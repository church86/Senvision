X Bank of Ireland being left behind on new payment methods Cantillon: Bank risks missing boat on technologies such as Android and Apple Pay about an hour ago Ulster Bank and KBC have adopted Apple’s contactless payment technology Apple Pay in Ireland. Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters         When Android Pay launched in December last year, it was to a great fanfare. The contactless payment method allows customers to use a compatible phone to pay for goods and services in shops, with an extra layer of security for purchases over the €30 threshold that was imposed on contactless cards. Card numbers aren’t shared with retailers, making it more secure for users. AIB and KBC were first out of the gate with the new payment method, although Google promised that more banks would follow. Just a few weeks ago, Apple launched its contactless payment technology Apple Pay in Ireland. Same principle as Android Pay, same level of convenience, and secured with a fingerprint or code. This time, it was Ulster Bank and KBC who adopted it immediately. KBC has embraced the move fully, saying it is in line with its digital strategy for its customers. Again, others are likely to follow. Compatible with any contactless terminal, the days of having to carry plastic cards appeared numbered. So where, in all of this, is Bank of Ireland? One of the biggest banks in the State appears to have missed the boat when it comes to the new technology. Another product It’s a topical issue as it appears we are on the brink of seeing yet another contactless technology introduced here, with Samsung Pay predicted to launch in mid- to late-summer. Could the bank be biding its time? You could argue that there aren’t enough people interested in both Apple and Android Pay in Ireland to justify the bank making that leap, but offering the option to customers should at least be contemplated. And looking at other markets where the contactless technology is already in use doesn’t really bear the “market size” theory out. According to Apple’s most recent results, for example, the number of Apple Pay users has tripled in the last year, and chief executive Tim Cook told analysts in January that the service racked up billions in transactions during the December quarter. As the service launches in more countries and with more retailers, that is only going to increase. In London, for example, you can use Apple and Android Pay on public transport, something that Samsung’s vice-president of mobile for UK and Ireland Conor Pierce says he would like to see introduced in Ireland. Bank of Ireland risks being left behind by customers if it fails to capitalise on yet another new technology entering the market.       Topics: Cantillon Conor Pierce Tim Cook AIB Apple Bank of Ireland Google KBC Group Samsung Read More Late 2016 UK growth surge starting to run out of steam State faces unwelcome attention as Trump tackles trade deficit Brexit talks will continue amid nonsensical scaremongering Changes to State broadband scheme may bring legal challenge Nothing distorts earnings data like messy, moveable Easter The €23m question hanging over Independent News & Media Lloyds to compensate fraud victims as inquiry reopens Former IFG Group CEO McNamara gets over €300,000 on departure Central Bank governor Philip Lane gets €7,000 salary hike Scapegoating of Central Bank for house prices ignores the problem's complexity AboutCantillon A man with a profound understanding of how money is made and lost, Kerry-born economist Richard Cantillon (1680s-1734) is a fitting namesake for this long-running column.

At an invite-only meeting with a handful of Apple bloggers and reporters, two of Apple's top executives -- marketing head Philip Schiller and Craig Federighi, who leads software engineering -- acknowledged that the firm's strategy for the Mac Pro, the company's top-of-the-line desktop, had been a mistake.

Insider Access Stallion Sphere Advertise Video Forum Contact Menu Home USA Canada Australia New Zealand UK / IRE Europe Round 4 of the Blue Chip Matchmaker 03:08 PM 08 Apr 2017 NZST Comment (...) Tweet Share Email Print Back to Home page Lispatty Chris Brokate Photo Medusa Chris Brokate Photo YONKERS, NY, Friday, April 7, 2017-- Yonkers Raceway's Blue Chip Matchmaker offered up Round 4 Friday night (April 7h), with a pair of harness racing $40,000 divisions. This penultimate prelim event offered a different look, notably one less grouping as some of the marquee ma'ams (co-leader Bedroomconfessions and third-place lass Regil Elektra) taking the week off. The opening event saw the millionairess formerly known as Krispy Apple (Brett Miller) cave off some very tepid fractions (:27.1, :57.1, 1:25.2).. It was only she and Wrangler Magic (Dan Dube) leaving from their respective outer venues, but neither was involved in the outcome. Lispatty (Jason Bartlett, $13.80) earned the decision over a squeezing-through, 36-1 Diva's Image (Joe Bongiorno) in 1:55. The winner, from post position No. 3, improved inside down the backside as 17-10 fave Betabcool N (Mark MacDonald) and second choice Tessa Seelster (George Brennan) both left the cones and were essentially devoid of pace. It was Krispy Apple owning a length-and-three-quarter lead the lane, but she was done. Lispatty angled out, then prevailed by three-quarters of a length. Wrangler Magic lasted for third, Hidden Land (Tim Tetrick) and Betabcool N (Mark MacDonald) settling for the remainder while Krispy Apple retreated to seventh. For fourth choice Lispatty, a 4-year-old daughter of McArdle trainer by Gilberto Garcia-Herrera for owner Gilbert Garcia-Owen, it was her first win in seven seasonal starts. The exacta paid $182.50, with the triple returning $1,594. Friday's second Matchmaker soiree had Medusa (Matt Kakaley, $11.20) do what Krispy Apple could not...finish what she started (:28.1, :57.3, 1:25.1, 1:53.3). From post No. 4, Medusa seated longshot Empress Deo, then never had an anxious moment. The pocket-sitter gave way by the three-quarters, with Mackenzie A (Jordan Stratton) taking up the chase. That chase left her a length-a-quarter in arrears at the wire, the same distance in front of a non-threatening 3-4 choice Mach it a Par (Bartlett) Empress Deo and Shesjustadelight N (Ron Cushing) settled for the minors. For third choice Medusa, a 6-year-old daughter of Bettor's Delight co-owned by Randy Bendis and Tom Pollack and trained by Andy Federico Jr., it was her fifth win in 13 seasonal starts. The exacta paid $29.40, the triple returned $60 and the superfecta paid $390. Round 4 of the George Morton Levy Memorial Pacing Series goes Saturday night (Apr. 8), with three, $50,000 divisions.   YONKERS’ SATURDAY PICK 5 FEATURES $12,500 DOUBLE CARRYOVER A friendly reminder from Yonkers Raceway that Saturday  evening’s (April 8th) Pick 5 wager starts with a certifiably-enticing double carryover of $12,570.13.   The Pick 5 is a 50-cent base wager comprising races 7 through 11 (for programs with at least 11 races…if not, then it goes as races 6 through 10). It has no consolation payoff, meaning if no one selects all five winners (as was the case Thursday and Friday nights), the entire pool (minus takeout) moves to the next racing program.

Twitter Facebook The iCloud hackers' bitcoin ransom looks like a fake The Turkish Crime Family said they'd been paid not to wipe Apple devices, but an expert says the evidence isn't real Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 08 April, 2017 11:33 - - - - print email Comments A group of hackers who claimed to hold millions of iCloud accounts for ransom said on Friday they'd been paid. But one bitcoin expert says that's bogus.  The Turkish Crime Family grabbed headlines last month by claiming they had the stolen login credentials for more than 700 million icloud.com, me.com and mac.com accounts. They demanded increasing ransoms from Apple while threatening to wipe the data from devices connected to the affected accounts if it did not. On Friday, the hackers tweeted that they had been paid US$480,000 in bitcoin. As proof, the group posted a link showing a transaction on Blockchain.info, a popular bitcoin wallet.   “We were told by our negotiator that we have come to a final agreement with Apple,” the hacking group tweeted prior to receiving the payment.   However, the hackers actually tweeted out a transaction to an "internal treasury operation at a bitcoin exchange," according to Jonathan Levin, co-founder at Chainalysis, a provider of anti-money laundering software for bitcoin. "We have positively identified that the inputs and outputs of that transaction are controlled by a single bitcoin exchange," Levin said in an email. The transaction was part of an internal money deposit process at a Korean bitcoin exchange, he said. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. The tech giant has said that it never suffered any such breach. The stolen login credentials that the hackers obtained appeared to come from breaches at other third-party services, Apple said. Security researchers suspect that's true, and they believe the Turkish Crime Family has exaggerated its hacking claims.   The hacking group also didn't respond to a request for comment. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Highs Durable chassis Plenty of ports Attractive, yet anti-glare display Excellent processor and hard drive performance Class-leading battery life Lows Mediocre look and feel Very small touchpad More expensive than similar competitors DT Editors' Rating 7.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) review By Matt Smith Posted on 04.07.17 Research Center: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) The PC’s shift from cutting-edge luxury to everyday device has brought with it a mundanity that becomes more entrenched with each year. Many of the best laptops no longer see significant revisions each year, as is still common with smartphones. In fact, some laptops go many years before they’re completely replaced. Apple’s MacBook Pro started that trend, but Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon was among the first Windows alternatives to follow it. First released in 2012, the Carbon has received yearly updates, but today’s model doesn’t look all that different from the first. The Carbon remains a thin and light laptop that stands out from competitors because of its 14-inch screen, and continues to try and out-maneuver alternatives by combing durability with one of the thinnest, lightest designs around. More: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon: Our first take You might expect a high-end Lenovo ThinkPad to be expensive…and you’d be right. Pricing starts at an intimidating $1,329, and that’s for a model with a Core i5 processor and 128GB SATA hard drive. Our more impressively configured model, with Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB PCI Express drive, rang up at $2,123. That’s a lot of scratch. Is it justified? An old design that stands the test of time Browse Google for images of the previous ThinkPad X1 Carbon, then look at the latest model. Notice the difference? No? We have a hard time spotting it as well. There are minor touches, like smaller display bezels and a thinner overall profile, but the two models are otherwise identical. The 2017 model even retains the same power button location and hinge design, despite tweaks to the chassis. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Yet the Carbon still looks modern. Is it exciting? No – but ThinkPads aren’t purchased for their looks. What’s important is the overall footprint and quality, and in these areas the Carbon continues to excel. Though it has a 14-inch display, it’s now similar in size to many 13-inch laptops. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch bar and HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 both shave less than a half-inch in width and depth. Dell’s XPS 13 is the only rival that shrinks itself to a size that’s meaningfully different from the Carbon. At .63 inches thick, the Carbon is also far from the thinnest laptop, but within range of its competitors. As its name suggest, the Carbon’s chassis makes some use of carbon fiber, paired with the magnesium alloy that’s common in many ThinkPad products. These materials are extremely durable, and provide a soft-touch texture that feels inviting and adds extra grip. Unfortunately, the material is more flexible than metal, so it doesn’t provide the illusion of rigidity you’ll find in an all-aluminum laptop like the MacBook Pro 13 or HP Spectre x360. This is not a durability problem, but it will turn off those who think a laptop this expensive must feel luxurious. That’s likely why Dell’s XPS 13, which also has a carbon fiber chassis, uses a metal outer shell. Plenty of ports Lenovo has modernized its port selection with two Thunderbolt 3 / USB Type-C ports, which can be used to charge the laptop. That’s a welcome change, as Lenovo has stuck with its own proprietary charging solution in recently reviewed systems. It obliterates the competition in Geekbench 4 multi-core. There are also two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, one HDMI port, one micro-Ethernet port with adapter, a combined microphone/headphone jack, and a MicroSD card reader with Micro-SIM card slot. Overall, this arrangement makes the Carbon exceptionally easy to use for a thin-and-light laptop. Most of its competitors either rely entirely on new connection types, as does the MacBook Pro 13, or make a compromise that results in relatively few ports overall, as is true of the Dell XPS 13. Lenovo has an edge here. Good keyboard, tiny touchpad Keyboard quality is always a tricky subject with ThinkPads – not because they fail here, but because they’re good, and fans expect the best. The Carbon is always in a tough spot because its thin profile can lead to a cramped typing experience, but we noticed no issue with the 2017 model. Key travel is substantial, which leads to a pleasant flow when typing at a high rate. We did think the key action felt a touch vague as it bottomed out, but it wasn’t enough to bother us. Compared to alternatives, like the Dell XPS 13 or HP Spectre x360 and its EliteBook variant, the Carbon feels as if it has more key travel. It’s also more spacious in layout, because the 14-inch screen leads to larger overall dimensions. The new MacBook Pro 13 also feels spacious, but its poor key travel puts it far behind the Carbon in typing pleasure. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Keyboard backlighting is standard, though it offers just two brightness options. This is an area where Apple is still the leader, as it offers a wide range. There’s significant light leak from behind the Carbon’s key caps – more, in fact, than in any competitor in recent memory – and that can be distracting in dark environments. The Carbon’s touchpad is smaller than its competitors. As always, the Trackpointer can be blamed. This tiny red nub in the middle of the keyboard allows use of the mouse without moving away from a normal typing position, but it also must be paired with physical, discrete left/right mouse buttons above the touchpad, which cuts into its usable space. What you think of this arrangement depends on what you think of the Trackpointer. We enjoy it, and find its implementation on the Carbon satisfactory. Users who prefer the touchpad will find it cramped. The Carbon supports Windows Precision Touchpad standards, at least, so it can handle all the operating system’s multi-touch gestures. More: Dell XPS 13 (Kaby Lake) review You’ll have to get used to it, because a touchscreen is not supported even as an optional upgrade. Anyone looking for a touchscreen should instead consider the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. One of the best anti-glare displays around Give its 14-inch size, you might expect Lenovo to cram a 4K or at least QHD panel into the latest Carbon. Instead, the company has opted to stick with a 1080p, non-touch screen with anti-glare coating. It’s a choice that focuses on practicality. Users who care about display quality most of all may scoff at the resolution, and for good reason. All the Carbon’s potential competitors, from the Dell XPS 13 to the MacBook Pro 13 to even Lenovo’s own high-end IdeaPads, offer a 3,200 x 1,800 or 4K panel option. These panels can hurt battery life, however, and as we’ll discuss later, Lenovo’s decision to stick with 1080p does reap rewards in that area. Aside from its modest resolution, how does the screen stack up? Extremely well, as it turns out. We recorded a contrast ratio of 990:1 at maximum brightness, and 1210:1 at 50 percent of maximum. These figures are very solid. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar hit a contrast ratio of 1200:1 at maximum brightness, and the Surface Studio with Performance Base hit 1410:1. But most other laptops, including the Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360, fall well behind the Carbon. The Carbon packs reasonable color quality. Its gamut is not that impressive, as it renders 95 percent of the sRGB gamut and 72 percent of AdobeRGB. These figures are exactly average, and behind the best laptops, which can render over 90 percent of AdobeRGB. However, the Carbon boasts an average color error value of 1.5, which is great. Lower values are better in this test, and anything below one represents an error that’s hard for the human eye to notice. Apple’s MacBook Pro line can produce a value below one, but most laptops come in above two. The Dell XPS 13 with 1080p display, for example, produced an error value of 2.65. Numbers are just part of the equation, though. How they come together is important, and the Carbon’s figures ultimately total up to a great display. The 14-inch screen is a reasonable fit for 1080p resolution, so images looks sharp enough in most situations. Colors are vibrant, and overall contrast is strong enough to provide a sense of depth in movies and games. The anti-glare coat, while not the most aggressive, minimizes reflections and keeps the bright screen usable even outdoors. Most colors are highly accurate, except for blue hues, which are more prominent than they should be. This is a common flaw of modern backlit LCD displays, as the backlight technology tends to make the overall image look cooler and more sterile than it should. More: HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 (2016) review There are better displays. The MacBook Pro 13 and Surface Book are in another league. However, they both suffer a hit in usability due to the extreme glare their highly reflective screens can cause. The Carbon’s screen is solid overall, and its high points are what the target audience will desire. Speakers that focus on Skype Lenovo has placed a pair of stereo speakers in the bottom front of the Carbon. This is the typical placement for laptops in the Carbon’s category. It allows for compact size and decent volume when the laptop is used on a flat surface. However, a more malleable surface – like a lap, for example – can block and muffle the speakers. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) Compared To Acer Aspire VX 5-591G 5652 Dell Latitude E5470 Razer Blade (2017) Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (2017) Lenovo Yoga 910 Asus Zenbook 3 UX390UA Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Dell Precision 15 3510 Lenovo Ideapad 710S HP Spectre Acer Aspire S 13 S5-371-52JR Dell Latitude 12 LG Gram 15 Z960 Samsung Notebook 9 Pro… Lenovo IdeaPad V460 The quality of the speakers is clearly tuned with preference for clarity over depth and volume. Voices come across sharp and easy to understand, which is great for video calls with co-workers. The deep bass of an explosive action movie, however, falls flat. Intel’s fastest laptop dual-core is, in fact, the fastest dual-core While the base model of ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a Core i5-7200U, our tricked-out review unit arrived packing the Core i7-7600U. This is a dual-core processor with a 2.8GHz base clock, and it represents the high end of Intel’s mobile dual-core chip line. The Core i7-7600U provides an excellent showing in GeekBench, a shorter synthetic benchmark. There, the Carbon leaps to a lead in both single-core and multi-core testing. In fact, it obliterates its competition in Geekbench 4 multi-core, where it scores over 1,000 points better than its next-closest peer, the Dell XPS 13 with Core i7-7500U. Handbrake has more to say in the Carbon’s favor. There, the laptop crammed through an encode of our 4K h.265 test clip in under 17 minutes. That’s the second-best result we’ve seen in a laptop, coming in behind only the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base. The Carbon’s result is one to three minutes faster than most its peers, beating the Dell XPS 13 and Apple MacBook Pro 13 with ease. A screaming fast new Samsung hard drive Our review unit arrived with a Samsung PM961 solid state drive connected over PCI Express, and boasting 512GB of storage. This is a major upgrade over the base model of Carbon, which unfortunately has a mere 128GB SATA solid state drive. That’s a major problem for a $1,329 laptop. The benefit of upgrading to the larger, faster drive are clear. With it equipped, our test unit screamed to a write speed of almost 1.9 gigabytes per second, and a read speed of just over 1.5 GB/s. These numbers easily defeat the Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360, two laptops that are no slouch in the hard drive arena. Not a gaming machine, but better than most Intel’s HD 620 integrated graphics hardware came alongside our review unit’s Core i7-7600U processor. It would be reasonable to expect performance similar to the Core i5-7200U and Core i7-7500U, both of which also have HD 620. Yet that’s not what happened in our tests. 3DMark Fire Strike finds the Carbon has a reasonable advantage over Dell and HP competitors with what’s supposedly the same graphics solution. The Lenovo wins by a margin of about 15 to 20 percent. Why? Because it’s not the same solution. While Intel HD 620 shows up in a variety of chips, it doesn’t operate at the same speed in every situation. The Carbon’s high-end Core i7-7600U has a faster version of HD 620, with a maximum core clock of 1.15GHz. In addition to running 3DMark, we loaded Sid Meier’s Civilization VI at 1080p and medium detail to see how the laptop handles a typical modern game. At those settings the game was a slideshow, producing an average of 13 frames per second. Reducing quality to the minimum preset increased performance to an average of 28 FPS, which was tolerable, though the game lost most its beauty as a result. A class leader in portability Every ThinkPad X1 Carbon comes with a 57 watt-hour internal battery which cannot be replaced by the user. This is not exceptionally large by modern standards, but it does rank towards the top. Dell’s XPS 13 has a 60 watt-hour battery, while the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has a 49.2 watt-hour battery. This large battery, combined with the power-saving 1080p display, make for exceptional battery life in all test loads. We recorded eight hours and 38 minutes of life in our Peacekeeper web browser benchmark test. A simple 1080p video loop extended that to an outstanding 14 hours and 30 minutes. Its materials are durable, providing a soft-touch texture that feels inviting. These numbers are, in both cases, among the strongest we’ve recorded. The Dell XPS 13 with Core i5 processor and 1080p display lasted 12 hours and 43 minutes in the video loop test, while the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar lasted 10 hours and 24 minutes. It’s clear that Lenovo has made efficiency a priority for the Carbon, and that pays off in real-world testing. Of course, the laptop is also quite easy to carry. While the 14-inch screen means it’s a bit larger than most competitors, its weight of 2.49 pounds is extremely competitive in its category. The Dell XPS 13, MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar, and HP Spectre x360 all weigh a few tenths of a pound more. Warranty information Most laptops come with a one year warranty against manufacturer defects. While the base Carbon doesn’t push the limit there, the high-end review unit we tested has a three-year warranty included in the price. That’s a wonderful extra that helps justify the high price. Our Take The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon is an extremely quick laptop that successfully puts work before play, and its battery life is the envy of all its peers. It’s a shame the price is so high, as it slightly sours an otherwise sweet package. Is there a better alternative? The ThinkPad X1 Carbon has many competitors. Dell’s XPS 13 looks nice, and is significantly smaller, but it’s quick. Apple’s MacBook Pro 13 has a much better display and crisp speakers, but falls behind in value and battery life. The HP Spectre x360 and its workmanlike peer, the HP EliteBook x360, are fast and have great screen options, but they’re not up to the Carbon’s caliber in keyboard quality. The DT Accessory Pack Anker PowerCore+ 20100 mAh portable charger $66 Lifewit leather vintage canvas laptop bag $44 Logitech MX Anywhere 2 wireless mobile mouse $56 We still think the Dell XPS 13 is the best overall pick among portable laptops, but the Carbon does have many strengths, and is the better choice for people who spend as much time working on the road as they do at home. How long will it last? With a seventh-generation Core i7 processor, a cutting-edge hard drive, excellent battery life, and a durable chassis, there’s no reason to think the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon won’t last for the long haul. Also, the more expensive models come with a standard three-year warranty, which provides peace of mind. Should you buy it? Yes, if you need a function-first laptop that can accomplish tasks on the go. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon packs stellar battery life and performance, yet falls behind a bit in display quality and design. It’s also extremely expensive. This is a laptop for those who view their computer as a tool, not a toy, and demand hardware that can keep up with hours of serious work, day after day.

View All Editorials → Jay Z Ditches Apple Music and Spotify for Exclusive Streaming on Tidal Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Apr 7th, 2017 6:23 PM EDT | News It looks like Tidal co-owner Jay Z doesn’t think Apple Music and Spotify are cool any more because he pulled his albums from the streaming music services. It looks like just his original content is gone while collaborations with other artists are still available. Apple hasn’t said anything, but Spotify did confirm via Twitter that Jay Z requested his catalog be removed. @PinoyBroski Hi there! We can confirm that some of Jay Z’s catalogue has been removed at the request of the artist /LP — SpotifyCares (@SpotifyCares) April 7, 2017 Spotify didn’t say if Jay Z’s decision was based on friction between Tidal and other streaming music services. Assuming Kanye West is a reliable source, it’s likely that’s exactly why his music isn’t available for streaming on the two services. Kanye West bashed Apple Music last year in what amounted to a very public meltdown where he said his music wouldn’t ever be available on the service. Shortly after that his “Life of Pablo” song showed up there, and not long after the whole “Saint Pablo” album was available, pretty much killing the claim that his music would stream exclusively on Tidal. Sorry Apple Music and Spotify, no streaming Jay Z for you Tidal’s claim to fame is higher quality streaming audio and that it is artist-owned. The US$19.99 subscription level does offer higher bit rate tracks, although its $9.99 a month service offers the same file quality as competitors. For practical purposes, that means the only real difference between Tidal and Apple Music and Spotify are exclusive streaming deals. If Jay Z did pull his albums to make Tidal more enticing to Apple Music and Spotify customers he should get ready to be disappointed. He’s more likely to push people into pirating his songs than convince them to switch streaming music services.

Imagination Technologies added it believes a brand new design for a graphics processor that did not infringe on Imagination Technologies’ intellectual property would be very challenging for Apple, setting the stage for a possible fight over intellectual property in the months ahead. Imagination Technologies has been struggling to diversify, but has remained dependent on its largest customer, Apple, and has continued to derive most of its revenue from the PowerVR graphics processor technology that Apple says it will no longer use. Last year, Imagination Technologies laid off roughly 5% of its workforce after rumors that Apple was going to buy the company failed to pan out. Apple’s move to bring its graphics chip technology in-house is part of a larger trend that is impacting several of the largest companies in the mobile ecosystem. Google and Amazon.com have both talked about designing their own chips, and Apple has been designing its own central processing units for several years, although it still uses cores designed by ARM, another British company that licenses intellectual property related to chip design. ARM recently became part of Japan’s SoftBank, the carrier that owns a controlling interest in Sprint. The decision to move forward without Imagination Technologies’ intellectual property is a more radical change than Apple’s decision to design its own CPUs using ARM cores. If the graphics chips that Apple ultimately brings to market do not rely on a completely new architecture, look for another bruising patent battle that will play out in the courts. Apple is already on track to meet another one of its key suppliers in court. Earlier this year, the iPhone maker brought a $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm, claiming the leading maker of LTE connectivity chipsets had failed to remit payments promised to Apple. Apple’s pressure on its chip suppliers can be seen as part of an ongoing effort to control costs at a time when growth at the highest end of the smartphone market is leveling off. The world’s most valuable company is under pressure from investors to maintain the eye-popping returns shareholders have enjoyed in the past. Follow me on Twitter.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 75 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares153 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Loved Ahemmm... GPM now offers streaming all access in India... And that's for nearly 3/4th apple's price... I standby what I said: APPLE MUSIC IS NO BETTER Jay Hah! How could anyone have known, that they were going to start offer it for 90 bucks (inr) just a few hours later?! XD Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. Brian Demodulated That only lets you play your local music, and it's a pretty bad local music player. I want to be able to play my music at work on in the car. Daniel Tiberius I've heard if you run the desktop app at home you can access those files through the mobile app. Brian Demodulated I haven't used Spotify for 2 years so perhaps they've added this. Before I subscribed to Google Play Music I used to run a free open source music streaming server called Subsonic. Loved it! WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ?

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career). hooch Wow is that ugly Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 141k 105k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] 4-pack Type C to MicroUSB adapters $4.95 at Amazon w/Slickdeals code ($3 off MSRP) 2017/04/07 1:02pm PDTApr 7, 2017 6 [Deal Alert] JBL Flip 3 on sale at $64 ($36 off MSRP) as an Amazon Gold Box daily deal 2017/04/07 12:12pm PDTApr 7, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Snag an Arlo Pro 3-pack from Amazon for $500 ($80 off) 2017/04/06 7:07pm PDTApr 6, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 22 [Deal Alert] The Moto G4 Plus is $189.99 ($60 off) on Amazon 2017/04/04 2:26pm PDTApr 4, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Before the launch of Night Shift, f.lux was the go-to tool for doing this. Let's see how they compare. Night Shift and f.lux (free) sound identical at a glance. They both attempt to reduce your exposure to blue light at night by applying a warmer colour filter to your screen after the Sun goes down. The similarities between the two end there though, and in typical Apple fashion, which one you use depends primarily on how much you like to tinker with settings. F.lux Offers Way More Options to Tweak How It Works Night Shift's (left) minimal settings are part of the appeal, but f.lux (right) offers way more ways to customise it. The biggest and most important difference between f.lux and Night Shift comes in the form of your options for customisation. With Night Shift, you can set when Night Shift activates, and then choose a colour temperature on a scale of Less Warm to More Warm. F.lux offers a somewhat insane variety of options. You can choose the temperature of your screen during the day, at sunset/sunrise, and at bedtime. You can choose from various colour presets or create your own. There's even a Night Owl setting for those who actually prefer to work late into the evening. Beyond that, f.lux also allows you to set how long the transitions between colours last, what time you get up on the weekend, and you can set reminders when it's getting close to your bed time. F.lux even includes several specific types of colour effects, like a dark room mode that inverts colours, a movie mode that preserves colours while reducing certain lights, and a mode that automatically triggers the macOS dark theme at sunset. Night Shift's Effect Is Less Noticeable Since it's shipping with a commercial product, Night Shift is also a little less extreme than f.lux. This isn't necessarily a bad thing — Night Shift is targeting a broad set of people, whereas f.lux is filling a niche. F.lux breaks down the differences in a forum post, the main difference being in how f.lux also reduces blue-green light: F.lux claims that Night Shift just doesn't reduce enough light to help with sleep. We know that the supposed effect here is about much more than just reducing the blues, but it's hard to say whether one or the other is actually better for sleep. Regardless, Night Shift is much less intrusive because all it does is add a warmer filter to your display, and you can use it without disrupting your general computer usage that much, unless you're working on colour correction in photos or videos. Even with all of the different settings tweaks you can do, f.lux has a much more noticeable impact because it does more than just apply a warmer filter; it changes the overall amount of light alongside the colour. F.lux Works On Older Macs (and Everything Else) One little surprise that came with the launch of Night Shift on the Mac is its limited compatibility. For some reason, Night Shift is limited to the following Macs: MacBook (Early 2015 or newer) MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or newer) MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or newer) Mac mini (Late 2012 or newer) iMac (Late 2012 or newer) Mac Pro (Late 2013 or newer) Good news though, f.lux works on pretty much every Mac in existence (as well as Windows and Linux). So, if Night Shift isn't an option, you can get the same effect out of f.lux's default settings, so don't feel like you're missing out on anything special. There's also the fact that f.lux is continually a work in progress, with small iterations being released pretty often and new landmark features added in at a steady pace. The developers behind f.lux are constantly talking about the research behind their work and making adjustments to the software as they go. I doubt Apple will show this same sense of dedication to a small little feature they tossed into their operating systems. Regardless, Night Shift is still useful for a lot of people and the simplicity of its set it and forget it attitude means it will be in use by a lot more people. If you want more options though, grab yourself a copy of f.lux. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Amanda Lapidus of Toronto knows that first hand after she woke up on e day in March to find her charging cable smoking hot and melting down beside her bed. Sean O’Shea reports. What is this?

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Registered dietician Amanda Lapidus was in bed one morning in late March with her iPad nearby. “It was on the table beside my bed,” she said, adding it was plugged into a charger. But when the Toronto woman touched the cord attached to the device, she knew right away there was a problem. “I picked it up and it was extremely hot,” Lapidus told Global News. Story continues below READ MORE: A hidden fire danger in your home The end of the cable was melting, so she disconnected it, ran to the bathroom and found a towel to snuff out a possible fire. “I thought it was going to turn into a bigger fire,” she said. “I have two kids in the house and I was worried.” Fortunately, no one was injured and there was no damage. Since then, however, she said her iPad no longer charges as well as it did. Lapidus was using a non-Apple charging device manufactured by Belkin, a large consumer electronics company. The device was Apple MFI certified, a designation that means “Made for iPhone/iPad/iPod.” She said she thought the cable would be safe to use. Millions of consumers use electric chargers made by different manufacturers to recharge electronic devices such as phones, tablets and computers. READ MORE: Could your cheap knock-off phone charger kill you? But Apple warns customers to be careful. On the support page of its website, the company issues this caution: “Beware of counterfeit parts. Some counterfeit and third-party power adapters and batteries may not be designed properly and could result in safety issues.” “To ensure you receive a genuine Apple battery during a battery replacement, we recommend visiting an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. If you need a replacement adapter to charge your Apple device, we recommend getting an Apple power adapter,” Apple says on its website. Consumers worldwide often charge their phones in ways that may add to the risk. For example, many technology experts recommend against over-charging devices. Not only can that practice degrade the life of the battery, but it could cause overheating and fire. Charging devices overnight and at your bedside can be potentially dangerous, too. Apple or non-apple, mobile devices & charging cables pose a fire risk. Please be mindful when charging electronics & unplug when not in use. https://t.co/nlSZzKwPQ6 — Richmond Hill Fire (@RHFES) April 7, 2017 “Apple or non-Apple, mobile devices and charging cables pose a fire risk. Please be mindful when charging electronics and unplug when not in use,” Richmond Hill’s fire department tweeted Friday. Lapidus said Belkin has not yet addressed her concerns about overheating and the damage to her iPad, but she’s grateful everyone in her family is safe. She said the experience has changed how she uses her electronic devices. “Before I probably would have left things charging all the time. Now I don’t.” — With files from Alana MacLeod © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

The iPhone’s Touch ID is handy on the Mac, too. The bad: You’re paying a hefty premium for the Touch Bar, which supports only a handful of Apple apps for now. The USB-C-only ports mean carrying a bag full of dongles. The lack of high-end graphics or huge RAM options in the 13-inch model may frustrate photo and video professionals. The cost: $1,700 to $1,800 LATEST TRENDING VIDEOS: Story continues below The bottom line: Apple’s smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro. Razer Blade Stealth Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The Razer Blade Stealth includes a Core i7 processor and high-resolution touch-screen even in its lowest-end configuration. It has more ports than other 12-inch laptops and a fun Chroma back-lit keyboard. The bad: It’s bigger and heavier than 12-inch laptops from Apple, Asus and others. The thick bezel around the screen feels dated, and configuration options are limited. The cost: $1,450 The bottom line: The Razer Blade Stealth offers better specs for less money than the competition, and includes features others lack, such as a high-resolution touch-screen and full-size USB ports. The design is slick, the price is right, but it’s not as slim and portable as other 12-inch laptops. Lenovo Miix 510 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: The good-looking hinged kickstand has a lot of positioning flexibility. Has a USB-C port for video output and peripherals with adapters. Unlike Microsoft, Lenovo includes a generally excellent back-lit keyboard cover. Lenovo’s Active Pen and palm rejection work very well. The bad: The fans can get a little too loud for quiet environments. No memory card slot for expansion. The Active Pen is a $40 extra and its included holder blocks the power jack. The tiny right-hand shift key is horrible. The cost: $592 to $611 The bottom line: The Lenovo Miix 510 is an excellent — and more affordable — alternative to Microsoft’s 2-in-1 tablet PC. And it might be the better choice for you. Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Cnet rating: 4 stars out of 5 The good: This new version of the XPS 13 adds a hybrid hinge and thinner body. The edge-to-edge, nearly bezel-free display makes maximum use of space, and the starting price is extremely reasonable. The bad: Standard USB ports get swapped for USB-C ones, the Intel Y-series processor isn’t as fast as those found in more traditional laptops and the power button can be tricky to hit.

The move by the rapper comes amid reported rising tensions between both TIDAL executives and Apple, as the fledgling service continues to fight for streaming exclusives from both artists and labels. Although neither Carter nor Apple have confirmed the reasoning behind the catalog’s recent pulling, MacRumors notes that Spotify has in fact broken its silence and is now beginning to confirm the catalog’s pulling to users via social media, (albeit only going as far as saying that ‘some’ of the artist’s catalogue is currently unavailable). It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time this has happened, as the site explains: Jay Z has removed select albums from Apple Music in the past, but this is the first time he has pulled his entire catalog of albums from the service, including Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, and The Black Album. Only some his collaborations with Kanye West, Linkin Park, R. Kelly, and Rihanna remain. And perhaps strangely, the removal of Carter’s back catalog from Apple Music doesn’t appear to be affecting the iTunes availability of his said songs (or albums), suggesting that whatever the disagreement is between the artist and the firm – it may only relate to streaming: “[…] Jay Z’s albums are still available for purchase on iTunes, while his wife Beyoncé still offers many of her songs and albums on Apple Music, including the newly added single “Die With You,” which was just released as a digital download today,” Rossignol says. It is not yet clear if or when the catalog will return to the service. / Image Credit: Source / MacRumors UPDATE It appears Carter’s catalog has in fact returned to Apple’s streaming service, in the last several hours.

The constant onslaught of news makes it nigh impossible for mere mortals with real lives to keep track of everything. That’s why we’ve compiled a quick and dirty list of this week’s top 10 tech stories, from everything you need to know about AT&T’s unlimited plans to how you can watch the NFL on Amazon — it’s all here. ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Amazon scored a deal with the NFL to stream 10 Thursday Night Football games during the upcoming season. The news, confirmed to Digital Trends via email, is a serious blow to Twitter, which secured the rights for the same coverage last season. This time, however, Amazon outbid not only Twitter, but also YouTube and Facebook. The retail giant paid a reported $50 million to take the prize — that’s $40 million more than Twitter’s payout last year. Read the full story here. Spotify vs. Apple Music: Which service is the streaming king? When it comes to subscribers, the undisputed king of on-demand streaming music is Spotify. The Swedish-born service helped pioneer the current market and has tens of millions more paid users than the competition, not to mention millions more free users. But Apple Music, known for its high-level exclusive releases and full integration into Apple’s popular iOS system, is the hottest service on Spotify’s heels. Apple’s streaming service has shown impressive growth in its audience since its inception, so which is better? Read the full story here. Has Intel turned into a virtual reality film studio? We found out Few companies have been as integral to bringing the future to computing for as long as Intel. Now the technology conglomerate is putting its chips where the films are, acting as a sort of “tech whisperer” to help filmmakers create in virtual reality. Does this mean Intel, and other companies that power VR films, are becoming de facto movie studios? assisting moviemakers in acheiving their look is nothing new to Intel. The company provided processing technology to Dreamworks Animation in 2008, for instance. If you thought 2009’s Monsters vs. Aliens looked cool, you can thank Intel. Read the full story here. Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Do you have an inordinate amount of shipping containers? Are you trying figure out what to do with all them? In the unlikely event that the answer to this question is “Yes,” you’ll be pleased to learn that they’re far more practical than you may have imagined. And if you answered in the negative, then good news! You can grab yourself a decent size shipping container for just over $1,500. Read the full story here. NASA’s retiring EO-1 satellite changed how we see Earth with these stunning photos Last week, NASA retired one of its greats — the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. Initially commissioned for the agency’s New Millennium Program, EO-1 proved to be the satellite that could. Its one-year mission nearly extended to 17 years. EO-1 was never meant to be such a star. In fact, its original purpose was to test and refine technologies for future Earth imaging. It was launched on November 21, 2000 with 13 new technologies, three of which had never been tested. Many of the most stunning images were capture by the Advanced Land Imager (ALI). Read the full story here. Next Page 1 of 2 Page 1 Page 2

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 7, 2017 at 5:42PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) will reportedly start producing the A11 chip for the next iPhone family in April, according to a leak from Chinese news outlet Economic Daily News (via MacRumors). The report also indicates that TSMC is targeting a production run of 50 million A11 chips before July, as Apple doesn't want to run into supply chain issues. More importantly, Apple could build around 120 million new iPhones this year as compared to 89 million units of the iPhone 7/7S in 2016 -- according to Mizuho. This is great news for the other companies in Cupertino's supply chain -- such as Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Cypress Semiconductor (NASDAQ:CY) -- as they won't have to wait until the second half of the year to bask in iPhone-driven glory. Image Source: Apple. Here's how each of them is going to take advantage of Apple's upcoming devices. The case for Skyworks Skyworks gets 40% of its revenue by supplying connectivity chips to Apple, so a stronger iPhone production cycle will give a nice boost to its revenue and earnings. Mizuho analysts Vijay Rakesh and Jason Getz recently upgraded the semiconductor specialist, citing a 35% jump in new iPhone builds this year. Now, Skyworks is expected to at least maintain its dollar content in Apple's new iPhones, according to Canaccord Genuity. Citigroup estimates that the chipmaker has $6 worth of content in the current device. Therefore, the next iPhone could bring at least $720 million in revenue this year at the 120 million unit-production forecast, driving $186 million in additional revenue, thanks to a 31 million unit spike in builds. But investors shouldn't rule out Skyworks gaining dollar content at Apple this time as the chipmaker has been taking business away from rival Qorvo. As it turns out, Qorvo's content grew 8% in the last iPhone cycle, to $4 per device, while Skyworks saw stronger gains of 10%. This indicates that Skyworks' revenue can jump even higher if it manages to win over content from Qorvo during the next production cycle. Broadcom can benefit from a new iPhone feature An IHS Technology consumer survey shows that more than 90% of customers want Apple to include wireless charging on the next iPhone. The iPhone maker seems to be listening to customer demands, as it has joined the Wireless Power Consortium, lending weight to the possibility of a wireless charging enabled device. This feature will give Broadcom a big shot in the arm, allowing it to build up on its $8 worth of content in last year's iPhones. In fact, the chipmaker's radio frequency content in the iPhone 7/7S had jumped 30% year over year, making it the biggest beneficiary of Apple's current line-up. As it turns out, Broadcom has been reportedly working with Apple for the past two years to develop a wireless charging feature, according to JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur. The analyst believes that the glass back cover of the next iPhone will allow it to be charged wirelessly, creating a $500 million-$600 million revenue opportunity for Broadcom in addition to its existing business from Apple. Cypress' big iPhone opportunity Apple's widely anticipated inclusion of the fast-charging technology in its upcoming device will be a boon for Cypress Semiconductor, thanks to its expertise in Type-C controllers. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the semiconductor specialist is going to supply the power delivery chips to the iPhone maker to enable Type-C power delivery for faster charging. This looks likely, as Apple will want to get up to speed with Samsung's Galaxy S8, which uses USB-C for charging. As it turns out, Cypress has got $295 million in design wins for its Type-C controllers, with management expecting a major ramp up in the second half of the year, which indicates a possible design win at Apple. In fact, investment research firm Needham believes that Cupertino's fast-charging ambitions might add anywhere between $87.5 million and $157.5 million to Cypress' top line, and boost earnings by $0.11 to $0.19 per share. This is impressive considering Cypress generated $0.15 per share in earnings last quarter, indicating that the next iPhone cycle will bring substantial gains for the company.

It contains a simple text report and shows on a map where recent drone strikes have taken place. It doesn’t contain any graphic images of the strikes or much else. But still, Apple apparently believes that’s too much for its users’ delicate sensitivities. Recently, Apple pulled the app from its store after accepting it mere hours earlier, according to Josh Begley, the data artist who created Metadata+. Apple didn’t give a reason for removing the app and it didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment. But the company has made its feelings clear about it in the past. Begley originally designed Metadata+, then called Drones+, back in 2012. Apple repeatedly rejected it, using a variety of excuses. It wasn’t “useful or entertaining enough.” It didn’t “appeal to a broad enough audience.” But numerous times, Apple used the same rationale – the app was “objectionable.” Apple finally accepted the app into its store in 2014, after Begley changed the name and stripped it of all content and gave it a more generic description. Once the app was in the store, he plugged back in all the historical information about drone strikes. Then, just as suddenly, Apple removed the app more than a year later, saying it contained “excessively crude or objectionable content.” Begley said he tried to re-submit the app 12 more times after that, finally and inexplicably getting it through only to have it removed again. Apple has tried to keep a tight grip on the apps it allows in its store. In part it’s done that to protect users from malicious software. As a result, the vast majority of smartphone malware targets Android-based devices. But the company has drawn controversy in the past for making seemingly capricious decisions about apps that aren’t malicious. It approved an app that allowed users to place a picture of themselves in a scene that made it look like they were having sex with a porn star. But it rejected a game that sought to highlight immigration issues for being “pornographic” because it included a cartoon representation of characters’ bodies going through a body scanner at a checkpoint. For his part, Begley said the bigger story is about how the country’s drone wars remain largely hidden from view. The app represented his attempt to put a light on them and to see how that might affect public discussion. That impetus seems particularly relevant given that President Trump is pressing to lift even the minimal restraints President Obama put on the drone program and strikes are already up markedly in the first months of his administration, with the number of civilian casualties rising. “If anything about the (Metadata+) app is ‘excessively objectionable or crude,’ perhaps it’s the airstrikes themselves,” Begley wrote.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 75 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares153 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Loved Ahemmm... GPM now offers streaming all access in India... And that's for nearly 3/4th apple's price... I standby what I said: APPLE MUSIC IS NO BETTER Jay Hah! How could anyone have known, that they were going to start offer it for 90 bucks (inr) just a few hours later?! XD Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. Brian Demodulated That only lets you play your local music, and it's a pretty bad local music player. I want to be able to play my music at work on in the car. Daniel Tiberius I've heard if you run the desktop app at home you can access those files through the mobile app. Brian Demodulated I haven't used Spotify for 2 years so perhaps they've added this. Before I subscribed to Google Play Music I used to run a free open source music streaming server called Subsonic. Loved it! WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ?

They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career). hooch Wow is that ugly Follow Android Police 1.5M 464k 141k 105k Latest Deals 11 [Deal Alert] 4-pack Type C to MicroUSB adapters $4.95 at Amazon w/Slickdeals code ($3 off MSRP) 2017/04/07 1:02pm PDTApr 7, 2017 6 [Deal Alert] JBL Flip 3 on sale at $64 ($36 off MSRP) as an Amazon Gold Box daily deal 2017/04/07 12:12pm PDTApr 7, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Snag an Arlo Pro 3-pack from Amazon for $500 ($80 off) 2017/04/06 7:07pm PDTApr 6, 2017 25 [Deal Alert] Grab these free and 10-cent apps, games, and icon packs 2017/04/05 6:44am PDTApr 5, 2017 22 [Deal Alert] The Moto G4 Plus is $189.99 ($60 off) on Amazon 2017/04/04 2:26pm PDTApr 4, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Not really. But they’re about way more than playing music. Let’s just get all the fun comparisons out of the way up top. Wearing AirPods is like wearing a toothbrush in your ear. No, it’s like your earbuds are melting down the side of your face. They look like tiny hair dryers! Tiny candy canes! Tiny bean sprouts! Tiny golf clubs! Apple AirPods: 5/10 Learn How We Rate Wired Never have Bluetooth headphones been so easy to pair. AirPods turn Siri into an omnipresent being. Battery life and fit are both better than you might expect. Tired U-G-L-Y, they ain't got no alibi. All the best features only work with Apple gear. They don't sound as good as they should for the price. Buy It Now   |  Apple How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection In truth, AirPods look like… Bluetooth headsets. In fact, they look like the Bluetooth headset Apple made for the original iPhone back in 2007. If you follow Apple’s design philosophy of making things thinner, simpler, rounder, and whiter over time, you could easily get from that to these in nine years. If you’d prefer something a little more contemporaneous, they also look exactly like Apple’s wired EarPod headphones, minus the cable. Whether that’s weird or bad is up to you. I say they look both weird and bad. Looks aren’t everything, though, and the fact is AirPods look the way they do because of their most important feature: they have no wires. There’s nothing to break or tangle, nothing to plug in, nothing to get caught on a stranger’s backpack on the train every freaking day. Just sweet aural freedom. Sure, you might lose them, but that’s a you problem, not a headphones problem. The AirPods sit fine in my ears, actually better than the EarPods. They even stayed in while I ran. The battery lasts a little longer than the five hours advertised. In the six days I’ve had them, I’ve only had to charge them one time. The oddest thing about the AirPods isn’t how they look; it’s that Apple’s evidently not all that concerned with how they sound. Your $159 doesn’t buy you any better audio than you’ll get from the EarPods that come free in the box with your iPhone. I mean, look: they sound fine. Statistically, most people are fine with the EarPods, and they’ll be fine with the AirPods too. But if you’ve ever purchased a pair of headphones that cost more than $50, I’d bet they sound better than the AirPods. If you’ve spent more than $100, they definitely do. So what’s that premium pricing going toward, aside from no strings attached? For one, the microphone is fantastic. The dual-mic setup, along with Apple’s clever noise-cancelling tech that uses subtle vibrations to know you’re speaking, makes for one of the clearest remote-input devices I’ve ever used. Good riddance to Siri never hearing you, and to holding your headphone cable a quarter-inch from your mouth while you walk and talk. More important, though, is the tight integration between hardware and software that Apple still excels at supplying. It starts from the very beginning: you take the AirPods out of their box, open up the lid to the dental-floss-dispenser case, and set them down next to your iPhone. A pop-up window appears from the bottom of your phone’s screen, asking if you want to connect your new AirPods. Of course you do! So you press the very large “Connect” button, and you’re done. From then on, as soon as you flip open the charging case and put the AirPods in your ears, a bright ding will let you know you’re connected to your phone. If you’re listening to music and take one bud out, it automatically pauses. Put it back in, and it starts playing again. (This is the only imperfect part of the equation, by the way—it works most of the time, but not all.) If you only have one bud in to start, it automatically shifts to mono sound. Double-tap on the headphones to invoke Siri. The AirPods will work as standard Bluetooth headphones with any device, but features like auto-pairing and Siri will only work with headphones that incorporate Apple’s new W1 chip. The AirPods will cut out for a split second if I put my hand in just the right spot or bury my phone a bit too far into my bag. It doesn’t happen often, and it is, sadly, still better than most other Bluetooth headphones. And I’ve never had it spontaneously disconnect completely, which is more than I can say for most AirPods competitors. Lupine Hammack for WIRED Having Siri two taps away isn’t just the best thing about the AirPods. It’s the reason they exist. In some spots, they’re even too reliant on Apple’s voice assistant. Most headphones let you change volume or songs with gestures and buttons. With the AirPods, you have to either dig your phone out or double-tap on the bud, wait for Siri to stir from its slumber, say “Next song,” and wait again for Siri to do your bidding. Siri has gotten dramatically better in the last couple of years, and minimalism is great and all, but another swipe option or two wouldn’t hurt. Read More Our 15 Favorite Wireless Headphones, From Bose to Beats Review: BeatsX Wireless Headphones Review: Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless Headphones Of course, Apple could add more gestures with a simple software update. AirPods are, after all, a computer for your ears. Apple’s not the first company to try this approach; Bragi and Doppler have brazenly run down this same path. But Apple has something those two upstarts don’t: An entire ecosystem at its disposal. It’s easy to imagine Apple making the AirPods the centerpiece of how you interact with all your devices, particularly as Siri becomes more important. (And, hopefully, faster.) Do you want to wear these AirPods all the time, though? Will you ever? If my experience so far is any indication, it’ll be a while before wireless earbuds of any kind are more than a near-futuristic novelty. And it doesn’t help that the AirPods look like two antennae sticking out of your ears. Right now, you can get better-sounding wireless headphones for the same price or less. They’ll fit better, look better, work better. If you buy the AirPods you’re buying them for being really, ridiculously convenient, and not much else. And you can even get that for less, too, at least when the W1-equipped Beats X earbuds come out later this fall. (Though those are, improbably, even uglier than the AirPods.) All that said, I’m really looking forward to what the AirPods become. They have the potential to be the kind of project that goes from accessory or hobby to critical piece of Apple’s future. The AirPods, above all else, are Siri machines. And just like Siri, they have a bright future—and a seriously awkward present. A Few Months Later After a few months of using the Airpods, a weird thing keeps happening to me. I still don’t think AirPods sound very good, I still don’t think they look good, and a few of their features still drive me absolutely insane. And yet, I keep finding myself going back to the AirPods. For all their faults, Apple’s candy-cane headphones are so easy to pair, and so comfortable to wear for hours at a time, that I can overlook the many faults. Sometimes. Life with the AirPods is a study in tradeoffs: It’s great that they’re so loose and comfortable in my ear, except that means I can’t hear my podcast once the train gets noisy. I love that I can just pop one bud out and my music will pause, but when I’m holding that bud in my hand I tend to accidentally tap on the side and start the music playing all over again. Their simplicity is half the point, but it drives me up a wall that I can’t change volume without getting my phone or begging Siri. I love that there are no wires! I hate that I can’t take them off and drape them around my neck. I love using the AirPods for phone calls above all else. They’re the first Bluetooth headphones that sound as good as if I’m holding my phone to my face. And in general, they’re a totally viable set of headphones that never fall out, even when you think they will. What I really want, though, is a cross between these and the PowerBeats3: the light, simple earbuds, with a cable that goes behind my head and some basic controls. Maybe even a cable you can disconnect? I’m dreaming, I know. But there’s a happy medium in there somewhere, between the beauty and freedom of wireless and the controls and quality of the slightly tethered. Until we get there, pick a side. Or buy two pairs of headphones. Update: This review was updated in April 2017 with additional notes from the author. Go Back to Top.

Of course, Apple makes an absolute killing on iPhone models with more storage space, and there’s no way the company will ever destroy its margins by letting people purchase entry-level iPhones and then expand their memory with a microSD card. But guess what: there’s a 256GB microSD card in my iPhone right now. No, it’s not black magic, it’s the Lexar microSD To Lightning Reader. Pop this little guy into the Lightning port on any iPhone and you can offload your photos, videos, music and more onto a microSD card to clear up space for new content. Couple it with this 256GB microSD card (or any other microSD card) and you’ll never get one of those pesky out of storage errors again. Here are some key details from the product page: Easily offload and transfer content to or from your iPhone or iPad with a micro SD card Great for anyone capturing photos or video with a sports camcorder or aerial camera Small, portable design with a Lightning connector Works with use of free file management app (App Store) Automatically and securely sync files Lexar microSD To Lightning Reader - LRWMLBNL: $24.95 Samsung EVO+ 256GB UHS-I microSDXC U3 Memory Card with Adapter (MB-MC256DA/AM): $159.95 Trending right now: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 iPhone 8: Insider outs exciting new features, but says phone is delayed Biggest iPhone 8 leak yet offers several surprising new details See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Ford brings baby’s car-ride experience to the crib Yahoo Tech A massive asteroid is going to zip past Earth later this month BGR News I drove the electric Chevy Bolt all weekend and only freaked out once Yahoo Tech Don’t throw these sneakers out — you can compost them Yahoo Tech Biggest iPhone 8 leak yet offers several surprising new details BGR News How Apple's secrecy can hurt consumers Yahoo Tech Pogue’s Basics: How to speed up YouTube playback with a keystroke Yahoo Tech Astronomers just discovered something awesome about the most Earth-like planet ever found BGR News Robot arms are now teaching each other how to work Yahoo Tech The disruption of workers by robots is about to take a giant leap forward Yahoo Tech Google's window-mounted air conditioner could have its own window Digital Trends Google's new YouTube TV lets you watch cable for $35 a month Yahoo Tech ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Yahoo Tech U.S. net neutrality advocates blast Pai effort to reverse rules Reuters Obsess over your dog even more with this smart pet door Yahoo Tech

 Android and Windows sell way more devices than Apple, but that's not as important as it sounds Jeff Dunn Apr. 7, 2017, 5:47 PM 2,824 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Among the many noteworthy things Apple said during its Mac announcement-meets-apology earlier this week was the revelation that, according to Apple marketing boss Phil Schiller, the Mac’s total user base is nearing 100 million. That figure caught the eye of some onlookers, since it falls well short of its rival Windows operating system. More specifically, Microsoft said last September that it had 400 million users on Windows 10 alone. Sounds pretty bad for Apple, right? Well, as this chart from Statista reminds us, market share isn’t the end-all, be-all for tech industry success. If you mix recent device shipment and spending figures from Gartner with Apple’s sales numbers in 2016, a familiar trend reasserts itself: The Cupertino company doesn’t have to sell the most devices to make the most money. Roughly 11% of phones sold last year were iPhones, for instance, but Apple’s popularity in the high-end of the market — where it almost exclusively sits — was enough to capture more than a third of the phone industry’s total revenue. One analyst recently said the company took more than 90% of the industry’s profits last quarter beyond that. In other words, it’s about quality more than quantity. The gap isn’t as dramatic with the Mac as it is with the iPhone and iPad, but the fact that it’s still worth roughly $25 billion after years of fading relevance to Apple is impressive (and well above Microsoft’s competing Surface business). Still, just because the Mac is making money doesn’t mean it’s keeping customers happy — which is why Apple is promising to do better by its “pro” users from now on.

Fossil and Apple see some momentum, while Fitbit has new reason to worry, according to one analyst. By Emily Bary April 7, 2017 4:46 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large "The bulk of the opportunity may still be in the future," says one analyst of the Apple Watch. Illustration: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images After a slow start, the timing might finally be right for wearables -- at least a certain kind. More traditional watch companies are coming around to smartwatches -- and consumers are too. KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma left the Baselworld watch show impressed by Fossil’s progress on fashionable watches that also have smart functions. If people can get notifications and fitness-tracking capabilities in a sleek-looking smartwatch, they might have less need for basic fitness trackers, which Yruma estimates make up about 80% of Fitbit’s sales.

Fitbit is trying to make a bigger push into watches, but it may have to break away from the boxy, sporty look of its current models. Garmin, meanwhile, might have less to lose since fitness trackers are just 10% of its business, according to Yruma. The Fossil effect will probably have less of an effect on Garmin’s application-specific sports watches. The Apple Watch might not be as pretty as the hybrid watches that Fossil has launched, but better features on the newest version of the Apple Watch and lower prices for the prior model appear to be attracting new customers. “While we have seen little to suggest a pending inflection in growth rates, the category seems to be demonstrating steady progress for Apple, which suggests the bulk of the opportunity may still be in the future,” Yruma wrote.

Around 4:50 p.m. EDT, the Turkish Crime Family—a collective of apparent hackers and data collectors— received a payment of just over 401.78 BTC, or about $482,000. The group had been threatening to remotely erase a database of iCloud accounts it had collected if it did not receive payment. Read: How To Change Your iCloud Password: Apple Denies Hackers Stole iCloud Credentials The origin of the payment is unclear, but given the company’s previous statements on the issue, it is unlikely the payment came from Apple. The transaction was believed to have been sent through a Bitcoin tumbler, which are designed to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions so they cannot be traced back to an individual. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. A member of the Turkish Crime Family operating the group’s Twitter account told International Business Times the group couldn’t provide any confirmation where the payment came from, but said, “either way somebody with 400k+ making these claims should not be taken as a joke.” The group member said the Turkish Crime Family will “not attack Apple” as a result of the payment. “A deal is a deal,” the account proprietor said. Security researcher Troy Hunt suggested on Twitter that the transaction was fake. Using a tumbler may be evidence of this, as it obscures the sender of the the funds, which Hunt intimated was the group itself attempting to save face. The alleged payment came hours after the group’s initial deadline of 7:30 p.m. GMT (3:30 p.m. EDT), though the group claimed on Twitter to be in touch with a “negotiator” who was working on an agreement with Apple. Read: Apple, iCloud Accounts Stolen? Hackers Blackmailing Apple Over Supposed Stolen Credentials The group claimed to be in possession of an upward of 800 million Apple and iCloud credentials, which it gathered and assembled from a number of previous database leaks. A sample of the accounts indicated that at least some of them were valid, but it is impossible to say how many may have been affected had the threat been carried out. Despite ending the iCloud attack—whether because the group received its requested ransom or because it never had the resources to carry out the attack in the first place—a member of the group promised that the Turkish Crime Family had future plans in the works. The member said the group is still intending to launch an “unlocks service” which appears to be a service where users will be able to pay $10 to get a password associated with an Apple ID. “This is just the start of the group,” the person said.

Here’s how to downgrade from 10.3. Apple just released the iOS 10.3 update, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 for a limited time. Get on it fast if you want to do this. Unfortunately, there is no way to go back to iOS 10.2, which you can jailbreak. Officially Apple does not support a way to downgrade iOS updates, but there is an easy way to do this in iTunes for a short time after Apple releases an update. Apple closed the option to downgrade to iOS 9 long ago, but you can still downgrade to iOS 10.2.1. In order to downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 you will need to download the file and Apple still needs to sign the file. This normally only happens for a week or two after Apple offers a new update. How to downgrade from iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1. Apple’s upgrade system includes a check to make sure that Apple is still activating, or signing, the software you want to install. If Apple is no longer signing this update you will not be able to install it. How to Downgrade iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1 Here are the steps you need to downgrade from iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.2.1. You cannot downgrade to iOS 9.3 or to iOS 9.2, which is frustrating for some users. You cannot downgrade back to a jailbreak-able version of iOS 10 either. Backup Your iPhone Before you start you should make sure that your iPhone or iPad is backed up to your computer. You can’t restore a iOS 10.3 backup to your iPhone after you downgrade to iOS 10.2.1, but it is important to make sure you have a backup in case something does go wrong. Make sure you have a backup before you start the iOS 10.2 downgrade to iOS 10.1.1. When you downgrade you will need to completely erase your iPhone. If you have a backup from iOS 10 you can restore to that. Download the iOS 10.2.1 Update To do this you will need to plug in to your Mac or PC using a Lightning cable and you will need to make sure that you have the iOS 10.2.1 update file for your device. Here’s where you can download iOS 10.2.1 ipsw files for any of the iPhone or iPad devices that runs this update. If the row is green and there is a check in the Apple Signing Status, then you know that you can continue. If Apple is no longer signing iOS 10.2.1 you should stop. Start the iOS 10.3 Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Once you have the file downloaded to your computer, and unzipped if needed, you will want to plug in your iPhone to Mac or PC with a Lightning cable. Start the downgrade to go back to iOS 10.2. Open iTunes and click on your iPhone or iPad to launch the device summary page in iTunes. Make sure you turn off Find my iPhone before you start. You will need to special click on “Restore iPhone…”. That is a alt/option click on Mac or a Shift click in Windows. Hold the key and then click. This will open up a prompt so that you can search for the iOS 10.2. ipsw file you downloaded.   Complete the iOS 10.3 downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 Find the file and click Open to start the downgrade process. You will see a message on the screen that iTunes will erase and restore your iPhone to iOS 10.2.1 and will verify the restore with Apple. Click Restore to start. When this finishes you will have a blank iPhone on iOS 10.2.1. You can choose Restore Backup and choose a previous backup from before you installed iOS 10.3. Alternately, you can choose to start over from scratch. What’s New in iOS 10.2.1 & iOS 10.2 New iOS 10.2 Emoji   1 / 6 There are over 100 new iOS 10.2 emoji in this free update. You don't need to buy any apps or subscriptions to unlock them. Simply install iOS 10.2 and you will be able to start sending new faces, food, animals, sports and professions. The people you send the new iOS 10.2 emoji to will need iOS 10.2 installed to see them. They may need iOS 10.2 to see some of the redesigned emoji based on our testing during the beta. Some of the new iOS 10.2 emojis include; Clown Emoji Prince Mother Christmas Rolling on the Floor Laughing Lying Face Drooling Emoji Nauseated Face Sneezing Face Shrug Man in a Tux emoji Pregnant woman Face Palm Cal Me Hand Fingers Crossed Emoji Handshake Gorilla Fox Face Deer Rhino Bat Eagle Duck Owl Lizard Croissant Baguette Peanuts Bacon Egg Milk Whisky Emoji Spoon Scooter Canoe First Place Medal Goal Net Fencer Wrestlers Apple also adds in new professions to the emojis including male and female versions of these new options including artists, astronauts, cooks, factory workers, farmers, firefighters, health worker, judges, mechanics, office workers, pilots, teachers and much more.   1 / 6 19 Responses 03/22/2016 Thelma Reply Friends…!m­­­­­­­­­y room­­­­­­­­­ate’s e­­­­­­­­­x-w­­­­­­­­­ife ma­­­­­­­­­kes $83 e­­­­­­­­­very ho­­­­­­­­­ur o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e inter­­­­­­­­­net .

Well, I just did. During the downgrade, iTunes asked me if I wanted to start fresh or restore a backup, so I chose to restore a backup. I chose the iTunes backup that was made from 9.3.4 just before starting the downgrade, and it restored just fine to 9.3.3. 08/23/2016 tariq malik Reply i have ipad 2 wifi . after the download 9.3.3 version when i go to itunes and click on check for update with holding shift key from laptop then select the file from browse the message come on my screen ‘could not be update because the firmware file is not compatible’ please help me for downgrade the software even i off the option ”find my ipad’ 09/22/2016 blogzxeenmmy Reply Is downgrade to iOS 9 is now possible ? 12/29/2016 hackear facebook Reply What i do not realize is in reality how you are no longer actually much more well-favored than you might be now.

When checking Apple Music on Friday afternoon, only albums in which Jay Z collaborated with other artists, including Linkin Park and R. Kelly, were visible under a search of his name. A handful songs that Jay Z did with other musicians, such as “Holy Grail” which featured Justin Timberlake, are still available on Apple Music. Jay Z takes down albums from Apple Music. Photo: Apple Music, Screenshot: Denisse Moreno However, it seems like Jay Z hasn’t cut off all ties with Apple, since many of his albums and videos are still available on iTunes. Jay Z’s music was also taken off Spotify, a tweet posted Friday spotted by MacRumors shows. In response to the tweet Spotify said: “We can confirm that some of Jay Z's catalogue has been removed at the request of the artist /LP.” It’s not explicitly clear why Jay Z took down his work from Apple Music and Spotify, but Hova does own rival streaming service, Tidal. Although Tidal has many famous stakeholders, including Beyonce, Kanye West and Rihanna, the service has lagged behind Apple Music and Spotify. In January, Sprint bought a 33 percent stake in Tidal. The streaming service was expected to start producing content available exclusively to Sprint customers after the deal. Whether the acquisition played a role in Jay Z’s decision to take down his music from Apple Music and Spotify is not certain. Tidal, like Apple Music, costs $9.99 a month, and offers a library of about 42.5 million songs and 140,000 videos. Tidal said last year it had 3 million subscribers, but reports have disputed that number. Apple Music passed the 20 million paid subscribers barrier last year, while Spotify has more than 40 million paid and 100 million total users.

Once you start using the device, you tend to store important data on it such as private photos and important contact information and even financial details. So, losing one could be quite a loss, not only in terms of data, but also in term of money. But rather than stressing the device once it is lost, it is better to take prior precautions and in case you lose, use the proprietary Apple app called Find My iPhone. Read: Apple Ditches Google Maps For Find My iPhone Find My iPhone is Apple’s anti-theft software, which is pre-installed on all iPhones. It works for all Apple devices including iPad, iPod and Mac. It allows users to track a lost or stolen device by showing its location and even lets them lock and wipe a device remotely. In addition to this, the app requires the iPhone owner’s registered Apple ID and password before it can be disabled. Therefore, it is important to enable the app on your iPhone. In case your iPhone is lost or stolen, here’s what you need to do: Log into iCloud from a computer (It doesn’t matter whether it is a Mac or a Windows PC). Just go to www.icloud.com and punch in your Apple ID and password, which would be the same one you used to log in to the app on your device. Once you have logged in, click on the Find My iPhone button Now, click on “All Devices” Select your stolen iPhone in the drop down menu An ‘iPhone Info’ Window will pop up and show you exactly when your iPhone was last checked in. It will have three buttons: ‘Play Sound,’ ‘Lost Mode,’ and ‘Erase iPhone’. The ‘Play Sound’ option will make the iPhone play a sound and could be useful in case your iPhone is nearby. In case, you think that your iPhone is at a location where you can go and fetch it, then you can simply lock the phone remotely using the ‘Lost Mode’ option. If you think that your iPhone is stolen and you wouldn’t like the data on it ending up in the hands of a stranger, you can click on the ‘Erase iPhone’ option to wipe out all the data on the device. Read: Apple Might Start Using Self-Healing Displays on iPhones Soon You can also track your iPhone in the map, which would be there in the background of the Find My iPhone web app on iCloud.com and show the last location of your iPhone.

The Canadian Biotechnology Action Network (CBAN) said the webinar content had inappropriate product placement and collaborated with Council of Canadians and several other groups in sending a letter to provincial education ministers asking them to withdraw support. “The example that was used is a brand name corporate product that was being presented by marketing staff from the company. We think that was an inappropriate level of corporate involvement in this webinar,” said CBAN co-ordinator Lucy Sharratt in an interview. “The webinar did focus on the apple production chain, which I think is important and interesting but … the webinar was not carefully constructed to provide unbiased information or information that was removed from the company that actually is marketing the GM apple,” she said. Johanne Ross, executive director of Agriculture in the Classroom Canada, said mention of the Arctic Apple in the webinar, presented as part of month-long agricultural literacy efforts, was an example of how technology can help address food waste. “This is not an infomercial about a product,” said Ross. “We’re just using the Arctic Apple as an example to talk about innovation and the gene silencing that happens to actually get the non-browning trait. That’s just part of a bigger discussion.” The webinar, comprising about 45 slides, included four specific to the apple, said Ross. The main speaker for the webinar, presented to high school students on March 7, was Jessica Brady, a member of the marketing and communications team for Okanagan Specialty Fruits, the company that developed and is marketing the Arctic Apple. “I think everyone would agree that product promotion is not a legitimate activity in classrooms so if corporations are going to be part of presenting information to students through Ag in the Classroom, the question is, what is that role of those companies? Are they credible sources?” Sharratt asked. Ross said the program’s funders operate under official donor guidelines requiring them to embrace AIC’s mandate to provide accurate, balanced and current information. ADVERTISMENT “We call it our ABC principal,” said Ross. “It’s based on science and it gives multiple views so that the students can have their own robust discussion behind it. And then they can make their own decisions for all the right reasons.” Ross said the letter sent to education ministers, which was sent by CBAN, the Council of Canadians, Earth Action PEI, the MacKillop Centre for Social Justice and Kids Right to Know, elicited only one query to AIC. That came from the Prince Edward Island provincial education department. “They were very comfortable with what we had provided them and there’s been absolutely no communication to me in terms of any education departments getting involved,” Ross said. Sharratt said her group got two responses. The Nova Scotia education ministry said it did not promote the webinar and the Newfoundland and Labrador ministry asked for more information. “I don’t know how clear standards are but we thought it was important to alert students and teachers and ministers of what we thought was pretty clear product placement in this case,” she said. “Schools are a very clear market for this GM apple so it was particularly alarming that the … product placement was so up front.” Sharratt also noted development of the Arctic Apple has been controversial, even in agriculture circles, so AIC information should recognize that in its programming. ADVERTISMENT Ross said that is the goal. “We’re very interested in telling the whole story of agriculture,” she said. Attention to the AIC program from other groups has raised its profile, said Ross. “I’ve been told a number of times that I guess this means we’re doing good work, because we’re being noticed. We have absolutely nothing to hide. That’s why it hasn’t been hard to speak to it, because we’re very, very proud of the resources and the programming that we’re offering to schools across the country.” Ag in the Classroom programming is carried out by farmers and volunteers with limited staff support. Ross praised that involvement. Sharratt noted that as well, with a proviso. “We do know that there’s a lot of farmers and volunteers involved. And all of the work that farmers and volunteers do with Ag in the Classroom could be undermined if corporate interests are using it to promote their products to students,” she said. “That was our concern that was flagged by this webinar. We don’t yet have a perspective on how far that may be a problem inside the program itself.” ADVERTISMENT Popular articles Farmers overcharged nearly $100 million in CGC… Survey reveals ‘amazing’ soil loss in Great… Police warn about illegal left turns Grain bag slashing angers farmer Genesis plans huge fertilizer supercentre west of… About the author Barb Glen — Lethbridge bureau Also by this author Conservation projects to receive $9… Dairy tries cross breeding, but returns… Cover all bases in land lease stevesavage The story of those apples is a great example of Canadian farmer-driven innovation going against all odds to develop a consumer-oriented, waste reducing trait. Not sure how one could tell that without mentioning the brand. It should be a source of pride for all Canadians Sheryl McCumsey This is exactly the opposite of what you are claiming. This is about the lack of ability of someone to cut up their own apple…….instead this apple will be placed in packaging…….something we need to REDUCE. Reducing food waste begins at the grocery- and some stores already have eliminated that entirely. This is up to retail and consumers to change and this apple has nothing what so ever to do with that. This is to benefit industry NOT the consumer and certainly NOT waste. stevesavage Sheryl, The pre-sliced offer is just one way this apple can be marketed. If the public phobias and anti-technology campaigns can be overcome it would be possible to offer it as a whole apple for those of us who prefer to do our own slicing. richard Interesting how the arctic apple is a perfect metaphor for industrial agriculture….. Its all about optics and little to do with nutrition…. Why not an apple packed with more vitamins, energy and taste….rather than a clinically white one still infused with three to five applications of agritoxins, sealed in a wax coat….? Jason Why is this a metaphor for industrial ag? I don’t see any other forms of ag addressing that issue either. Harold “Public Phobia”? A mental disorder? There is mental disorder and “anti- technology campaigns”? Does the new apple cure the mental disorder? Who is the expert that clinically discovered this epidemic and disability? What is anti-Technology anyways? I know what anti means and I know what technology means but put together i don’t know how you can place a backward motion with a forward motion and call it a fact word. You either have the technology or you don’t; no technology, you either have the science or you don’t; no science, and unused technology is simply that; unused technology. Anti-science and anti-technology are nonsense words. (perhaps you prefer “anti-sense” in place of “nonsense” for clarity) Everywhere that anti is being crafted to words is where groups are displaying a desire to remove Canadian individual’s rights to freedoms of choice, belief, conscience, expression, thought, opinion, speech, association, assembly, and peace and security of person and those groups are Government and the Corporate Elite. How the Government? The lack of transparency and closed doors (lobbying) and lack and disregard for public communications and news media black outs is not government but has become Government. (no direct weekly press conferences and disclosure of new Bills before the house; 6-o-clock NEWS). Canadian individual rights (Charter) are written for how the government shall consider and act before any law is passed. They are not written to us. When the government violates the Charter, we (public) present the violation to the government and they must act upon it according to OUR will. Anytime we do not present the charter at a time of violation, it is in acceptance to suffering the law agreed to and it is enacted. Our government prevents public knowledge and promotes the suffering of laws that the majority do not want to suffer compounded by the majority not knowing how to withdraw their consent to discontinue its sufferance. All said, forgive me if I have only two words for the “little green apple”; i’ll take my Meds. Nonetheless, what group has the mental disorder and the phobia? Follow the money trails and you will find what a billion dollars can do to the mind. Follow their nonsense word ANTI- Something. Per adventure: another nonsense word anti-terrorism is another example and so forth. Jason Sheryl, if it doesn’t benefit the consumer then they won’t buy it. If it does, they will. Why not let them decide if they want it or not? Damo I can think of many reasons for a pre-sliced packaged apple. One of which is independence for the handicapped. Rob Bright Public school classrooms are no place for industry propaganda. How is this not clear to people? Harold What we clearly know is to sit down, shut up when told, and to obey authority no matter what authority looks like or face punishment as was taught by our very own school system. The one’s who dropped out of the school’s systems know authority very differently. Take a freshly graduated student and ask him what his personal authority as a individual person is; ask anybody. Unable to answer, you will see that the Education System did well and why propaganda is taught in schools. It can take many years to un-educate yourself. Aren’t we all just sitting down and shutting up and letting the authority’s whoever they say they are handle all of the concerns while we pass private notes between our student desks awaiting our teacher’s next assignment. (like we are doing now) What is our Authority? Those who say they have “none” have been educated well, and those who say that we are the authority know the truth and they stand. (very few) No Law is passed without majority consent and we just can’t seem to figure out the simplicity of it all. Is CBAN or the Government or the politicians with their own ideological personal well thought out educated opinions the majority? A: only when we consent to sit down, shut up and obey their teachings. What is not clear; the fact that we have not left behind our student desks to roam the halls freely as our parents and teachers do? Why should we interfere with government? A: because we as an individual or as a majority, have a Living Constitutional Lawful and undeniable RIGHT to do so immediately at any given moment and time and our conscience demands it. . (unless educated = the many) The same simplicity occurs at any restaurant; if you don’t have an order, then what you want rightfully does not come to your table by your server and the Chef rightfully prepares nothing and you have only wronged yourself. Are we feeling like we are fasting? Make an order. If you don’t like the sauce, have it removed. No explanation for your dislike is necessary, and importantly, regardless of your mental state. What I mean by this is that the majority makes the decisions and government has no law that gives them the right to question or a right to ignore it. If we remain silent (educated) then the plate that lawfully landed on your table is by your own consent. Silence = educated = knowing what you are doing and Protest/petition = educated = knowing what you are doing, and referendum means not enough signatures to support a petition proving majority. The simplicity of law Is kept out of the schools and from the public at large to benefit whom? I’m sure that the Government elite and the corporate elite will have the appropriate answer. Sheryl McCumsey Personally I have not been silent and in fact I wrote the Minister of Education about this issue and spoke with someone from this department. What I was told is that this is not his issue because they deal with the curriculum. I said, “Isn’t the curriculum deal with content?” Yes I was told. So I said this is the content of what our children are being taught and it is not balanced when an industry has decided to market to our children. This puts the responsibility on parents to object. We are expected to object every and each time industry lobbies to our government in regards to removing environmental regulations and influencing our education. We are expected to “know” what is going on when media isn’t fully reporting all the issues. Teachers would need to spend a lot of time to go through information shared in the “toolkit” for teachers that “Ag for Life” shares. They say they are non-profit but they are supported by Monsanto and other chemical companies. This means that we are up against multi-national corporations that have very deep pockets- that are in effect advertising to our children without the informed consent of their parents. If we decide to elect an individual that we hope will listen to us we are out of luck if they do not follow through. A perfect example is Trudeau and his abandonment of electoral reform. This is only one example but industry spends a lot of money lobbying to government and has influence over media. This is just another serious and disturbing example. Harold The first step is to win your argument with facts before you attempt to write a letter. You send your letter properly addressed to the full name and full address of the Minister that you are contacting and he personally must respond by a written and signed in ink letter. (You make an Order to do so) This is the undeniable evidence of your communication. A person who speaks on the Ministers behalf is hearsay and irrelevant. If you accept a person other than the Minister and you communicate, you may have unknowing changed the “game”; that was mistake number One. Mistake number two. You do not ask the Minister a question at anytime unless you intend to be his or her student. You present your written fact evidence (proves that you are educated in the matter) and you make an order such as; “whereas this is in conflict with the spirit of the education system and its purpose I hereby withdraw my consent and require your quest be for the matter to be made of no cause and effect in the education system”. (what “This” and what “education system” have to be identified fully) “I require that you personally respond within 14 days of receiving this letter”.(you keep a copy of your letter and it doesn’t hurt to send it double registered to prove that it was received). You have Just created a cause and an order. You have placed the minister in a position where he can only respond to your facts and provide you with more fact. This is the start of your second letter if you can counter and don’t accept a half hearted response without countering with a demand for full accountability for the facts. 2+2= 4 and no matter how many people point it out, or do not point it out, it remains a fact Be prepared to say this if some idiot politician says dismissively that you are the only one with a concern. He is not in a position to challenge your order. The Minister’s return letter and your letter becomes your fact evidence that you will present to the public at large because the Minister is their servant too. This is why you can never accept a half hearted letter written by the title of Minister; you are corresponding to a adult by an adult and not to a child. Your order to the Minister is also an order that the public will follow as well. For example: we the public petition and agree and demand the order carried out as written) Do you think that we are playing any games with the Politician? Mistake number three. What you said in part was “……not his issue because THEY deal with the curriculum”. Did you “educate” him or did he just “educate” you and say “put your hand down” Miss so and so. It is a trap and dismissal trick that they hope you accept. (most do) Not fooled you would ask if the conversation is being recorded, and if not, ask him to supply recording; If not so be it. I would then say “I don’t know you, and I don’t understand you (understand means agree) and I will await the Ministers written response; have a good day” and then hang up. (reason later) If adventurous I would take his full name and Rank and then ask who the “they” are. Does the “they” have a name? You know for every “they” that there is a department head that has a full name. (responsibility) Even “they” who live at the North Pole have a Santa Clause. Perhaps he meant Santa Clause. You write down the full name and full address of the name who is the “they” so that you can give the Minister of Education the name of the “they” to help execute the order in your letter. (Mr Minister I “order” you to tell Mr “they/name” to cease and desist) Next I would order Mr.Rank to become a messenger to the Minister of Education to inform the Minister that “you will not consent to Mr Rank or hearsay speaking on the Ministers behalf.” “Inform the Minister, Mr.Rank, that my letter dated (….) remains true and unchanged and that I am awaiting his written response.” What you are doing is keeping your letter active in meaning, facts and orders.This is followed by: “can you Mr.Rank repeat to me what you have written down for the Minister on my behalf.” Hopefully you were recorded and now Mr Rank is liable, so you need the date, time and notes of the details to enter into your file to retrieve the recording and etc later. Next, you bid him a “good day” and hang up. In the background, Mr Rank got an order to call you for which Mr.Rank needs to return a report to the sender. Here is the trick being played. People change their minds and they have a lawful right to do so unless under contract it is prevented. Your letter demands a written response from the Minister but accepting a call from Mr. Rank instead is a change of mind and Mr Rank’s report is attached to your letter as the evidence. Any recorded part of the conversation can also indicate a change of your opinion relative to your letter. That is why Mr. Rank often takes you to la la land and introduces you to “they” and further why it is done over the phone; letter writing and signatures are precise. Mr Rank provides the evidence and now Mr. Minister does not need respond. (you are back where you started) Further, the Minister is not responsible for what he say’s because he just may not be able to recall what he says. The Minister is not responsible for what he thinks that you publicly voiced/phoned to him, for the very same reason. However, he is responsible for every written word and especially where his signature appears. This is why they like to do town halls and speeches and never write anything down or collect order’s bearing a wet ink signature and why we hear monologues but the public is never heard. I will ask you this; what upsets and inspires people more; what you say or the evidence that proves what you say? What are the tricks meant to do? If the Minister has written that he will not obey your order then you go to majority petition whereby consent is withdrawn by the majority. Hopefully this information helps. Sheryl McCumsey Yes, it certainly gives me some ideas. Thank you for taking the time to share. Harold I hope that I have given you remedies rather than Ideas. Written Law and acting lawfully and providing fact is not an Idea. I have a habit of word checking to gain clarity. Words can be self-defeating. It is very important that you know who you are and not fall into any traps. What gives you the right to bother a politician in the manner that I have shown you? You can try what I said but where is your freedom when asked? The politician says: do you think that you can just barge in here and make demands of me? Who do you think YOU are. I am a Lawful Politician and you are just a voter! What will you say? Will it be anything that you learned in Social Studies at school which would come in damn handy right now? How about saying to the politician: Because I have a damn Right to at any time! Followed by: Charter of Rights and Freedoms : Any member of the public in Canada has the right to communicate with, and to receive available services from, any head or central office of an institution of parliament or government of Canada in English or French and has the same right with respect to any other office of any such institution. Ask the politician is he sees any restrictions written. Calendar? clock? Restrictions are written and there are none. You will notice that this includes your provincial government, schools, your city. town and all of their agencies. I have to further warn you of politicians and their opinions. It is also a trap. His opinions are offers only for which you can accept or you can reject. Do not accept any opinion unless you ask any or all of the following. Where is your opinion written down? Show it to me now. It Is Public opinion: Where Is the public opinion written down? Show it to me now. Everybody knows, don’t you?: Where Is what everybody knows written down? Show it to me now. How does your written opinion apply to me or to anyone else? Show it to me now. (he wrote for example: I believe carbon taxing Is the right thing to do and everybody in the church thinks the same so there should be a law.) It is your opinion politician and you are only one, and a Servant. He is the servant and cannot challenge your order and you are there with written word and educated with fact and your servant has provided you with hearsay. Show me politician: your majority ink signed consent to your proposal and show it to me now. Order: Politician Without the authority of majority consent you have no authority to continue. (you enter in Constitutional law violation text) Have the majority been made fully aware of your offer? (you enter in more constitution law showing a violation) Show me the evidence and show it to me now. Did the majority ask for this law? (add more constitution law) Show me the evidence and show it to me now. This may seem rather harsh but if a Politician cannot provide evidence then what the hell Is he or she doing in office? Lip service? Your letter to the minister must be Honorable in nature and your words in your letter as much as possible should derive their meaning from the Canada law dictionary. Sometimes unknowingly your word choice can in Law mean something totally different. Check your words regardless if you think that you know them As I have said before, never understand what a politician is saying even if some of what he is saying is correct. Say that you do not understand and then give the politician your complete understanding. Don’t worry, some of the politician facts will be in your painting but your painting is going on the wall because you are refusing his. If I have confused you let me know and I will correct it. If Corporations do not belong in the school system then we should correct the system. SageThinker It’s another gimmicky trait. I don’t mind the mention of a brand name in a classroom, but i hope the GMO apple never goes into the lunch rooms of schools, and i hope it’s not taught as some kind of wondrous things. It’s more of an example of pointless technology that introduces risk of harm for dubious benefits. By the way, Steven Savage who also commented here is a known industry cheerleader. He’s author of many polemics for the GMO and agrochemical industry and Monsanto flew him to Hawaii to lobby the government there with Kevin Folta… so make of his comment what you will in that context. mary I was a teacher in the Richmond School District in the 1990s, and there was lots of corporate foraging into the education system back then all over the place, to “sponsor” all sorts of school activities, at a time when the school district was super strapped for cash, in exchange for brand placement in the school and in the classroom. Discussions abounded and these are just a few examples of the “collaborative innovative” spirit that education and corporations were exploring: Nike offered to sponsor district sports teams as long as PE strip in the schools was sourced from Nike, McMillian Bloedel would sponsor the purchase of biology curriculum supplies (a big expense) as long as deforestation was down played in course material, and Pepsi actually put in a proposal to rent Richmond School roof space for giant logo advertising placement directed at the planes that fly overhead to and from Vancouver airport. It’s real. and it’s happening. all over the place. Government cutbacks in education put school districts in terrible situations…and brand placement is so insidious that it seems to loads of people that it is both innocuous and a no brainer to avail of it’s funding to our schools. No amount of hope is going to turn that juggernaut around. Sucks to AIC and to arctic apples, and kudos to CBAN and the Council of Canadians for watchdogging like they do. Donations their way!! Sheryl McCumsey We also give tax dollars to corporations directly and indirectly- instead tax dollars should properly fund our schools and businesses should run on their own. Some of what I am witnessing is just not necessary and is not only unethical but information I am seeing is incorrect as well. Pesticides have increased since the introduction of GE crops. That is fact and is documented in government reports. Ag for Life is “teaching” something else. kim hunter What next, Pfizer selling synthetic opiods in classrooms as the only answer to teen angst? Where does the special interest end in the classroom if we allow this industry propaganda to be peddled as education? “The main speaker for the webinar, presented to high school students on March 7, was Jessica Brady, a member of the marketing and communications team for Okanagan Specialty Fruits, the company that developed and is marketing the Arctic Apple. “ grinninglibber Another unneeded GMO Trojan horse product. Most fast food restaurants and grocery chains will not carry it. Sheryl McCumsey Will students get all the information? Will Western Producer post my comment or will I be sharing this “again” on another page? “I don’t think we’re hiding behind the fact that we use that technique,” said Neal Carter, founder and president of Okanagan Specialty Fruits. “We don’t want to demonize the product by putting a big GMO sticker on it.” HUH? The genetically engineered apple (or GMO) called the Arctic Golden Apple is already being sold in the US although we are not being told where exactly. Why not? There has been a ton of resistance to this from both consumers and growers BUT now there is definite plans to market this directly to our children in the classroom across Canada. Is it acceptable to market to our children at all especially inside a classroom? Corporations are certainly in the classroom and this in itself is disturbing. Check out who sponsors those non-profits that explain why pesticides are necessary. The United Nations has reports that say we need to change how we farm that does not include pesticides. One: Genetic Engineered products all share the same scientific concern. We do not yet know and understand how a genome interacts – “replacing” DNA inside the plant genome changes the entire genome as DNA interacts just like David Suzuki puts it, like an orchestra but now you have someone playing a completely different tune. Does that matter? No one tests how this will affect our health or the environment because it is not required. Early uses of this technology are discussed in, “Altered genes, Twisted Truth” which I encourage you to read. Unknown and untested. Two: The enzyme that oxidizes an apple that is silenced has been discussed in studies before this apple was conceived, “PPO gene families perform multiple functions in plants. Little is known about the PPO gene family in apples, but in other plants, PPO genes are known to bolster pest and stress resistance. This raises the question of whether non-browning apple trees might be more vulnerable to disease and require more pesticides than conventional apples — and whether they might transfer those vulnerabilities to other apple trees.” This enzyme has a purpose. Three: This is not just an apple with apple genes. Because it is impossible to know if DNA “takes” markers are used so that it can be determined if the desired DNA is actually present. The marker used in this apple is a kanamycin resistant bacterial gene. Kanamycin is used in the treatment of serious diseases such as TB which is on the rise and becoming more resistant to treatment. Kanamycin is given intravenously. This is another concern. Four: It is impossible to contain damage to a market. You cannot contain this once it is growing in a field. Serious economic issues to farmers have resulted due to contamination of GE Flax, corn, soy and wheat in the US and Canada. This cannot be contained and growers did not want this apple. Many more countries do not want GE crops than those that accept this for some of the concerns I just mentioned. Damage to markets. Five: This will not address food waste but it may increase packaging of a simple food that does not require packaging. If people are opposed to an apple that “browns” they can use lemon juice or buy a variety of apple that already resists browning and does not have any of these risks. These apples are: Cameo, Snowsweet, Cortland, Empire, Gala, Goldrush, GingerGold, Masonova and Shizuka. This apple is redundant and a waste of money and effort. Addressing food waste is very important and can be done with far less effort- including writing grocers to change policies. Redundant. Six: Other GE crops have been tested such as corn to show that there is a chemical difference. ” The marked increase in putrescine and especially cadaverine is a concern since these substances are potentially toxic, being reported as enhancers of the effects of histamine, thus heightening allergic reactions.” “These apples make long double stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA). dsRNAs are proven vertebrate toxins. They are called toxins in the scientific literature.” Serious concerns around toxicity already exist. Seven: We are repeatedly told that GMO’s are not new, that we are all eating them and that this isn’t any different than other food we eat. This just isn’t true and when issues around GE wheat are discussed the same parties argue that GE wheat does not exist. We have created new foods that does not use this technology at all. We can continue to do this safely and without concerns around environment or health. GE crops are different and have patents on them. Why does this industry say one thing and then another? This is confusing isn’t it? Eight: Some people have never liked the idea of “owning” life or the arrogance that seems to always come around thinking we understand the consequences of this when clearly we do not. Then there is the question of labeling. Why don’t you label it? With all of this what is your “gut” reaction? I use this analogy, when standing on the beach in Thailand watching the water move out I would have run like hell and maybe not have questioned what was going on……….and then asked questions about tsunami’s……..we are being hit with a tidal wave of GE crops. Corn, canola, sugar beet, soy……..salmon (that will very well damage our wild populations), apples and even potatoes are on their way. We are told many things about this technology but often it is far from the truth. Label it don’t tell me that I am “demonizing” it- I want to know what I am eating and I am a part of the “majority”. Let’s demonstrate democratic values please. Nine: There are 750 studies just released from the Brazilian Ministry of Agrarian Development discussing the hazards and harm of this technology. Science does not suppress concerns it embraces them, recognizes them and discusses them. The bio-tech industry has not been honest or forthcoming and belittles anyone that questions them. Science exists around the multiple and widespread concerns of a technology that is just not needed. Every GE crop has a hybrid that can and often does outperform it. Ten: IBS. Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Canada is a world class leader of gut issues. There are many diseases that are dramatically increasing in relationship to pesticide increases and all the science around both GE crops and pesticides. Animals show harm in studies and we see it in the general population. This industry however is extremely powerful. Share this widely………before they hear about it. AND get it out of our classrooms. Teach children all about this but don’t let corporations do it for us. Peter Olins “Every GE crop has a hybrid that can and often does outperform it.” I’m speechless. Sheryl McCumsey Good. I listed several here: Cameo, Snowsweet, Cortland, Empire, Gala, Goldrush, GingerGold, Masonova and Shizuka. richard The largest single market for organic produce is apples…..You can draw your own conclusions about public perception ……Every skinned food oxidizes the second it is opened up…..your apple is no different…..And children who have been normalized to a junk diet are unlikely to start eating properly because their apple is sliced white. Rather than clever little marketing gimmicks in food, why doesn’t GM finally get down to products that people actually want…….nutrient dense, agritoxin free, sustainable, non feudal food systems……That’s the zeitgeist….. lead. follow or get out of the way…. stevesavage Well lets see. There are GM bananas and rice that could solve a real nutrient deficiency issue in the developing world and the opponents have blocked it. There are potatoes and sweet corn that were protected from insects with a very safe insecticidal protein so that they needed fewer sprays and those have been kept out of the food supply by brand-sensitive retailers who didn’t want to try to take on the anti-GMO activists. There are GM crops that are much easier to cultivate with the most sustainable, minimum tillage systems. The anti-GM folks are increasingly getting the big food companies and now Cargill to promote non-GMO which means not being able to use that very popular farmer option. No idea what you mean by feudal food systems richard oh I don’t know….lets see…..How about the vain notion that food is somehow broken and needs to be fixed…..by proprietary technology…..at seventy dollars an acre for seed……and legal control……How about fifty young farmers around me that can only rent capital, rent land, rent equipment, rent expertise, and now ….rent seed. How about them being tithed ninety seven per cent of their gate receipts to agribiz technological pipe dreams….Is that feudal enough for you sir? What the ivory tower fails to reveal to its missionaries is that an increasingly educated and discerning public aint buying it…….Theres nothing in it for them but more cheap bad food, environmental degradation and spine numbing hyperbole……all brought to you by……you got it…..the usual suspects. Dale Burns Ag in the Classroom is necessary to provide students a more balanced view of modern agriculture. The controversy seems to develop when students are given a view other than “modern ag is bad”. Kids Right to Know often boasts of their visits to schools and demonization of GMO breeding techniques without revealing the family conflict of interest. It is rather telling to see this reaction when faced with a program like Ag in the Classroom. After several years where kids’ exposure to agriculture was often limited to watching “Food Inc”, I think it is about time that students see a more realistic version of farming and food production. Attempts to squash Ag in the Classroom are meant to prevent balanced, insightful discussion of food production. Harold By whose opinion will a student be considered balanced? Will it be by the opinion of “modern ag”? What is modern agriculture? Assuming that I am living in modern times (2017) I see GM crop and I see organic crop and the year has not changed. It is collectively, both, together. twins, the two, each, arm in arm, united, couple, they must then represent modern agriculture in now time. (GE propaganda term “modern agriculture” baiting “organic” obsolete) So why is there a war? Do neither side have facts? What is in conflict with 2+2=4? is it 3+3=6? No; it is just another fact and no conflict of interest. Is a fact a demon? What then do students deserve? Lies? That is exactly what they get when you bring controversy into the schools. Lies are the topic rather than facts. Perhaps the adults should grow up a bit before they bring their BS to the students. Then there is the teacher of the student. Is he or she qualified to teach Modern GE and modern Organic Agriculture? In today’s world there is no reason to bring an Ag corporation into the school because everything that they need to know is available on the Web and the teacher only needs to bring it to the class room. Both of our modern agriculture practices and sciences and scientists and Farmers are available. Science is the teacher and it is not a peddler of an industry or its agenda. Any viewing on the Web peddling an agenda should be disallowed. You do not give any student an agenda of any kind; a student needs fact only and they will form their own agenda and that is true education. A student deserves no less. It is the duty of teachers to present facts only to their students and to keep that passion but to also leave their own personal agendas along with their little emotions outside the classroom door. Allowing an Industry peddler into the school system is to indoctrinate them rather than to educate them. It is about the money and not about a student’s education. My opinion is that if the GE Industry would just shut their gob and present the facts there would be no controversy. We would form the agenda and the Industry opinion can go to hell. Sounds Democratic; sounds New Canadian. (the old one wasn’t working in case you hadn’t noticed) Poor kids, same old same old. Happy Farmer I think education should get back to simple basics like the 3Rs. I have firsthand experience with kids that can’t write letters or sentences. Their math skills are terrible, and they don’t read very well either. If we think it is important to teach kids about food, religion or whatever in school, we should then allow presenters from every angle. Once every position has been presented the kids will then be able to decide for themselves. (although this may create more confusion than good, so maybe just get back to 3Rs). Happy Farmer Harold, rather lengthy and wordy for me, but I agree with your here.

Now, when searching for "Jay Z" on Apple Music, only songs in which he collaborated with other artists are available to stream on the service in the United States and elsewhere. Jay Z has removed select albums from Apple Music in the past, but this is the first time he has pulled his entire catalog of albums from the service, including Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, and The Black Album. Only some of his collaborations with Kanye West, Linkin Park, R. Kelly, and Rihanna remain. Jay Z co-owns Tidal, a rival streaming music service, so his decision to remove his discography from Apple Music could be for competitive reasons. Kanye West, another stakeholder in Tidal, also implied that there might be some animosity between Apple and Jay Z in a series of tweets last year. Jay Z's albums appear to have been removed from Spotify recently as well, so his decision might be unrelated to any potential feud with Apple. Spotify on Twitter today said it can "confirm that some of Jay Z's catalogue has been removed at the request of the artist," but it did not provide a specific reason. Jay Z's albums are still available for purchase on iTunes, and to stream on smaller services such as Google Play Music, at least for the time being. By contrast, Jay Z's wife Beyoncé still offers a large number of her songs and albums on Apple Music, including her recently added single "Die With You." Tidal's other stakeholders, including Kanye West, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Daft Punk, Jack White, Madonna, Arcade Fire, Alicia Keys, Usher, and Calvin Harris, also continue to offer many of their songs and albums on Apple Music. Tidal costs $9.99 per month, the same price as Apple Music, while a premium tier with high-fidelity sound is available for $19.99 per month. Tidal said it had over 3 million subscribers in March 2016, but recent reports have claimed it may have been falsely inflating the number of paying customers it had. Apple Music had over 20 million subscribers as of last December, while Spotify recently announced it surpassed 50 million paying customers. Sprint acquired a 33 percent stake in Tidal in January, and at the time it said it would give its customers "unlimited access to exclusive artist content not available anywhere else." Under the deal, artists partnering with Tidal will create music that will only be available to the carrier's customers. It's unclear at this point if Sprint's stake in Tidal has anything to do with Jay Z's music being removed from Apple Music or Spotify. Apple and Jay Z's music label Roc Nation did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Universal Music Group deferred comment to Roc Nation.

It’s the one with the card holder icon that you’ve probably buried in a folder of things you never use. The app is perfect for keeping event passes, travel tickets, loyalty cards, and more accessible and ready to display at a moment’s notice. Apple refers to these information cards as “passes.” Today we’ll see how you can add passes to Wallet and what else you can do with them. We’ve covered the Apple Pay aspect of Wallet before How To Use Apple Pay To Buy Things With Your iPhone How To Use Apple Pay To Buy Things With Your iPhone Your iPhone may some day be the only device you need to purchase products and services, but first you need to start using Apple Pay. Read More , so we’ll leave that out in this article. Add a Pass to Wallet Adding a pass to Wallet is easy, but it’s not always obvious how to do so. That’s because the workflow involved is not predictable at times. You’ll see what we mean by that as we explore the three basic ways to add a pass to Wallet. 1. By Scanning a Code From Wallet’s own welcome screen it’s clear that scanning a barcode is one way to add a pass. Tap on the Scan Code link to begin. The catch here is that Wallet identifies codes only from certain brands/stores, but don’t let that bother you. Install Pass2U Wallet (Free) and you can bring even unsupported barcodes into Wallet by first scanning them into Pass2U Wallet. 2. From a Supported App The second option on Wallet’s welcome screen (Find Apps for Wallet) leads you to a list of the top apps that Wallet supports. Install one of these, or any other, Wallet-supported apps and look for the “add to Wallet” option within it. This is the tricky part and you might have to hunt around a bit for that option, because it lives in a different location in each app. As you can see in the screenshot below, different apps have different names for the “add to wallet” button. Tap on that button once you find it and the corresponding pass information will show up in Wallet once you confirm the add request. 3. From a Pass File In the email app on your phone, open a booking confirmation email for a flight or an event and see if it has an attachment with a .PKPASS extension. If it does, tap on that file to download it. You’ll then automatically see a preview of the pass with an Add button at the top right, which allows you to add the pass to Wallet. You can view .PKPASS files on Android as well. You’ll need a passbook app like the ones we have mentioned in the Wallet for Android section below. Rearrange Passes Passes stack up in Wallet in the same order that you add them, with the most recent ones at the top of the stack. It’s helpful to rearrange them in the order you’ll need them, and iOS allows you to do that. Tap, hold, and drop a pass to the right location and it shows up there! If you have trouble activating the drag-and-drop function 4 Useful Drag-and-Drop Mac Data Transfer Apps 4 Useful Drag-and-Drop Mac Data Transfer Apps Forget menus, buttons, and confusing keyboard shortcuts. Try dragging and dropping for a faster workflow. Read More , try holding your finger on the pass for a couple of seconds before you drag it out. If you have, say, booked flight tickets for your family, you’ll get the option to add passes for all of them to Wallet on your phone. These passes stack up as a separate bundle and you can view them one at a time by swiping through them left and right. View, Share, and Delete a Pass Tap on a pass to view its details and once again if you want to return to the pass stack. In the “full” view of a pass, you’ll see the most important details that go with it. For example, for flight ticket passes, you’ll see the flight number, departure and arrival dates and times, passenger name, and so on. When you’re viewing a pass, pay attention to the “i” information icon at the bottom right. Tap on it to reveal extra information, such as seat numbers for travel-related passes. For some passes, you might even see an Automatic Updates switch in the information section. With this switch set to ON — and it is by default — you don’t have to worry about missing updates on flight timings and such. To be on the safe side though, you might want to refresh passes manually when you’re viewing them, especially the time-sensitive ones. It’s as easy as placing your finger at the top of the pass (in the info section) and pulling it down to release. The information section is also where you get the option to share the pass with a friend or a family member. Tap on Share Pass and you’ll see the standard Share menu that you’re used to seeing in most of your iOS apps. Tap on the Remove Pass button to delete a pass from Wallet anytime. Deletion of expired passes isn’t automatic, which is probably a good thing. You’ll have to remove each pass yourself after it’s past its validity. It’s a pity you can’t remove passes in bulk. iPhone needs to be a way to remove the passes from the Wallet app from the past with a single tap. — Shit Jayesh Says (@jayeshb_bot) March 15, 2017 View Passes on the Lock Screen For some passes, besides the share and remove options in the info panel, you’ll find a Suggest on Lock Screen switch. If you enable this option, Wallet reminds you at the right time that a movie, event, trip or similar is coming up by displaying the relevant pass on your lock screen. Useful? Absolutely! Creepy? Yes again. If you’d rather look up passes yourself, you can stop Wallet from suggesting any of them on the lock screen based on location. For this you’ll need to block the app’s access to location services It's Time to Stop Disabling GPS on Your iPhone It's Time to Stop Disabling GPS on Your iPhone Whether it's to conserve battery life or to stop the NSA tracking your every move, it's likely your reasons for crippling your iPhone's ability to locate you aren't justified. Read More . Select the Never option under Settings > Privacy > Location Services > Wallet and you’re all set. In general, leaving your passes accessible on the lock screen is a security risk. There’s no authentication barrier to protect the information they contain. Of course, it’s up to you to decide if certain types of passes are harmless enough to display on the lock screen Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Your iPhone can notify you about just about anything, but left unchecked, this feature can quickly get out of control. Here's how to make notifications useful again. Read More . In any case, for apps with sensitive data, you might want to stop any kind of alerts from showing up on the lock screen. To do this, open up the app’s individual settings from Settings, and under Notifications, set the Show on Lock Screen switch to off. Open Wallet Super Quick If you want quick access to Wallet, you can get it with a double click of the Home button. You’ll first need to ensure that the Double-Click Home Button switch under Settings > Wallet & Apple Pay is set to ON, which it should be by default. On some phones, this setting appears as Wallet under Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Allow Access When Locked. Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the double-click feature to work on my phone (iPhone SE, iOS 10). It turns out other iPhone users have come across this issue as well. Of course, you can also get to Wallet by swiping from left to right on a pass displayed on the lock screen. Mind you, the Home button double-click trick isn’t necessary if you’re using Wallet to pay for something with an Apple Pay card.

Wallet for Android If you also own an Android device and wish Google Play Store had a Wallet-like app or two, you’ll be glad to know that it does. Our top three picks are Wallet, WalletPasses, and PassAndroid Passbook Viewer. Among the Android-based passbook apps, Wallet seems to come closest to its iOS namesake. It’s not associated with Apple in any way though. I *really* wish Android had a feature half as good as Apple's Passbook/Wallet. I've been using my iPod Touch for boarding passes. Sanity! — «rit abides»???? (@rit) November 2, 2015 What’s in Your Wallet? If Apple Pay isn’t available where you live, your Wallet experience might differ from that of someone who lives in an Apple Pay-enabled region. For example, a few Wallet features/settings might be in a different location, or in some cases, missing altogether. I don’t even have a Wallet & Apple Pay section in my iPhone’s settings, but I still think Wallet can be useful for every iPhone user! Have you tried out Wallet or is it one of those unused default iOS apps that sit pretty on your iPhone’s screen? Let us know what you think.

Speaking to a handful of tech journalists a few days ago, Apple said that it’s already working on a brand new Mac Pro design and that a pro version of the iMac is in the works as well. Don't Miss: Sam’s Club has a killer Galaxy S8 deal that’s even better than Best Buy’s “With regards to the Mac Pro,” Phil Schiller said in remarks transcribed by Daring Fireball, “we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro’. We’re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.” With respect to the iMac Pro, Apple was predictably short on details, though Schiller emphasized that the machine will be designed “with the pro customer in mind.” Helping us to fill in some of the blanks, a new blog post from Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors) relays a number of interesting details about Apple’s upcoming iMac Pro, including hardware specs and a launch window. Citing a source purportedly familiar with Apple’s plans, the blog claims that the iMac Pro will be released in late October and will feature a new keyboard design. Incidentally, recently published Apple patents suggest that Apple has plans to bring the Touch Bar it introduced on last year’s MacBook Pro to the iMac. As far as specs are concerned, the iMac Pro will seemingly pack a big punch. Good news folks. I am told, by a little bird, that the next iMac (to be released in late October) will be available with (up to) Intel E3-1285 v6 processor with 16 GB (upgradable to 32 or 64 GB) ECC memory. Faster NVMe SSD’s possibly up to 2 TB and AMD graphics to support VR and Pro apps. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 with… tada… a brand new keyboard. By way of comparison, Apple’s current entry level iMac has 8GB of RAM and can only be configured up to 32GB. Further, Apple opting for ECC memory should help dramatically reduce the incidence of data corruption errors. The tidbit about AMD graphics is also notable given that it’s a rumor we’ve seen floated before. As for other points of interest, Pike’s Universum claims that the “next Mac Mini won’t be so mini” and that Apple, in conjunction with its work on a new Mac Pro, is also working on a brand new 8K display. Apple may have neglected its Mac lineup in recent years, but the good news is that the company seems to fully appreciate, perhaps more now than ever, just how important the Mac is to its users. The iPhone may still be the company’s primary source of revenue, but the Mac has been pulling its own weight in recent years. In fact, Apple saw more money from the Mac last quarter than it did from the iPad.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple People can’t stop talking about Apple’s new Mac Pro, but it might not launch until 2019 Yoni Heisler BGR NewsApril 7, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share For any Mac users who have been patiently waiting for Apple to retire the relatively ancient trashcan Mac Pro, the good news is that a brand new Mac Pro is in the pipeline. The bad news is that it may not see the light of day for quite some time. Citing sources purportedly familiar with Apple’s plans, Thom Holwerda of OS News writes that Apple’s about-face regarding the Mac Pro was a rather recent development. Interestingly enough, Holwerda relays that Apple only opted to throw some engineering resources at developing a brand new Mac Pro due to the tepid response the MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar elicited from creative professionals this past October. Don't Miss: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 As we’ve highlighted previously, many developers and other pro users were quick to label the Touch Bar as a gimmick while simultaneously blasting the MacBook Pro for being overpriced and under powered. A 16GB ceiling on RAM, for example, drew an especially harsh reaction from the Mac community. Holwerda’s writes: Well, after the announcement of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, orders for refurbished “old” MacBook Pros supposedly went through the roof, and after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher. This response to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar took Apple completely by surprise. Combined with the problems surrounding the LG UltraFine 5K display and the constant negativity from professional Apple users, the company decided to double down on professional users. That being the case, Holwerda speculates that a new Mac Pro won’t hit store shelves until late 2018 at the absolute earliest, with a good chance that it may not ship until 2019. This is certainly a plausible scenario given that a) Apple didn’t reveal a shipping window and b) Phil Schiller’s remarks to a group of journalists this week suggests that Apple’s Mac Pro team were instructed to come up with something great as opposed to churning out a new machine as quickly as possible. “With regards to the Mac Pro,” Schiller said, “we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro’. We’re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers.” As part of Apple’s reinvigorated commitment to pro users, the report adds that Apple is also considering expanding the number of available Retina MacBook Pro models for users who don’t want a machine with the company’s newfangled Touch Bar. In one rumored incarnation, Apple is said to be exploring a MacBook Pro design that would be capable of linking up with an iPad Pro to form a “Cintiq-like device.” Trending right now: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Biggest iPhone 8 leak yet offers several surprising new details iPhone 8: Insider outs exciting new features, but says phone is delayed See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Ford brings baby’s car-ride experience to the crib Yahoo Tech A massive asteroid is going to zip past Earth later this month BGR News I drove the electric Chevy Bolt all weekend and only freaked out once Yahoo Tech Don’t throw these sneakers out — you can compost them Yahoo Tech Here’s how I added a 256GB microSD card to my iPhone BGR News How Apple's secrecy can hurt consumers Yahoo Tech Pogue’s Basics: How to speed up YouTube playback with a keystroke Yahoo Tech Biggest iPhone 8 leak yet offers several surprising new details BGR News Robot arms are now teaching each other how to work Yahoo Tech The disruption of workers by robots is about to take a giant leap forward Yahoo Tech Astronomers just discovered something awesome about the most Earth-like planet ever found BGR News Google's new YouTube TV lets you watch cable for $35 a month Yahoo Tech ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Yahoo Tech Google's window-mounted air conditioner could have its own window Digital Trends Obsess over your dog even more with this smart pet door Yahoo Tech
Enter your search terms Submit search form       Home | About Us | Sample Press Release   Press Release Articles | Press Releases and SEO | Press Release Book     Boris Mizhen - Drives the Vision and Motivation from Steve Jobs' Example and Life Lessons   View as PDF  Print View    Boris Mizhen is a New York City-based real estate developer and entrepreneur, whose career launched when he developed a number of online advertising and marketing websites. NEW YORK, NY - April 7, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- Steve Jobs' passion for competition and restless strive to get everything best coupled with his business acumen made him a legend and role model for entrepreneurial success; it also helped him through his meteoric rise that never ceased to amazed millions of his admires in America and around the globe. Incredible success and ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, it is these traits that Boris Mizhen, online entrepreneur and marketing guru, drew his greatest inspiration from. The Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs inspired him to eventually achieve his own technology-related success. "Perhaps what inspired me most about Steve Jobs was his strategic expertise," Mizhen shared. This is a fact that cannot be disputed, as Jobs' greatest strength is widely unknown by the public. At the time of Apple's formation, Jobs was helping facilitate the development and sale of the Apple I computer. While the industry did take notice, it was the Apple II, which Jobs helped develop, that skyrocketed the company to fame and fortune. Boris Mizhen admires the earlier stories about Jobs' enthusiasm and integrity and applies it to his own work ethic when building his business. Mizhen reveals "It is through Jobs' lessons, that I learned technical ability alone won't ensure success in the technology field. The trick is to anticipate what the public wants and know how to provide it." Another trait of Jobs' that Boris Mizhen has adopted is his unique business judgment. "History has shown that although his business decisions would not always result in immediate profits, his willingness to take risks due to a long-term vision resulted in great successes," he notes. Apple's haste to change direction and part ways with Jobs saw the company hit an all time low. However, his return to the company was the catalyst for Apple's accession to the very top of the technology world. "His decision to branch out into developing or improving on software outside the company's original focus not doubt terrified investors and shareholders," Mizhen said. "But we all know the result of that bold business move!" Boris Mizhen has established himself as an authority in marketing strategy, online advertising, digital media, social media and a host of related fields due to the lessons learned from pioneers like Jobs. Mizhen is sure to add that mirroring Jobs' ability to turn dreams into great successes was also reliant on one more trait: forward thinking. "A favorite quote I share with Jobs is by hockey great Wayne Gretzky: 'I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.' I always look ahead to see where the technology and the marketing world will head next and ensure I'll already be there when it arrives!" Boris Mizhen is a New York City-based real estate developer and entrepreneur, whose career launched when he developed a number of online advertising and marketing websites. Born with a strong business instinct, Mizhen learnt at a young age how to use every opportunity to his advantage. In addition to his online companies, Mr. Mizhen also manages numerous real estate properties across the North-East of the United States providing stable housing to families in different regions. He enjoys spending his extra time and energy by contributing to charities and organizations that offer help to those who need it most. By pursuing his passion in philanthropic causes, Boris Mizhen remains passionately involved with social activism across the world.

The construction site at University Village, adjacent to the current Apple store. (GeekWire Photo / Nat Levy) There is a huge construction pit in the middle of the upscale University Village mall in Seattle, and no one seems exactly sure what’s happening there. So we did some digging, and here’s what we found: permit documents show that Apple is building out a larger store on the site, adjacent to its current store location. Apple’s name, address and phone number appear on documents filed with the city of Seattle in recent months for a project called “Village Green.” Additionally, Ben Shim, who manages Apple retail store development, according to his LinkedIn, sat in on meetings about the project last year and is listed as the tenant, documents show. The retail building will be just shy of 10,000 square feet and take up the majority of the site. Blueprints show the building will be just across a narrow road from the mall’s Microsoft Store. Project documents depict a single-story building with a basement area. A cross-section of the proposed store. (Foster + Partners Rendering Via Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections. Click for larger image.) Apple and University Village officials either declined to comment or did not respond to our requests. It is unclear when the new building will open. The site was walled off this week and construction workers there didn’t have much to say about it. Another big question is what will happen to Apple’s current retail location in the mall. The Apple store in San Francisco. (Foster + Partners Photo) Apple last year unveiled the latest evolution of its store design in San Francisco. The two-story store features 42-by-40-foot sliding glass doors that allow the store to become part of the outdoor space. Apple said at the time that this model would be the company’s new design aesthetic going forward. It is unclear how similar the design would be to the San Francisco store, but an architect listed on documents for the Seattle project — Foster + Partners — designed the San Francisco location. Apple opened the University Village location in 2003, approximately two years after the company opened its first brick and mortar locations. In 2011, Apple revamped the store, though it stayed the same size. The mall has in recent years become a hub for tech companies opening brick and mortar stores. It started with Apple, and then Microsoft opened its store in the mall in 2011. In 2015, Amazon made University Village the home of its first physical bookstore. The online retail giant is now building or planning 10 locations, including one at the Bellevue Square Mall, where Apple and Microsoft also have stores.

This confirms a report earlier this week suggesting there would be delays related to not only the 3D sensors but also OLED screen lamination, but White adds that his contact was “emphatic about the delay,” but that it’s still early enough in the year that the situation could improve. White is currently in Taiwan gathering information from Apple’[s supply chain, and based the report on information from a “smartphone contact” that is “diligently following the supply chain data points,” adding more credibility to the prediction. Other reports have also suggested manufacturing delays for the more advanced model due to the amount of new technology Apple is pushing into it, but some analysts have suggested that it may be simply a matter of extremely limited stock being available for initial orders, similar to the release of the Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus last fall, while others have suggested that Apple may not even release the new model until it’s ready to ship in October or November.

By Emily Bary April 7, 2017 1:34 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple’s Clips app, launched Thursday, gives iPhone users a new way to make and share creative videos. Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphoto When Apple announced that it would be rolling out Clips, a cheeky video-editing app, we were skeptical. There’s no shortage of ways to build short, fun videos on the iPhone these days. The catch is how to share them. Clips doesn’t work natively with Snap. Apple surely hopes users will turn to iMessage for sharing, instead. Clips arrived in the App Store on Thursday, and we’ve been using it since. It’s not the most intuitive app, but it’s surprisingly fun. We still question whether anyone will choose Clips over the video options in Snap and Instagram.

Clips feels a bit like a relic in that it takes an iMovie-like approach to creating stories. Your videos get added to a reel, which becomes the final product. The upside is the ability to combine moments, but it adds complexity, compared to Snap, which is all about quick hits. You can also customize the amount of time that photos appear on screen, but it’s not that obvious. While most buttons aren’t labeled, we quickly figured out how to add filters, emojis, and music. We liked some of the fun filters -- including one that made us look like comic book characters -- and wish there were more. Same goes for the emoji selection, which was limited. There is a lot of canned music to choose from, though. The best part of the app is “Live Titles,” which automatically turns your voice narration into captions. The captions appeared as we spoke, and the app understood us perfectly, though it is possible to edit the text if there’s a transcription error. To use one of Apple’s favorite phrases, it’s a bit magical. Unfortunately, Clips’ complexity elsewhere overshadows the cool caption trick. Clips is a standalone app available in the Apple App Store. Apple might have boosted usage if it was embedded in the native Camera app. We wouldn’t be surprised to see that integration in the next iOS update.

Big Sean – ‘Down (Remix)’ Marian Hill’s “Down” has already been featured in an Apple commercial. Now, the Philadelphia-based duo’s piano-laden hit gets a remix from Big Sean. In a near whisper, the Detroit spitter explains his stance on infidelity during his show-stopping verse. “Good guy, but for you, I’ll do the felonies,” raps Sean Don over the mesmerizing beat. “If you never test me, I’ll never cheat / I got enough faith to be faithful to you / If you not around, I’ll still save it for you.” The aforementioned Apple ad, which features acclaimed dancer Lil Buck, helped Marian Hill become the most Shazam’d duo in the country. “That was really, really cool,” singer Samantha Gongol told Rolling Stone. “It’s just so beautiful — they nailed our aesthetic. Apple’s an iconic brand. We grew up watching those commercials. And [knowing that] artists have had incredible careers after [being featured in Apple ads] was really exciting to me.” “Down,” which has been unofficially remixed by CyHi The Prynce, first appeared on MH’s Act One LP in 2016. But today, the group that also includes Jeremy Lloyd, released Act One (The Complete Collection) with new material, including their Big Sean collaboration and appearances by Steve Davit and Fifth Harmony’s Lauren Jauregui.

Apple currently only uses the Smart Connector on the iPad Pro line… Sony A6500 This isn’t the first time Apple’s Smart Connector has been rumored for an upcoming iPhone. Prior to the iPhone 7 debut last year, leaks showed versions of the iPhone 7 Plus ahead of its introduction with the Smart Connector placed on the back. While the overall design was accurate including the dual camera layout, the Smart Connector remains an iPad-only connection. Separately, wireless charging has been rumored to come to the iPhone this fall, although inductive wireless charging in the same style as the Apple Watch may be disappointing. Still, it’s plausible as you can already use inductive wireless charging to power the iPad Pro using the Smart Connector and Logitech Base. The Verifier believes Apple will also use the Smart Connector for augmented/virtual reality accessories in some way too. The report also claims new Apple TV hardware and AirPlay will have a role in Apple’s VR/AR vision. For what it’s worth, the report comes from a website with other claims that have not yet been tested including iOS 11 including group FaceTime and enhanced Siri features like iMessage integration. Aside from today’s claim, Smart Connector has not been rumored for this iPhone cycle. What we are expecting includes a new larger edge-to-edge display in the body of the iPhone 7, an OLED panel like the Apple Watch, stronger waterproofing and enhanced cameras.

Weekly Roundup: Apple to reset the Mac Pro, Tesla most valuable U.S. automaker Posted 12 hours ago by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story U.S. Government drops its demand to reveal Twitter user’s identity Apple reveals that it will be resetting its approach with the Mac Pro, the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit moves forward and Tesla surpasses GM to become the most valuable U.S. automaker. Here are the top stories of the week, and you can also receive this post as the Weekly Roundup newsletter. 1. At a small event addressing a group of reporters, Apple revealed that it is pushing the reset button on the desktop Mac Pro system entirely. Apple Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller shared some numbers he says are meaningful to Apple. The Mac user base is nearing 100 million users. As a business, it’s also nearing a $25 billion run rate. Apple now ships computers at a ratio of 80 percent notebooks to 20 percent desktop computers, a stat they haven’t updated the public on in some time. Here’s a transcript of the entire conversation.  2. Google and its self-driving technology unit Waymo, is suing Uber and Otto. Waymo says that Uber “misappropriated” its trade secrets, and infringed upon its held patents. Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the crux of the issue, pled the fifth in the case, and Uber has admitted in court filings that it still uses commercially available LiDAR systems in its self-driving vehicles because its in-house tech isn’t ready for the road. Here’s a timeline of the events in the Waymo v. Uber lawsuit.  3. Less than 24 hours after news broke that Twitter was suing the federal government to protect the privacy of the person or persons behind a popular “rogue” anti-Trump account, the government backed off. In a filing, Twitter dropped its charges against the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection after the government withdrew its request to the company. 4. Verizon’s long-awaited Yahoo acquisition has a name, and it’s Oath. The rebranding effort combines AOL and Yahoo’s media brands and, well, it could be worse. (Disclosure: AOL, which owns TechCrunch, is owned by Verizon.) 5. YouTube’s new live TV streaming service went live. YouTube TV takes a bunch of the more popular U.S. cable channels — ABC, Fox, CBS, NBC, CW, Disney, SyFy, ESPN and 40+ more — and crams them into one app. It’ll cost $35 a month, which gives you access to Live on up to six accounts with up to three devices streaming simultaneously.  6. Tesla was trading up again this week, and for the first time became the most valuable U.S. automaker as measured by the stock market’s standards — surpassing Ford and GM. 7. Amazon has overtaken Twitter with a better NFL streaming deal. Amazon has reportedly reached a one-year deal with the NFL to stream 10 Thursday Night Football games this year. The deal is valued at around $50 million. Users will have to be Amazon Prime members in order to watch live. 8. Apple launched Clips, a super simple social video editing app. The standout feature is probably Live Titles. Using voice to tech technology, the app is able to add captions to video in real time in eight different text styles. It utilizes iOS Dictation and requires an internet connection to work. 9. Amazon launched Amazon Cash, a new offering that lets you make purchases on its site without a bank card. The service allows consumers to add cash to their Amazon.com balance by showing a barcode at a participating retailer, then having the cash applied immediately to their online Amazon account.  10. Grab, Uber’s biggest rival in Southeast Asia, has completed its first major acquisition after it bought up an Indonesian startup called Kudo. The reasoning behind the acquisition, said to be valued between $80-100 million, is to boost Grab’s mobile payments platform. 11. A new report has found that Android now accounts for a larger share of internet usage than Windows for the first time.  0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report YouTube now blocking ads on low-view channels | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories YouTube now blocking ads on low-view channels | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:41 | Crunch Report Okta pops as Wall Street continues to take a shine to the enterprise 9 hours ago | Alex Wilhelm, Ron Miller Adidas’ latest 3D-printed shoe puts mass production within sight 11 hours ago | Fitz Tepper Uber denies Waymo theft claims on grounds it never used custom LiDAR 14 hours ago | Kate Conger Will Spotify go public without an IPO? 23 hours ago | Katie Roof Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | YouTube now blocking ads on low-view channels 4 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Stripe’s Patrick Collison says no to an IPO any time soon 7 hours ago | Connie Loizos An afternoon with Avegant’s prototype light field display headset 8 hours ago | Lucas Matney Google DeepMind open sources Sonnet so you can build neural networks in TensorFlow even quicker 8 hours ago | John Mannes Comment moderation powered by Up Next U.S. Government drops its demand to reveal Twitter user’s identity Posted 13 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Technical Instructor, JavaScript, React.Js at CodePath (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Data Engineer @ The Meet Group at The Meet Group (San Francisco, CA, United States) Site Reliability Engineer @ Sift Science at Sift Science (San Francisco, CA, United States) CEO.

White said pre-orders for the iPhone 8 are still expected in September, but deliveries might not start until “several weeks later.” Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple Will Reportedly Include True Tone Displays For 2017's iPhone Lineup Citing a contact following the supply chain data points, White wrote the iPhone 8 possible shipping delay is due to challenges concerning the device’s expected 3D sensing technology. “This is not the first time that we've heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone,” wrote White. “However, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously.” White said the contact expects customers will be able to get their hands on the new iPhone in time for the December holidays. He also pointed out “it is only April” and the “situation could improve.” White’s predictions come after a research note by Barclay’s analysts revealed last month said Apple could release the iPhone 8 in limited quantities. The analysts said the majority of iPhone 8 units may not be available until after the fourth quarter. Like White, Barclay’s also said shipping estimates could fall back by several weeks just minutes after pre-orders take off. Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple Reportedly Places Order For 70 Million OLED Panels From Samsung The new iPhone is rumored to come with 3D front-sensing camera -- and other reports also suggest that feature is the reason for possible delays. Last month, a report said STMicroelectronics would make sensors for the front 3D camera, and components being produced by its factory in Crolles, France would not be ready for September, potentially causing a delayed release date. However, White’s and Barclay’s research notes point to a September launch. The iPhone 8, which could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition, is expected to be revealed alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. The iPhone 8 is rumored to come with an OLED screen display, while the two other phones are expected to keep the LCD displays.

The Saturday Night Live spot will promote Apple products, but it's not yet clear what kind of content the show will create for Apple. Saturday Night Live is also working with Verizon and plans to create a spot for the carrier, which will be written by "Weekend Update" anchor Colin Jost and will star Kenan Thompson. Apple's ad "will look different" than the Verizon ad, according to Variety. Apple has struck a deal with NBC to have "Saturday Night Live" create commercial content slated to appear in a few weeks' time. The show's work for the large consumer-electronics company will look different than its Verizon efforts, according to two people familiar with the situation. Apple did not respond to queries seeking comment. Saturday Night Live is teaming up with brands like Verizon and Apple to create custom content in the hopes of making the show both more appealing to advertisers and more compelling to watch live. The show has been seeing a surge of popularity in the months following the U.S. presidential election, thanks in large part to Alec Baldwin's role as Donald Trump. Teaming up with Saturday Night Live will be new territory for Apple. Most of the company's ads are made in house or through longtime ad agency partners. The Verizon Saturday Night Live spot will air on April 8th and April 15th, while Apple's ad spot will come somewhat later in the month or in early May.Tags: Apple ads, SNL Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Entertainment - 2 weeks ago< > Embed Alec Baldwin Fell In Love With Tina Fey 00:33 Alec Baldwin is Tina Fey's number one fan.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5 and we plan to publish our thoughts on the iPhone 6s and iPad iOS 10.3 updates in the near future. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about your new iOS update. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 You also have another option at your disposal. If you think it might improve performance, you can try dropping back down to an older version of iOS 10. At the moment, you’ve got two options: iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward but you’ll want to put away at least 20-30 minutes to get it done. The iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3 downgrades will only be open for a limited time. At some point, Apple will close up them up permanently. Once Apple stops signing on iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3, you’ll be stuck on iOS 10.3 with any problems you might have. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 6 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

A security expert who has analysed samples of compromised data has concluded that the threat – such as it is – only exposes a small number of accounts to potential credential-stuffing attacks. The self-styled Turkish Crime Family – the group behind the supposed pwnage – have withdrawn into silence save for a enigmatic tweet from an affiliated account threatening something might go down at 2030 BST tonight. Requests by El Reg to coax a hint of what that might be have been met with silence so far. The group emerged last month claiming to have gained access to 300 million iCloud and Apple email accounts, threatening to delete account contents and remotely wipe Apple devices unless Apple paid a ransom. Little by way of proof was disclosed publicly to substantiate these claims. The hackers later put it about that they were planning to offer a IMEI and appleid lookup service based on the compromised data, charging $10 a pop. Troy Hunt – the security researchers behind haveibeenpwned.com (HIBP) – has analysed a sample of 69,000 compromised records via security reporter Zack Whittaker. Eliminating duplicates brings the list down to 53,000. More than 98 per cent of the email addresses had featured in earlier data breaches loaded into HIBP, implying that the data set had come from existing breaches. 77 per cent of the unique email addresses in the Apple data came from the Evony breach. A further 3,243 email addresses not already found in the Evony data matched perfectly to accounts in the Last.FM breach. The chances of this happening from a random sample taken from hundreds of millions of breached records is minute, allowing Hunt to infer that the supposed multimillion record compromise is nothing of the sort. "The list of Apple accounts is not hundreds of millions, it is instead less than 53k and it's compromised predominantly of accounts from the Evony data breach and a small handful of others," Hunt concludes in a blog post. Rather than hundreds of millions of Apple accounts being reset and iPhones wiped today, it's those from a sample of 53,000 records who have reused previously compromised passwords with their iCloud account who are at risk, and even then only if they haven't changed their Apple login credentials recently. "Now, that's not to say there's no risk at hand here, but rather that the risk is no different to the one we're faced after every data breach: a bunch of people have reused their passwords and they're now going to have other accounts pwned as a result," Hunt explained. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register Security slip-ups in 1Password and other password managers 'extremely worrying' Everything's fine now.

Credit: Screenshot of Flappy Bird Vietnam-based dotGears Studios’ smash-hit mobile game, Flappy Bird, has taken flight, seemingly with no plans to return. For nearly a month, Flappy Bird has perched at the top of both the Apple and Android app stores, soaring to the position of “No. 1 Free Game” on both online application markets because of its explosive popularity. Yet following a Tweet from the game’s developer, Dong Nguyen, at 2:02 p.m. from his account @dongatory Saturday, the game was yanked from both the iOS and Android stores, prohibiting all future downloads. “I am sorry Flappy Bird users, 22 hours from now, I will take Flappy Bird down. I cannot take this anymore,” Nguyen tweeted. As of Sunday evening, any searches for Flappy Bird in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store resulted in messages stating the application could not be found, or it reveals games that imitate Flappy Bird but are not the original application. The rationale to remove the game followed a previous Tweet by Nguyen, in which the Flappy Bird developer condemned the game’s increased presence in popular culture. “Press people are overrating the success of my games. It is something I never want. Please give me peace,” he wrote Tuesday at 12:36 p.m. According to an interview with Nguyen conducted by The Verge, Flappy Bird was originally launched in May 2013 and developed out of code written by Nguyen after work. Since then, the game had been downloaded “50 million times, and has accumulated over 47,000 reviews in the App Store,” as reported by The Verge Feb. 5. The game boasted a simplistic design, featuring a bright yellow bird that navigated through a maze of green pipes of varying heights. The graphics of Flappy Bird were reminiscent of the “retro pixelated games in (gaming’s) golden age,” according to a description from the dotGears Studios website. “Everything is pure, extremely hard and incredibly fun to play,” the website says. Players controlled the bird’s movement by tapping the screen of their mobile phones and tablets. The object of the game was to coax the bird through as many gaps between green pipes as possible. If a player miscalculated the height needed to shoot the gap, the bird would hit the pipes and the game would be over. The dotGears Studios website shows the logos for four of the developer’s other games, including Shuriken Block and Ninjas Assault. Flappy Bird is not mentioned on the website. Many Ohio State students said that although the Flappy Bird game design was simple, it was hard to master. “It is really addictive because it’s kind of hard to start playing and get used to what you have to do,” said Emily Rodgers, a first-year student in romance studies and anthropology. “Then you just get so aggravated, like you have to make sure you keep going and keep beating your high score and get as high as you possibly can.” Rodgers said she spends about 15 minutes per day playing the game and her highest score to date is an 87. Rachel DeLucia, a third-year in criminology, said Sunday she downloaded Flappy Bird about two weeks ago. “It’s really addicting, it’s a good way to kill time, but then it kind of starts to kill a lot of time,” she said. “You’re always trying to beat your record, but then it gets frustrating, and it’s kind of just like an endless cycle.” DeLucia said she thinks the developer’s decision to remove the game might be for the better, as the game might be viewed as a distraction. “I think it’s honest-to-goodness ruining lives,” she said. “It is taking up a lot of my life. I play it in class and things like that, so the developer should probably get rid of the game. I think that’s a good idea.” According to The Verge, Flappy Bird was earning an average of $50,000 a day, a profit made from in-app ads. In the wake of Nguyen’s decision to remove the game from the app stores, many theories have surfaced in an attempt to explain the developer’s actions. “There are a couple different speculations about it,” said Mike Letscher, a first-year in computer science and engineering. “One of them being he just can’t handle the publicity. The other reason that I’ve heard is that it could be kind of a PR stunt for his next game … He decided to take it down in order to use this publicity to make his next game a hit instead.” Josh Grile-Nielsen, a first-year in finance, agreed that the game’s removal could be an attempt to drum up publicity. “Personally, I think it is just a big publicity stunt … I mean, this might shine light on his other games,” he said. Grile-Nielsen said he “only plays (Flappy Bird) a couple times a week,” but the news of the game’s discontinuation was “surprising.” “This is not heartbreaking for me, I’m not destroyed by it,” he said. “(But) he was making so much money and it’s such a popular game, a bunch of people played it.” Within minutes of the initial Tweet announcing the imminent retirement of Flappy Bird, rumors began circulating saying the decision to remove the game was because of legal issues. In response to this speculation, Nguyen tweeted, “It is not anything related to legal issues. I just cannot keep it anymore.” While Flappy Bird can no longer be found in any app store, the application can still be played by users who downloaded the game before its removal. android apps dong nguyen flappy bird iphone apps phone games 2014-02-09 Daniel Bendtsen tweet Previous: Opinion: Valentino PR move insensitive to Philip Seymour Hoffman Next: ‘Game of Thrones’ conference reigns over Ohio State Related Posts Opinion: Can we all just agree to uninstall Flappy Bird already?

One of the most pervasive, however, is pollution. Over the past few decades, the world has become infested with waste, gases and substances that pose a grave risk to life and this planet. According to Pure Earth, toxic pollution affects more than 200 million people worldwide, and millions of people die annually as a result of this. The fact is, pollution of this kind is entirely manmade. Industrialisation has seen the world become increasingly less green, and there's been a lack of response from governments and other important decision-makers. That said, more and more people are identifying the threats posed here. You only have to look at 2015 Paris Agreement, which was signed by more than 190 countries to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, there's still a long way to go, and there's a general consensus that businesses should do more to see change made. The technology industry has prestige in economies all across the globe, responsible for a large chunk of the world's manufacturing efforts and it's beginning to be proactive towards the topic of pollution. Tech giants like Google and Apple have already made stark commitments to become more environmentally friendly, and many other firms are also looking to kickstart change. Greener tech giants Over the years, many of the world's biggest tech companies have come under scrutiny for the negative impact they're having on the environment. Apple happens to be one of them. In 2011, Chinese environmental groups accused the firm of working with environmentally unfriendly manufacturers which were disposing of harmful pollutants inappropriately. Apple's response was predictable, with it claiming that these accusations were untrue at the time. Since then,though, it's begun to change the way it manufactures goods in a bid to become a greener company. In 2015, it launched a programme to help partners reduce their energy use, power their facilities using renewable power sources and build more environmentally conscious products. Many of the initiatives Apple has announced since then have been focused on China, mainly because its products are manufactured there. The company's already building solar facilities in the country capable of generating a combined 200 megawatts of energy, including a 170-megawatt facility in Mongolia. According to the firm, these actions will help it offset its manufacturing emissions and in the foreseeable future, it hopes to be running off 100% renewable energy. Google has made similar commitments. In December 2016, the search giant announced plans for its data centres and offices to be powered by renewable energy from 2017. It's already the world's biggest corporate purchaser of renewable energy, with more than 40% of its power coming from green resources. Turning to science There's increasing pressure on companies to do more to help tackle climate change, and IT services and consulting company Capgemini is one example of the companies rising to this challenge. Its UK operation recently announced a new science-based target to cut carbon emissions by 20% per employee by 2020, growing to 40% by 2030. Capgemini UK has become the first IT services provider to publish an actionable report backed by leading scientists and it's one of only 28 worldwide companies to have targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. The latter is an organisation that works with companies to set emission reduction targets that coincide with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep temperatures below the 2ºC threshold. James Robey, global head of corporate sustainability at Capgemini, says sustainability is an important part of the company and that it's managed to cut carbon emissions by 21 per cent since 2008. However, he thinks the company can do a lot more. "As a global technology, consulting and outsourcing services company, Capgemini is committed to enabling a positive future for all," he tells IT Pro. "Our Positive Planet programme forms part of this commitment, aiming to reduce our environmental impact, while working to enable our clients, suppliers and people to do the same. We've reduced carbon emissions by 21% since 2008, a figure we aim to cut by a further 20% by 2020, focusing on reducing our travel emissions and energy use." Capgemini isn't just making big claims for marketing purposes. It's actually out there pushing for change. For instance, it's helped set up an initiative to promote sustainability worldwide and it owns one of the world's most sustainable data centres. "Our greatest opportunity for sustainability lies in the digital solutions we deliver to our clients through the development of new technologies. We're a founding member of the Net Positive group and have committed to reducing three times as much carbon emissions in our ecosystem as we generate through our own operations," adds Robey. "Our Merlin data centre, for example, is one illustration of the innovations we have employed. It's recognised as one of the most sustainable in the world, powered by renewable energy and constructed on a brownfield site with 95% recyclable materials. Projects such as this and TravelWell, our award winning holistic approach to reducing travel emissions, demonstrate our commitment to addressing sustainability issues for our clients and business." Giving tech a new lease of life Manufacturing electrical items isn't only an expensive process, but it can also have a negative impact on the environment and, of course, devices only last for so long; once a piece of tech has reached the end of its life, it's normally rendered useless and sent to the landfill. That's never a good thing, but 3 Step IT UK is looking to make things right. The company is supporting the circular economy - an industrial concept that promotes sustainable resource productivity - through IT lifestyle management. Instead of seeing devices sent to landfill, it refurbishes them so they have a new lease of life. This initiative was recently commended by Business Green as IT Project of the Year. Jason Skidmore, CEO of the firm, believes that all tech can be refurbished or used as parts for new products. "To manufacture just one computer and monitor takes roughly 530lb (240kg) of fossil fuel, 48lb (21.8kg) of chemicals, and 1.5 tonnes of water. Despite this resource hungry process, the United Nations estimate that we discard 20-50 million metric tonnes of e-waste every year," he explains. "While there is no doubt that more needs to be done to recycle IT hardware responsibly, it's also vital that we extract as much value as possible before sending equipment to its grave. 3 Step IT is a firm believer that one man's trash, is another man's gold and its business model is designed to ensure that IT equipment remains in circulation for as long as it's useful." The company has so far refurbished more than 300,000 devices and it hopes to continue on this journey over the next few years. "By refurbishing and remarketing over 95% of the devices that its clients return, it ensures that equipment is reused, rather than recycled. In 2016, 3 Step IT handled 360,000 devices and its programme was highly commended by BusinessGreen in the 'IT Project of the Year' category," he continues. Technology plays a huge role in modern society and life would probably feel odd without devices such as smartphones, tablets and computers. But the fact is, as an industry, technology has been somewhat unsustainable in the past. Luckily, companies are beginning to see the threats posed by pollution and are putting mechanisms in place to help create a greener planet.

In one of the show’s coming broadcasts, that won’t be the case. Viewers who stick around during the ads either during the April 8th or the April 15th broadcast of NBC’s late-night institution will glimpse a spot for Verizon written by “Weekend Update” anchor Colin Jost and featuring cast member Kenan Thompson. The bespoke pitch is part of an ongoing effort by NBC and Lorne Michaels’ hardworking crew of satirists to make the show more compelling to watch live, rather than catching up via clips next morning. “Everyone is struggling now in a world where there is so much media,” Michaels told Variety. “We are all competing for sponsors, and everything is being reinvented. ‘SNL’ has been reinventing itself from season two.” “Saturday Night Live” is having what may be its most talked-about season since it first came on the air in the fall of 1975, owing to the show’s ongoing lampoon of President Trump and his administration, breakout performances by cast members like Kate McKinnon and Beck Bennett and a recurring, headline-making performance by actor Alec Baldwin as POTUS himself. But NBC’s move to make the show more appealing to advertisers comes as Madison Avenue is working more intensely to drape late-night TV in commercial messages. “Comedy is a big force in the culture, and I don’t think there’s a lot of over thinking about doing commercials as there was in the late ’60s and early 70s,” Michaels said. “When I grew up, it was like Jack Benny for Jell-O or Bob Hope for Chrysler or Texaco Star Theatre.” Much of that sort of thing has surfaced in wee-hours TV. Amazon sponsored a week-long trip that NBC’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” took to Washington, D.C., last year. CBS’ “Late Late Show” managed to package both Coca-Cola and McDonald’s into a single segment of host James Corden’s signature “Carpool Karaoke” segment. Jimmy Fallon has worked General Electric and Ford into segments on his “Tonight Show.” And Apple hawked its new streaming-music service with a bottom-of-the-screen banner during a performance by Ryan Adams on Comedy Central’s “Daily Show.” “SNL” cast member Cecily Strong appeared in a 2014 commercial for Jeep that showed her using the car to prepare a sketch on the show, as part of a broader ad pact with NBCUniversal. Apple has struck a deal with NBC to have “Saturday Night Live” create commercial content slated to appear in a few weeks’ time. The show’s work for the large consumer-electronics company will look different than its Verizon efforts, according to two people familiar with the situation.  Apple did not respond to queries seeking comment. Related CBS Moves Fast to Win New Ads for James Corden, Stephen Colbert “Many brands want to be part of the cultural conversation,” and late-night shows that explore and lampoon the headlines make the task easy to accomplish, said Shannon Pruitt, president of The Story Lab, an ad agency owned by Dentsu Aegis that tries to weave advertisers into programming. When the shows work with an advertiser, she said, “they really go all in, and they make it their own.” The process can be tricky. Give an advertiser too much of a spotlight, and the show veers away from its main goal. And yet, advertiser support can help boost production quality. “I think that it’s terrain that everyone is trying to figure out,” Samantha Bee told Variety last year, a few weeks after streaming pre-show activity for her TBS program, “Full Frontal,” on Facebook in an effort sponsored by AT&T. “It would have to feel awfully organic to us, for sure. Otherwise, we would resist it strenuously.” Advertisers have been increasing their focus on late-night for years. For the past three seasons, ad-rate increases at late-night programs have been among the steepest on TV. “What we noticed at that hour once Jimmy Fallon took over ‘The Tonight Show‘ is that the numbers exploded,” said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal. “When you really dig down and look at the audiences, they are younger. They are more upscale. They have really become quite a surrogate for primetime.” The cost of a 30-second spot in “Saturday Night Live,” which is enjoying its highest-rated season in more than two decades, soared 43.5% in February, to $110,000, according to Standard Media Index, a tracker of ad expenditures, compared with $76,900 in the year-earlier period. The show captures around $115 million in advertising each year, according to Kantar Media. The show’s politically charged comedy is generating tons of notice. “We wanted to make sure we got it right,” Michaels said. “We are doing what we always do, but the difference is that everyone is paying attention,” he added. Marketers see ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, CBS’ Stephen Colbert and the rest as good conduits for younger viewers, who have become more difficult to attract with scripted dramas and comedies (where inserting a pitch can be difficult if the show’s storyline doesn’t lend itself to the product in question). And this new generation of late-night hosts isn’t as finicky about working with sponsors than previous kingpins. David Letterman, for one, was known to be less-than-eager about the idea. Teaming up with “Saturday Night Live” takes stick-to-itiveness. Michaels acknowledged that he moved very deliberately in considering how to work with sponsors. “Linda has a very welcoming attitude toward advertisers, and I am less welcoming in the sense that the integrity of the show is really all that matters to me,” he said. He does not think ads should appear during program time. “SNL” episodes typically contain several satirical commercials as well as references to actual brands. The show’s March 12 broadcast, for example, nodded to Olive Garden and Subway. “You can’t make fun of it, and be with it” simultaneously, Michaels explained. “But we have managed to find a model we all think works, and we will see.” Both Michaels and Yaccarino said they expect “SNL” to continue working with advertisers in unique ways. “SNL” producers agreed to test making commercials after Michaels approached NBCUniversal’s ad-sales staff last year with an interesting request: Could NBC cut some of the ads in the show so as to make the linear viewing experience more pleasant? “I compared where we were in the ’70s in terms of commercial load to where we were last year. I just thought we were at a point where we were making it harder and harder to see the show live,” Michaels said. “People can DVR and scroll through the commercials and watch it the next morning, but we want them to watch it as an event show. And in exchange for losing three minutes of commercials, which makes the show go much faster, we sort of made an agreement that we would be open to working with advertisers.” Media buyers and ad executives say “SNL” producers worked methodically, even mulling the types of products and brands they thought would be appropriate for the show. Last summer, as TV’s “upfront” ad-sales market wound down, buyers indicated NBC was offering everything from the chance to work with the show’s cast and writers to the prospect of tapping former “SNL” stars to reprise favorite characters from years past. There was chatter of the show doing as many as five or six different ads this season. But Yaccarino cautioned that “SNL” would not be producing ads en masse. “You can’t put something like this into a factory and churn it out,’ she said. “The art takes a while.” State Farm is one of “SNL” biggest sponsors, and has run commercials featuring former cast members Kevin Nealon and Dana Carvey reprising their “Hans and Franz” characters. But Edward Gold, State Farm’s advertising director, said in an interview last year while exploring the idea of taking part in the “SNL” offer that some marketers might be cautious. “You are absolutely giving up some control of your brand when you are working with these guys, because they are comedians, and they believe they know what works best in their show,” Gold said. Verizon executives were on hand when the crew shot the company’s ad, Michaels said. “It was not our goal to do something they would not like, but it had to be funny, or at least in the same tone of what we do,” he said. Verizon was not able to make an executive available for comment, but the advertiser  achieved memorable results in another Michaels-produced NBC show. In a 2006 episode of “30 Rock,” Tina Fey’s character Liz Lemon — as part of a paid placement — talked about how much she loved products made by Verizon Wireless, then turned to the camera and said, “Can we have our money now?” This will not mark the first time “Saturday Night Live” has dipped a toe in these waters. During the program’s first season, Michaels recalled, the show ran live ads for Polaroid cameras during certain commercial breaks. Candice Bergen, an early host, was a spokeswoman for the camera company. “The big complaint was that if I put them in the middle of commercial breaks, they had to watch the commercials,” he said. “We didn’t want to stop the show to do it.” Chevy Chase was among the cast members who took part. And “SNL” tested the idea again in 2009, when the show created three sketches based on a long-running spoof of “MacGyver” called “MacGruber” that were actually commercials for Pepsi. The spots appeared in ad breaks supporting a January “SNL” broadcast, and one of them showed up in NBC’s broadcast a day later of Super Bowl XLIII. In that same year, “SNL” allowed Anheuser Busch InBev to purchase all the national ad time surrounding the program to hawk a brew called Bud Light Golden Wheat. In exchange, the beer-maker sponsored a series of never-before-aired comedy segments from the show’s rehearsals during commercial breaks. More cast members seem to be turning up in ads as well. Leslie Jones has appeared in an ad for Allstate. McKinnon did a series of ads for Ford. Bobby Moynihan recently showed up in a spot for Pizza Hut. And Michael Che has accompanied Fey in an American Express commercial. When David Spade did an ad for 1-800-COLLECT in the mid-1990s while still on the show, it was surprising. These days, commercials with “SNL” talent seem more commonplace. “I don’t like it, but if someone is going to be well paid and it’s not next to us in the show, then I’m OK,” said Michaels. At the heart of things, Michael said, is a desire to find more ways to keep broadcast TV working and drawing a sizable audience at a time when consumers can find video entertainment on a number of different screens. “The audience has gotten smaller for commercial television, broadcast television, but I am, as you know, a huge fan of and believe deeply in broadcast television. We are on in all 50 states, and without us, a lot of people would not see this kind of material,” Michaels said. “That thing that pays for it are commercials, and I don’t really see it as any kind of a moral crisis.” On a coming Saturday night, viewers are more likely to be surprised and curious than outraged.

RS says: April 7, 2017 at 12:56 pm Not sure how this will draw more eyebals to the live broadcast. Just as people watch the best sketches online the next day, they’ll watch these new commercials, too. SNL is definitely on a hot streak this season, for obvious reasons, but there’s still a fair amount of chaff amonst the wheat. Reply Report comment Practical Voice in the Hollywood Wilderness says: April 7, 2017 at 11:02 am Did anyone notice the two times Leslie Jones did product placement on SNL? I wonder if she got in trouble for that. The first was she put on her Oakley shades in the “Oopsie Doopsie” sketch with Emily Blunt and mentioned the brand, and the second was during a curtain call she turned around and she had an advertiser’s name on the back of her jacket. She pointed to it. It really stuck out to me but I never saw any mention of it in the press.

Back in June 2016 Apple left the standalone display market, discontinuing sales of its Thunderbolt Display. However, the company appears to have made a u-turn, confirming in April 2017 that it has plans to make a new standalone display to go with the new Mac Pro it is currently developing. The revelation came when three Apple execs were speaking about the company's plans for the Mac Pro. It was revealed that a new display is in the works at Apple, expected to ship in 2018. Apple's head of marketing Phil Schiller said: "As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a pro display as well." In this article we will assess when Apple is likely to start to sell this new standalone display; whether this display is likely to be 5K like the iMacs, or even 8K; and how much it's likely to cost. You might also be interested in reading about How to connect two screens to a Mac and Best screens for Mac. When will Apple launch a new standalone display? It's been a very long time since Apple launched the Thunderbolt Display. The Apple 27in Thunderbolt Display first went on sale in July 2011. It offered what would now be considered a poor 2560 x 1440 resolution that can't even match the 2560 x 1600 of the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro, and is dwarfed by the 5K iMac's 5120 x 2880. We've been hoping for some years now that the company would update its monitors. Sources predicted that a new Apple external 5K monitor, complete with integrated GPU, would be unveiled at WWDC 2016, but no hardware of any kind was unveiled at the company's summer bash and instead Apple removed the display from sale. But now the company seems to have had a change of heart and has revealed that it will start to sell a new display in 2018. As for when that new display might go on sale in 2018, that probably depends a lot on the development of the new Mac Pro (read about Apple's plans for the 2018 Mac Pro here). Apple tends to make announcements relating to the Mac Pro at WWDC, so it's feasible that we could find out more about it's plans for the Mac Pro, and the accompanying display, at WWDC in June 2017, although they won't ship until 2018. This would follow the way the Mac Pro was launched - with a preview at WWDC followed by it going on sale in January the following year. The new display will be designed for Mac Pro users, but Apple may want to push its range of displays to the MacBook market as well, encouraging owners of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro to purchase a second screen. Indeed, MacOS features introduced as far back as Mavericks are targeted at the use of a second screen. 8K resolution With the Mac Pro able to support up to three 4K displays or six Thunderbolt displays. There was some speculation back in 2014 that Apple would launch a 4K monitor with a resolution of 4069 x 2160 (or 3840 x 2160) pixels. Then there were suggestions that a new monitor would have 5K resolution, like the 27-inch 5K iMac. That's a resolution of 5120 x 2880. However, it looks like we can expect more than that. A report on Pike's Universum has now suggested that the new display could offer an 8K resolution. 8K resolution (or 8K UHD) is the same resolution offered by ultra high definition TV. To offer 8,000 pixels the total image dimensions need to be 7680×4320. 8K is the successor to 4K. Few cameras had the capability to shoot video in 8K. Apple wouldn't be the first company to offer an 8K display, Dell offers a 32-inch UltraSharp 8K display (although it costs a rather pricy $5,000) One thing we know for sure is that the display won't be controlled by touch. When asked whether Apple would consider a touch display, Apple's Phil Schiller said: "No. We’ve talked a lot about touch on the Mac. It’s certainly, as we’ve talked to pros, not a big request for things they would want in a Mac Pro and not the problems that they most want us to solve." Dimensons As for size, Apple used to sell a 30in display until replacing it with the 27in Cinema Display back in July 2010. The company could again sell a 30in display, but we expect Apple to stick to a maximum screen size of 27 inches, as it has done with its iMac line. That said, the display could feasibly be larger than 30-inches - the Dell display mentioned above measures 32-inches. Integrated GPU The new monitor could feature its own integrated GPU, which would enable it to offer high-res graphics when attached to lower-powered Macs - such as MacBooks, which as discussed above are often used in conjunction with second screens. MacBooks generally don't have room for a GPU, but by integrating a GPU into a standalone display Apple would bring 5K, or even 8K, to its laptop customers without compromising on the portability of the MacBook itself. By hooking up to the monitor when in the office and then detaching the MacBook for life on the road, business users would be able to get the best of both worlds. 9to5Mac's sources said back in 2016: "Upon connection to the new Apple display, the Mac will intelligently decide whether to use its own internal graphics power or rely on the external GPU included with the Thunderbolt display; the more powerful GPU will be used while the less powerful GPU will be inactive." How much will the new Apple display cost? Beore Apple stopped sales of the Thunderbolt display it cost £899. It would be reasonable to expect a 5K replacement to cost rather more (although it's possible that Apple will roll out the new display for £899 and offer a price cut on the lower-res display). Apple's lowest-spec 5K iMac retails for £1,449, so we'd expect the new 27-inch display to come in at around £1,000 or slightly more. Tags: Mac , Rumour Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

The Harris County Sheriff’s Office is getting the word out (check out their Facebook post below): please don’t say to Siri, “Hey Siri 108” on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or Apple TV.  If you do, you have 5 seconds before Siri calls the Police.  And when you call the Police unnecessarily, it’s taking their time away from the people who really do need them for an emergency! So why in the world does Siri dial “Emergency Services” when you give the “108” command?  Siri has been programmed to dial “Emergency Services” when you give the command of any country’s emergency service phone number: “108” just happens to be India’s emergency service phone number (just like “911” is ours in the United States). iPhone users warned about dangerous new 'Hey, Siri 108' prankhttps://t.co/vlSaVJg4lZ pic.twitter.com/cHOak36IPh — Talk of Connecticut (@talkofct) March 25, 2017 Unfortunately, it all started as a prank on social media (see some examples of those posts below).

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile iPhone 8: Insider outs exciting new features, but says phone is delayed Image Source: Vianney le Masne Zach Epstein @zacharye April 7th, 2017 at 11:19 AM Share Tweet Demand for Apple’s upcoming new iPhone 8 is going to be through the roof when it is released later this year. Apple fans are long overdue for a new design since Apple decided to reuse its 2014 iPhone designs yet again in 2016. Thankfully, it looks like they’re definitely going to get what they want in 2017 as Apple ditches the home button and the thick bezels, and opts for a more modern design and an OLED display. That’s the good news. The bad news is that yet another insider with a decent track record has reported that the iPhone 8 will be delayed, though the delay might not be as long as others have said. Don't Miss: There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Multiple recent reports have said that Apple’s new iPhone 8 will not be released at the same time as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus. Those two phones are supposedly still on track for a September release, but the redesigned iPhone 8 might not debut until October or even November, if those rumors are to be believed. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White agrees that the OLED-equipped iPhone 8 won’t be released alongside the two other models, but he says the “delay” should only be a few weeks. If White is correct, that means we’re likely looking at a release date sometime in early October. White has a mixed track record, but he has accurately reported on unreleased Apple products in the past. For example, he was one of the first to reveal that Apple was working on the iPad mini back in 2012. Apart from the delay, White says that his supply chain sources have given him some insights into a few exciting new features Apple has planned for the iPhone 8. Among them are new augmented reality capabilities, new 3D sensing features, and secure facial recognition for unlocking the phone and authenticating Apple Play transactions. “First off, our smartphone contact believes the 3D sensing technology and OLED displays will only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8,” White wrote in a note to clients that was seen by BGR. “However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we have heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. Since it is only April, this situation could improve.” The analyst continued, “Essentially, our contact believes customers will be able to pre-order the new 5.8-inch iPhone 8 along with the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 in September; however, the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will not be available for delivery until several weeks later. The 3D sensing capability is important to Apple and has a host of use cases outside of AR. For example, 3D sensing will allow a user to open their iPhone with their face in a secure manner (cannot be tricked with a photo) and approve payment on Apple Pay, while potentially negating the need for proximity sensors that are used when holding the iPhone near one’s ear. Our contact believes approximately half of the new iPhone 8 shipment volume will go toward the 5.8-inch version.” White’s reporting comes following meetings with multiple LCD panel makers, smartphone vendors and a component supplier in Taiwan. While he neglects to specify the names of the companies he met with, some or all of them are presumably in Apple’s supply chain.

The report from Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White (via CNBC), claims that Apple’s expected high-end 5.8-inch model in the new iPhone 8 could be delayed beyond September due to difficulties related to the 3D sensing technology rumored to debut on the device: The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac “First off, our smartphone contact believes the 3D sensing technology and OLED displays will only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8,” White said in a note emailed to CNBC. “However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays.” Several reports in recent months have indicated that Apple is planning to use 3D sensor technology, possibly in combination with both the front and back cameras. That could allow for facial recognition, augmented reality applications, and other features that Apple has shown interest in. Today’s report backs up one earlier this week from Economic Daily News that also claimed “technical issues” could cause delays for the device. More specifically, that report said suppliers were struggling to perfect the lamination process of curved OLED panels and adoption of the 3D sensing front camera system. The 3D sensing tech and OLED displays, as White notes, are expected to only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. For that reason, the other models expected in the next-generation iPhone lineup, including upgraded 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch models similar to the current generation devices, should be available in September without delay, according to the report. Earlier this week, a separate report claimed Apple signed a two-year deal with Samsung to supply curved iPhone OLED displays with up to 92 million panels in 2017 alone. The iPhone 8 OLED is expected to be not as curved & edge-to-edge as Samsung’s Galaxy S8, while there have been conflicting reports about a rumored higher $1000 ASP for the OLED model.

The handset is tipped to feature an all-glass front similar to the Galaxy S8. The home button will be gone, but the fingerprint sensor should be embedded in the new OLED screen. The front-facing camera is getting an advanced 3D depth-sensing feature, and the rear camera will have two lenses like the iPhone 7 Plus. Now, a new report from a source with a solid track record may be the most extensive iPhone 8 leak so far. Don't Miss: This iPhone 8 would be so much hotter than the Galaxy S8 Obtained from Asia and posted initially on Weibo by a leaker that goes by the name KK, new drawings of the iPhone 8 may offer some interesting details about the phone’s design, assuming they’re based on Apple’s actual plans. The drawings are said to have been made by a Foxconn worker who has seen Apple’s plans for the phone. There’s no home button on the front side, and there’s no standalone fingerprint sensor anywhere on the back. This seems to imply the Touch ID sensor will be embedded in the screen, as has been rumored several times in the past, since the feature is critical to various iPhone features. On the front, there appears to be a dual camera setup, but one of those large openings will probably house the 3D sensor. These sensors would not be visible to the user. In fact, the report notes that there won’t be any openings on the front side, suggesting that Apple may place all the front-facing sensors behind the screen. We already know that Apple has patents on this type of technology. Another interesting design element sits on the back, a dual camera that’s positioned vertically rather than horizontally, like it is on the iPhone 7 Plus. An unconfirmed rumor made reference to this design possibility for the iPhone 8 a short while ago, but many Apple fans hoped it was false because it’s definitely an eyesore. The Weibo post mentions that the iPhone 8’s camera experience will be one of the highlights of the phone, complete with augmented reality features and 3D support. Other notable features concern the antennas, which appear in the four corners of the phone, but they don’t seem to be as annoying as the antenna lines we’ve grown to hate. In fact, it appears the phone’s antennas are similar to the iPhone 4 and 4S’s antenna setup since the phone will feature a glass back like those old models. The curvature of the iPhone 8’s metal frame is supposedly going to be similar to the Apple Watch, the leaker says.

The SIM tray is also still in the picture, and there’s a Lightning port on the bottom with no 3.5mm audio jack to accompany it.   Trending right now: This is your last chance to get T-Mobile’s best promo for free First Galaxy S8 TV commercial debuts with two weeks until release Sam’s Club has a killer Galaxy S8 deal that’s even better than Best Buy’s See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next Ford brings baby’s car-ride experience to the crib Yahoo Tech A massive asteroid is going to zip past Earth later this month BGR News I drove the electric Chevy Bolt all weekend and only freaked out once Yahoo Tech Don’t throw these sneakers out — you can compost them Yahoo Tech Here’s how I added a 256GB microSD card to my iPhone BGR News How Apple's secrecy can hurt consumers Yahoo Tech Pogue’s Basics: How to speed up YouTube playback with a keystroke Yahoo Tech Astronomers just discovered something awesome about the most Earth-like planet ever found BGR News Robot arms are now teaching each other how to work Yahoo Tech The disruption of workers by robots is about to take a giant leap forward Yahoo Tech Google's window-mounted air conditioner could have its own window Digital Trends Google's new YouTube TV lets you watch cable for $35 a month Yahoo Tech ‘Thursday Night Football’ is coming to Amazon Prime next season Yahoo Tech U.S. net neutrality advocates blast Pai effort to reverse rules Reuters Obsess over your dog even more with this smart pet door Yahoo Tech

When you hear the name Elyxr, you may be forgiven for asking ‘who?’ The Irish audio manufacturer isn’t the most well-known when it comes to accessories, however they continue to pump out solid products which appeal to the average consumer. When they offered us the chance to test out their latest headphones, which seem to be a take on the Apple Earpods, we jumped at the chance. They are a small, convenient and, most importantly, wireless way of listening to your favourite tunes. These tiny headphones give a glimpse into what the future of wireless audio could look like. The packaging is attractive and exudes quality. A magnetic cover that reveals the headphones, charging unit (which we will look at later) and the necessary handbooks is no bigger than your regular headphone box. The design of the headphones is equally excellent. They are discreet and largely unnoticeable when you put them on. One of my bug bears about the Apple Earpods is that silly white pole which sticks out at the bottom. It means that people all around you can see the latest tech from the Californian giant… Plus it looks stupid. There’s no such problems here, as the headphones themselves are barely visible once in the ear. It’s basically a speaker driver and not much else, though they do have some flashing lights for Bluetooth pairing purposes and to show they’re turned on. They’re so small and discrete that you better watch out, as we imagine they’re quite easy to lose by mistake. There’s plenty of colour options available but ours came in a dark finish, with each earpiece having a silver strip that acts as an action button for turning them on. The charging unit is nice and stylish too. Naturally, we’ll again be comparing this to the competition from Apple… But the Elyxr Air once again stand up really well. Aesthetically, just as with the earphones themselves, discretion is the order of the day with minimal design and a logo on the front. Instead of that awkward lid which opens to reveal Apple’s Earpods, the company has elected to go for a design where the user pushes up on the bottom of the device to be presented with the headphones. The sliding mechanism is a convenient way of taking the earphones out to listen and then putting them back on charge. You need not worry about losing the headphones whilst they are charging as they are held in with strong magnets that pull in the headphones nice and snug. The sliding mechanism is a convenient way of taking the earphones out to listen and then putting them back on charge The charging unit also includes a USB port at the bottom. This can be used to juice your handset while on the move, though obviously this can have an impact on the amount of power that is left for the headphones themselves. It’s only a 2,100mAh cell so don’t expect a full charge out of it but for emergencies, it’s a nice addition. I found that between my phone and the headphones, I was able to just about get through the day with some caution. Using the Elyxr Air for my daily commute and during work hours, I typically got around two and a half hours, three at a push. If you have a long commute this is definitely something you should consider and I found myself carrying around a wired set of headphones as a back up policy. So back to the earphones and the all important question is, are they good for music fans? Sound quality is definitely good, though we wouldn’t say it was stellar. They never went particularly loud when played through my HTC 10 and there’s no clear way to distinguish between which is the left and right. That said, the frequency spectrum comes across very neutral and there’s little distortion. There’s a subtle disco smile which is noticeable on some material, with the mid-range taking a slight back seat. Bass is well controlled and doesn’t thump, which helped with my taste for techno music. Bluetooth headphones seem to be a necessity or will be in the future, with certain big manufacturers dumping the headphone jack. The convenience of not having to untangle yourself from your headphones is a welcome addition, so long as you’re willing to appreciate the shortcomings of Bluetooth. We found that it does cut out sometime, especially when the phone is the trouser pocket. This is slightly worrying but not really a problem which is specific to the Elyxr Air. Despite the cons, the simplicity and excellent design is what makes these headphones so great. Small format wireless headphones such as these is still an evolving technology and we look forward to seeing what else Elyxr come out with next.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Australian consumer watchdog goes after Apple after iPhone ‘Error 53’ glitch Australian consumer watchdog goes after Apple after iPhone ‘Error 53’ glitch Matthew Wilson 15 hours ago Apple Back in February last year, Apple finally acknowledged ‘Error 53’, a Touch ID glitch that would brick iPhones and make them unusable. At the time, Apple did offer a workaround for customers but it seems that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) wasn’t impressed with the whole situation and is now taking Apple to federal court citing a breach of consumer law. The issue here is that Apple told some customers that it wouldn’t fix devices if they were previously repaired by a third-party/unauthorised vendor. Essentially, Apple wouldn’t honour its usual warranty. According to the ACCC (which has also sued Valve recently), this was a breach of consumer law as Error 53 made devices unusable by no fault of their own, entitling them to a free repair under Australian law. ACCC Chairman, Rod Sims, said that “consumer guarantees are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party”. He then went on to accuse Apple of “misleading and deceptive” conduct by refusing to fix phones previously repaired by unauthorised vendors. This isn’t the first legal headache that Error 53 has caused for Apple, as The Inquirer points out, a barrister here in the UK has claimed that Error 53 could potentially be viewed as an offence under the UK’s Criminal Damage Act 1971. Previously a class-action lawsuit also attempted to get under way over in the US, though that did end up being unsuccessful. KitGuru Says: Given that Error 53 was a software issue, it seems unfair of Apple to choose whether or not to issue a repair based on whether or not a customer went to a cheaper repair shop first.

Jio subscribers who had already activated the Jio 'Summer Surprise' offer will continue to benefit from it, but new registrations will stop soon - though Reliance Jio is allowing users to sign up and avail the offer benefits at present. Reliance Jio said it would comply with the TRAI's decision, but that it would take a few days to make the operational changes necessary to withdraw the offer. The offer, which was announced on March 31, gives Jio Prime users free services for three months on a recharge or Rs. 303 or more, beyond the offers that have been announced since the time of Jio's launch. Users had to became Jio Prime members and refill with a certain minimum amount in order to get the three additional months of free service.   Samsung Galaxy C7 Pro Launched in India today As expected, Samsung formally launched the Galaxy C7 Pro in India today, with a price tag of Rs. 27,990. This more affordable sibling of the Galaxy C9 Pro will be available exclusively on Amazon.in from April 11 onwards. Its body is made of metal and curved glass, and you can buy it in either Gold or Navy Blue. The new phone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 SoC and has a 5.7-inch full-HD screen. On the plus side, you get 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, a fingerprint sensor, and 16-megapixel cameras on the rear as well as front. However, this phone runs the dated Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow and has a hybrid dual-SIM tray so you have to choose between a microSD card and a second SIM. The Samsung C7 Pro will be taking on the likes of the OnePlus 3T (Review) and Vivo V5 Plus (Review). Gadgets 360 was able to spend some time with a demo unit at Samsung's launch event today, and we look forward to conducting an in-depth review in the near future. Xiaomi ranked India's 'most preferred smartphone brand', pipping Apple and Samsung While market share is determined by the actual number of units shipped in a particular time frame, a new study conducted by research firm Strategy Analytics pegs Xiaomi as "India's most preferred smartphone brand", ahead of even Apple and Samsung. The Chinese powerhouse entered India less than three years ago, but immediately shot to fame because of its shockingly low prices and strategy of constraining supply to generate buzz. Xiaomi got 26 percent of the vote when a panel of Android users was asked which brand the members would go for when buying their next smartphone. Samsung and Apple were chosen by 12 percent each, with Motorola following at 7 percent, and Lenovo tied with OnePlus at 6 percent each. Strategy Analytics noted that Xiaomi has grown tremendously since its launch. However, the return of Nokia, which is a powerful brand, could see Xiaomi knocked out of the top spot. Reliance Jio appears to be gearing up to launch TV services Reliance Jio has already upended the mobile operators' industry, and trials for home broadband service are under way. Not content with that, the company seems to be preparing to enter the TV space as well. Two new options have appeared on Jio's website: Home Broadband and Jio Link. Jio Link in particular appears to refer to a set-top box. Jio could use its massive infrastructure to deliver TV over IP rather than launching a satellite DTH service. Details are scarce at the moment, but stay tuned to Gadgets 360 for all the news as it breaks. iPad (2017) pre-orders now open in India Apple announced its new 2017 iPad just a few weeks ago, and it is already up for preorders in India. The new model is slightly thicker than the outgoing iPad Air 2 and lacks its laminated screen, but offers an updated processor is a lot more affordable. Prices start at Rs. 28,900 for the 32GB Wi-Fi variant, and go up to Rs. 47,900 if you want to max out the storage at 128GB and add cellular connectivity as well. It weighs 469 grams. The iPad (2017) is available in gold, silver or space grey, and has a 9.7-inch 2048x1536-pixel Retina display just like its predecessors. You get an A9 CPU, an 8-megapixel rear camera, 1.2-megapixel front camera, and fingerprint sensor. This model lacks the True Tone screen, quad speakers, and Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard compatibility that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro offers. Xiaomi Mi 6 and Mi Max 2 specifications purportedly leak online Xiaomi is also in the news because of mounting speculation regarding its upcoming Mi 6 flagship and Mi Max 2 phablet. Devices purporting to be these two models have appeared in the GFXBench benchmark's online database, indicating that tests are being run on prototype units already. The Mi 6 supposedly runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat with a new iteration of Xiaomi's MIUI custom ROM. It should have a 5.1-inch full-HD screen and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC. RAM is tipped to be either 4GB or 6GB, and there should be 64GB and/ or 128GB of storage. These specs don't quite match up to previous leaks which indicated much more premium hardware as well as a larger Mi 6 Plus sibling model. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 appears to have a 6.4-inch full-HD screen and an unannounced Snapdragon 660 SoC. Stay tuned to Gadgets 360 for confirmation of the Mi 6's specs as soon as we get them. Facebook launches an AI-based companion within its Messenger app Facebook Messenger in the US can now chat with M, an AI-powered assistant that aims to show helpful suggestions and actions within the app. Facebook is hoping to compete with Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Samsung, amongst others, in the race to capture AI companion market share. M should roll out to users around the world in due course. It will help users manage conversations and perform other actions, with more capabilities being added over time. DoT survey shows that calls are more likely to drop when you're indoors The Department of Telecom (DoT) has released the results of the data it has gathered by questioning users about call drops. SMS and IVRS services were launched in order to help mobile subscribers lodge complaints, and by following up with them to determine the circumstances of each dropped call, the DoT was able to determine that call drops are more likely to occur indoors. 2,20,935 subscribers have participated in the survey since it began in December 2016, of whom 1,38,072 (62.5 percent) reported call drops. These results are shared with mobile service operators fortnightly to help them improve services. LG G6 to go on sale in some parts of the world soon LG's 2017 flagship, the LG G6, was unveiled at MWC 2017. Units are now being shipped out to key markets in North America, Europe and Asia, and they should go on sale very soon. The phone is already on sale in its home market of South Korea. The highlight of the LG G6 is its 5.7-inch 1440x2880-pixel FullVision screen which has an unusual 18:9 (or 2:1) aspect ratio and extremely narrow borders. It is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC and has 4GB of RAM.

Problem Solving | 07 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (0) Colonel Mustard in the Library with the Shift Key by Adam C. Engst I love a good mystery… as long as it has a solution. The case of the Library’s changing modifier key had me stumped for a while, but thankfully, our buddy Rob Griffiths figured it out. Starting with OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple hid the home folder’s Library folder (~/Library) to prevent users from meddling in it and causing trouble (see “Dealing with Lion’s Hidden Library,” 20 July 2011). We’ll ignore for the moment the question of whether this was a good move. To access that folder, you had to hold down the Option key and choose Go > Library in the Finder. If you were sufficiently irritated by having to do this, as many of us were, there was a Terminal command you could run to reveal the ~/Library folder within Finder windows permanently. (Remember, there are multiple Library folders in macOS; ~/Library is the one in your home folder. Oddly, Apple leaves /Library and /System/Library visible, even though users should never mess around in them.) In OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple pulled back a bit on pretending that we users weren’t capable enough to work in ~/Library, adding a Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window for the home folder. That checkbox appears only when your home folder is displayed in the frontmost Finder window, and if you’re in column view, you might need to select a folder inside the home folder. When that checkbox is selected, ~/Library appears in Finder windows, but Library does not appear in the Go menu unless you hold the Option key down too. In macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple made it so that checkbox adds Library to the Go menu too, and in 10.12.3, also added a keyboard shortcut — Command-Shift-L. However, Sierra is also where things started to get funky. For many people, including me, the old Option key trick stopped working in Sierra. That wasn’t a problem for me because I had permanently revealed my ~/Library folder long ago and seldom used the Finder’s Go menu. But I did notice that Option had stopped showing the Library menu item, and when Kirk McElhearn wrote a blog post about how the key had changed to Shift in one of Sierra’s minor updates, I was pleased to discover that, indeed, the Shift key now worked to show the Library folder in the Finder’s Go menu. I didn’t explore further because Kirk’s solution worked fine for me, and it solved Tonya’s confusion over the loss of the Option key trick as well. Thinking I was sharing a neat little trick, I mentioned it briefly in an email message to Take Control readers. Little did I realize the can of worms I was opening. Several people replied to say that Shift did not work for them, and Option still did. Lauri Reinhardt, who does support for Take Control, tested before passing those messages on to me. She found that, while the Shift key worked initially, after she toggled the Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window, Shift stopped adding Library to the Go menu, and Option started working again. Nothing she could do would make the Shift key work anymore. I confirmed that Shift still worked on both my iMac and my MacBook Air, toggled the checkbox on my iMac, and found exactly what Lauri had. A new test account showed that Option really was still the right key, but why had it been Shift for a while? Madness! I was stumped, so I tracked backward from Kirk’s post to Michael Tsai’s initial Twitter thread and then followed a link to a post by Rob Griffiths that explained the situation. Rob’s discovery was that relaunching the Finder (Option-click its Dock icon and choose Relaunch) puts the Finder in a weird state where the Shift key took over from the Option key. I was able to reproduce that as well. Doubly weird — this state persists across restarts! It’s a bug, and Rob reported it, so we hope Apple will fix it in a future macOS update. My suspicion is that this weird Finder state, which may date back to the Sierra betas, can be triggered in ways other than relaunching the Finder. Quitting or force-quitting the Finder from within Activity Monitor doesn’t seem to do it, but I can imagine other scenarios that might leave the Finder in an unusual state — a kernel panic, for instance, or a loss of power to the Mac. Over years of usage, it’s easy to see something like this happening to many people. Regardless, the practical upshot of this minor mystery is as follows: Sierra Power Users: If you’re running Sierra and you want ~/Library to be visible in Finder windows and in the Go menu, select your home folder, choose View > Show View Options, and select Show Library Folder. Regular Sierra Users: If you don’t mind getting to ~/Library via the Go menu in Sierra, open the Go menu and press the Option key to reveal the Library menu item. If the Option key doesn’t work, use the instructions in the previous bullet to show and then hide the Library, after which Option should work. OS X Users: Those using 10.7 Lion through 10.11 El Capitan should either use Option with the Finder’s Go menu or enter this Terminal command to make ~/Library show up in Finder windows. chflags nohidden ~/Library/ Finally, why might you want to work in ~/Library? Lots of reasons, but Ted Landau wrote an article for MacObserver about the top six reasons to visit the Library folder. It dates from 2012 but is still essentially correct. Still, as Ted says, don’t mess around with files in ~/Library if you don’t know what you’re doing — you can cause real problems. Always make sure you have a backup first! Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Sierra: A Take Control Crash Course You can head off into the wilds of Sierra with confidence when you're equipped with Mac expert Scholle McFarland's detailed what's new list. She also teaches you new Sierra features like Siri, app tabs, Desktop and Documents folder syncing, Optimized Storage, Universal Clipboard, and Picture in Picture. Still, our favorite chapter is "Discover the Little Things in Sierra," which covers the tiny changes that make a big difference.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Australia consumer commission sues Apple over alleged device disabling Friday 7 April 2017 at 9:46 AM ET by Alexis Wheeler ©  WikiMedia (Taylor Shomaker) [JURIST] The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) [official website] filed suit against Apple [corporate website] on Thursday alleging [press release] that the company made "false, misleading, or deceptive representations" to consumers. The allegations stem from an investigation into reports of devices being disabled after downloading an operating system update. The ACCC claims that the company denied specific devices, which had been previously repaired by third parties, a free remedy. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." The ACCC said it found that Apple had a practice of refusing usual services to devices repaired by third parties. Apple has been part of numerous recent, high-profile legal proceedings. Last month a Beijing IP Court ruled [JURIST report] that Apple's iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus did not infringe on patents held by the Shenzhen Baili Marketing Services Co., a Chinese manufacturer which is now "defunct." Earlier that month a Federal court overturned [JURIST report] a Texas District Court decision awarding Smartflash LLC a $533 million patent verdict against the company. In January the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated [JURIST report] its damages determination in the longstanding patent lawsuit between Samsung and Apple.

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White sent a note to investors on Friday detailing why his firm believes Apple's 5.8-inch iPhone 8, suspected to be the most expensive of the new iPhones, won't arrive in September as usual. "First off, our smartphone contact believes the 3-D sensing technology and OLED displays will only be offered with the 5.8-inch iPhone 8," White said in a note emailed to CNBC. "However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3-D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays." Apple's iPhone is expected to employ 3-D sensors to take advantage of new augmented reality technology. White's note follows a similar report out of Apple's supply chain earlier this week, which also suggested the iPhone 8 will be delayed for similar reasons. There's still some good news, though. White said that customers should still be able to pre-order two of Apple's new iPhone 8 models, including a 4.7-inch and a 5.5-inch model, in September as usual. Those phones won't have all of fancy new trimmings that the 5.8-inch model will have, however, which means iPhone enthusiasts will need to wait longer for the latest and greatest device.

Power Tablet Survey for the First Time Microsoft Tops Apple in J.D. Power Tablet Survey for the First Time Posted by Shane McGlaun | Fri, Apr 07, 2017 - 10:18 AM When it comes to tablets the products that many people think about first are the Apple iPad line. For the first time Apple is no longer in the top spot on the J.D. Power tablet survey reports Fast Company. Microsoft has taken over that top spot with its Surface line of tablets that creative and professional users have found so compelling. Apple had been very proud of its J.D. Power satisfaction ratings and has used that ranking as a way to show that people still love iPads even in the face of sagging sales. Those brands will be nullified now that the Microsoft Surface tablets sit at the top of the satisfaction rankings. The latest JD power rankings came out on Thursday and showed that Surface users gave their tablets an 855 out of 1000 score. Things that users praised in the rankings about the Surface tablets include pre-loaded applications, internet connectivity, and the accessories available. Users also bragged on the Surface selection of inputs, outputs and internal storage. Top marks for Surface were also given for design, look, and feel of the tablet. Interestingly the ranking also found that Surface tablet users were more likely to be younger and early adopters of tech than users of other tablets. The iPad came in second in the rankings with a score of 849, only slightly behind the Surface tablet, but as Ricky Bobby says, second place is just first loser. Apple is currently working to appeal to the pro level users out there with promises of a refreshed Mac Pro and a new external display on the horizon.

 More reports are suggesting the iPhone 8 could be delayed Kif Leswing Apr. 7, 2017, 11:02 AM 3,113 facebook linkedin twitter email print Martin Hajek/Computer Bild Apple will launch a redesigned iPhone this fall. Current rumors suggest it will be very desirable, with a bigger screen in the same size chassis, glass casing, and a new kind of 3D camera.  But there's increasing evidence that the redesigned iPhone, often called the iPhone 8 or OLED iPhone, could be announced in September but delayed until later in 2017 — perhaps by several weeks, according to a research note from Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White distributed to clients on Friday.  White cites a contact with knowledge of Apple's Asian supply chain who is increasingly "emphatic" that Apple's new 3D camera is facing challenges that could result in delays: However, our contact strongly believes the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will be delayed by several weeks due to challenges around the 3D sensing technology but still in time for the December holidays. This is not the first time that we have heard about a potential delay with a new iPhone; however, our contact was so emphatic about the delay that we are taking this data point more seriously. Since it is only April, this situation could improve.  One possibility that White lays out is that Apple could announce the redesigned iPhone in September, like it has for the past few years, but instead of it going on sale shortly afterwards, it would go up for pre-orders instead.  This would be a launch strategy not too dissimilar from Apple's most recent new product, the AirPods wireless headphones, which were announced alongside the iPhone 7 last September but didn't go on sale until December 13. However, AirPods were not available for pre-order when they were revealed.  The 3D camera is expected to be a banner feature on the redesigned iPhone, which is expected to launch alongside two other new models that are more similar to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Drexel's research suggests half of the iPhones Apple plans to manufacture will be the new, redesigned model.  The 3D camera will be critical for Apple's ambition in augmented reality, a new technology that mixes the real world with computer graphics, that Apple CEO Tim Cook is fond of discussing in public. White also suggests that the 3D camera could have a facial recognition feature that won't be fooled by a photo, like the bug that's affected Samsung's new Galaxy S8.  SEE ALSO: What experts are saying about Apple and AR More: Apple Drexel Hamilton iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Rumors facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru More reports are suggesting the iPhone 8 could be delayed More reports are suggesting the iPhone 8 could be delayed Apple will launch a redesigned iPhone this fall...

Walter Thompson and Mindshare has suggested that Siri is seen as lagging behind other intelligent voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home. Apple is a voice pioneer, having launched Siri in 2011, but is increasingly seen as a laggard. While it has integrated Siri into wearables (the Apple Watch and AirPod), its challenge is a comparative lack of machine-learning capabilities and user data to make a voice assistant intelligent. Its strategic focus on data privacy and security reflects this. The study, based on the behaviors and attitudes of more than 1,000 UK smartphone owners, also provided a bunch of insights into who is using voice assistants and how … NordVPN Unsurprisingly, the biggest users of IAs are young, male, and affluent. 50% of 18-34-year-olds, 43% of men and 48% of people with a household income of more than £50,000 use voice monthly or more versus the population average of 37%. Interestingly, while the top three reasons for using IAs are practical – it’s convenient, simple and faster than typing – the fourth reason given was that it’s fun, suggesting that there’s still a novelty factor in play despite the fact that Siri has been around since 2011. ‘Asking a fun question’ was also the second most popular type of interaction after serious searches. The fact that speaking to our phones still isn’t seen as routine was also reflected in users expressing reluctance to use IAs in public, the report finding that the home was the primary environment. Some 22% of users said that they’d feel embarrassed to talk to their devices in public. Smart home use is already taking off, with some 15% of regular IA users saying that they use it to control connected devices in the home. Web searches were the main use of IAs, followed by playing music, getting a weather forecast and asking directions. The main things people want from future development of IAs is greater intelligence and personalization. Users of voice are looking for greater integration across platforms, devices and contexts, picking up conversations where they left o and building on prior understanding […] People want the assistant to know their every preference and deliver an experience that caters to their every whim. As one of our respondents put it, “I’d like voice technology to understand me on the level that humans understand each other.” Around a third (32%) of smartphone users are excited about a future where “my voice assistant will anticipate what I need and take actions or make suggestions.” It’s here where Apple may face its greatest challenge, its strong stance on privacy limiting the degree to which Siri can learn more about us and our lives.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile There’s only one thing keeping all these iPhone users from switching to the Galaxy S8 Image Source: Samsung Zach Epstein @zacharye April 7th, 2017 at 10:29 AM Share Tweet Last week, I wrote about how difficult it’s going to be for me to keep using my iPhone 7 Plus for the next five or six months until the iPhone 8 comes out. Why? Because I’ve held the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in my hand. Experiencing these phones and then going back to Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design feels like trading in a flat-panel LCD TV for an old CRT TV. You know, those crazy old TVs from the stone age that were practically as deep as they were wide. Seriously, Samsung’s designs are that good. Unfortunately, as I explained earlier, there’s really no way that I can ditch my iPhone and jump ship to the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, and it looks like I’m not the only one who feels this way. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus speed test: Did Samsung finally beat Apple? Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 is expected to pull the company’s smartphone design into the modern era, ditching the home button and the massive bezels in favor of a nearly bezel-less design similar to what we’ve seen on the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Unfortunately, there’s a whole lot of time between now and late September. Making matters even worse are several recent reports that suggest Apple’s new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus might launch in September, but the iPhone 8 might be pushed back until October or even November. As sleek as Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are, and as long as the wait is between now and the release of the new iPhone 8, are iPhone users going to abandon ship? It’s certainly likely that some people will hop off of the Apple train and give Samsung’s sleek new smartphones a try, but it looks like most Apple users we’ve seen commenting about the Galaxy S8 plan to stay in Apple’s camp despite admiring Samsung’s latest work. A recent thread on Reddit does a good job of capturing the general sentiment among most iPhone owners. They seem to agree that the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are magnificent, but they’re sticking with their iPhones. Why? Long story short, it’s the same reason I’m sticking with my iPhone: the software. iOS is too smooth, third-party apps are too much better, integration across devices is too convenient, and updates are too fast. As great as the Galaxy S8 is, not many people are willing to give all that up for a nice design, even one as nice as Samsung’s. Head over to the Reddit thread for specifics, and let me know on Twitter if you plan to jump ship from an iPhone to a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+.

If you’re not familiar with Apple Pay, it’s essentially Apple’s own way of paying for goods at the store or in shopping apps on your iPhone. The way it works in-store is you go up to the checkout desk and when it’s time to pay, you simply hold your iPhone near the pay terminal and then rest your finger on your iPhone’s Touch ID sensor to authorize the payment. It’s touted as being an easy, quick, and safe way to pay for goods at the store, and while the “safe” part of that statement is certainly correct, my experiences with the other parts aren’t quite as accurate. Read: How to Set Up Apple Pay Apple Pay is great in the sense that it protects your actual credit card information and doesn’t provide it to the store you’re paying at, meaning that you’re less susceptible to mass credit card store hacks. That alone is a great reason to use Apple Pay. However, the store must accept Apple Pay as a payment option, which many stores still don’t. Plus, Apple Pay has to simply work at these stores, and my experience with Apple Pay has been less than ideal because of this. Apple Pay Store Availability The number of stores that accept Apple Pay is quite lengthy, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t a whole lot of stores that don’t have Apple Pay, because the list of stores that don’t accept Apple Pay is also quite lengthy. Of course, Apple Pay is only a year old, but that’s still really no excuse, since NFC-enabled payment platforms have been around for a several years already. Many stores are simply just lagging behind on updating their payment systems to accept Apple Pay and other wireless payment options. It may come down to cost of updating their systems, and we don’t blame stores that want to wait until Apple Pay becomes a bit more widespread before they start spending money on updating their payment terminals, but Apple Pay can’t become more widespread until stores become leaders and not followers. Surprisingly, the only store that I go to regularly that accepts Apple Pay is Meijer, which is a regional grocery store chain in the Midwest. My mechanic (who I visit semi-regularly for oil changes and maintenance) also accepts Apple Pay, and it’s not one of those huge nation-wide chains like Meineke or Jiffy Lube. I’m talking about a mom-and-pop car shop that doesn’t even advertise…and they accept Apple Pay. Read: Why Apple Pay Isn’t Accepted Everywhere Those are the only two places that I visit regularly that accept Apple Pay, and even then I still use my debit card because Apple Pay really isn’t any quicker. I still have to sign or enter in my PIN number when I use Apple Pay, which kind of defeats the purpose of it being quick and easy to use. Sometimes, I go to Walgreens to pick up a prescription or some random things I need quickly, so you could say there are three places that I go to at least semi-regularly, but that’s where the next problem comes into play. Apple Pay Not Working On top of the not very many stores that I visit frequently having Apple Pay, there have been enough times when Apple Pay simply wouldn’t work that I got to a point where I ultimately just stopped trying to use Apple Pay. One time I was at Meijer and used Apple Pay. The pay terminal said that the payment went through, but it wasn’t showing that it was complete on the cashier’s end, so I tried it again, but it was still doing the same thing. I ended up just busting out my debit card and paying in less than 10 seconds. Another time, I decided to try Apple Pay at Walgreens, only this time I brought along one of my best friends who is an Android user. I wanted to show him Apple Pay, so when we got to the checkout lane, I pulled out my iPhone, placed it near the pay terminal, and nothing happened. To make matters worse, the cashier must have not been trained on Apple Pay and had no idea what the heck I was doing. To her, I looked liked some psychopath who was hovering my iPhone over the pay terminal expecting something magical to happen. Again, I just pulled out my debit card and paid in less than 10 seconds. I then left the store feeling like a complete idiot, and my Android friend quietly snickered during the ride home. This isn’t Apple’s fault by any means, since it’s usually the responsibility of the store to roll out Apple Pay and make sure their payment systems are working properly for such a technology, but I’ve been disappointed so far as to how a lot of stores are handling it. Read: Why Your iPhone Should Never Replace Your Wallet I feel like the world as a whole isn’t quite ready for a mass NFC payment rollout, not in the sense that stores themselves aren’t updating their systems, but rather humans don’t really seem ready for that kind of technology. Paying for goods using your smartphone is still a very new concept, and while many users who are interested in technology are familiar with Apple Pay and such, I feel that a majority of people still see it as a strange and foreign concept. Hopefully that changes sooner rather than later, but for the time being, it’s really just easier for everyone if you use your credit or debit card.   2 Responses 11/10/2015 Judge Dickerson Reply Since apple pay is only in a few stores that I actually go to I have to remember that I can actually use it there. Apple Pay should be something I dont think about using 04/07/2017 TypoDiva Reply ‘Of course, Apple Pay is only a year old, but that’s still really no excuse, since NFC-enabled payment platforms have been around for a several years already.’ Typo? Surely you did not mean to use ‘a’ before ‘several’ ? I have been spotting typos on a daily basis and now I have taken it upon myself to point them out. I hope this helps you in some way.

And the smartphone companies are driving the change Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur Modern technology and connectivity mean that the occupants of such a car will have better entertainment options, as well as safety features. Cars today aren’t just about driving from points A to B, they are also about convenience, entertainment and security. If tail fins and chrome defined the automobile in the late 1950s and the “muscle-car” was the fashion in the 1960s and 1970s, we are now cruising into what is appropriately being called the “connected car” era, with Silicon Valley stars making their presence felt in what used to be Detroit territory. Modern technology and connectivity mean that the occupants of such a car will have better entertainment options, as well as safety features—buzzing a helpline automatically in case of an accident, for example. Then there is the real-time management system, providing updated traffic information, optimal route navigation and information on the car’s health, all aimed at making the drive safer, faster and more efficient. Do you scoff at the idea of a connected car? Well, according to navigation company TomTom, drivers in Moscow spend an average of 127 hours each year stuck in traffic—Beijing, Tokyo, Bangkok or New Delhi wouldn’t be very different. Moscow isn’t perceived as a city with bad traffic, but data suggests it is. This is where cloud-based data and smart algorithms become relevant, be it for navigation, communication, safety or security. The change is upon us So, what are the elements of a modern-day connected vehicle? Take the example of Swedish carmaker Volvo. Its Volvo On Call app (Android and iOS) hosts a bunch of cloud-based services that allow you to remotely control some of the functions with your phone or smartwatch. You can locate the car, send navigation directions, unlock doors, monitor fuel, pre-manage the cabin’s temperature, make a Wi-Fi zone, even call for emergency assistance. A truly connected smart car will have a processing unit, a bevy of sensors, storage and smart software to run all the features—think of your car as your laptop, only many times more powerful. “Integration of connected devices to avoid distracted driving is the key. Infotainment is no longer limited to audio and video systems in the car. Seamless intelligence transcending devices (these work together as well), including sensors, cameras, tablets, smartphones, navigation system and infotainment systems, is imperative,” says Tom von Bonsdorff, managing director, Volvo Auto India. Infotainment: The driving soundtrack Over the years, perhaps the biggest disappointment has been the factory-fitted music system. For, unless you have splurged on a Jaguar XE sedan, for instance, with the InControl Touch and Meridian music systems, the experience would rank somewhere between clunky and exasperating. Now, tech giants Apple and Google want to put your smartphone at the very centre of the experience. With their CarPlay and Android Auto systems, respectively, they seamlessly integrate hands-free calling features, music streaming, maps, navigation and more, all with voice commands. It becomes easy for the person driving to make or receive calls, change the music or even use navigation guidance, all without the driver needing to take their eyes off the road. In 2015, Maruti Suzuki was the first to introduce Apple CarPlay in India as part of the SmartPlay infotainment platform, which is now available in their Baleno hatchback, Ciaz sedan and Brezza crossover, among others. The platform has now also been updated to add support for Android Auto, which is being rolled out with the Ignis hatchback. “The major risk associated with Apple CarPlay was the acceptability of the feature by Indian car consumers. The feature can be best experienced with good Internet speed, which is a major challenge in the Indian context,” says C.V. Raman, executive director (engineering), Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. It took time for rival carmakers to take the hint, but the likes of Hyundai, for example, have joined the party, with the new Elantra sedan, and also the 2017 Elite i20 hatchback and the 2017 Creta crossover. If you aren’t buying a new car anytime soon, Pioneer Electronics is selling a range of in-car entertainment after-market options that can be installed in your existing vehicle—the AVH-X8890BT (Rs39,990), AVIC-F70BT (Rs49,990) and AVIC-F80BT (Rs51,990) are some systems that support both CarPlay and Android Auto. Sony offers the XAV-AX100 (Rs26,990) infotainment system, with similar capabilities for supporting your smartphone. Both Apple and Google are working on updates to further improve in-car infotainment experience. In fact, the latest iOS 10.3 software now rolling out for the iPhone tweaks the interface and improves ease of use of apps such as Apple Music and Maps. Safety and maintenance: The value additions Smart features aren’t only about entertainment. Ford’s Sync system, for instance, can automatically call the emergency helpline with location coordinates. The new Ford Endeavour has advanced sensors that can semi-automatically park the mammoth vehicle for you. Honda as well as Mahindra and Mahindra now offer apps that connect your phone with your car and send you a treasure trove of information. If you happen to own a Honda car (City, Amaze and Jazz included), the Connect (Rs7,999) plugs into the car’s on-board diagnostics port, and pairs with your iPhone or Android phone. What you get is access to vehicle data, including engine and battery health, ability to locate the vehicle, analyse driving quality, service reminders, even call the helpline in case of an accident. “Cars are increasingly taking the place of a second home and we believe that customers are progressing rapidly. They are looking forward to entertainment and convenience as an option easily made available,” says Guillaume Sicard, president, Nissan India operations. Big business Tech companies understand the market potential. Research firm McKinsey and Co. suggests that the global market for connectivity components and services will reach €170 billion (around Rs11.8 trillion) by 2020, up from just €30 billion in 2014. Research firm PwC suggests that worldwide sales of connected-car products will increase almost fourfold by 2020 and will be worth $149 billion (around Rs9.7 trillion) for the passenger cars that you and I will probably buy. In October, chipmaker Qualcomm said it would acquire semiconductor manufacturer NXP and its portfolio of automotive micro controllers for a total enterprise value of approximately $47 billion, which makes Qualcomm the world’s largest automotive chipmaker. Security fears There is just one catch: genuine fears about connected car security. In February, security firm Kaspersky Labs’ report suggested that what you do with your phone too has a huge bearing on your connected car’s security. One fear is that malicious users may find a vulnerability that would allow them to obtain access to the server that sends the data to the car’s on-board system. So you should not install unverified apps on your phone, and avoid unauthorized software tweaks (such as “rooting” an Android phone) that will alter the built-in security mechanisms. *** Cars for the geeks You don’t need to get into the luxury brand territory to own a car that has a reasonable tech quotient. The more affordable hatchbacks and sedans are now smarter than ever before Maruti Suzuki Ignis Maruti Suzuki Ignis Rs4.59 lakh onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) This hatchback is the first in its segment to offer CarPlay and Android Auto, making it a breeze to stream music, navigate, and more. It doesn’t fall short on safety either, with dual airbags, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) and electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD). Mahindra XUV500 Mahindra XUV500 Rs12,46,631 onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) With the Blue Sense app (Android and iOS), you can control media as well as air conditioning and access data such as fuel mileage. The tyre pressure monitoring system will alert you if there are abnormal temperature changes or when leakage is detected. Honda WR-V/Honda City Honda WR-V/Honda City Rs7.75 lakh onwards/Rs8,49,990 onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) Honda’s new DigiPad infotainment system offers voice commands for phone calls and media playback. It is perplexing that Honda didn’t think CarPlay and Android Auto were important enough. But it makes up for that with a navigation system that offers traffic updates, and a built-in Web browser. Hyundai Elantra Hyundai Elantra Rs12.99 lakh onwards (ex-showroom, Delhi) The Elantra now has CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as an 8-inch HD touchscreen. It also includes French audio brand Arkamys’ smart sound algorithms—they match the music genre and surroundings to improve clarity and minimize audio quality loss.

Why? Because I’ve held the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in my hand. Experiencing these phones and then going back to Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design feels like trading in a flat-panel LCD TV for an old CRT TV. You know, those crazy old TVs from the stone age that were practically as deep as they were wide. Seriously, Samsung’s designs are that good. Unfortunately, as I explained earlier, there’s really no way that I can ditch my iPhone and jump ship to the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+, and it looks like I’m not the only one who feels this way. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus speed test: Did Samsung finally beat Apple? Apple’s next-generation iPhone 8 is expected to pull the company’s smartphone design into the modern era, ditching the home button and the massive bezels in favor of a nearly bezel-less design similar to what we’ve seen on the Galaxy S8 and LG G6. Unfortunately, there’s a whole lot of time between now and late September. Making matters even worse are several recent reports that suggest Apple’s new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus might launch in September, but the iPhone 8 might be pushed back until October or even November. As sleek as Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are, and as long as the wait is between now and the release of the new iPhone 8, are iPhone users going to abandon ship? It’s certainly likely that some people will hop off of the Apple train and give Samsung’s sleek new smartphones a try, but it looks like most Apple users we’ve seen commenting about the Galaxy S8 plan to stay in Apple’s camp despite admiring Samsung’s latest work. A recent thread on Reddit does a good job of capturing the general sentiment among most iPhone owners. They seem to agree that the new Galaxy S8 and S8+ are magnificent, but they’re sticking with their iPhones. Why? Long story short, it’s the same reason I’m sticking with my iPhone: the software. iOS is too smooth, third-party apps are too much better, integration across devices is too convenient, and updates are too fast. As great as the Galaxy S8 is, not many people are willing to give all that up for a nice design, even one as nice as Samsung’s. Head over to the Reddit thread for specifics, and let me know on Twitter if you plan to jump ship from an iPhone to a Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8+.

Apple’s Most Futuristic-Looking Computer Came Out 20 Years Ago The Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh foreshadowed the sleek design sensibilities of Jony Ive that now dominate Apple's product line. This story appeared in the April issue of VICE magazine. Click HERE to subscribe.  Apple officially turns 41 years old this month. But along with that milestone comes a stranger one that the world's wealthiest tech company is unlikely to publicize: the 20th anniversary of the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh (TAM). In 1996, Apple had reached two decades of existence without commemorating the event with new technology, but in January 1997, which marked the 20th anniversary of the company's incorporation, it announced TAM. In many ways, this gorgeous, mostly forgotten piece of computing hardware set the stage for the ultra sleek, chic Apple of 2017.  Released on March 20, the TAM was essentially the computing version of a concept car, an innovation showcase. It compared to a car in another way: it was expensive, costing $7,499 upon its release. After its launch event, The New York Times called the ambitious effort a "Ferrari-on-a-desktop." The problem was—like the similar gambit of the G4 Cube a few years later—it had the body of a Ferrari, without a matching engine. With a 12-inch screen and a trackpad, it looks like a desktop designed in a laptop mold. And it had an odd focus on multimedia, despite marketing aimed at the executive suite: It had a built-in TV tuner and FM radio, and its Bose speaker system was so integral to its design that the power supply was integrated into the subwoofer. The device was so expensive that, initially, a limo driver in a tuxedo delivered it to buyers (really). And unless you're a hardcore Apple nerd, you've likely only ever seen one in a movie (2006's Children of Men). But despite its failure, it was an important preview as to where Apple was going as a company, as it suggested the budding influence of an inventive industrial designer. "I think more significant, more exciting, is the indication, is the signal that Apple takes design very seriously, that Apple is prepared to innovate, maybe ask more questions than provide answers for, but that we're pushing design extremely aggressively as we close the millennium," said Apple's then shaggier Jonathan Ive, in a promotional video.  A year and a half later, Apple released the iMac, a machine designed by Ive, and Steve Jobs raised the profile of the budding designer within the company after he returned as CEO. The iMac remains an industry-leading computer to this day, even if the Twentieth Anniversary Mac is mostly a footnote.

The iPhone 7 Has Arbitrary Software Locks That Prevent Repair The home button is no longer swappable, a concerning move for people who think they actually own the electronics they buy. Apple has taken new and extreme measures to make the iPhone unrepairable. The company is now using software locks to prevent independent repair of specific parts of the phone. Specifically, the home buttons of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are not user replaceable, raising questions about both the future repairability of Apple products and the future of the thriving independent repair industry. The iPhone 7 home button will only work with the original home button that it was shipped with; if it breaks and needs to be replaced, a new one will only work if it is "recalibrated" in an Apple Store.  The home button has two functions: Touch ID, which unlocks the phone, and the actual "return to home" function you get when you push it. In the iPhone 5S, 6, and 6S, a new home button would break the phone's TouchID functionality, but the button's return-to-home functionality still worked. The phone could still be locked and unlocked as normal by entering a pin number, suggesting that the two functions are separate pieces of software that are not tied together. In the iPhone 7, both Touch ID and return-to-home functionality are locked by software if you replace the button. Locking down Touch ID makes at least some sense from a security perspective, but locking return-to-home functionality seems like an arbitrary and vindictive move against independent repair businesses and consumers. Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the issue.  It should be noted that the new home button is a "solid state" part, but it is still separate component that can be removed and moved to another phone without damaging it. "Not supporting that menu function makes no sense," Justin Carroll, owner of FruitFixed, an independent iPhone repair shop, told me. "Just a sad and petulant move on their part that will directly affect consumers especially after their one year manufacturer warranty is up." An Apple Store Genius confirmed to me that the home button is only replaceable in Apple Stores and can only be fixed using Apple's proprietary "iPhone Calibration Machine." "If any damage to the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus home button is done, we cannot replace it." In a video demonstrating the block, Michael Oberdick, owner of the independent iPhone repair shop iOutlet, swapped the front displays (and home buttons) of two iPhone 7 devices. When swapped, the phone displays an error message that says "The Home Button May Need Service." Its functionality is disabled and "Assistive Touch" automatically pops up on the device, creating an onscreen, software-based home button. Oberdick said that for third party repair companies, this means they often won't be able to guarantee to customers that they can fix their cracked screens, because often home button damage isn't immediately apparent. "If any damage to the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus home button is done, we cannot replace it," Oberdick told me. "In repair, we run across occasions where there is damage to the home button. We cannot always tell if the home button functions pre-repair or if the glass cracking caused a tear of the home button cable during removal of the LCD." This may sound like an esoteric issue, and to some extent it is—screen replacements can still be done so long as the original home button is carefully removed and moved to the new screen. But software locks specifically designed to prevent repair are a monopolistic, anti-consumer move that attempts to "tie" an electronic to the manufacturer even after it's already been sold. Software locks are common in other industries—John Deere tractors, for instance, cannot be repaired without specific software codes from a John Deere dealer, and many industrial appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners have similar locks. These locks have become key to the right-to-repair debate, which posits that consumers should not be beholden to the manufacturer's whims on products that they ostensibly own. This isn't the first time Apple has tried to impose a software lock on the iPhone, but it's the first time that one has been pre-baked into a device. Last year, "Error 53," a software update that bricked phones that had their screens replaced by third party repair shops, caused such a shitstorm that Apple had to eventually reverse course and apologize.

Image: HubSpot “This is the first time ever in the history of software that we have a fighting chance at creating actually intuitive software,” said HubSpot’s Dharmesh Shah on the advent of AI and natural language processing UIs. CTO Dharmesh Shah and CEO Brian Halligan founded HubSpot almost 11 years ago when they were both studying for MBAs at MIT. HubSpot is a global inbound marketing and sales platform that is used by more than 18,000 businesses in 90 countries. Last year, HubSpot announced plans to create 320 new jobs at its European headquarters at One Dockland Central, which will bring total employment at the company in Dublin to more than 600 people. ‘We have plans to grow from 300 to 600-plus people in Dublin over the next few years’ – DHARMESH SHAH Prior to HubSpot, Shah founded Pyramid Digital Solutions, which was acquired by SunGard Data Systems in 2005. Dharmesh holds a BS in computer science from the University of Alabama in Birmingham and an MS in technology management from MIT. Named in the Inc Founders 40 list in 2016, he is an active member of the Boston entrepreneurial community, an angel investor in more than 60 start-ups and a frequent speaker on inbound marketing. How did the idea of HubSpot come about? Brian and I met at graduate school at MIT. He grew up in sales and I grew up in engineering. We had some shared passions, both in tech and enterprise companies particularly, but we both had a passion for small businesses. The reason for this was that we both previously worked in enterprise software in our earlier careers and the sales cycles were really long and painful, and the focus was on a small number of large companies that were paying a lot of money. At the other end of the spectrum, you have consumer start-ups, and the problem is that they are very much like a lottery ticket, where there is a binary outcome: you either end up being the next Facebook or Google, or nothing at all – there is no in-between. Brian went to work in a venture capital firm in the Boston area.We had a rapport and we discussed how we might actually start a company together some day. During the year after Brian graduated, we were working on ideas and Brian was talking to venture-backed start-ups about how they were going about marketing – and they were struggling. On the flip side, I had started a blog and traffic was rising a lot more than any of these start-ups that had professional marketers and a budget. There’s a thing called SEO, you can get traffic from Google, there are social media sites – and you need to go and get portfolio companies to do all these things. You can get WordPress for your blog, tools for your SEO. To Brian, that all sounded like a science project. He pointed to all of these 10-person companies, and that’s where we had the idea of HubSpot. All the changes in internet and marketing meant that most small and medium-sized businesses were struggling with doing this stuff and making that transition. And that was the market opportunity. That’s where HubSpot was born. What is your ethos on product building and execution? The challenge we had early on was that there were good products and companies in each of the categories we found – in SEO, for example; social media tools, blogging tools, analytical tools etc. All those things existed, but the problem we were out to solve was not a dearth of tools. The issue was getting them all to talk to each other and work together. It was not trivial. And the reason we made that seemingly foolish choice was that we wanted to solve the problem the customer actually had. HubSpot wanted to create that all-in-one experience. We were very inspired by Apple. Apple’s whole take is keeping everything integrated and all in one place. Apple is good at selling to people already using something, but it is unique at getting non-consumers to start consuming new things by simplifying products and, to do that, they control the entire ecosystem. When you put all the pieces together, it is the best overall experience. In theory, it sounds like a good thing and in practice, it worked out. But, from a product development perspective, there were never enough people on the engineering team to fulfil the vision. Over time, we caught up. How did Dublin help you solve your engineering challenges? When we came to Dublin, we decided to make it our European headquarters. We were very deliberate in how we went about it. I was super-fearful of disrupting our culture by not having everybody in the same place. We are a very culture-driven company. So what was bothering me was: how do we keep the magic when we transfer it over an ocean? We took a leap of faith. One of the things we did was atypical. Companies come to Ireland for various incentives such as taxes or a cheaper labour pool. We didn’t think about any of those things. What we did was we decided that in order for the culture to work, and for us to overcome the core fear that we had, was to make Dublin equal in every way to our HQ in Boston. Culturally, first and foremost, we made it clear to staff: you are a HubSpotter and you have an inalienable right to everything. Even though it so happens that you are across an ocean, you will still experience the full force of it. Our head of recruiting came over and was finding engineers as good as – if not better than – back in Boston and we said, ‘Let’s keep doing that’. And here we are, 300-plus people. It’s been a phenomenal story for us. How has Dublin been from a tech talent perspective? There’s a reason why we chose Dublin over London, and that was that the same advantage that Boston had. We had room to build an employer brand. Boston is a small city versus San Francisco, and part of our motivation for Dublin was the same and that worked out well. It is a city where we can build an employer brand and a reputation as a great place to work – a lot of similarities to Boston. We have plans to grow from 300 to 600-plus people in Dublin over the next few years. It has gotten harder. The big issue we have now is less about talent and more about real estate and being able to grow. We are not the only ones to have discovered Dublin, evidently. What kind of technical challenges do you have? Is your stack fully formed? Yes, it is. We have all of those classic issues such as multiple dimensions, including scaling. The scale we have to deal with is not just the number of customers, but those customers themselves are growing in terms of the traffic they are getting to their websites, which was the whole reason for adopting HubSpot in the first place. We have to deal with that geometric increase, but we have an amazing infrastructure-as-a-service team internally. We are all on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and that helps us to scale economically. One of the other challenges we have had over the last couple of years has been fixes around user experience and design. We went from having five or six full-time designers in the last two years to more than 24. The whole mobile movement is a particular design and engineering challenge. You want to get to core features and business applications on iPhone or iPad or Android. Our entire mobile team is here in Dublin. Overall, we have between 50 and 70 product engineering people here. We are also at the beginner stages of understanding AI. This is a by-product of the machine learning revolution, and AI progress is seen across the industry, in terms of how chatbots and conversational UIs are becoming much more prevalent. How do you see AI manifesting itself at HubSpot? Since the first wave of AI, we have been working on it. For our direct marketers, we have a chatbot product called GrowthBot and it works in Slack, Facebook Messenger and other platforms such as Google Analytics. GrowthBot lets you type in a question like, ‘How was my traffic to the website last week?’, and it not only comes back with the answer, but lets you do competitive research; for example, ‘How much does Intercom spend on pay-per-click ads?’. And so, there are all these data sources out there. We have all of this stuff in one bot. It is the number two ranked bot in the market on Slack’s app store. We are piggybacking on AI, natural language processing and APIs in this area. It is one of the big developments that have happened over the past year and a half, because all of the big tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and others have started to expose their machine learning and natural language developments as APIs. We started this development a year ago, and it is getting thousands of users a week. It is super-popular on Slack and we are looking at Microsoft Teams as one of the other work-based collaboration platforms. What predictions do you have for the near future of AI? It has been fascinating to see. I am a big proponent of conversational user interfaces specifically, and the reason for that is that I have been in software for more than 25 years; and all of those 25 years, in the history of interfaces and how we interact with computers, it has been done on screens. It started with desktop clients such as Windows and macOS. Then the browser came along, and it was still a desktop interface, but it was simpler and refined. Then the mobile interface came and now you can touch, swipe, pinch and zoom, and you are directly interacting with the data. Across all three generations, all of them have pixels in common. And it works! The problem with software developers is that we claim to build easy-to-use, intuitive software, but everybody says that. You still have to learn how to use the platforms to get the answers and outcomes you seek. But that’s not necessarily intuitive. You should just be able to just talk to the software and ask questions like, ‘How many customers do I have in Norway?’, and have it come back with the answer. That’s intuitive. This is the first time ever in the history of software that we have a fighting chance at creating actually intuitive software. It is not going to replace desktop or mobile apps, but now we are going to get a whole new set of use cases that we weren’t able to do before, because we were constrained by screens and pixels and how much stuff you could design onto a screen.

Apr 6 Why Pro Matters In the light of Apple’s recent, incredibly surprising reveal of their plans for the Mac Pro, I wanted to write a bit about the (literally) immeasurable value of their Pro Mac user base. As John Gruber mentioned, the Mac market is negligible next to the iPhone market: Even among pro users, notebooks are by far the most popular Macs. In second place are iMacs. The Mac Pro is third. Apple declined to describe the Mac Pro’s share of all Mac sales any more specifically than “a single-digit percent”, but my gut feeling is that the single digit is a lot closer to 1 than it is to 9. The desktop market is a small shard of a chunk, and out of that, the Mac Pro users are an even smaller one: a single-digit percentage of all Macs. So why would Apple even bother with this group? I won’t lie; even though I am an ex-Mac Pro owner and one of the biggest whiners online for a new Mac Pro, I expected Apple to outright abandon this market. I figured they simply didn’t care enough about this segment anymore and they would let the companies that entered the currently-vacuous-space of Pro creative computers take over. Several companies are already making moves. I went and bought the Surface Studio. It made me incredibly happy, yet profoundly sad that it wasn’t Apple making it. This week showed that Apple isn’t going to let that group of users slide. Let’s talk about Macs for a moment. They’re a classic story of an underdog: as the PC was conquering the market, the Mac somewhat miraculously emerged as the choice of design professionals. Steve Jobs proudly marketed it towards the ‘Crazy Ones’ in their marketing. Adobe initially favored Apple’s platform for its creative software like Photoshop and Illustrator. Add the late (RIP) QuarkExpress DTP software, along with other smaller creative apps and you can see how people came to prefer the Mac for creative work. In 2001, Apple moved Mac OS to a UNIX base, appealing to the scientific computing community as well as developers. What happened next was very interesting. As Apple focused on creating a healthy developer environment with good tools, a huge explosion in digital and web design happened. Macs became the tool of choice of this new wave of designers, and as the web evolved Apple kept its OS and app ecosystem in sync with its trends; as online video became popular, Apple offered the easiest editing software in iMovie. Blogs and RSS had a peak; Macs came with iWeb that let you author blogs literally out of the box. These designers started to code, or came in contact with developers. As a result, Apple’s Mac OS third party software ecosystem thrived. Apple’s intense focus on design, in its computers and in its user interfaces, helped its creative users realize what a interactions with a computer and software could be. There was a lot of tinkering, but beyond that: Art in apps became a real thing. We had smoking disc burning apps (no, really: an app with a smoke simulation system as you burned a disc). A piece of cataloging software that let you literally shelve your books (and later, items in your home). Some fun people got together to make an uninstaller modeled after a laser gun. Others took Apple’s approach to making something ‘stupid easy’ and took a complex, inaccessible thing and made it understandable to an entirely new class of nontechnical users, like the ultra-polished CSSEdit or Panic’s Coda. I actually learned CSS thanks to CSSEdit’s — at the time, totally unique — X-Ray and Override feature that let you click website elements, view their styles and live-edit them. The list goes on, and what Apple had created started giving back to them: a beautiful exploration in browsing music, Coverflow, was a standalone app but its creators were acqui-hired by Apple and the UI and technology integrated into the first iPhone OS and Mac OS X Leopard. Exploration of small UI in Mac OS X Tiger’s Dashboard widgets informed the user interface of the first iPhone. Beautiful mini-apps already existed there, like Delivery Status and Ski Report. All of this existed because Apple invested hugely in developing its OS, packing great APIs and innovations into at every release, as well as keeping a big, healthy, frequently updated set of computers for every niche. I know designers that switched to Macs coming from a professional 3D background, editing special effects for feature films, designing immersive Flash (remember Flash?) website experiences and more — who all went and ended up working on apps. Many jumped from a PC to a beefy Mac Pro. Others got a Mac Mini, uninterested in buying an expensive new laptop or screen. Others yet got in with the sleek MacBook Pros, only to ditch the PC for their 3D / animation rendering work and buying a Mac Pro. I was one of the latter. This scene of creative software development and ‘app artists’ was swirling at an absolute storm of activity when Apple suddenly released the iPhone. All these people who were already making these fantastically beautiful apps or just part of the community were suddenly eager to build apps for this new device. Some even did before you were able to; bypassing limitations before the App Store came into existence. Lucas Newman and Adam Betts’ Lights Off game and Iconfactory’s Twitterrific were pre-App Store iPhone apps. Photo credit: iMore Eventually, Apple opened the gates. What happened next was incredible. The Nokia N95 was the absolute state of the art at the time. This was the state of mobile software pre-App Store: Here’s the same app from the first iPhone OS: Apple massively innovated with a phone that was essentially a highly capable, all-screen multi-purpose computer in your pocket. Thanks to the Mac, it instantly had an audience of skilled, creative and passionate makers that were eager to bring all their artistry and experience to an entirely new class of product. iPhone marked a huge revolution in software: no such shift in the quality of software since has ever happened again. Almost overnight, we went from rudimentary fragments of a utility to mind-blowing experiments on a tiny computer that went with us everywhere. And apps were gorgeous. A huge, creative base was unleashed on an entirely new medium all at once. iOS quickly became a playground where modern technological UI conventions and entire new product categories were invented. And again, like with the Mac, Apple got a lot back from what it created. You could argue that Apple was inspired by an app back then Classics, with its actual-page-flipping UI to create iBooks. (I worked on Classics with the talented David Lanham, Andrew Kaz and Phill Ryu) We all know the iPhone story after this. It became the rocket engine to power Apple’s rise to the most profitable company on Earth. We can excuse Apple for losing sight of what made that so special and such a success; in creating such excellent products on the computer and phone side, they had an ecosystem that produced beautiful work almost automatically. It was a wonderful combination of factors. But since then, Apple has focused almost exclusively on its massive moneymakers and not so much on the Mac or creative professionals. In fact, they let the creatives that brought them to that point down. As they focused solely on the iPhone and iPad, they let the Mac languish, with a lack of updates to the hardware making it increasingly difficult to use the Mac for demanding work. The Mac Pro itself was removed from sale and replaced with a somewhat tone-deaf ‘Trash Can’ edition that was non-upgradable, impossible to expand and severely underpowered soon after launch. And year after year, without any word from Apple, the professional desktop Macs got older without updates. Four years passed. Four years. An eternity and a half in computers. Creatives started to leave. Most of my friends that are in 3D, film and other creative industries have switched to PCs. And more continue to leave. Why? The next wave of creative work is here. It requires a great deal more power than Apple’s sleek laptops offer today. In the last years, real-time ray tracing became a thing in 3D. It’s hard to overstate how much of a big deal this is. In a recent talk at FITC Amsterdam, artist Raul Marks (famous for working on inimitable titles for Westworld, True Detective and Halt and Catch Fire) stated he used to have to rely on the rendering farm of Elastic to get his work done. Creatives are losing the option to use Macs to create work like this. Now, he can work from Australia; previewing how his renders will turn out from the comfort of his home by realtime-raytracing his scenes. This is only possible with powerful modern GPUs paired up with Octane Render. The same kind of huge leaps are happening in gaming and game development; a powerful modern GPU is a requirement for working on and using VR and AR, one area Apple is said to be working on. Demand and interest in 3D work, for design, game and software development, and video is bigger than ever and growing exponentially. Without a truly top-tier workstation, Apple will miss out on a huge segment of digital creatives that can craft the future of human-machine interaction — something way beyond tapping a piece of glass. It would lack a Mac workstation with the raw computing power to prototype VR and AR interactions, build game worlds, simulate complex models and render the effects of tomorrow’s great feature films all the while offering those same creatives a platform to create for its own mobile devices. Before this week’s announcement, it was looking like the future would simply pass Apple by. And I was convinced — me, an ex-Apple designer with the greatest passion for Macs — that I had bought my last Mac, and would finally be forced to switch back to PCs. I’m incredibly relieved I won’t be. Apple Tech Creative Design Apps 117 6 BlockedUnblockFollowFollowing Sebastiaan de With Designer and founder of Pictogram, photographer, motorcycle traveler.

In late March, Apple pulled its iOS 10.3 update from beta and released it for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. A week later, Apple replaced iOS 10.3 with a new iOS 10.3.1 update. iOS 10.3.1 a small maintenance release with a security patch and bug fixes on board. If you are coming to iOS 10.3.1 from the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3 update, your download will be pretty small, just a few megabytes. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from something older than that, your iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to the previous versions of iOS. They’re baked into iOS 10.3.1. Today we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know if you already downloaded iOS 10.3.1 or if you’re thinking about installing the iOS 10.3 update on your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. This roundup looks at the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.1 update’s performance, the current state of iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.1 problems, and a quick glimpse at what’s next from Apple and iOS 10. iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.1 Review: Impressions   1 / 9 Before we get into the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.1 update's performance, a quick note about the iOS 10.3.1 installation process.  The iOS 10.3.1 download/installation process took us about 7 minutes to complete. Of course, we were coming from the device's iOS 10.3 update.  If you are coming to iOS 10.3 from iOS 10.2.1 or older, your iOS 10.3.1 installation could take upwards of 20 minutes.  We suggest putting 30 minutes of quiet time aside to monitor the download and the installation process for problems. We didn't run into any issues but there's always potential for trouble. We've been using the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.1 update for just about a week now and the update is performing well on our iPhone 6s models.  Battery life is holding up and we haven't seen any abnormal drain on the devices we're using to test the iOS 10.3 update. We're still able to get a full day of use when using a mixture of Wi-Fi and LTE.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3 and you're seeing abnormal battery drain issues, give it a couple of days. Sometimes it takes a few days for the battery to settle in. If the problems persist, you'll want to dig into some fixes. Connectivity remains stable as we push away from the update's release date. We've tested the phone and the update with several ISPs, routers and Bluetooth devices and we haven't noticed any major issues with our connections. They remain strong and fast. The iPhone 6s' UI is fast and we haven't experienced any lag, random reboots or freezes during our testing. The iOS 10.3.1 update feels stable and fluid. So far, the transition from iOS 10.3 to iOS 10.3.1 has been extremely smooth. We haven't run into any significant performance issues at the week milestone. The iOS 10.3.1 update is certainly worth a look if you're running into issues on an older version of iOS 10 or if you're concerned with security.  If you're coming from an older version of iOS, like iOS 9, you might want to snag a second opinion before installing the update on your device. For more, take a look at our reasons to and not to install iOS 10.3.1 today.   1 / 9

Apple continues to refine its iOS 10 operating system with milestone upgrades and maintenance releases. The latest, iOS 10.3.1, is a small update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Unlike its predecessor, iOS 10.3, the iOS 10.3.1 update brings a few bug fixes and one security update. The iPad’s iOS 10.3.1 update is small but it’s important and worth monitoring as we push into the month of April. If you’re coming to iOS 10.3.1 from iOS 10.3 your update will only be a few MB. If you’re coming from something older than iOS 10.3, your iPad’s iOS 10.3.1 update will be much larger thanks to the fixes and features from iOS 10.3 and/or previous versions of iOS. They’re baked in. This roundup takes a look at the iOS 10.3.1 update’s performance on a few iPad models, the iOS 10.3.1 problems plaguing the iPad, and a quick look at the update that will follow the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ll continue to update this with new information so check back in as the month goes on. iPad iOS 10.3.1 Update Review: First Impressions   1 / 7 We've installed the iOS 10.3.1 update on four iPad variants: The 9-inch iPad Pro, the iPad Air 2, the iPad mini 2, and the original iPad Air. Over the past few days we've been taking a look at several key areas of performance including including battery life, connectivity, and UI speed.  So far, battery life has been excellent on all three of these iPad models. We have, however, observed abnormal battery drain on the iPad Pro.  For some reason, the YouTube application is not agreeing with Apple's new software and has been draining the device's battery, severely, in the background. If you use the YouTube app on your iPad, this is something to be aware of.  If you recently installed iOS 10.3.1, give the battery a few days to settle in. If you continue to see issues with battery life, you should take action. Apple's next iOS update could still be a few weeks out.  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are both holding up as well. We've tested these slates with several different ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we haven't run into any problems with speed or random disconnects. Our connections are stable.  We're using the iPad mini 2 on AT&T's network and we haven't noticed any issues with cellular data. LTE and 4G are working fine.  We haven't noticed any random reboots or freezes/lockups and we've noticed improvements to the UI speed on the iPad Air 2 and the iPad mini 2, particularly when opening up folders and apps. This was an issue for us on iOS 10.2.1 and below. iOS 10.3.1 feels a lot faster.  We'll be back with some more long-term feedback about the iOS 10.3.1 update's performance next week. For now, take a peek at our list of reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update right now.    1 / 7 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

It’s actually been more than a year if you count my time with my first review unit. In any case, I’ve been making use of a 12.9-inch original iPad Pro since March of 2016. Since then there’s been no single smart device (other than a smartphone) that I’ve used so consistently. Main Use The main thing I use the iPad Pro for is illustrating pictures using Adobe Illustrator Draw. While other drawing apps have caught my attention for short periods of time, no one app has felt so solid and worked so well. In Adobe Illustrator Draw I can create vector illustrations with a set of tools that’s versatile enough to make almost anything, and limited in its scope to the point where I feel at home on the device I’m using. It’s a very similar setup on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 – same app, almost he same functionality. Have a peek at my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Review to see all the ins and outs of that top-notch device. The reason I continue to use the iPad Pro instead of switching to the Tab S3 is simple: the iPad Pro is bigger. With the setup I have now with the iPad Pro, I illustrate images every night – almost every single evening. Some examples of the things I’ve drawn over the past year are included in the gallery below. Each of these images were originally illustrated in Adobe Illustrator Draw on the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. Apple Pencil Size/Grip Issue The Apple Pencil is too small for my hand when I’m drawing for extended periods of time. More than once I’ve gotten cramps in my hand from this piece of hardware’s size and shape. Luckily I had a few packets of Sugru left over from the time I did our initial Sugru Review. With this puddy-like substance, I was able to easily fashion myself a custom-fitted grip for the Apple Pencil – one that stays in place and fits to the contours of my grip precisely. GRIP: It looks like wadded-up bubble gum, but it’s actually Sugru (see link above) – and it’s actually pretty great stuff. Once I’d increased the diameter of the Apple Pencil, my issues with cramps disappeared. I have similar issues with other styli before – all with a similar size or smaller. The only stylus I’ve used any time recently that gave me no issue whatsoever was the one included with the Wacom Cintiq 27 QHD Touch. Have a peek at our Wacom Cintiq 27 QHD Touch Review to learn more about that massive device and generously-sized stylus. QUICK FIX: That’s electrical tape to keep the Lightning plug converter attached to the Apple Pencil while I leave the magnetic cover back in the box so as not to lose either one. I also have a tiny issue with the charging situation on this device. To charge the Apple Pencil, the user needs this teeny tiny converter – about 1/3 the size of a stick of gum. Some 3rd-party accessory makers have thought of solutions for keeping the lid on the Lightning plug (otherwise only held on magnetically). But I’ve yet to find a better solution for keeping track of the converter here than using some super fashionable electrical tape to keep it stuck to the Apple Pencil itself. Battery Life Battery Life is one of the primary reasons why I continue to use the iPad Pro so consistently. I charge it whenever I think to do so after I’ve drawn with it for an extended period of time. But almost no matter what, the iPad Pro has battery life when I hit the power or home button. This has largely been true with every iPad I’ve used over the past several years – they all seem to have infinite battery life because they’re not constantly being turned off and on to check for notifications. They aren’t smartphones, so they don’t have any reason to see a big power drain whilst not in use. This is great for me since finding a device without any battery life generally means I’ll set it to charge and move on to something else. With the iPad Pro I remain motivated to illustrate. Size and Weight The iPad Pro is a size and weight to which I’ve quickly become accustomed. The iPad Pro is heavy enough that I feel like the project I’m working on is being worked on with a professional set of tools. The iPad Pro is just large enough for the sort of illustrations I tend to do. I can work in one area of the image while the rest remains visible. Apple’s folding Smart Cover and Silicone Case are ideal for my setup. They add very little weight, protect the back and the display, and give the setup a bit of extra grip. With the Smart Cover I’m also given the opportunity to set the iPad Pro up on its side if I need to switch from my knee – the place I most often place the device to draw. Wrap-up The pricing for the iPad Pro is something you’re still going to need to consider for yourself. For me, the experience has been well worth what the iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, Smart Cover, and Silicone Case – plus an Adobe Cloud subscription – cost all together. Especially if you’re able to turn a profit on whatever it is you like to work on with this set of tools, the value can vary wildly. I’ve been surprised at the small variety of different sorts of activities I’ve done on the iPad Pro – but not disappointed. Not at all disappointed. The iPad Pro has allowed me to keep practicing a set of skills I hadn’t otherwise paid significant attention to for quite a few years. With the simplicity of the setup and the extraordinarily powerful tools it allows me to utilize, the iPad Pro is easily one of my favorite devices in the past several years. The iPad Pro is not inexpensive. It’s a tool that costs exactly what Apple knows its worth to those with the means to buy it. This device turns illustration skills into digital artworks ready to roll in the modern multi-format world, and it’s perfect for the sort of work I do – and the sort of work I aspire to do more of in the future.

Court in London Finnish mobile device manufacturer Nokia was due to argue that Apple has infringed one of its technology patents before the High Court in London on Friday.07 Apr 2017 Patents Litigation & International Arbitration Intellectual Property Enforcement TMT Advanced Manufacturing & Technology UK Europe Nokia has claimed that Apple has infringed one of its European patents for communications technology and wants the High Court to serve the US company with an injunction banning the company from infringing that patent, and further order Apple to "take all steps as are in their power to retrieve from the channels of distribution all products the sale, disposal or keeping of which would infringe [the patent]", according to legal papers seen by Out-Law.com. The UK court action is part of a series of litigations between the two companies around the world. Late last year Nokia filed legal papers before regional courts in Dusseldorf, Mannheim and Munich in Germany, and the US district court for the eastern district of Texas. It also raised legal proceedings against Apple in France, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Japan and before the International Trade Commission, as well as the High Court in London. At the time, Ilkka Rahnasto, head of patent business at Nokia, said: "Through our sustained investment in research and development, Nokia has created or contributed to many of the fundamental technologies used in today's mobile devices, including Apple products. After several years of negotiations trying to reach agreement to cover Apple's use of these patents, we are now taking action to defend our rights." Apple separately filed legal papers in the US against Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management late last year, according to media reports at the time. Apple accused the companies of acting with Nokia to obtain unfair patent royalties from it. "We’ve always been willing to pay a fair price to secure the rights of patents covering technology in our products," Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said, according to a Reuters report. "Unfortunately, Nokia has refused to licence their patents on a fair basis and is now using the tactics of a patent troll to attempt to extort money from Apple by applying a royalty rate to Apple’s own inventions they had nothing to do with."

As part of its planned pro-oriented feature enhancements, Apple is reportedly considering allowing users to hook an iPad Pro up to a Mac so that the tablet can be used as a Cintiq-like drawing tablet for their computer. Don’t dismiss this rumor just yet. Apple actually filed for a patent application a few months ago describing a docking station with a built-in keyboard and a special cutout into which an iPhone or iPad could be inserted. This would let the docked iOS device act as a multi-touch trackpad complete with Force Touch controls via 3D Touch and haptic feedback via Taptic Engine. According to the invention, the screen of the docked iOS device could even double as a drawing tablet for Mac apps, according to Apple’s patent application for an “Electronic accessory device”. Today’s rumor reminded me of Astropad, an awesome app by former Apple engineers that made its App Store debut a little more than two years ago. It basically turns an iPhone or iPad into a drawing tablet for your Mac with full support for Apple Pencil on iPad Pros. With Astropad, you draw into Mac apps like Photoshop via your iOS device’s screen, using your finger, Apple Pencil or 3D Touch with pressure sensing. Here’s Astropad in action. With its fast, fluid engine and virtually zero lag, small wonder some professional artists have now replaced their Wacom tablet with Astropad and an iPad with Apple Pencil. Aside from Apple Pencil compatibility, the app works with FiftyThree’s Pencil stylus and other styli, too. Astropad Studio for iPad is available at no charge via App Store, but you’ll need to buy a subscription via the In-App Purchase mechanism to use all the features: $9.99 per month or $64.99 per year. If you’d rather buy the app outright, Astropad Standard for iPad is available on App Store for $29.99. The iPhone, iPod touch and Apple Watch version of Astropad is free on App Store.

Become Your Hotel Concierge AI Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members Tech giants and competitors Apple and Amazon are vying for the very profitable spot as the go-to tech in hotel rooms Ivanha Paz 5 april 2017 The voice-controlled battle continues. Alexa and Siri have been fighting it out for a spot in our living rooms, our cars—and our hearts. Following Amazon’s footsteps and actually improving on it, Apple released its ‘Home’ application last year. Like Alexa it’s a home assistant, but with a wider selection of automation equipment. Now tech giants and competitors Apple and Amazon are vying for the very profitable spot as the go-to hotel butler. Currently being tested by Marriott, the international hotel chain will determine which one, Siri or Alexa, is best for their guests to use for simple tasks such as turning lights on or drawing the curtains, by just telling them out loud. This is a tight race, and whoever claims the victory stands to win a huge paycheck—not just from Marriott, but from the general boost in sales the chosen device is sure to see. And for those who like the efficiency of a voice controlled assistant in their lives, this race is good news. Just like Apple improved upon Amazon’s Alexa last year, we can expect to see automation taken to the next level as these two try to outdo each other. Amazon has already been stepping up its game hitting the food industry with Alexa features in a new LG Fridge and hospitals with a Boston Children’s Hospital app that allows the device to give medical advice. According to Bloomberg, Marriott could be making a decision this summer. One thing is certain, though. No matter who wins, automation is definitely here to stay. A seamless voice controlled assistant might very well be a part of every day life—not just in our homes, but in many other places we don’t even suspect yet.

Apple might be going pro with the iMac. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 7, 2017 at 8:15AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-centric website MacRumors recently reported on a recent post in blog Pike's Universum, in which a purported list of specifications/upgrades for Apple's next-generation iMacs -- which the blog says will be coming in "late October" -- is provided. Though you can see the full specification list here, there's one part of the specification list that's worth doing a sanity check on -- the main processor. Image source: Apple. No more Core processors for the iMac?  Apple's iMac computers have traditionally used chip-giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core processor family. Today, Apple's iMacs can be configured with Intel's Core i5 chips, the middle-of-the-pack within Intel's Core processor lineup, or Core i7 chips, the cream of the crop. This new rumor claims that, instead of using Intel's Core chips, Apple will use Intel's Xeon E3 processors. Despite the fancy-sounding name, Intel's Xeon E3 chips are little more than Intel's Core processors with a few additional capabilities enabled -- namely, support for ECC memory and vPro technology. ECC memory -- ECC stands for "error correcting code" -- is a type of memory that, according to memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), includes capabilities designed for "detecting and correcting single-bit memory errors." "By detecting and correcting single-bit errors, ECC server memory helps preserve the integrity of your data, prevent data corruption, and prevent system crashes and failures," Micron's webpage explains. I suspect that, if Apple really does shift its iMac line to Xeon E3 processors and away from Intel's traditional Core processors, it would be doing the shift mainly for ECC memory support. Does this make sense? If Apple's goal is to position the iMac -- and indeed, the Mac itself -- as a "professional" platform, then the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory makes perfect sense. Apple already uses Intel Xeon E5 processors coupled with ECC memory in its Mac Pro line, so it's not as though use of such technologies would be unprecedented. What's worth noting, though, is that, while the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory may appeal to professionals and prosumers, these features don't really buy the average consumer much. In fact, Apple will almost certainly have to jack up prices on its ECC-capable iMac computers to compensate for what are likely to be higher memory prices. So, does Apple force all potential iMac buyers to eat the costs of more expensive memory? Or does Apple simply offer "Core" options and "Xeon" options? Given how pricey Apple's iMac computers tend to be anyway -- and the supply-chain complexity of supporting too many computer models -- Apple may simply bet that its customer base won't mind a modest price increase due to the slightly pricier memory, and go all-in on Xeon. Foolish takeaway If Apple's goal is to position its Mac products as true "professional" products, while pushing more consumption-oriented consumers over to its iPad product line, then a move to Xeon-based iMacs (and MacBook Pros) with ECC memory support may be the right way to go. Apple may find that Xeon processors -- by their server/workstation heritage -- are more marketable to the professional/prosumer crowd, and even "regular" consumers might be enticed by the fact that, when they buy an Apple product, they get a Xeon processor rather than a "pedestrian" Core processor. I have no idea if this rumor is true, but it's certainly plausible.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

And it has been brutalised by my extreme usage. And yet, besides a few dings here and there, one would find it very hard to imagine the type of abuse this phone has gone through. A couple of my friends who also use the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus as their daily driver will also attest to this. For the record Apple uses series 7000 aluminium to chisel out the frame of the iPhone. Apple shifted to this high grade aluminium in 2015 when it launched the iPhone 6S in the wake of the bend-gate fiasco in 2014 when it had launched the iPhone 6. Numerous videos of the iPhone 6 had surfaced on the Internet in which the phone showed an uncanny propensity to bend, which was at odds with Apple's exacting standards of quality. Apple iPhone 7 review: Batman’s phone I have been using the iPhone 7 for the last 6 months and I have used it without a case. And it has been brutalised by my extreme usage. And yet, besides a few dings here and there, one would find it very hard to imagine the type of abuse this phone has gone through. A couple of my friends who also use the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus as their daily driver will also attest to this. This meant Apple was the first mainstream manufacturer to move to series 7000 aluminium. Typically, this is the type of alloy which is used in the construction of transport vehicles like aircrafts and even weapons like machine guns, glock handguns amongst many others. Now many wouldn't have probably known this fact, but this is one of the reasons why if you fling your iPhone 7 it will likely come unscathed with just a minor scuff mark. This trait is of course also true of the iPhone 6S which also uses the same type of metal, but it seems to me Apple has stepped up its game with the iPhone 7. This advantage gets further amplified when compared with phones that have glass backs, because the iPhone 7 is one of the few phones in the market which is fully metal from top to bottom, right to left, corner to corner. The iPhone 7 will at max get scratched or dented in case of a severe bump, some of the other phones like Samsung's Galaxies while more gorgeous will get cracked or shattered. No Gorilla Glass 5, no sapphire crystal yet very solid Even more interesting is the solution that Apple uses as a part of its cover glass. Most Android phones and even some of the earlier generation of the iPhone used to depend on Corning's Gorilla Glass . Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 uses Gorilla Glass 5, which is thinner and more solid, but the iPhone 7 which is a good 6 months older is highly likely to be infinitely sturdier. Again I've dropped my iPhone many times in the last few months. Only a couple of days ago I dropped it flat on the screen on a hard Kota Stone surface from a height of at least 4 feet. Guess what, not even a scratch. Of course, there are numerous permutations and combinations that result in the breakage of a screen one of them being the exacting angle of impact. Maybe, I've been lucky. Apple launches new affordable iPad, Special Edition (RED) iPhone 7 and doubles memory of iPhone SE I have been using the iPhone 7 for the last 6 months and I have used it without a case. And it has been brutalised by my extreme usage. And yet, besides a few dings here and there, one would find it very hard to imagine the type of abuse this phone has gone through. A couple of my friends who also use the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus as their daily driver will also attest to this. Regardless, the iPhone 7 will remain sturdier than Samsung's new hotness. Why? Because it doesn't have them curved screens which are more susceptible to damage. If you manhandle the iPhone will likely be the one that will come to your rescue. Water resistance One of the few things Apple's iPhone didn't do till the introduction of the iPhone 7 was protect the device against water damage. With the iPhone 7 having IP 67 certifications in place, it is one the phones which can be dunked in water and come out unscathed. Of course, there are other phones which also do this and in the case of the Samsung Galaxy S8, it does it better than the iPhone 7 because of its better IP68 technical rating, but in real world use the difference isn't much.

 Apple is making a curved screen for 'iPhone 8,' multiple supply-chain sources say Jim Edwards Apr. 7, 2017, 7:56 AM 34,190 facebook linkedin twitter email print A conceptual rendering by Martin Hajek of an iPhone with a curved screen.COMPUTER BILD TV Apple has placed a large order with Samsung for OLED curved-screen panels, according to multiple reports emanating from Apple's Asian supply chain. The order is fuelling rumours that at least one model in the "iPhone 8" launch expected later this year will have a curved screen. The Nikkei Asian Review reported: "A supply chain source familiar with iPhone designs revealed the size of the order, which was in line with an estimate by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. It will be the first time Apple adopts a curved OLED screen for its iPhones, marking a major overhaul and generating high expectations for the model. "'Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations,' Hsieh said." A speculative rendering from Mesut G. Designs of a curved iPhone.Mesut G. Designs DigiTimes, which has a sketchy record of reporting on iPhone rumours, on Thursday summarised other reports from Asian media of a curved-screen order: "Apple reportedly has signed a two-year contract with Samsung Display for the supply of KRW10 trillion (US$9 billion) worth of small-size curved OLED panels, according to Korea-based ET News, Chosun Biz and other media. "Based on the contract, Samsung Display will ship 70-92 million small-size OLED panels to Apple in 2017, said the reports. This means that about 30% of iPhone devices shipped in 2017 will come with curved OLED panels, given that Apple currently ships about 200 million iPhone devices a year." It is not clear whether the screens would be curved to support new functions, the way Samsung's Galaxy devices are, or whether the screen curve would be more cosmetic. Currently, the iPhone 7 Plus has a small curve at the edges of its screen where it joins the chassis, but it performs no functions. The Wall Street Journal also reported in 2016 that Apple was considering a curved screen. More recently, however, rumours have suggested Apple will stick with its more traditional all-flat design. Apple is expected to unveil three devices later this year, the 10th anniversary of the iPhone launch. A new large-format device might have a special name like iPhone 8, iPhone X, or iPhone Edition. Two smaller devices are expected alongside it that might look like traditional updates to the legacy product. Those devices are expected to have flat screens, according to DigiTimes.

It’s called Clips, because it creates video clips. Better yet, it’s free on the App Store. When you open it, you’ll be greeted with a square capture screen, looking at you through the front camera. If that reminds you of Snapchat, you’re not alone. It puts recording front and centre, it’s got a few filters, and even a bunch of overlays. Fortunately, the similarities end there. Ultimately, Clips is a new-age video editor. Don’t let that term’s ageing connotations drive you away; this is not a professional’s tool by any means. Clips is to Final Cut Pro what your Sunday gully cricket tournament is to the IPL. At the same time, it’s good enough to let you create (somewhat) professional looking content. The more video-inclined in you are probably thinking: “But I already have iMovie to fill that niche.” That’s true. For a bit of casual creative fun, iMovie on a Mac has its appeal. On the iPhone’s screen, though, it’s a whole different story. And with video slowly taking over most social apps – just scroll through your Facebook feed, if you don’t believe us – Apple’s willing to bet that Clips will find suitable use. Before you dive in with the new app, here’s what you should know. Recording, and customisation Clips offers three ways of creating video – you can click a picture or capture a video from within the app, or pull in something from your existing iPhone library, aka the Photos app. All three options are located right below the viewfinder. No matter what you pick, it’s reformatted to always fit a square aspect ratio, which is bit of a bummer. The one good thing is that you can manually swipe around with panoramas, and then Clips smooths out the motion later. Apple has baked in four ways of customising individual clips – “Live Titles”, that is text, filters, overlays, emoji, and “posters”, which are basically title cards. Filters, overlays, and posters are straight-forward to use. You pick one from the options, drag them around for placement, and can double-tap to edit the text within. Unfortunately, just like Snapchat, the emojis here don’t render in high-res. Unicode, are you listening? The first of those – Live Titles – is the most interesting aspect, as Clips can transcribe and lay out it on the video, synchronised to your talking speed. You can choose from a variety of options for the text’s appearance, and then you narrate to your iPhone while you hold the record button. Once you’ve done that, Clips will show you how your video looks with the text. You can choose to retain your speech, the text version, or both. Those are good options to have, considering how much video we watch these days tends to be silent video. You can also pause playback at any moment, and double-tap to edit the text if the voice recognition fails. It doesn’t make for the most intuitive functioning, overall. Clips doesn’t make it clear what button does what – the microphone button doesn’t record audio, it’s meant to mute you instead. Moreover, the transcribed text doesn’t appear until you’re done speaking. And if you forget to choose Live Titles before hitting the record button, you can't convert it to text later. Not cool. Editing, and sharing All video clips go into a timeline at the bottom. You can tap on any individual clip to play with its length, mute it, or get rid of it. To reorder the clips, just hold down and drag them left or right. If you import an existing video with audio, and record a voiceover, the mute option is clever enough to recognise the tracks as separate – you can unmute the recorded audio, or the original audio. Clips also lets you bring in background music to layer over the full video. That’s the icon in the top-right. You can either pick from over a dozen soundtracks supplied by Apple, or head into your personal music collection. Apple Music tracks are unfortunately not covered in the latter, which is rather disappointing considering Apple made this app itself. Once you pick your favoured song, Clips will layer it across your video. It even handles mixing on its own, making sure your narration doesn’t get drowned by the music. The only let down with the audio aspect of Clips is that you can't fine-tune the selection, or alter the volume yourself. If you’re satisfied with your creation, you just touch Done in the bottom-right of the timeline. When you tap the share button, you can either save the video (in full-HD) to your library, or share it on the social networks you prefer. In addition, there’s a new iMessage tray above that. Apple says it uses facial recognition tech to identify people in your videos, and suggest iMessage contacts accordingly. We’re not sure how well this works, but it didn’t pick up any of the faces during our initial testing, and reverted to a list of recent contacts. Clips is easy enough to play with, and it’s still advanced enough to set itself apart from Snapchat, Boomerang (from Instagram), or Facebook’s new camera. It’s much closer to what Adobe – the maker of professional video tools – has been trying on phones for some time, first with Premiere Clip, and later with Spark Video. Adobe being Adobe, both those apps offer much more granular control than Clips. If that’s more you, check them out if you haven’t already. Live Titles are unique to Clips though, and Apple’s wide influence could act in its favour. Or maybe not, who knows.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Apple Clips may be cool, but is it better than these 5 photo and video apps? Here's a list of apps you can use to create interactive videos using your Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Sami Khan   April 7, 2017 17:27 IST iPhoneREUTERS/Regis Duvignau Apple Clips is yet another iOS-exclusive feature that iPhone and iPad users can boast about with their Android friends. The app lets users create videos with ease and then share them across different social media platforms with just a tap. If you are not so good with Adobe, but wish to make that one catchy video to boost your social media presence, Apple Clips has you covered. You can add text, filters, overlays, emoji, and Apple's new posters, which are opaque title cards, voiceovers and so much more to make your video interactive and fun. While everything's great about Apple Clips, Android users crave for something equally useful. Videos are gaining a lot of traction on social media and it is only evident for tech giants such as Apple to provide necessary means to fulfill users' desires. Apple Clips may have some unique elements to stand out in the crowd, but it is certainly not the first video-making app out there. We have some video-making apps that can be used to get desired results without much strain (and yes, Android users can take part in it too). Apple ClipsApple Newsroom FxGuru (Android/iOS) If you want to add fun animations like zombie attacks and meteor strikes, FxGuru gives the best effects. You can create a Hollywood-style video with special effects to your video clips and share it with friends. The app is available for download on App Store and Google Play for free. Dubsmash (Android/iOS) It is one of the most popular video apps popularised by its fun idea of lipsyncing to pre-recorded voiceovers. There is a massive library of famous songs and dialogues, which you can act to and share the final video with friends via messaging apps or social networks. The app is free to download and it is available on both Android and iOS platforms. MSQRD (Android/iOS) MSQRD by Masquerade is a fun face-swapping app and it is owned by the social media giant Facebook. The app is available as a standalone on Android and iOS app stores for free. It can shoot videos and add effects like adding filters, swapping faces with a friend, and broadcast live on Facebook. The app became popular after it was used by famous celebrities. Quik (Android/iOS) Quik is a useful app to edit video clips, photos and add soundtracks without you doing much. The app was bought by GoPro, which makes it of great importance for those who shoot a lot of adventure videos using GoPro cameras because we all know what a pain it is to edit GoPro videos. Quik does most of the heavy-lifting for you, so you can simply share videos on social media once they're ready. VivaVideo (Android/iOS) We have used this app to create some short video clips and it comes quite handy to summarize your vacation, parties and more by stitching together short video clips and photos. You can add text to describe the content shown in the video in different styles and add background tracks to make it sound cool. The level of customisations this app offers is pretty impressive, which lets you adjust the volume of the track, audio in the video and much more. It is a free app and available for both Android and iOS users. Andromedia Video Editor (Android) Andromedia Video Editor is another great tool for making creative videos. You can organise clips, crop videos and add effects like the ones used in films to images and videos to make your video stand out in the crowd. You can add transitions, record a voice note for particular image or clip before finally sharing the videos on social media platforms. This tool is good for those who are looking to start video making and editing without prior knowledge. It is available exclusively on Android and comes free of charge.

But the key element of Martin Hajek’s concept images (which he names the iPhone X) is on the rear of the phone. Hajek imagines Apple celebrating the 10th anniversary of the iPhone with a retro look that takes us back to the very first iPhone … NordVPN Apple’s metal-backed iPhones are not transparent to radio signals, so require breaks in the metal where the antennas are located. The company has taken various approaches to that over the years, and in the original iPhone that was a sizeable black plastic section at the bottom of the phone. It is this design which Hajek shows being brought back to the iPhone 8. It’s of course an incredibly unlikely idea. Apple has worked hard over the years to make the antenna breaks as subtle as possible, along with glass-backed casings which don’t require one at all. The idea that it would return to something as obtrusive as this is hard to imagine. As for the retro appeal, Apple doesn’t have much of a track record for celebrating anniversaries. It did so in a pretty big way for the 30th anniversary of the Mac(intosh), but the company seemed to content to note the iPhone’s 10th anniversary with a press release back in January. But it’s a fun idea, and the front renders show something very much in keeping with the reports. The concept was created for Computer Bild, and you can see a set of 36 images there – or just check them out in the video slideshow below. You can find all our iPhone 8 coverage in our guide.

By Caitlin McGarry Staff Writer, Macworld | Apr 7, 2017 4:43 AM PT Credit: Apple More like this Apple's new Clips app for making stylized videos is available now Apple's new Clips app is like a simplified iMovie for viral videos 5 handy things the Photos app can do with your iPhone snapshots Video How to use iOS 10.3's new Find My AirPods feature It’s easy to compare Apple’s new iOS app, Clips, to video-sharing social networks like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. But that’s not exactly fair, because Apple’s Clips isn’t social at all—it’s designed simply to help you create and edit fun videos. What you do with them after that is up to you. This approach makes Clips less anxiety-inducing. To share a video on Instagram or Snapchat, you’ll want to shoot in Instagram or Snapchat to make sure the moment you’re capturing is perfectly framed. You can shoot in Clips, too, but this feels more like an app you’ll use after the moment has passed to stitch together memories and add a soundtrack and captions. Clips is way more low-key. But that doesn’t make it less complicated to use. In fact, it’s on par with Snapchat when it comes to unintuitive design, so be prepared to spend an exorbitant amount of time creating your first clip. (We pray it gets easier the more you use it, but time will tell.) Here’s everything you need to know about using Apple Clips. How to use Clips Caitlin McGarry/IDG See those icons on top? They unlock all of your editing tools. First thing’s first: You need photos and videos to edit, right? Right. You can import them from your Camera Roll and stitch them together, or you can shoot photos or videos in-app. Pro tip: You can swipe left on the giant red “Hold to record” button if you plan on filming for awhile to lock the camera in recording mode. Just tap the button again when you want to stop shooting. Clips defaults to the Instagram-esque square format, so if you’re importing media, make sure it’ll look good square. (Some might mind this, but I don’t.) From there you can swap videos or photos around in the visual timeline at the bottom of the app just by pressing and moving them. You can also easily trim video clips—just tap on the clip in the timeline and then tap the scissor icon to edit the video down to just the seconds (or minutes) you want to include. Along with a video-trimming tool, Clips has all the standard social video-editing features (filters, emojis, etc.) tucked behind icons at the top of the app. Tapping the speech bubble icon adds captions in real time (more on this in a minute). Eight filters, ranging from black and white to my favorite Comic Book, are behind the interlocking circles icon. The star is hiding the time, your location, shapes like circles and arrows, and random words you can edit after adding them to your image or video. The ‘T’ icon unlocks title cards that can help you tell your story—the text on these cards is also editable. The last option, a music note, is how you add a song from iTunes or an Apple-supplied tune to your video. It takes awhile to get to know the various tools and tricks to make Clips work for you, but you’ve got this. And remember that creating a clip in Clips doesn’t mean that video goes anywhere but your Camera Roll. You have to take extra steps to share it with anyone or on any platform, which makes it extremely low-pressure. Caitlin McGarry/IDG Turn on Live Titles as you're speaking to automatically translate your words to text. The best Clips features Clips has a few features that set it apart from other video-editing apps, the most notable of which is Live Titles. That’s what Apple calls its real-time captioning tool, which is designed to make your video totally watchable without sound. This is perfect for scrolling through Facebook’s auto-playing News Feed, but also improves accessibility, making videos easy to watch for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. Live Titles supports 36 languages at launch, which is a feat for a brand-new app. The Live Titles feature doesn't always nail the speech-to-text translation, though. I didn’t experience any captioning errors in my tests, but if you speak quickly and run your words together, you might confuse the algorithm parsing your sentences. Speak slowly and enunciate to avoid having to edit your captions. (I actually didn’t know this was possible, but the Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern discovered that you can edit a caption by tapping on the video clip, then pausing the video where the error appears on screen and tapping on the text. Yeah, it’s kind of a process.) But basically everything you see on screen is editable, which is incredibly useful. Every bit of text can be changed and even emojis can be easily swapped out by tapping on the emoji on-screen and then tapping again to access your emoji keyboard. In your first few hours with Clips, it’ll feel a little burdensome. But once you figure it out, creating social videos with Clips is a cinch. Apple Time to share Once your masterpiece is finished, it’s time to share it. Clips uses facial recognition to figure out who’s in your video and then suggests that you use iMessage to send your video to those friends, which is really cool. You can also share a clip via email or post it to your go-to social networks, minus Snapchat. Snapchat is not designed for sharing what’s essentially a short social movie (not to mention the fact that clips are square and snaps are vertical). But clips seem tailor-made for sharing on Facebook in particular. Imagine creating movies of your kids or making your own DIY Tasty food recipe video with Clips. Post them to your page and watch the likes roll in. It’s a good thing Apple didn’t try to build a social network around Clips (lesson learned from Ping, perhaps). Instead, Apple is doing what it does best: giving creators the tools they need to make good work. Right now, popular media tends to be short and shareable. With Clips, maybe you too can snag 15 minutes—or more likely seconds—of viral video fame. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Reuters/Chaiwat Subprasom Just a couple of days ago, Apple surprisingly announced that not only is the company going to release an iMac 2017 refresh, it’s also going to launch a pro model of the all-in-one desktop. The Mac maker did not go into details about the potential specs of the upcoming iMacs, but a new report suggests that the new desktops are going to pack powerful components. According to the Pike’s Universum, the new iMacs could house a number of upgrades that should make the desktop line-up potent enough for both regular consumers and pro users. Citing a “little bird [that] is usually pretty accurate,” the blog alleges that Apple’s new computers could include up to 64 GB of ECC RAM, AMD graphics, Intel Xeon E3 processors, faster NVMe SSDs and Thunderbolt 3 ports. Intel has yet to launch a Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, but the chip could ultimately be the E3-1280 v6 bundled with Intel HD Graphics P630. The 16 GB of ECC RAM is upgradable to 32 GB or 64 GB, according to the blog, which is in line with the most recent Mac Pro. In comparison, the current iMac line-up has 8 GB of non-ECC RAM, upgradable to 16 GB or 32 GB. ECC RAM is capable of detecting and patching up errors that can damage files and systems, so it’ll be swell if the iMac 2017 models have it. The blog claims that the “faster” NVMe SSDs can hold up to 2 TB while the AMD graphics are supposedly for VR (virtual reality) and pro app support. The likely addition of the Thunderbolt 3 ports comes as no surprise as they are currently included in the newest MacBook Pro. Apple is also apparently going to upgrade the new Mac Pro’s display and consider a name change for its operating system. “Apple is also working on [an] 8K display for the next generation of Mac Pros, which, by the way, will be much more like a PC with the next generation EFI BIOS,” alleges Pike’s Universum. “The next version of macOS won’t use a mountain [or] park name anymore. [There are] two names in the running. One starts with [an M].” According to MacRumors, one of the Cupertino, California-based tech giant’s trademarked names that could fit the description is Monterey. The blog likewise claims that the new iMacs are going to be released in late October together with a brand new keyboard. It also declared that the next Mac mini “won’t be so mini anymore.” Pike’s Universum and its report should be taken with a grain of salt.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Watch Production To Launch In Second Half Of 2017 From New Supplier Tips Report Posted: Apr 7 2017, 6:01am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, in Rumors | Apple     Compal Electronics to take over some Apple Watch manufacturing A new rumor is making the rounds that has its source in the Apple supply chain reports DigiTimes. This rumor claims that Compal Electronics has entered the supply chain for the Apple Watch. Compal is said to begin shipping Apple Watch models in the second half of 2017. That would align with previous rumors that the Apple Watch Series 3 might be introduced in September along with the new iPhone models. Don't Miss: The hottest Apple Rumors for 2017 The current generation of Apple Watch Series 2 models are built exclusively by Quanta Computer. According to this report Quanta will continue to be the manufacturer of the Apple Watch Series 3, but it seems that with the new model launch the Series 2 will still be offered. Compal Electronics will reportedly be given some of the Apple Watch Series 2 manufacturing duties with Compal focusing on some production of Series 2 products along with the new Series 3 Apple Watch. Predictions have Apple shipping 11.9 million Apple Watches in 2016 accounting for 49% of overall smartwatch shipments in the segment. To get ready for its new Apple watch manufacturing duties, the company has moved equipment used for building smart devices to plants that it has in Chongqing, China. The new production of wearables will help Compal to fill space left in its manufacturing capabilities caused by sagging notebook shipments. The facilities that Compal has in China will become the company's base for products like tablets, smartphones, and wearables. Compal is mostly known as a notebook manufacturer and is the second largest notebook ODM in the world and has been expanding into other electronics segments as notebook shipments begin to fall. Previous rumors about the Apple Watch Series 3 have given some idea of what we can expect to see in the new wearable. Big rumors include smart fabric bands, a front camera, and an integrated cellular chip. The smart fabric bands are said to be able to show data right on the band all the time, such as time, date, notifications, and more. The inclusion of a cellular chip inside the new Apple Watch will mean that the wearable can make and receive calls and have its own internet connectivity without the user needing to have a paired smartphone with them. The front camera will allow users to do things like take selfies and to have FaceTime video chats. The Apple Watch Series 3 is also tipped to get support for the Air Pods wireless earbuds, which will presumably be needed to make and receive those FaceTime calls.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Friday, April 7, 2017, 17:15 [IST] Apple has so long refrained from entering the social media space, but it looks like it has noticed the popularity of the same right now. Today, the company announced a new app called Clips. Apple Clips is a fun and quick way for you to create videos that are expressive on their iPhones and iPad. Clips help you combine videos, photos, and music into short videos that can be shared on social networks such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and others. The latest iOS app, Clips lets you create videos without much effort. Apple has many video creation tools, but this is a free and alternate option. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! It's like Snapchat Apple Clips is just like Snapchat. It offers all types of fun effects that can be used on the media such as speech bubbles, comic filters, soundtracks, shapes, animated posters, etc. These can be adjusted to suit the video you are creating. Clips also offer Live Tiles to let you animate and capture captions using your voice. How Apple Clips works? If you have created videos in Vine or Instagram, you can easily find out how to use Clips. You just have to hold down the record button to record what you want. You can record a number of clips too. Once you have recorded what you need, you need to drag the clips in the order and add emoji, filters, titles, animated icons, etc. All these can be done in seconds. If you want to insert text on-screen, you need to choose Live Titles. The words you utter will transcribed and time-coded automatically in the video. The final output can be shared on social media. Device compatibility Apple Clips is available for download in the Apple App Store for free of cost. It is compatible with devices such as iPhone 5S and above, and the newly announced iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad. It is compatible even on iPod Touch sixth generation and iPad Mini 2 and above.

What is Apple Clips and how to use it? By James Peckham How To  The next big photo editing app is here Shares Clips is a new app developed by Apple to help you customize your photos and videos before you send them out on social media to your friends and family. It works on either iPhone or iPad and includes features you may have used in Instagram, Snapseed, Prisma and a variety of other apps. The difference here though is that it's built specifically for iOS devices and that there's a new voice recognition tech that's an interesting addition to photo and video editing. How to download Clips First things first, Clips is an iOS exclusive app. You won’t be able to download this if you have an Android device, and Apple has shown no intention of porting Clips to the Google mobile platform. To download Clips on iPhone or iPad, you’ll need to have iOS 10.3 software or later running on your device. You can find out how to upgrade your iOS software here.  Compatible devices include everything from the likes of the iPhone 5, iPad 4, iPhone 5S, iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 to newer devices, like the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 7, so if you own any iDevice made in the last few years you'll be able to upgrade to iOS 10.3. Downloading Clips from there is then as simple as heading to the App Store and searching for Clips. If you're on mobile, you can use this link to the Apple Store here. Clips is free to download too. How to use Apple Clips We've been playing with Apple Clips and below we'll talk you through what Clips can do, as well as offering a few tips and tricks for Apple's latest app. You can use your voice to add captions Apple Clips is different to the competition thanks to its voice recognition feature. This allows you to speak to your phone and have the app automatically translate what you say into on-screen captions. To do this you’ll need to press on the speech bubble on the black bar at the top of the screen. You can then choose your caption type; there are seven available. When you’ve selected one, you can hold down the red record button and speak over the top of the video. In our testing we found it to work quite accurately in quiet locations, but you may struggle if there’s a lot of noise around you. Complicated words may also be a bit of a struggle for the app. There are filters - but they're not great Much like with Instagram and other photo editing apps, Clips allows you to add filters over the top of your snaps. It also works over the top of video clips. Apple has limited options when it comes to filters though. There are filters called Chrome, Ink, Comic Book, Transfer, Fade, Instant and Noir, but none of them are particularly different to what the competition offers. There are fun effects too Apple has included a few speech bubbles, arrows and logos you can put over the top of your images. Some provide extra information such as your location or what time you took the photo – they act in a similar way to Snapchat filters – so you may find them useful to lay over your image before sending it to your friends. Plus you can add music to your video too Apple has allowed you to include music in your videos as well. If you hit the musical note in the top right corner of the screen when looking at a video clip you've created, you can find a track to suit your video as well as select a volume and do some minor tweaking to the audio. This won't block out any audio you've recorded either and you'll still be able to hear your voice over the top of the music. Then you can share directly to social media You can share these simply to a variety of social media channels including Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, plus you can also send the clips and photos in messaging apps like WhatsApp or iMessage. To do so, find the file you've finished and press on the box with an arrow coming out in the bottom right corner of the screen. Then you can find the social network or messaging app you're looking for in that list and hit share. Want to know more about iOS?

Apple's new 9.7-inch iPad which was launched last month will now be up for pre-order on Flipkart starting today. The WiFi only variant is priced at Rs 28,900 for the 32GB internal storage and Rs 39,900 for 32GB WiFi and Cellular variant. Further, the new iPad is available in Silver, Gold and Space Gray colour options. The major highlight of this new 9.7-inch iPad is the price making it the cheapest iPad from Apple ever to be sold in India.    The new 9.7-inch iPad replaces the iPad Air 2 with the new 64-bit A9 chip inside. Apart from this, most of the specifications of the new iPad are similar to that of iPad Air 2. Quickly briefing about the specs, the new iPad, as the name suggests, sports a 9.7-inch LED-backlit IPS retina display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels making up for a pixel density of 264 ppi. On top of this, apple has provided a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating. As mentioned before, the new iPad comes with Apple's 640bit A9 chip which was first seen on Apple's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.   For the optics, we get an 8-megapixel camera with f/2.4 aperture, autofocus, HDR, panorama and various other controls such as burst mode, exposure control, tap to focus etc. This camera can record 1080p video at 30fps and also a slow-mo video at 120 fps. Turning the device around, we get a 1.2-megapixel f/2.2 aperture selfie camera which can record videos up to 720p resolution. For connectivity, both the Wi-Fi and LTE variants support Wi‑Fi (802.11a/b/g/n/ac) and Bluetooth 4.2. On the other hand, the WiFi + LTE variant supports all the major LTE bands, Data calling and Apple SIM (Nano SIM). For the dimensions, 9.4 x 6.6 x 0.29 mm and weighs 469g for Wi-Fi model and 478 g for Wi-Fi and LTE model. As always, we don't have any specific information about the battery capacity though the company claims that it can last up to 10 hours on single charge cycle. Besides, the new iPad 9.7-inch runs on the latest iOS 10 and also comes with Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

(Apple) Apple this week announced some minor upgrades to its Mac Pro desktop computer, which it says will be followed by a major overhaul of its high-end Mac. It's been four years since Apple announced any sort of update for the computer, leading some to worry that the company — which famously worked to usher in a  “post-PC” era — was letting mobile overshadow the humble desktop. But as Apple's announcement proves, we may not see desktops die completely, even in an era when mobile devices are our most-used gadgets. What may happen, however, is that desktop computers take on a new form. Judging by what companies have been trying lately to keep excitement alive in desktops, consumers may see the companies shift from affordable computers that can work in every home to higher-end, more specialized machines. There's no denying desktops have been on the decline. Sales growth for computers, particularly desktops, has been sliding since 2012, according to consulting firm IDC. A recent study showed that Android overtook Windows as the world's most-used operating system overall. A similar thing happened with Apple in 2012 when its mobile operating system, iOS, was logged as getting more usage than Apple's desktop operating system as consumers turned more to their iPhones, iPads and iPods. Basically, desktops have seen their main functions eroded by an army of new devices. Need a big keyboard on which to type? There's a cheap laptop, or a Bluetooth keyboard, for that. Want to stream an online movie? You can do that straight from your TV. But the truth is that we may never go truly “post-PC”  — or post-Mac, as the flurry of breathless articles over Apple's plans for the Mac Pro indicated. There's always going to be things for which we need a computer. In fact, Deloitte last year claimed in a study that even the youngest of millennials, those ages 18 to 24, are still relying on desktops and laptops a lot for specific tasks, including shopping, banking, watching video and creating text and image files. On top of that, companies are working to create desktops that fit into a world where mobile devices are increasingly doing most of the heavy lifting. For Apple, part of the solution seems to be making the Mac Pro more customizable, and therefore more flexible when it comes to fitting people's needs. It's also more closely marrying the mobile and desktop experiences. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said that the company is working on making the iPad Pro work better with the desktop as a way to convince people that they still need both devices. Microsoft appears to be dealing with PC shifts by taking the best of mobile technology and bringing it to the desktop, often in big, beautiful fashion. The Surface Studio, a 28-inch touch screen desktop computer that's also $3,000, lets you use a stylus as well as a dial that Microsoft designed just for this touch screen. Samsung is trying to make your desk completely mobile-based. The company this month showed off a desktop mode for its upcoming Galaxy S8 phones, which lets you plug your phone into a $150 dock and use it with a monitor, keyboard and mouse for a more desktop-like experience. It's the kind of product that, in theory, that could kill the desktop as a widespread device. But it will take some time for mobile solutions like this to take off because they're still a little bit rough around the edges, said Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. “The reality of putting your small device onto your large screen is that you have to adjust screen size and applications to fit. Those little subtle changes are hectic, and it's not realistic to use them,” she said.  So, judging by how the desktop market has evolved over the past several years — and where it's headed — the upshot seems to be that you'll probably be spending more for a desktop, but possibly using it for fewer things. Kitagawa said that, in her opinion, desktops will settle at around the $800-$1,000 range for consumers who don't want the high-end machines that you'd see in a professional setting, but want the power for gaming, video and photo editing or other hobbies. “That's going to be the sweet spot,” she said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

Subscribe here.  Are big corporations among the firewalls protecting the Republic from Donald Trump? It would be comforting to think so. Silicon Valley has risen up against Trump’s anti-Muslim attacks. More than 100 of the most prominent tech giants, from Microsoft to Tesla, signed an amicus brief challenging Trump’s immigration orders. Starbucks made a point of announcing that the company would hire 10,000 refugees. The Super Bowl ads were a veritable festival of anti-Trump sentiment, some subtle, others surprisingly direct. Budweiser celebrated the dreams of its immigrant founder. An Airbnb ad declared, “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.” 84 Lumber’s astonishing commercial followed a young Mexican girl and her mother trying to make it to America, on foot, in a boxcar, and on a flatbed truck, finally finding a door through a wall. Fox refused to air the full, six-minute version, but did run a cut-down one-minute spot whose message was unmistakable. Google’s ad depicted a rainbow of families of different ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations, ending with a party and a “Welcome Home” cake. Take that, Steve Bannon. Several of America’s largest corporations, including Apple and Google, have defended transgender people. In a statement, Apple publicly attacked Trump’s repeal of guidelines on transgender bathroom use in schools: “We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals.” Target endorsed the proposed federal Equality Act, which adds protections to LGBT people. Corporate America continued voting with its feet against states that display bigotry. North Carolina, epicenter of both anti-transgender policy and suppression of voting rights, keeps losing convention business, sports events, and concerts. Some 41 large companies have poked Trump in the eye by donating directly to Planned Parenthood, including not-especially-progressive outfits like American Express, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Nike, Ford, and Verizon. And Nordstrom, Macy’s, and several others have stopped carrying Trump family brands. Professional sports teams with large numbers of black athletes took pains to distance themselves from Trump. Several players from the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, a team with long-standing ties to Trump, boycotted the team’s White House visit. A handful of franchise owners and officials have expressed their personal displeasure at Trump. John Angelos of the Baltimore Orioles said that Trump was not welcome to throw out the first ball unless he apologized for all the offensive things he’s said. What gives? Is corporate America giving the commander in chief a big middle-finger salute?   BEFORE WE EMBRACE our improbable saviors too ardently, consider several caveats. Where are the corporations on the economic issues? Where they usually are, of course. They now have a plutocrat champion in the White House who makes William McKinley look like a socialist. If you unpack the issues where big corporations are crossing Trump, they are the cultural ones—immigrant rights, transgender rights, reproductive rights, support for a multicultural America. This is progress, of a sort. It does serve as a counterweight to Trump’s cultivation of the most vicious forces of the far right. However, on the core issues that have defined America’s slide into reactionary economic policies, corporate elites are lined up at Trump’s trough—to double down on the same policies they have been aggressively pushing since Ronald Reagan. While America’s biggest companies, especially those with reputational concerns, are singing kumbaya with a multicultural rainbow, these same companies are happily taking the tax cuts, the deregulation, and the anti-labor laws. Even our liberal-ish friends in Silicon Valley want nothing to do with regulatory constraints, much less labor protections. On some key policy issues, corporate America has proved to be surprisingly impotent. Three of the largest players in America’s health-industrial complex—the hospital industry, the insurance industry, and the American Medical Association—took strong stands against the Republican health bill, and lobbied against it. None of that cut any ice. How come? Maybe they didn’t lobby all that hard. The bill includes some nice perks for insurance executives. It repeals the ACA’s limits on tax-deductible executive pay, intended to limit the ability of companies to pass along windfall profits from their expanded customer base to corporate brass. The drug companies, meanwhile, are salivating at the prospect of even less regulation under Trump’s FDA. Likewise the bankers, and the energy industry, and the telecom giants. So companies with direct consumer exposure, such as AmEx or Verizon, can throw a few bucks at Planned Parenthood, while they chuckle all the way to the bank, buoyed by the prospect of lower taxes, less regulation, weaker unions, and right-wing judges who will overturn what remains of health, safety, consumer, labor, and environmental regulation. On a handful of issues, there is convergence between corporate self-interest and common decency. Corporate America is liberal on immigration, but for all the wrong reasons. Back when Republicans and Democrats were working on a compromise path to citizenship for undocumented workers, corporations were among the biggest backers. Imagine—all those low-wage workers under strict legal constraints to stay out of trouble. Yum. Trump has appointed climate-change deniers to key energy and environment posts. Where is corporate America on that? A small segment of American industry is making money off the green economy, but the big fossil fuel companies are back in the saddle, thanks to Trump. And Walmart, the number one predator when it comes to mistreating workers, tries to change the subject by being the greenest robber baron in town. Where is the corporate pushback against the Republican war on science? Several of the same corporations that took progressive stands on cultural issues, such as AmEx and Verizon, are also supporters of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which promotes right-wing policies at the state level. Among the core items in ALEC’s playbook are strategies to suppress voting participation. Did somebody say black lives matter? This corporate support of the Tea Party base has served both to strengthen the infrastructure of the far right and to undermine the living standards and economic security of ordinary people. The somewhat bizarre alliance between the culturally liberal Wall Street right and the culturally reactive Tea Party right paved the way for Trump. Corporations undercut pay and job security for workers, while they embraced multiculturalism. The Tea Party nourished the resentment against both. There is a perverse and paradoxical symbiosis here. Corporate America and its Republican allies execute economic policies that make daily life more arduous for ordinary people. But they burnish their image by supporting liberal social causes like immigrant rights and protections for transgender people. And then the conservative social base gets mobilized against both trends. Somehow, the corporations escape the wrath of working-class America. That gets deflected onto liberals, immigrants, blacks, and gays. Meanwhile, Democrats have been losing winnable elections because progressive cultural policies are easier for them to embrace than aggressively anti-corporate pocketbook policies. Going left on multicultural issues while largely failing to articulate a politics of class uplift cost Democrats the 2016 election. Trump’s economic populism is, of course, fake. Four decades of an increasingly virulent business elite paved the way for it. On no significant issue are Trump’s pocketbook politics at odds with those promoted by big business.   IS THIS TOO HARSH? If you take a close look at the good-guy corporations on issues other than identity politics, here’s what you find: There are a small number of idiosyncratic corporations led by genuine progressives, such as the original Ben and Jerry’s, and God bless them. We also have corporations that are various shades of green, ranging from completely bogus green-washing, to entrepreneurs who have found ways to profit from marketing clean technology and a variety of renewable forms of energy. Then we have the larger movement for corporate social responsibility, and its international counterpart, the voluntary movement to improve working conditions and environmental standards, by promoting labels for a broad range of products and processes. These range from fair-trade coffee to sustainable forestry to decent labor conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh, and dozens of others. Take a close look, and these certified goods represent a small fraction of total production, and they are losing more ground than they are gaining. Indeed, if you go back half a century, the truth is that progress was made on the entire front of environmental, labor, public health, and safety issues when citizens mobilized and legislatures passed mandatory laws—not via corporate voluntarism. For two decades after World War II, business got along with unions, not because elites had had a change of heart but because of a power shift. The same was true of the spate of environmental laws enacted in the 1970s. In the famous formulation of Lyndon Johnson, who was very skeptical when his Vietnam advisers told him that America needed to win hearts and minds, if you get them by the [private parts], their hearts and minds will follow. This is surely true, in spades, when it comes to reining in corporate excess. Yes, it’s great to have some class traitors among your allies, but it’s no substitute for a real movement.   BUT WHAT ABOUT democracy itself? There is a whole school of democratic theory that associates liberal democracy with the spread of economic laissez-faire. Cheerleaders for freer markets like both Friedmans (Milton and Tom) have insisted that democracy and capitalism logically go together. Going back to the days of Adam Smith, we’ve heard that free markets and free peoples reinforce one another. Supposedly, capitalism promotes democracy, because of common norms of transparency, rule of law, and free competition—for markets, for ideas, for votes. Democracy and capitalism are intimate allies. So when an existential threat to democracy like Trump arises, the captains of industry will surely come together to defend core democratic institutions. Oh, did I miss that? The nexus between free-market capitalism and democracy sounds plausible, until one examines the actual relationship throughout history. Slavery was a quintessentially commercial enterprise. Abolitionists in liberal Massachusetts, center of the 19th-century textile industry that depended on cheap Southern cotton, spoke scathingly of the alliance between the loom and the lash. In the 20th century, capitalists coexisted nicely with dictatorships, which conveniently created friendly business climates, cut taxes, and repressed independent worker organizations. Western capitalists have enriched and propped up third-world despots who crush local democracy. Western extractive industries have worked with dictators to plunder natural resources, pay kickbacks, exploit corruption, and give almost none of the benefits to local people. Communist China works hand in glove with capitalist business partners to destroy free labor unions and to preserve the political monopoly of the party. Vladimir Putin presides over a rigged brand of capitalism and governs in harmony with approved kleptocrats. Western businesses helped work to overthrow insurgent democratic regimes that threatened their financial interests, from Chile to Iraq, and cut deals with dictators from Kazakhstan to the Congo. International companies and bankers promoted capitalism in post-Soviet Russia. They didn’t exactly promote democracy. During the shabbier periods of American history, our government has protected purely commercial interests by sending in the Marines or fomenting coups. Today’s global backlash, in both its populist and religious-fundamentalist forms, is partly the result of the less-savory face of American corporate power overseas. General Augusto Pinochet took his economic advice from los chicos de Chicago. His ultra free-market economic advisers got a lot of publicity for counseling the dictator on how to deregulate the Chilean economy. They were notably silent on Pinochet’s brutal repression of any political opposition. In the 1930s, big business found it congenial to work with Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco. Adam Hochschild’s new history, Spain in Our Hearts, recounts how Texaco, in violation of the Neutrality Acts, literally helped turn the tide for Franco’s fascists against the Spanish Republic—not only by refusing to sell the Republic oil while generously supplying Franco’s forces, but also providing Franco’s Nazi ally with intelligence on the Republic’s oil sources so the Luftwaffe could sink the tankers. Large German corporations, from Deutsche Bank to Thyssen, Krupp, and I.G. Farben, assumed Hitler could be worked with to serve common interests and would moderate once in office. When the Fuehrer only became more vicious, the German corporate elite went along for the ride, and got quite rich on rearmament until the unfortunate miscalculation of World War II. Several American corporations briefly got into trouble for helping Hitler. Even after war was declared, Ford and GM subsidiaries in Germany continued to operate. ITT and RCA, via intermediaries in Switzerland, continued to collaborate with their German partners, Siemens and Telefunken. History shows that when circumstances demand awful choices, the logical conclusion of the corporate state is fascism.   TRUMP IS NOT HITLER. But if we think corporate America will serve as a bulwark against his excesses, we are as delusional as Trump is. When right-wing Republicans went after the fundamentals of democracy, by suppressing the right to vote, or shutting down the government over budget disputes, or refusing to even hold hearings on dozens of judicial nominations, we didn’t see any warm and fuzzy ads from Google, Apple, or Starbucks. Donald Trump calls out particular corporate executives when that is expedient, but his is a quintessentially corporate regime. With few exceptions, corporations conclude that Trump, weirdness and all, serves their interests. They are bankers and billionaires first, citizens a distant second. Not only do corporations fail to promote democracy; the converse is also true. Both at home and abroad, democracy has expanded by limiting the power of business. Constraints on corporate abuses have been necessary to give ordinary people more liberty and security to pursue a decent livelihood. When that project fails, dark forces are often unleashed. The political scientist Yascha Mounk makes a useful distinction. The problem threatening democratic practice today is not just illiberal democracy—governments with the form but not the substance of real democracy, from Turkey to Hungary to Russia and the dictatorial urges of Trump Tower. The problem is also undemocratic liberalism. By this Mounk means liberalism in its European sense, as ultra-marketization that narrows the space for democratic deliberation. All the major trade deals of the past two decades and the austerity rules of the European Union add up to what the economist Dani Rodrik calls hyperglobalization. The goal is to diminish the capacity of the democratic nation-state to housebreak capitalism, and it succeeds all too well. Mounk’s point is that undemocratic liberalism and illiberal democracy feed on each other, by leaving people who are not part of the Davos set far behind. So the challenge for progressives is not to make better alliances with corporations, but to restore democratic constraints on corporate power. In the late 1990s, a British NGO called Publish What You Pay (PWYP) devised an ingenious strategy for going after the bribery paid by Western extractive industries to third-world dictators. It pressured these Western corporations to disclose the bribe payments. A few, beginning with BP, agreed. Due to persistence and luck, PWYP even managed to get a mandatory disclosure provision included in the Dodd-Frank Act. Companies now had to disclose such payments in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulations carrying out this provision were among the very first to be scrapped in Trump’s war against regulation. You can just imagine how many corporations tried to block the repeal, in their splendid civic defense of the transparency that is allegedly common to efficient markets and democracy. That would be none. Thus far, Donald Trump has assaulted American democracy in several respects. He has stirred up hatred by associating his presidency with far-right haters. He has done everything in his power to undermine the free press. He has sought to use decrees to undermine the rule of law. Substantively, his policies have escalated the war against a balanced, socially decent form of capitalism. Some of corporate America has resisted the pure hate part, and for this we can offer one cheer. But let’s not kid ourselves. Despite the touchy-feely corporate commercials about America being a big, happy, diverse family, there is far more that unites business with Trump than divides them. At the end of the day, we need the same movement to keep Trump from destroying basic democracy and to keep business elites from destroying a decent brand of capitalism. We will defend and redeem American democracy the old-fashioned way, by mobilizing ordinary citizens.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 7, 2017 at 6:05AM Image source: Apple. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is one of the most hotly anticipated gadgets of the year. Thanks to the Apple rumor mill, we already know a lot about the features that might be included -- a glass body, a faster A11 processor, wireless charging, and a Touch ID sensor and a forward camera that are both integrated into an edge-to-edge OLED display. However, we've spent less time talking about the features that we probably won't see in the iPhone 8. Let's take a closer look at eight things that will likely be missing from Apple's tenth anniversary device. Image source: Getty Images. 1. MicroSD card slots Apple has never added MicroSD card slots to iPhones, because it allows the company to charge higher prices for higher-storage iPhones. Current rumors suggest that the highest-capacity iPhone 8 will have 256GB of storage. However, Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) lineup of Galaxy S8 devices includes MicroSD slots which support cards with up to 2TB of storage -- even though the current limit is 256GB. A SIM card placed next to a smartphone. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Dual SIM cards Dual SIM devices are popular in high-growth mobile markets like China and India, because they let users mix and match cheaper voice and data plans, as well as keep separate work and home numbers on a single device. Early rumors suggested that Apple would add dual SIMs to the iPhone 8, but recent reports indicate that it will only feature a single SIM slot. The main reason is that the major carriers that promote flagship devices like the iPhone 8 and Galaxy S8 prefer locking in users with single voice and data plans -- which boosts their profit margins. Energous' WattUp wirelessly charges devices via transmitters. Image source: Energous. 3. Long-distance wireless charging Apple reportedly struck a deal with Energous (NASDAQ:WATT), a pioneer in long-distance wireless charging, last December. Since Energous' WattUp charging tech can charge devices from 15 feet away, it was widely believed that the iPhone 8 could be charged without a cable or a wireless charging pad. The Qi wireless charging standard used by Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S8 only charges devices from 1.6 inches away. However, Copperfield Research recently suggested that Apple didn't plan to add long-distance charging to the iPhone 8. Instead, it suggested that the deal with Energous was instead aimed at keeping the technology out of its rivals' hands. Xiaomi's Mi Mix. Image source: Xiaomi. 4. The Home button Apple will reportedly replace the Home/Touch ID button from the iPhone 8 with a "function area" that reads fingerprints directly from the display. The need for a Home button will likely be solved via software changes in iOS 11. That's because the iPhone 8's entire screen is expected to be an edge-to-edge bezel-less display similar to Xiaomi's Mi Mix. The first generation Mi Mix placed the fingerprint sensor on the back, but the second-generation device will reportedly also put the fingerprint sensor on the display. Samsung's Galaxy S8. Image source: Samsung. 5. A curved OLED display Samsung sparked an aesthetic shift when it launched the Galaxy Note Edge in 2014. The display's single curved edge was evolved into two curved edges with the Galaxy S6 Edge, and has since become the defining feature of its high-end Edge devices. Early rumors indicated that Apple would finally add a curved OLED screen to the iPhone 8, but numerous analysts -- including KGI Securities' Ming Chi-Kuo -- claim that Apple scrapped that plan. The iris scanner on Samsung's Galaxy S8. Image source: Samsung. 6. Iris scanner Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 will likely always be remembered as the "exploding" phone, but it was also the first Galaxy device to use an iris scanner to unlock the device. Samsung has also added the feature to its S8 and S8+ devices. The iPhone 8, however, isn't expected to add this futuristic feature. Samsung's DeX Android desktop. Image source: Samsung. 7. Desktop mode The Galaxy S8 also features a "desktop mode" which converts the device into a desktop computer -- powered by Samsung's DeX window-based Android desktop -- when hooked up to a monitor. The idea is similar to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Continuum, but that effort hasn't gained much steam due to weak sales of Windows 10 Mobile devices. Apple, which is often criticized for not merging iOS and OS X into a single OS, won't add a desktop feature to the iPhone 8. Doing so could cannibalize sales of Macs and upset the balance between the two operating systems. Image source: Getty Images. 8. A 3.5 mm headphone jack Apple's most controversial design move with the iPhone 7 was the removal of the headphone jack. Critics complained about the need to charge Bluetooth headphones, their poorer sound quality when compared to wired headphones, and the use of clumsy lightning adapters to use regular headphones. Samsung not only kept the headphone jack in the Galaxy S8, but it doubled down on wired headphones by bundling a pair of $99 Harman AKG headphones with the device. Apple, which rarely backtracks on its design choices, won't likely bring the jack back in the iPhone 8.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 7, 2017 at 7:27AM No one invests in the stock market to lose money. Yet it often seems like the people who lose their shirts outnumber those who strike it rich. While there's no guaranteed way to avoid losing money in the market, recognizing these six common blunders can save your portfolio from a lot of pain. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Not knowing what you're buying Legendary investor Peter Lynch popularized the idea of buying "what you know." While this doesn't mean that you should buy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock because you like the iPhone, it could be a viable starting point for additional research. Unfortunately, many investors buy stocks in sectors that they don't understand, simply because financial pundits recommended them. That's a reckless strategy which leads to impulsive purchases and sells, since these investors can't grasp the longer-term headwinds or catalysts for a company. 2. Not keeping up with quarterly reports Warren Buffett was once asked how investors can make smarter decisions. He reportedly held up stacks of reports and said, "read 500 pages like this every day. That's how knowledge builds up, like compound interest." Unfortunately, Investors sometimes don't keep up with a company's most recent quarterly reports and conference calls. As a result, they fail to understand why a company beat or missed expectations during the quarter, and become oblivious to upcoming headwinds or catalysts. That's why I think an ideal portfolio consists of less than 20 stocks -- any more and I find it hard to do my due diligence on each company. 3. Ignoring forecasts and valuations Many short term traders rely on the murky notion that the "trend is your friend." This basically means following trading volume and price fluctuations while ignoring a business' fundamental growth and valuations. But if you do that, you violate the core tenets of long-term investing -- to understand how fast a company is growing, and to determine if a stock is cheap based on that growth. If we look at Apple, we'll see that analysts expect its sales and earnings to respectively grow 6% and 8% this year. That's not bad for a mature tech company, but its trailing P/E ratio of 17 currently matches its industry average of 17 -- which tells us that the stock isn't really "cheap" at current prices. Yet the short-term trader might still buy the stock, believing that the stock rising above historic highs indicates that the stock is "breaking out."  4. Applying trading strategies to long-term investments Investors also often confuse short-term trading strategies with long-term ones. A classic example is the trailing stop, which automatically sells a stock once it drops by a predefined amount or percentage. That sounds like a smart move -- the trailing stop rises with the stock, and "catches" it on the way down, removing all emotion from a trade. Image source: Getty Images. But in reality, setting trailing stops under long-term investments can cause premature selling. If we revisit Apple, we'll see that the stock fell from the mid-$20s to less than $12 during the financial meltdown of 2008-2009. A trailing stop would have prevented your stock from falling to $12, but you would have missed the rally all the way back to the low $140s. If you were a true long-term investor, you would have been buying up more shares instead of selling. 5. Selling winners and holding losers Investors naturally want to sell their winners and hold onto their losers. That's because they're constantly afraid that their gains will be erased, and always hopeful that they can recover their losses. History shows us how disastrous selling winners can be. If you had invested $10,000 in Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) IPO in 1997, you would have received 555 shares. After three splits in 1998 and 1999, your share count would have risen to 6,660. That stake would be worth $5.8 million today. Imagine how you would feel if you had sold that stake the first time it doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled. As for losers, check out BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), which lost 95% of its market value over the past decade. Investors who believed that the former smartphone market leader would make a comeback (in phones, tablets, or software) were repeatedly burned by lofty promises. 6. Failing to diversify Lastly, the easiest way to lose money in the stock market is to not diversify. Having a single hot stock account for 100% of your portfolio might be great when that stock goes up, but you'll be in big trouble when it comes tumbling down. Likewise, buying a lot of stocks from a single sector doesn't count as diversification, since bad news about one company often drags down its industry peers. Therefore, I generally spread my stocks out over a few sectors, and I don't allow a single stock to account for over 10% of my portfolio. The key takeaways The stock market can be tough for unprepared investors. But if you try to avoid these six common pitfalls, I think you'll stand a better chance at growing your investments instead of losing all your hard-earned money.   Leo Sun owns shares of Amazon.

Buried in their announcement of the NVIDIA Titan Xp, NVIDIA has also made a rather surprising revelation: that they will be releasing macOS drivers for their Pascal architecture GPUs. This comes despite the fact that Apple hasn’t sold a Mac Pro that can officially accept a PCIe video card in almost half a decade. When Apple released the trash can shaped and highly customized Mac Pro design in 2013 – one, coincidentally enough, they’ll be walking away from for the next iteration – Apple also sealed the fate for end-user video card upgrades on the Macintosh platform. Every Mac now uses a customized, integrated video card of some kind, from the soldered-on MacBook Pro up to the custom format cards of the Mac Pro. This has meant that as the old, Westmere-based Mac Pro towers have aged into retirement, so has the market for Mac video card upgrades. For NVIDIA, this is a bit of a double-whammy. NVIDIA owns the bulk of the discrete video card market, and at the same time, Apple hasn’t integrated an NVIDIA GPU in some time now; the last NVIDIA-equipped Mac was the 2014 MacBook Pro, which included an NVIDIA Kepler GPU. As a result, NVIDIA has been locked out of the Mac video card market entirely for the last couple of years, and consequently makes NVIDIA’s announcement so surprising. So why is NVIDIA releasing a Mac driver to a market that, officially speaking, is essentially dead? It’s telling that this is a question NVIDIA doesn’t even bother to address, simply stating that they’re “making the new TITAN Xp open to the Mac community with new Pascal drivers” in order to give “Mac users access to the immense horsepower delivered by our award-winning Pascal-powered GPUs.” At best, the official market is the remaining handful of Mac Pro Tower owners. Instead it’s the off-label use that makes this announcement interesting, and indeed gives NVIDIA any reason whatsoever to make a Pascal driver release. Within the Mac community there are small but none the less vocal user groups based around both unsupported external GPUs and not-even-Apple-hardware Hackintoshes. In the case of the former, while macOS doesn’t support external GPUs (and isn’t certified as eGFX complaint by Intel), it’s possible to use Macs with Thunderbolt eGFX chassis with a bit of OS patching. Meanwhile with a bit more hacking, it’s entirely possible to get macOS running on a custom-built PC, leading to the now long-running Hackintosh space. The fact of the matter is that neither of these groups is very big relative to the much bigger Mac user base – who wants to do real professional work on an unsupported video card setup? – but they are vocal, and they do need increasingly powerful video cards, like the rest of the PC market. But more to the point, given Apple’s announcement that they’re going to eventually fix the Mac Pro’s GPU woes, but not for at least another year, this is a chance for NVIDIA to take a low-risk pot shot at Apple for their dGPU follies. At a minimum, it’s a nice gesture to Mac users (whom tend to spend big on hardware), and perhaps, it makes for the start of a grassroots campaign to get an NVIDIA GPU in the next iMac or Mac Pro. And while only NVIDIA knows for sure if they planned this before this week’s Mac Pro announcement or they just got lucky, it comes across as a clever move by the company. Otherwise, from a technical perspective, there’s little reason for NVIDIA not to do this. The company needs to keep Mac driver development for new architectures alive regardless so that they can compete for future GPU contracts, meaning NVIDIA already has the drivers in-house, though perhaps not in an end-user ready state. Given how the whole endeavor is essentially unsupported from the Apple side of matters, this may make for a bumpy ride at the start. But I think it will be interesting to see where the NV-GPU equipped Mac user base stands in a year or two when Apple readies their next Mac Pro, and if NVIDIA’s gesture has any real impact on the number of NVIDIA users out there.

I'm really surprised how long this model has endured due to Apple's missteps. Considering that on the CPU side, the 2013 model of the Mac Pro only bests my model in AVX based code, my system is still state-of-the-art on the Mac side. With my GPU and SSD upgrades, I've got a machine faster than what Apple is currently selling in several aspects. I also have greater memory capacity (128 GB). If I really wanted to go crazy, I wonder if the Quadro GP100 is supported under those macOS drivers... Reply Filiprino - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link Probably Mac users are a target for that card.

More like this Ask the iTunes Guy: A look at new features in iTunes 12.6 Ask the iTunes Guy: Better ways to view your iTunes media Can iTunes do...? Sometimes the answer is no Video The iPhone Show: What's new in iOS 10.3? When Apple released iTunes 12.6 a couple of weeks ago, some new features were added to the app, which I discussed in this column. But there were also some minor changes, and I've been getting a lot of email asking about some of the smaller tweaks. In this week's column, I cover a number of questions about the quirks of iTunes 12.6. Can I haz artwork? Q: I'm pretty sure I used to be able to right-click on an album in iTunes and choose Get Album Artwork to download artwork from the iTunes Store. Now the only place I find that option is in the File menu, and that gets artwork for the entire library. What happened? The Get Album Artwork menu item is useful if you've ripped a CD and haven't told iTunes to automatically download artwork. Or if you've downloaded music from somewhere and want to fetch artwork for it. In iTunes 12.6, that option is available, but it's in different locations depending on how you're viewing your music. If you're in Artists, Genres, or Composers view, click the ... button in an album's header to choose Get Album Artwork. If you're in Albums view, right-click an album's artwork or the musical note that displays when there is no artwork to choose that menu item. If you're in Songs view, and you have the artwork column visible, you can choose Get Album Artwork by right-clicking the artwork area. As you say, the File > Library > Get Album Artwork menu item tries to get artwork for the entire library. This may replace your existing artwork, so I don't recommend that you use it. Where's my visualizer? Q: I noticed that when I updated to iTunes 12.6 most of my visualizers disappeared. Is there a fix for this, or has Apple killed off third-party visualizers? I hadn't realized how many people use the iTunes visualizer until iTunes 12.6 was released. I've gotten lots of emails about third-party visualizes no longer working, or even showing up in the View > Visualizer menu. (If you're not familiar with the iTunes visualizer, read this article.) A report from one visualizer developer says that iTunes no longer accesses third-party visualizers. This suggests that Apple is shutting the door on these tools. This could be for security reasons; similar to the way apps are sandboxed—not allowed to access any resources outside of the apps themselves—perhaps iTunes is locking down its access to third-party tools. How do I clear Up Next? Q: I like using Up Next to queue up my music, but sometimes, when I've started playing an album, I want to clear the queue and add something else. There used to be a Clear button at the top of the list, but it's gone. How do I clear the queue now? Funny how Apple, long known for intuitive interfaces, can break something as simple as this. It makes sense for the Clear button to be at the top of the queue, especially if you have a lot of music in your Up Next list. But Apple's design team thought it might be nicer to put it at the bottom of the Up Next queue. This is fine if you only have a few tracks in Up Next, but if you have a long list, you have to scroll way down to see the Clear button; which isn't even a button any more. Kirk McElhearn/IDG The Clear "button" in Up Next is now at the bottom of the list. Up Next displays up to 20 tracks, and if you have a Mac with a large display, you can see them all if you click the Up Next button in the iTunes toolbar. But on a smaller Mac, such as a laptop, or if you're using the MiniPlayer near the bottom of your display, you won't see it unless you scroll. Where'd my seasons go? Q: I buy a lot of TV series from the iTunes Store store. But with the latest version of iTunes, I can only see one season at a time. Is there any way I can see all the episodes of all the seasons of a show? I never really liked the way iTunes showed all the seasons and episodes of a TV series when you viewed it in your iTunes library. Apple has changed the display, making it similar to the way Netflix lets you select a season to view its episodes. Kirk McElhearn/IDG Choose which season you want to view from this menu If, however, you do want to view all your episodes of a show, say to find a specific episode, you can do so by creating a smart playlist with the following conditions: Match TV Shows for the following rules Show is show name Choose View > Show View Options, and, from the View As menu, choose Playlist, TV Show List, or Episode List.

Apple is being sued downunder for allegedly bricking hundreds of iPhones and iPads with software updates. That's the claim being made by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in a lawsuit against the Cupertino giant. Specifically, the regulator claims that Apple bricked hundreds of iPhones and iPads and then refused to fix them. According to the regulator, Apple refused to fix the devices because they had been previously been serviced by non-Apple technicians. Apple customers who had downloaded software updates during September 2014 and February 2016 were later prompted with a message that the device "could not be restored and has stopped functioning." Upon reaching out to Apple, customers were told that Apple was not required to provide a remedy. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. ACCC is seeking fines, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs in its lawsuit, filed on Wednesday.

The suit alleges that Apple bricked the devices of Australian customers between September 2014 and February 2016 through software updates. The documents mention the Error 53 problem – which first appeared in 2015 – that affected thousands of iPhone 6 handsets. The phones had been taken to non-Apple technicians who carried out screen or Touch ID module repairs, which in turn caused the devices to fail Apple’s security checks and become expensive paperweights. When asked to repair the bricked products, customers were told that "no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, provide a remedy" for free. Essentially, Apple says that if a third-party carries out repairs, it doesn’t have to honor warranties, even those that are part of the AppleCare extended warranty program. "It's fair to say we haven't observed similar behavior by other manufacturers," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at a lower cost than the manufacturer.” The regulator said Apple engaged in "misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations to consumers" regarding how its software updates affects devices. The ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs. A US class action lawsuit was brought against Apple over the Error 53 issue last year, but was thrown out due to the plaintiff’s "lack of standing to pursue injunctive relief."

By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Friday, April 7, 2017, 16:13 [IST] It is evident that Apple will be launching the iPhone 8 by end of this year. However, as we wait patiently, the leaks continue to pour in almost every single day. The good thing about the leaks is that they keep fans as well as tech enthusiasts excited. On the other hand, these leaks also provide a lot of information about the upcoming device. We pretty much get an idea about what Apple is working on and what it will be offering. While that may not always be good for the manufacturer as it spoils the surprise element but it does help the company to make the device more popular. SEE ALSO: Apple shares new demos of its proposed WebGPU browser engine That being said, a new leak in the form of mockup photo of the iPhone 8 glossy back variant has just surfaced on the internet. The image shows the device from the front and back. To elaborate, the iPhone 8 image shows a big screen without the usual home button much like the Samsung Galaxy S8 that was launched recently. Similarly, the display seems to take up the large part of the front with slightly curved edges on the left and right side. Again, like the Galaxy S8, the iPhone seems to have thin bezels on top and bottom. Coming to the back, the iPhone 8 seems to have some design changes and instead of the horizontal camera setup the image shows a vertical dual camera setup. Further, the image also suggests that the iPhone 8 will have the fingerprint scanner at the back below the Apple branding. SEE ALSO: iPhone 8 256GB model with OLED display might cost $1,000 Furthermore, a report from iDrop News also states that the iPhone 8 will likely be dubbed as the "iPhone Edition" instead and that the device will feature a metal body which will be more durable and shatterproof. The report also suggests that the iPhone 8 will sport a slightly-curved 2.5D OLED edge-to-edge display. Notably, these are all just rumors and leaks which might not turn out to be true.

Digital artist Martin Hajek has created concept renders for what he’d like to see from the iPhone 8. They're based on the working theory that Apple plans to release two normal iPhone 7S handsets, alongside a third, super-charged iPhone 8 or iPhone X. This handset will reportedly get bonus features such as an OLED screen, and is predicted to cost more than £800. While we’ve seen plenty of concept renders for the iPhone 8 already, Hajek’s designs are unique in that they’re a major throwback to the first ever iPhone. Released in 2007, the original iPhone featured a two-tone back and a curvacious body. Hajek has adapted this then-innovative design and updated it for modernity. For instance, much of the front of the phone is now occupied by what appears to be a large 5-inch plus display – a far cry from the 3.5-inch panel on the original iPhone. In all fairness, Hajek is probably right on this point; the iPhone 8 will almost certainly feature an all-screen front. LG adopted a similar design with the new LG G6, and Samsung has done the same with the new Galaxy S8, dubbing the aesthetic ‘Infinity Display’. Apple is hotly rumoured to follow suit later this year. However, bear in mind that these aren’t official renders, so there’s every chance that the actual iPhone 8 – if it’s even called that – will look very different to Hajek’s concept. Check out some more of Hajek’s renders below: Related: Samsung Galaxy Note 8 What would you like to see from the iPhone 8 special edition? Let us know in the comments.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Indians prefer Xiaomi over Samsung, Apple: Strategy Analytics Indians prefer Xiaomi over Samsung, Apple: Strategy Analytics Xiaomi gained 26 per cent share in the most preferred smartphone brand beating Samsung and Apple By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 7, 2017 5:20 pm While Xiaomi gained 26 per cent share in the most preferred smartphone brand by Android users, Samsung and Apple stand at 12 per cent each. Xiaomi is now the most preferred smartphone brand for Android users looking to buy a new device in 2017, according to a report by research firm Strategy Analytics. The Chinese smartphone maker, which was ranked number one for the first time since its India launch in 2014, has beaten Samsung and Apple. While Xiaomi gained 26 per cent share in the most preferred smartphone brand, Samsung and Apple stand at 12 per cent each. Interestingly, homegrown player Micromax was the least preferred smartphone brand with only 2 per cent share. Lenovo and Motorola gained 6 per cent and 7 per cent share respectively, while OnePlus stands at 6 per cent. “Micromax as well as Sony, LG, Lenovo and Motorola have cause for concern,” the report points out. Users look for network and processor speed, camera, screen size and resolution as key factors while buying a smartphone. “The importance of network speed and processor performance to Android smartphone buyers is good news both for operators as they seek LTE customer and chipset vendors looking to migrate the huge base of feature phone users in India,” reads the report. “Xiaomi for the first time since it started operations in the Indian market was ranked among the top three vendors in Q4 2016. The vendor grew a whopping 125% YoY and 17% QoQ and captured 10% of market share in India in the quarter,” Rajeev Nair, Senior Analyst said. Further, Strategy Analytics’ Smartphone Model Tracker (SMT) program reveal that four Xiaomi smartphone models feature in vendors’ top-20 list. Only 6 per cent potential buyers prefer premium smartphones (above Rs 35,000), while over half of India buyers tend to spend between Rs 15,000-Rs 20,000 on a smartphone; the report notes. This also explains why Xiaomi is doing so well. It’s Redmi series in India has managed to combine great specifications at budget pricing, thus boosting its popularity among users. While Redmi devices have done quite well in India, the same can’t be said for its premium offerings. The company claims to have sold over 1 million units of its Redmi Note 4 smartphone in India in 45 days. Other offerings like Redmi Note 3 and Redmi 3S series have done quite well for the company as well.

The 2017 iMac is expected to feature AMD layouts, Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6  processors, and 16GB to 64GB of ECC RAM, based on a post on the weblog Pike’s Universum. Furthermore, support for Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C connection had been additionally teased, along with a 2TB SSD.  Intriguingly, the foundation mentions too that the new iMac’s AMD visuals can “help VR and professional apps,” which may be huge if taken as being a sign that Apple is stepping into virtual reality.  (your blog’s supply additionally teased an 8K display meant to pair using the overhauled Mac Pro, as well as a not-so-miniature Mac mini model in the future.) iMac is iBack The report also mentions a brand new keyboard visiting the brand new iMac, which fuels previous reports that Apple could possibly just take the Touch Bar from this past year’s MacBook Pro and augment future keyboards along with it. Now, even the leaked source adds a disclaimer that light doubt must be utilized when it comes to speculating on Apple rumors, and now we eventually concur – especially given that the report refers to its tipster as “little bird” who is “usually pretty accurate.” Nevertheless, we do know for sure Apple is arranging a significant modification to its iMac lineup very soon, along with competitors stepping into once-undisputed Apple turf with all-in-ones such as the Microsoft Surface Studio, it’s in iPhone maker’s most readily useful interest to come away moving.

Release date, features, rumours and price – all you need to know Apple's next offering is expected to boast some incredible new tech but ditch some familiar features By Jasper Hamill 7th April 2017, 8:22 am Updated: 7th April 2017, 8:23 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments IT’S set to be a big year for Apple fans, because this year marks the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. This means the tech giant is likely to be planning a HUGE release to mark this historic occasion, with rumours swirling over new features like a 3D camera. Getty Images 2 The tech world is already lighting up with gossip about the upcoming iPhone 8 As always, Apple has been tight-lipped about its gadgets but that hasn’t stopped rumours from swirling. We’ve collected together some of the iGossip, although we can’t verify all the info at this stage. When will the iPhone 8 be released? Apple had been expected expected to release the iPhone 8 in September 2017, in keeping with its annual autumn launch of major new products. In 2016 the iPhone 7 was launched on 16 September, so a similar mid-September date seemed most likely. However, according to the Economic Daily News technical problems mean it could be delayed by weeks due to “technical issues” with the hotly anticipated curved screen and 3D camera. Other rumours have suggested that delays in the handset’s new fingerprint sensor mean its release could be delayed until October at the earliest. Nothing has been confirmed, but Apple tends to stick to the same schedule every year. The iPhone 5, 5S, 6, 6S and 7 were all launched in September of consecutive years. Can't stop constantly checking your phone? This handy iPhone hack will help you break the habit How much will the iPhone 8 cost? Rumours suggest that the new smartphone could be a lot more affordable than you think. Steven Milunovich, an analyst from global financial services giant UBS, claims that Apple’s prices are expected to stay around the same price as the iPhone 7. He said the flagship iPhone 8 will start from $850, which is around £682. Milunovich wrote in a report seen by Mac Rumours: “Contrary to some perceptions, Apple prices quite competitively. “Apple likes to position its entry-level products at the mid-market with ‘Pro/Plus’ products close to competitors at the high end.” Despite the lower starting price, it’s likely that a higher storage tier will cost upwards of £800 – with some rumours suggesting that a weak pound could lead to the handset even costing £900. What will the iPhone 8 be called? Apple is rumoured to be planning to call its next smartphone the iPhone X in a huge break from its usual naming traditions. Up until now, every new iPhone has been given a reasonably logical name, although Apple did slip the odd 's' after some model numbers. In a briefing note seen by Tech Radar, analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company said his supply chain sources has predicated a name change for the new mobile. "It’s a name that makes some sense, simultaneously highlighting the phone’s high status and giving a nod to it being the tenth anniversary of the iPhone, with X, of course, being the Roman numeral for 10," the website wrote. Apple unveils waterproof and wireless iPhone 7 with no headphone jack What new features will the iPhone 8 have? Facial recognition Apple is rumoured to be planning to blast its biggest fans with LASER BEAMS when they buy the next iPhone 8. But whilst this sound scary, the James Bond-esque technology may actually allow them to open up their mobile phone using their face. An unconfirmed Apple rumour has suggested the upcoming device will use a laser to scan users' features. This could allow them to use their own lovely face to access the gadget, rather than having to scan a fingerprint or enter a password. "Features appear to include some form of facial/gesture recognition supported by a new laser sensor and an infrared sensor mounted near the front-facing camera and, as expected, should also finally include wireless charging," wrote Apple analyst Timothy Arcuri, according to Business Insider. Screen and camera The iPhone 8 is rumoured to have a stunning edge-to-edge OLED display taking up the length and breadth of the device. It could also feature an all-glass design, according to a recently filed patent. The patent awarded to Apple describes a device with a display that "may occupy the entire front face". The screen will have the Home Button  -- complete with super-sensitive Touch ID technology -- and its front-facing camera built in, according to leaked reports from Apple's Cupertino HQ. It is even thought the screen could be curved, just like the latest high-tech TVs. However, recent iGossip suggests that this prediction could be WRONG – and the cutting-edge OLED display could be held back until Apple releases an experimental version of the phone in 2018. Depending on the model (iPhone 8 is expected to come in three versions, see below) there will also be improved Optical Image Stabilisation technology. It has been rumoured that a 3D camera, which allows users to scan a 3D version of themselves into the phone, could be included in this version. ConceptsiPhone 2 Rumours are the iPhone 8 (artist's impression) could be full-screen and feature wireless charging technology It will allow for even clearer ultra-HD photographs using two cameras: a 12 megapixel wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens. This OIS technology already features on the iPhone 7 Plus's wide-angle lens, but NOT the telephoto lens. The telephoto lens is expected to be improved in time for the iPhone 8 launch, meaning even pictures taken from far away will be clearer and more stabilised. It has also been reported that Apple is working with LG on a camera for the iPhone 8 that would allow 3D photographs. It is unclear exactly how these could be put to use – however, a tech industry expert suggested a "revolutionary" front-facing camera could use infared technology to take 3D selfies. These cutting edge photos could then be used to create video game characters that accurately resemble the players themselves. Light-emitting diode (OLED) panels Apple placed orders for bendable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels – the kind you find on Samsung phones – to use in 70 million smartphones, according to sources speaking to Nikkei Asian Review. OLED screens are typically used in fancy smart TVs because they offer high colour and motion quality (making it perfect for watching Netflix)  without munching too much power. Wireless charging Taiwanese tech manufacturer Foxconn is making wireless charging modules for the iPhone 8, according to reports. It means the iPhone 8 will reportedly be able to be charged from 15 FEET away. It will use a built-in wireless receiver to receive power from a transmitter plugged into a socket. A company called Energous is said to be supplying the technology it called 'WattUp'. The firm has previously boasted WattUp technology can allow devices to be charged from the impressive distance. iPhone 8 'will have wireless charging using WattUp technology' No more Lightning port It has been claimed that Apple will remove the familiar Lightning connector from the upcoming model. Rumours suggest that the firm wants to remove the Lightning and replace it with the USB-3, which could provoke mild grumbling from people who own headphones or other peripherals which connect to the familiar jack. Will iPhone 8 have a headphone jack? It doesn't look like the new iPhone will have a headphone jack, and the physical home button is expected to disappear as the whole face will be a screen. The new phone will instead have a virtual home button. Samsung is expected to follow suit, ditching its headphone jack and home button on its new Galaxy S8, according to gadgets.ndtv.com How many models of iPhone 8 will there be? There will be three different versions of the iPhone 8, according to a market analysis note seen by MacRumors. The premium version will be a 5.8 inch model with the OLED screen, while there will be two TFT-LCD screen models — a 4.7 inch version and a 5.5 inch version. The smallest 4.7 inch model will not have the dual camera Optical Image Stabalisation Technology, while the larger and more expensive models will, according to the note.

Apple describes Clips as an app "for making and sharing fun videos with text, effects, graphics, and more." Essentially it's a stripped-down version of a video editor like iMovie, optimized to make edits fast and user-friendly on mobile. Its key focus is allowing you to shoot seconds-long clips and string them together into a video worth sharing. Getting started with a new clip is simple: you just press the big, red 'Hold to Record' button and video will record until you release it. Optionally, you can also take an existing image or video from your library and import it to the app. Whether you're recording something new, or editing existing content, Clips will always require your video to fit a square orientation. This might annoy some people, but it makes sense as a format that works well when viewed in either portrait or landscape. Once you've captured a photo or video, Clips provides a variety of tools with which to quickly edit that video. Content can be overlayed on top of the video, like resizable emoji, text bubbles, and more. Prisma-like filters can be added, as can audio soundtracks. One of the neatest tools is called 'Live Titles," which takes any words spoken while recording and creates animated captions out of those words in real-time. This eliminates the sometimes-tedious task of writing captions in later. When you're done recording and making edits to a video, sending it out into the world is handled by the share sheet, which contains all of the standard avenues for sharing content – Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and whatever other apps you have installed. A clever feature Apple has added to the share sheet in Clips is that if the app detects that one of the people in your video matches a face from your photo library, or if you said someone's name during the video, the share sheet will list those people as suggested options to share your video with via iMessage, alongside a grouping of people you've recently messaged. Overall, Clips is well-polished, packed with tools, and it does well what it's designed for. The recent onslaught of ephemeral, short-form video content on services like Snapchat and Instagram was clearly a strong influence on Clips' creation. And while I haven't gotten into the 'Stories' craze myself, I'm still expecting to be a somewhat-regular Clips user. Whereas I find something like Instagram Stories intimidating because I don't like the pressure of shooting and immediately sharing something. Clips allows those who want to move that fast to do so, while people like me can take their time – I can record something, save it to the Photos app, maybe share it with my wife or a friend, and if I end up really liking it, I can later share to social media. Clips is available on the App Store. Downloading it requires that your device is running iOS 10.3 or later.

Demand and interest in 3D work, for design, game and software development, and video is bigger than ever and growing exponentially. Without a truly top-tier workstation, Apple will miss out on a huge segment of digital creatives that can craft the future of human-machine interaction — something way beyond tapping a piece of glass. It would lack a Mac workstation with the raw computing power to prototype VR and AR interactions, build game worlds, simulate complex models and render the effects of tomorrow’s great feature films all the while offering those same creatives a platform to create for its own mobile devices. The Mac Pro user base may be a single-digit percentage of all Macs sold, but it's a group of users with an important indirect effect on the Apple ecosystem. Very often, they are the same users who make the movies, videogames, TV shows, music, and apps we put on our devices every day. They are few people who create highly influential content millions of others use, enjoy, and rely upon. And Apple has realized they don't want to let that community go.

As per the report, Apple is facing some technical issues “related to the lamination process of” curved OLED panels that are expected to feature on the new phones. This could delay the new iPhones till October or November. In addition to citing problems with OLED panels, the EDN report also mentions that Apple is adopting a new 3D Sensing system which may further delay the upcoming iPhones. There are no details mentioned on what this new 3D Sensing system will do, however, a previous report from KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the OLED iPhones will include a ‘revolutionary’ infrared module that will be able to sense the 3D space in front of it. The advanced 3D camera system is expected to feature on the front facing camera of the new iPhones and could be used in new games that replace a character’s head with that of the user. The new iPhones could also generate 3D selfies using the feature. Further to the two reasons why the new iPhones might get delayed, EDN’s report goes on to state, “Market sources said that they are watching the pull-in of orders for passive components from the iPhone's supply chain to see whether production of the new iPhone devices is on track, said the paper, adding that the supply chain should begin to pull in orders for passive components such as MLCCs in June.” While keeping an eye on the company’s supply chain could hint at the expected launch timeline for the new iPhones, including Apple’s 10th Anniversary edition of the device, it is in no way a confirmation of delay.

It pairs up the beef flavor with smoke, honey and all natural apple flavoring. The honey apple beef jerky is sweet and tender and delivers no heat at all. "We're excited about the new flavors that we've added to our product list" say Jim Sokol, CEO and owner of Saginaw Snacks, LLC. "With so much competition in the beef jerky market, we believe that our unique flavor offerings such as Rockin' Honey Apple and Sriracha set us apart for all the rest."

While Apple offers a 16GB iPad model, 16GB of storage on an iPad isn’t much at all. In fact, many would say that it’s nearly impossible for an iPad user, since the device is great for all sorts of games and movies, which can fill up the storage fairly quickly. We’ve discussed many times in the past about how you just shouldn’t get a 16GB iPhone or iPad, both for the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 5s, as well as the iPad mini and the new iPad Air 2. 16GB usually isn’t enough for a lot of users, and since iOS itself takes up a few gigabytes of space, you’re left with even less storage that you can work with. Storage size can ultimately be the toughest decision when buying an iPad, especially because of the price difference between the multiple storage tiers, but you also never know exactly how much space you’ll end up using, and the longer you own the device, the more apps and games that you’ll pile on over time. However, many users still opt for the 16GB option due to cost, as it’s priced way less than the next highest storage tier, which is $100 more. If your budget doesn’t allow for anything better than a 16GB iPad, the decision is pretty easy as far as what storage size to get, but ultimately not the best, and we certainly don’t blame you, as you’ll pay $100 more for the next storage tier up. However, if you want to add more storage to your iPad, there are several ways to go about it. Wireless Hard Drive Perhaps the easiest way to add a ton of storage to your iPad is by using a wireless hard drive, which connects to your iPad wireless without the need for any kind of internet connection. The Seagate Wireless portable hard drive is one option, and it’s a 500GB mobile storage device that can give you more storage than what Apple would ever provide in their iPads. The Seagate Wireless is a $129 wireless hard drive, meaning that it has an internal battery that can power the hard drive without the need for a USB or outlet connection. It also has its own WiFi network, which is how you connect it to your iPhone or iPad (from there, you can connect to your home WiFi or other network to get internet). Apple doesn’t support connecting external drives directly to your iPad using the Lightning connector, so this is the next best option. Trading Up Another way to add more storage to your iPad isn’t by necessarily adding more storage to your current iPad, but by simply “trading up,” which means buying an iPad that comes with more storage and then selling your old one. This might not be the best option for everyone, but if you want more built-in storage without dealing with a wireless hard drive and other external accessories, this is the best way to go. You might even be able to find someone who will trade you their higher-capacity iPad for your lower-capacity model plus some cash. A great place to look is on Reddit’s /r/AppleSwap. Use the Cloud If there’s one thing that the iPad is good at, it’s for viewing movies, watching TV shows, and listening to music. Music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, photos, etc. usually take up the most storage on your iPad, depending on how much you have stored on your device. However, you don’t have to store any of that on your iPad if you take advantage of the cloud. I’m not talking about Apple’s iCloud specifically, but rather different services that let you stream content or store content in the cloud, such as Netflix, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. For music, instead of storing all it on your iPad, consider using Spotify or Rdio to stream your music. If you want to watch a movie or TV show, use Netflix, Hulu Plus, or Amazon Instant Video. As long as you have an internet connection, you have a ton of music and video content at your fingertips that you don’t even have to store on your iPad. For photos, consider storing them in Dropbox, Google Drive, or even use Google’s new Photos app that lets you back up your photos and videos for free, and when you need to access them, just fire up the apps and view away. You can even save some for offline viewing. Again, you’ll need an internet connection to take advantage of apps like these, which is the main drawback for using the cloud in general, but most of the time you can get a WiFi signal almost anymore. It’s usually the small instances where you can’t get a WiFi signal that’s the hardest to deal with, so think about if using the cloud is really something that you could use. Free Up Storage Space Perhaps the best way to add more storage space to your iPad is by freeing some of it up. Too many users have apps, games, etc. on their iPad that they never end up using, which is precious storage space going to waste. Apps themselves don’t take up a lot of space at all — usually under 300MB a piece for most of them, but additional data such as cache, history, temporary files, etc. can add more space onto that. Plus, if you intend on having a ton of apps, the storage required can really add up over time. There are also bigger apps like GarageBand, which can take up almost a gigabyte by itself. Obviously, the more apps you have, the more storage space is being taken up by these apps as a whole, and I’m sure we’ve all been there before: You download a handful of apps, but never actually end up using them except for maybe a couple of times per year. It’s something we all experience to say the least. These are the apps that you should just get rid of. Every now and then, go through your apps and delete any of them that you haven’t used in a long time, as you’ll most likely never need them again. Doing this every now and then can free up space on your iPad with very little effort. 6 Responses 06/02/2015 yatindroid Reply one more thing you can use iDrive OTG for ipad iphone look here http://www.flipkart.com/strontium-nitro-idrive-3-0-otg-pendrive-ios-64-gb-utility/p/itme3xzfgc4bcpdb?pid=ACCE3XYVPQMXJG5Z&icmpid=reco_pp_same_mobileaccessory_pendrive_1&ppid=ACCCZ425QHUASXTY 12/13/2015 Wendy jager Reply Thanks for info I will have to try and remember it 04/01/2016 Brisue Reply Pardon my ignorance, but if I use an external wireless hard disc, can apps like BBC News be used just as if the app is on my iPad3 Retina ? 05/07/2016 jasmine Reply Hey, this is much easier to add storage to iPhone with the wireless storage device. http://airmore.com/flash-disk 02/20/2017 Rajesh khatik Reply Truthfully really helpful in such a device.

To me, Apple Clips is a lite version of iMovie. The app lets you create short videos on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Written by Anuj Bhatia | New Delhi | Updated: April 7, 2017 6:51 pm Apple Clips actually makes it easy to stitch together multiple videos and photos together, and add a soundtrack in the background. It’s like telling a short story to the world. Apple has not really entered the social media space, but with its clips app launched on Friday it wants to give Snapchat and Instagram some competition at least in terms of video editing for social. Some might even think that Apple is creating another Snapchat or Instagram. But the answer is no, at least for now. Clips is similar to Snapchat when it comes to recording and sharing video clips with friends and family. But what makes it different from Instagram or Snapchat is its simplicity and execution. And yes, it doesn’t have Stories or adverts for that matter. So, what is Apple Clips? Here is a quick review. Think iMovie, think Clips. To me, Clips is a lite version of iMovie. The app lets you create short videos on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Clips actually makes it easy to stitch together multiple videos and photos together, and add a soundtrack in the background. It’s like telling a short story to the world. And the best part is that you can upload the clip to any social network of choice, or simply share via iMessage. Plus, everything on the app has been made for a mobile user and that brings in a great ease of use. The design of the app is simple and requires no prior knowledge of video editing. But yes, it does take sometime to figure it out. Clips allows you to record video using the front or rear facing cameras or to upload existing content (be it photos or videos) from the device’s library. Once a photo or video is selected, users can add speech bubbles, filters, emojis or overlays. The speech bubble is at the top, which allows you to record your voice and, then automatically transcribe them into titles that overlay a photo or a video. Next to the Speech button is a filter button that alters your videos with eight filters, and the third button (which looks like a star), is for adding emojis and banners. Meanwhile, the “T” button will let you add posters, like “Cheers”, “Good Morning”, “Hello”, and more. Once a photo or video is selected, users can add speech bubbles, filters, emojis or overlays. You can also add background music, which can be done with the music icon on the far right of the app. You can either choose the pre-loaded music on the device, or add built-in background music options. Plus, you can choose to go with voiceovers, or turn it off. To record the clip, all you need to do is hold down the red button to capture video. Or, if you don’t wish to record a new video or photo, you can also add existing photos or videos from the device’s library. Just remember: multiple photos and videos can be combined together. Once you’re done recording , after dragging your clips into order, and then tap “Done”. You can always delete or reorder the recording before publishing. Once you are done making a short video, it can be shared directly to social networks, including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and more. You can also share it via Messages. Apple Clips is be a free to download app. Unfortunately, it is currently restricted to iOS. It is compatible with the iPhone 5s and up, the new 9.7-inch iPad, all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, the iPad mini 2 and up, and the sixth-generation iPod Touch. Make sure your device is up and running the latest iOS 10.3.

Research firm Strategy Analytics notes that Xiaomi topped the preferred brands chart for the next smartphone purchase with 26 percent share, followed by Samsung and Apple. Samsung and Apple are at par with each other by gaining 12 percent preferred market share. Micromax impressed the least amount of people by gaining only 2 percent of votes. Interestingly, Motorola attracted 7 percent votes, and Lenovo and OnePlus both got 6 percent votes. These research results are based on questions asked to an Android panel by the analytics firm. The research note also says that the panel preferred network speeds and processor over camera, screen size and resolution as purchase drivers. This is the first time Xiaomi has topped the charts as the most preferred choice for Indians while upgrading. Xiaomi entered India in 2014, and has since then made waves with its unique flash sale models, and competitive prices. Vendor Share Android Panel % Preferred Brand for Next Smartphone Xiaomi 16% 26% Samsung 18% 12% Lenovo 11% 6% Motorola 11% 7% Micromax 9% 2% Apple ~ 12% OnePlus 2.40% 6%     Source: Strategy Analytics Inc. The firm claims that the company has grown 125 percent year on year, a significant momentum for any smartphone company. This is because Xiaomi mainly made smartphones affordable and qualitative in the country, something that was missing before. The report also notes that the Indian premium smartphone segment (above Rs. 35,000) remains small at only 6 percent of potential buyers with over half of Indian smartphone buyers likely to spend between Rs. 10,000-20,000 only, something that Xiaomi caters to very well. However, David Kerr, Senior Vice President at Strategy Analytics feels that with Nokia re-entering the market, things may see a shift again. “Clearly a pool of dissatisfaction exist which One Plus, Xiaomi and others are stepping in to address. With Nokia re-entering the market this month, a powerful emotive brand will be added as an option to those dissatisfied with the current status quo. Micromax as well as Sony, LG, Lenovo and Motorola have cause for concern,” Kerr said in a statement. Kerr adds that it is “striking how poorly Micromax is rated in terms of purchase consideration relative to its position in the market.” Rajeev Nair, Senior Analyst at Strategy Analytics, added, “Xiaomi for the first time since it started operations in the Indian market was ranked among the top three vendors in Q4 2016. The vendor grew a whopping 125 percent YoY and 17 percent QoQ and captured 10 percent of market share in India in the quarter.” Nokia is said to launch the Nokia 3310 (2017) this month, followed by the Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and Nokia 6. On the other hand, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 launched last year has crossed one million in sales in India, and the Redmi 4A launched last month, garnered record numbers in first sale.

Photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Microsoft has officially beaten Apple in terms of satisfaction among iPad users. In a recent study conducted by J.D. Power, Microsoft Surface tablet users were more satisfied compared to Apple iPad or tablets manufactured by LG, Acer, Samsung, Asus or Amazon. The report, 2017 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study, released Thursday noted that with an overall satisfaction score of 855 on a 1,000-point scale, Microsoft topped the list mostly for its design, styling and features. The J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study claimed that Microsoft Surface was considered as among the best in the market because of its features, styling and design factors. Photo: J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study “The Microsoft Surface platform has expanded what tablets can do, and it sets the bar for customer satisfaction,” Jeff Conklin, vice president of service industries at J.D. Power, said in the report. “These tablet devices are just as capable as many laptops, yet they can still function as standard tablets. This versatility is central to their appeal and success.” According to the report, Microsoft was a clear winner in largely three areas — internet connectivity, preinstalled applications and preloaded applications. “Customers using Microsoft tablets are more likely to be early adopters of technology. More than half (51 percent) of Microsoft customers say they ‘somewhat agree’ or ‘strongly agree’ that they are among the first of their friends and colleagues to try new technology products. This is relevant because early adopters tend to have higher overall satisfaction,” the report said. Here are some of the key findings of the study: Rising levels of satisfaction When compared with the 2016 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study—Volume 2, the overall customer satisfaction with tablet devices has seen an increase of 21 index points, bringing the number to 841. The selection process A cheaper price tag and past experience both had 22 percent vote, making them the most common reasons to select tablets among users. Product and company reputation stood at 19 percent. Size of the device The most preferred screen size among users was 11.8 inches. Customers using devices with a screen size exceeding 10 inches was at 869 and the ones using 8-10 inches scored 850. Data plans Thirty-two percent users have a data plan that they use with their tablet. The satisfaction level of these users is 863 compared to 834 among users without a data plan.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 7, 2017 01:11 PM Many PC gamers and enthusiasts will tell anyone that it is not a very good idea to game on a Mac. Apart from the somewhat outdated hardware, the laptops and computers are well-known for performance throttling when the going gets tough. However, many still try by relying on updates from third-party developers to release the updated device drivers for their hardware. This is basically what NVIDIA has done. Although Apple is now using AMD graphics cards on its current line of laptops and computers, there is still a tiny niche of eGPU and Hackintosh enthusiasts who need driver support for the latest NVIDIA Pascal graphics cards. The last time Apple used an NVIDIA graphics card on a Mac was back in 2013. And at the time, even the Mac Pro has already switched to an AMD graphics card. Only the MacBook Pro and iMac remained with NVIDIA; at least until the following year. Nevertheless, with NVIDIA releasing a slew of new drivers for the latest Pascal-based graphics cards, it is still relevant in today’s Mac computing. When does one use an NVIDIA graphics card on a Mac? As mentioned, Apple has already switched to AMD in terms of graphics cards. Nevertheless, there are many third-party hardware that enables users to sort of equip a Mac with an NVIDIA graphics card, and that is through eGPU hardware. Razer Core eGPU box (via razerzone.vom) Another way one can use the NVIDIA Pascal drivers is through what is called the Hackintosh. A Hackintosh is a hodgepodge of various common PC hardware that is made to run like a Mac. More details of it are discussed below. What is eGPU? An External Graphics Processing Unit or eGPU is a standalone piece of hardware that provides added graphical support to an existing PC system. Instead of installing a graphics card inside the actual computer, an eGPU provides the same feature as a proper graphics card albeit it is situated outside of the computer. The only link between the eGPU and the host computer is a length of cable: either Thunderbolt or USB. An eGPU helps boost system performance For a PC, it is quite easy to swap or replace a piece of hardware, for instance, a graphics card. However, on a Mac, since pretty much everything is custom made, there is really not a lot one can do to change the hardware in order to improve performance. Most of the time, Mac users are stuck with what Apple puts inside a Mac system, be it a MacBook Pro, iMac, or Mac Pro. However, those who want to add more graphics processing power to their existing Mac setup can do so by using an eGPU. AKiTiO Node eGPU box (via akitio.com) The eGPU will act as a standard graphics processor to a performance-constrained Mac. Right now, the most used interface port for an eGPU is either USB 3.1 to Thunderbolt 3. There are older eGPU systems that support Thunderbolt 2 as well. However, these systems can oftentimes introduce a bottleneck between the graphics card and the host computer due to slower data lines. So what if NVIDIA released Pascal drivers for the Mac? This is where it gets pretty interesting. At the moment, NVIDIA has the most powerful graphics card in the market. And it will be releasing another one pretty soon: the NVIDIA Titan Xp. Since Macs only support AMD processors and older NVIDIA graphics cards, the new ones, like the NVIDIA GTC 1050 to 1080 are still unsupported. This means, gamers are stuck in using the AMD graphics cards even if they have an eGPU hardware. Who else can benefit from the NVIDIA Pascal drivers? Apart from eGPU users, there is also a very small group of, what you can say unofficial Mac users, who will benefit from the driver update: the Hackintosh community. A Hackintosh machine (via tricksforyou.blogspot.com.cy) The Hackintosh community is a relatively small group of Mac enthusiasts. This community has succeeded in porting the Mac OS to run outside of an official Mac system. These devices are made from common PC hardware and runs an unlicensed version of the Mac OS, hence the name Hackintosh. Although not completely legal, Apple somewhat tolerates Hackintosh users. However, it is clearly stated in its end user license agreement for the Mac OS that when used outside of official Mac hardware, its usage is deemed illegal. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, it is a very small community although it tends to grow bigger with every passing year. NVIDIA Pascal driver release date With NVIDIA releasing Mac support for the GeForce GTX 1050 and above, it changes the game altogether. Now, extreme gamers who are also fans of the Mac will be able to enjoy their favorite games on any Mac system. Not only that, they will also be able to enjoy the games in the best possible graphics settings. While the NVIDIA Pascal drivers do not affect the entire Mac ecosystem directly, it is still a rather big deal. Especially to extreme gaming and Mac enthusiasts. Gone are the days of limited hardware support. Now, everyone can enjoy whatever hardware they want to add on their Mac systems. Users can finally upgrade their older Maxwell-based 9 series graphics cards for a more powerful Pascal 10 series GPUs. NVIDIA is set to release the Pascal drivers for the Mac sometime next week. As mentioned earlier, it will include support to all the new series 10 graphics cards from the company. Unfortunately, the release will be in beta form. Meaning, users will need extra care in using the drivers as they are not fully tested yet. The beta driver will surely contain a fair bit of bugs that will need to be sorted out. Users are urged to perform regular data backups in case your system experiences a fatal bug. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 7, 2017 01:22 PM The Macintosh or Mac is undoubtedly the most iconic computer there is. Apple has been at the forefront of design and build quality when it comes to its computer products. Unfortunately, Apple is known to charge a steep premium on all of its Mac products, be it the MacBook, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac Pro, and the Mac Mini. What is worse, while there is no doubt at all that these products are made well, they are not the best in terms of performance. This is basically why there is a small niche in the market for Hackintosh machines that are basically a rough copy of a Mac. What is a Hackintosh? To cut to the chase, a Hackintosh is nothing but a bunch of common PC hardware put together to resemble a Mac. While an actual Mac may have inferior performance due to hardware constraints, a Hackintosh is somewhat more powerful. In fact, it can even outperform the Mac Pro in some cases. 2013 Mac Pro (via apple.com) Since an actual Mac system is very expensive, one can actually put together a collection of PC hardware and keep it cheap and cheerful; within the constraints of supported systems, of course. Why a Hackintosh? There are basically three reasons why someone will build a Mac clone. The first one is the price. Apple computers are known to be quite expensive even though they are somewhat lacking in performance. Secondly, is the performance. Many would know by now that a Mac is very limited in terms of performance. The system does not offer overclocking at all. In fact, when the system detects increased operating temperatures, the OS will throttle the performance of the system in order not to burn all the components. In a Mac clone, since it is basically made up of PC components that are readily available in the market, one can easily customize a build to cater to the power requirements. Overclocking is also possible since the system can be installed with an adequate cooling solution like liquid coolers. Furthermore, the main bulk of the system, the CPU and GPU, can be optimized to provide that best performance for any given design. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) Finally, there is the macOS. By far, the Mac OS is the best operating system from Apple. It is more stable and secure compared to any Windows platform. How does one build a Hackintosh? There are a lot of things to consider when building a Mac clone. For one, one should set a target performance for the build in mind. This will help one decide in choosing the appropriate hardware that needs to be bought and put together. Secondly, anyone who aspires to build a Hackintosh will need to do a lot of reading. The actual build is actually quite involved and some things need to be done that are not usually done on a normal PC build. For those who are curious about it can check tonymacx86 for some guides. Finally, know that building one and keeping or using one is in direct violation of Apple’s Mac OS end-user license agreement. While Apple seems to tolerate Hackintosh users for the time being, there is a chance that it might introduce a way of identifying unauthorized hardware using the Mac OS Sierra. Can I do it on my own? The answer to this question is a yes and a no. Yes, because with enough knowledge and keen sense of following directions, it is fairly easy to build a Hackintosh. There are a number of great tutorials online on how to build one. Furthermore, all the third-party settings that one might need are readily available on the Internet. A simple Google or visiting the site mentioned above will yield positive results. A typical Hackintosh assembly (via 9to5mac.com) On the other hand, a no can also answer the same question. This is mainly because as mentioned earlier, it breaks the Apple’s EULA for the Mac OS. Also, building a Hackintosh is not for the faint of heart. Even a seasoned PC builder can sometimes get stuck when building a Mac clone. What system should I use? This will depend on the aim of a Hackintosh builder. For instance, if one wants a simple system, there is the Hackintosh version of the Mac Mini. For mid-range specs, there is the iMac. And then finally, in the upper echelon of the Mac ecosystem, the Mac Pro. Each of these systems will have a corresponding PC hardware that one can use. Depending on how much one wants the system to perform, there are hardware available to cater for that. How much will it cost? In general, one of the main reasons why someone will build a Hackintosh is the cost. As mentioned earlier, an official Mac computer can cost thousands of dollars while having a lacklustre performance. With a Hackintosh, a lot of performance can be squeezed into a build with as little cost as possible. Of course, the cost will depend on what a user wants to get from the build. The Mac Mini equivalent build can cost between $400 to $600. Meanwhile, an iMac equivalent build can be between $1,000 and $1,500. Finally, a Mac Pro build can blow up to about $2,000. Of course, in comparison to an actual Mac, these costs are still quite affordable. A Mac Mini starts at around $500, with a sub par hardware. For the iMac, the 21.5-inch version starts at $1,100 while the 27-inch model is at $1,800. Finally, the Mac Pro can have a minimum price tag of $3,000. One thing to note is that the prices indicated for the Mac systems are in no way close to the performance of a Hackintosh with the same price tag. While a Hackintosh does not resemble a Mac at least in looks, it compensates with increased performance and build cost. Furthermore, since a Mac clone is basically a hodgepodge of computer parts, it can be easily upgraded with new hardware especially when driver support for the hardware becomes available.

The last time the company made changes to the all-in-one computer was back in 2016 when it released the Retina display iMac. Now, consumers are expecting the iMac 2017 to come later this year as Apple already made the announcement for it. In line with this, some new information about the iMac 2017 surfaced online ahead of the supposed release this year. According to the blog Pike’s Universum, the iMac 2017 will have a brand new set of specs on its release, on top of which is the Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 CPU paired with 16GB of ECC memory. It is interesting to note that this type of processor is not out yet. It is not even listed in the Intel Ark website. Furthermore, this will be the first time that the iMac will support ECC memory. There are no details that the iMac 2017 will still have non-ECC RAM support. The blog also mentioned that the iMac 2017 will have a maximum memory capacity of 64GB. Another thing mentioned in the blog is the upcoming iMac’s support for NVMe storage that can go as much as 2TB. Also, there will be support for Thunderbolt 3 as well as second generation USB 3.1. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) On the graphics side of things, the blog said that the iMac 2017 will also be able to support virtual reality or VR. If this is the case, the AMD graphics card would be something like the AMD Radeon R9 290X or quite possibly the AMD Radeon R9 390X. It will be quite a push for Apple to use the latest AMD Radeon RX480 due to power constraints. Lastly, it seems that the iMac 2017 will also sport a new keyboard, according to the blog. While it did not clearly specify what the keyboard would be, one can speculate that it might have support for Touch Bar and Touch ID features. This is due to the fact that Apple was just granted a patent for the technology. Readers are urged to take these bits and pieces about the iMac 2017 with a grain of salt. These, as they say, are nothing but rumors. Nevertheless, since Apple has already confirmed the arrival of the new iMac, consumers can expect them to arrive later this year.

The vulnerability resides in a widely used Wi-Fi chipset manufactured by Broadcom and used in both iOS and Android devices. Apple patched the vulnerability with Monday's release of iOS 10.3.1. "An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip," Apple's accompanying advisory warned. In a highly detailed blog post published Tuesday, the Google Project Zero researcher who discovered the flaw said it allowed the execution of malicious code on a fully updated 6P "by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction."

The fix is available only to a select number of device models, and even then it can take two weeks or more to be available as an over-the-air update to those who are eligible. Company representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post. The proof-of-concept exploit developed by Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini uses Wi-Fi frames that contain irregular values. The values, in turn, cause the firmware running on Broadcom's wireless system-on-chip to overflow its stack. By using the frames to target timers responsible for carrying out regularly occurring events such as performing scans for adjacent networks, Beniamini managed to overwrite specific regions of device memory with arbitrary shellcode. Beniamini's code does nothing more than write a benign value to a specific memory address. Attackers could obviously exploit the same series of flaws to surreptitiously execute malicious code on vulnerable devices within range of a rogue access point. Basic mitigations missing Besides the specific stack overflow bugs exploited by the proof-of-concept attack, Beniamini said a lack of security protections built into many software and hardware platforms made the Broadcom chipset a prime target. "We’ve seen that while the firmware implementation on the Wi-Fi SoC is incredibly complex, it still lags behind in terms of security," he wrote. "Specifically, it lacks all basic exploit mitigations—including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection (by means of a [memory protection unit.])" The Broadcom chipset contains an MPU, but the researcher found that it's implemented in a way that effectively makes all memory readable, writeable, and executable. "This saves us some hassle," he wrote. "We can conveniently execute our code directly from the heap." He said that Broadcom has informed him that newer versions of the chipset implement the MPU more effectively and also add unspecified additional security mechanisms. Given the severity of the vulnerability, people with affected devices should install a patch as soon as it's available. For those with vulnerable iPhones, that's easy enough. As is all too often the case for Android users, there's no easy way to get a fix immediately, if at all. That's because Google continues to stagger the release of its monthly patch bundle for the minority of devices that are eligible to receive it. At the moment, it's not clear if there are effective workarounds available for vulnerable devices. Turning off Wi-Fi is one possibility, but as revealed in recent research into an unrelated Wi-Fi-related weakness involving Android phones, devices often relay Wi-Fi frames even when Wi-Fi is turned off. This post will be updated if word of a better workaround emerges. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

View All Editorials → Tim Cook Offers Auburn Students ‘A Personal View of Inclusion and Diversity’ Bryan Chaffin @TMOBryan · +Bryan Chaffin Apr 6th, 2017 9:52 PM EDT | Editorial Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke to the students of Auburn University—his alma mater—on Thursday. According to university newspaper The Plainsman, Mr. Cook’s speech was titled, “A Personal View of Inclusion and Diversity.” Special to The Plainsman: Tim Cook on diversity at Auburnhttps://t.co/T6RXd2ckCa pic.twitter.com/P8tSB3i4M0 — The Auburn Plainsman (@TheAUPlainsman) April 7, 2017 In his speech, Mr. Cook made the case that diversity is important from a capitalist standpoint. He said, “The world is intertwined today, much more than it was when I was coming out of school. Because of that, you really need to have a deep understanding of cultures around the world.” Diversity of Professions, Too Interestingly, he also expanded the usual definition of diversity beyond cultural, ethnic, gender, and sexual orientation. We believe you can only create a great product with a diverse team. And I’m talking about the large definition of diversity. One of the reasons Apple products work really great – I hope you think they work really great – is that the people working on them are not only engineers and computer scientists, but artists and musicians. It’s this intersection of the liberal arts and humanities with technology that makes products that are magical. These are themes advocated for and advanced by Steve Jobs, who often spoke of the intersection of technology and the arts, or technology and the humanities. Mr. Jobs felt it was important, for instance, to design office buildings in such a way that fostered accidental meetings between people of all disciplines and professions within a company. He did this first with Pixar’s headquarters, and then again with Apple Park that is set to open later this year. In Walter Isaacson’s excellent The Innovators (Amazon, iTunes), he showed us how Steve Jobs studied Bell Labs, where such accidental meetings were key to that AT&T branch’s success for decades. Tim Cook It’s an interesting take on the importance of diversity. As Apple CEO, Mr. Cook has been vocal in the fight for marriage equality and other more politically-fraught areas. And it couches the concept of “diversity” in a way that may help some people reframe the “diversity” concept. Diversity of thought and background can combine to form better ideas and solutions. This is true for society, corporations, academia, science, and anywhere else you care to look. He added: In order to lead in a diverse and inclusive environment, you have to allow that you may not personally be able to understand something someone else does. That doesn’t mean it’s wrong. For example, somebody may worship something else as you. You might not be able to understand why they do that. But you have to allow that the person not only has the right to do that, but they likely have a set of reasons and life experiences that have led them to that. There’s more in the full article from The Plainsman.

Such settings include those of Apple-centric discussion fora, in which, occasionally, someone voices objection to diversity as an artifice of pointless political correctness, while at the same time using a product of Apple’s creativity, itself the product of applied diversity, as a tool to voice that objection. As one Mr Spock might say, ‘Fascinating’. There are other words that equally apply. April 7, 2017 at 10:09 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

April 6, 2017 | By HBSDealer Staff Leviton’s Decora Smart offering has new functionality, and a new look. Leviton released the Decora Smart product offering with support for Apple HomeKit, allowing for customizable lighting control using an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple Watch or Siri. This new family of products features three devices including 600 Watt and 1000 Watt in-wall dimmers, as well as a 15 Amp switch with multi-way capability. These dimmers and switches are wireless and individually HomeKit-enabled, requiring no centralized hub or bridge to coordinate the accessories throughout the home. Leviton’s Richard Westfall described the new product as an easy-to-install and easy to use. "The innovation behind Decora Smart with HomeKit makes controlling lights efficient and flexible by leveraging only an app or your voice with Siri,” said Westfall, VP and general manager of Leviton Energy Management, Controls & Automation. “Installation of these Decora Smart products is straight-forward too, making it easy for users to set up their iOS device with Wi-Fi. Plus, with no need for a hub or bridge, the HomeKit-supported solution is ideal for both existing and newly-constructed homes.” The Apple HomeKit technology in these Leviton accessories provides an easy, secure way to control lights from an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple Watch. Using Apple’s Home app or the free Leviton Decora Smart Home app, homeowners can facilitate distinctive lighting control settings such as fade rate, minimum/maximum brightness, bulb type selection and more to ensure the perfect atmosphere in every room. Homeowners can also use Siri to dictate whether a Leviton Decora Smart accessory is on/off or dimmed/brightened, and can even control scenes that include Decora Smart products. Using Apple’s Home app or Leviton’s Decora Smart Home app, Decora Smart accessories can be grouped into rooms and zones, such as a home’s first floor or outdoor area, which helps to simplify control for the user. Multiple accessories can also be set up to work together as scenes, such as “Good Morning” or “Movie Night,” which can be enabled using the Home app, The Control Center Home card in iOS or Siri. The Home app can even allow for the setup of automations, so Decora Smart accessories or scenes can run automatically based on location, time of day or separate accessory action. The product also introduces a new look. The dimmer hardware features a dim/bright bar placed vertically alongside the on/off rocker paddle while the vanishing LEDs on the left side of the paddle show current and target light levels with real-time feedback. Both white and light almond faceplates are included with the in-wall devices, and color change kits are available in black, red, ivory, gray and brown. Optional screwless Decora wallplates are also available.

Thorin Klosowski Apr 7, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  ask lh ask lifehacker clips coding development ios programming regulars Share Dear Lifehacker, I have a little background in coding, and I'd like to make an iOS app. I'm just not sure where to get started or what tools I need. Where do I start? Thanks, App Store Amateur Dear ASA, If you're versed in coding, you'll need to become familiar with Apple's development tools and their guidelines. Apple is known to restrict apps for all kinds of reasons, so it's good to know what you can and can't do before you start. We're not going to walk you through the entire process of making an app — that's far too much information for this post. However, we will get you set up with the coding environment, point you to Apple's guidelines, and give you a few resources to help you learn Apple's different languages for iOS. Xcode, Swift and the iOS SDK Apple's IDE (integrated development environment) for both Mac and iOS apps is Xcode. It's free and you can download it from from Apple's site. Xcode is the graphical interface you'll use to write apps. Included with it is also everything you need to write code for the OS with Apple's new Swift programming language. It's also only available for Mac, so if you plan on making iOS apps, you'll need to be running OS X. While Apple is pushing Swift pretty hard these days, you can program iOS in any number of languages, including Objective-C. Which you decide to use it really up to you, but here are a few guides, classes and tutorials to get you started: Start Developing iOS Apps Today: This is Apple's official starting guide. It walks you through setting up Xcode, structuring your app, implementing everything, and submitting it to the App Store. Introducing Swift: Apple's new programming language, Swift, is made specifically for iOS and Macs. It's supposedly much easier to work with and use, so if you're totally new to iOS development it's a good place to start. It works with and is similar to Objective-C (which you can also use if you prefer). Apple's Development Videos: Apple includes a lot of videos from WWDC teaching you various aspects of development. They're a great resource for learning industry tricks and getting to know the basic toolset you're working with. Ray Wenderlich's Tutorials: If you want to make games, Ray Wenderlich's tutorials are a great place to start. He covers all kinds of thing beyond games too, so you're bound to learn something about Swift and Objective-C even if you'd prefer to make a productivity app. Apple's API Capabilities: Apple has a lot of different APIs to access app extensions, Touch ID, Photos, HealthKit, and more. Familiarise yourself with these so you can integrate more advanced features into your app. Code School's iOS App Development class: You can get a grasp on the basics of iOS development for free through Code School's intro classes. Stanford's iOS Development Classes: Stanford has a set of free classes to learn iOS development. It's still only available for iOS 7, but most things you learn should transfer over nicely to iOS 8. Chances are there will be an updated class for iOS 8 in the near future. That should get you set up with your development tools and give you a good grasp on how things work on iOS. Apple's App Store review guidelines It's no secret that Apple's App Store Review Guidelines are incredibly strict. Apple has a very specific view of what apps will be allowed in the store, so it's useful to get to know the rules before you even try to build your app. If you don't, you might spend your time producing something that Apple won't allow into the App Store. When you finish your app, you'll submit it to the App Store and it will be reviewed based on a content, design (more on that in the next section) and technical details. So, head to the Review Guidelines page and get to reading. Apple also has a list of the common reasons apps get rejected here. Typically, it's because of crashes, broken links, advertisements or incomplete information. Apple is also known to block apps that include any type of adult or political content. Likewise, many of Apple's APIs have their own set of review guidelines. So, if you're going to integrate your app with HealthKit or Apple Pay, it's good to get to know those as well. Here they are: Apple Pay Guidelines App Extensions HealthKit HomeKit Keep in mind that Apple tends to be very conservative with its app review process. Chances are, if you're contemplating something even remotely risqué, it will be rejected, so be mindful of that before you start making your app. Apple's design guidelines Beyond Apple's review guidelines, there is also a set of design and interface guidelines. Apple wants all the apps in its store to have some type of consistency, and while this doesn't have to mean good design, it does mean apps use the same basic UI elements. To get a grasp on this, check out Apple's Human Interface Guidelines page. Here, you'll find the basics of what's required in both apps and icon design. Apple also has a set of Do's and Don'ts that summarise that massive guide so it's easier to get started. Thankfully, Apple doesn't leave you totally in the dark on how to make a well designed app. Here are a few resources to help you design something worthwhile: Designing Great Apps: Apple collected together some of the best talks from WWDC about design to help you get started with designing an interface. Designing A User Interface: Apple put together a guide for designing interfaces in iOS 8 using the built-in tools of Xcode. You can also find plenty of resources online to help improve your design chops. Register For GitHub And TestFlight Unless you're some kind of super-genius, you don't want to create your app in a bubble. Instead, it's good to get other people to look at your code and invite beta testers to try your app out. GitHub is the go-to for software versioning and collaborative work. Once you register for GitHub, it's incredibly easy to link Xcode into it so everything you do is saved and accessible by other people on your team. If you need a little help setting up GitHub, the service guides walk you through the process. Likewise, beta testing is also incredibly easy in iOS 8. Using TestFlight, you can simply invite users to your team so they can test your app. They will just need to download the TestFlight app. Developing for iOS is really all about familiarising yourself with Xcode. Once you're comfortable there, you can write your app in a wide variety of languages or take a stab at learning Swift. As you move along to actually writing that app, you'll certainly need to dig up answers to more specific questions, but the tools above will get you started on the right path.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Apr 6, 2017 at 9:07PM Services are more important to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) than ever before. Last quarter, 9.2% of Apple's revenue came from services, the highest percentage Apple's ever reported for its first fiscal quarter. One of the biggest contributors to Apple's services is its App Store. Apple said it paid out over $20 billion to app developers in 2016, which implies it brought in between $8 billion and $9 billion for itself after taking its cut. App Annie estimates Apple actually grossed $34 billion in its App Store last year. It also expects App Store sales to grow to more than $60 billion by 2021. The App Store is a major component of Apple's services revenue. As such, it's a significant contributor to its profit growth. Image source: Apple. Apple's highest-margin product The gross profit margin on Apple's App Store revenue is ridiculously high. With over 1 billion active Apple devices around the world, the scale of the App Store means its cost of revenue is practically nothing. Apple just provides a storefront and developer support. As such, Apple keeps about 90% of App Store revenue as gross profit, according to Macquarie Securities analyst Ben Schachter. That means Apple's App Store growth could add about $7 billion in annual gross profit five years from now based on App Annie's estimate and Apple's standard 30% take rate. For reference, Apple produced $84 billion in gross profits in 2016. The best part is that Apple doesn't have to sell more devices for App Store sales to grow -- though it likely will. App Annie expects revenue per device to climb through the end of the decade. There's always a new game, utility, or subscription service that consumers will want. Is doubling being conservative? Apple's next iPhone is expected to bring a huge wave of upgrades. Additionally, backlash from Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Note 7 fiasco will likely provide Apple with a nice boost through the rest of the year. Samsung's misstep already showed up in Apple's first-quarter results when it reported better-than-expected iPhone unit sales. As the installed base continues to climb, the App Store should see significant sales growth. Schachter believes App Store sales will climb at a 28% rate through 2021, implying App Store sales of nearly $100 billion that year. That assumes Apple's hardware sales stop growing after the next two iPhone cycles. Perhaps the true potential growth rate is somewhere between App Annie's and Schachter's estimates. Also consider that, if Apple cannot meaningfully grow hardware sales, management will likely take further steps to monetize its existing install base through services and the App Store. As long as hardware sales remain stable -- i.e., don't decline meaningfully -- App Store sales should continue climbing for the foreseeable future. Still a hardware company Investors shouldn't go around calling Apple a services company, though. Services may be growing extremely quickly, but they still only accounted for 9.2% of revenue last quarter. That growth is a byproduct of Apple's robust hardware sales. Services, with its relatively high margins, represent an opportunity for Apple to juice the profitability of each of those hardware sales. That way, Apple can grow net income even if total revenue stays relatively flat. Adam Levy owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Hands-on with Apple’s Clips: Simple and fun video editing, only for iOS Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 6, 2017 7:31 PM Tags: Apple, clips, top-stories, video sharing Above: Clips on iPad. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Today Apple released its latest app, Clips. It’s an answer to Snapchat and Instagram’s rapid and generally unimportant but absolutely modern systems for recording, editing, and sharing photo-video mashups. Do you need it when you already have Instagram or Snapchat? No. Is it more understandable than those other apps? At this point, I think so. The Verge sets Clips in the context of iMovie, Apple’s 18-year-old video editing software. That’s reasonable, but just so we’re clear, iMovie is also available on iOS, even if the app’s heritage is primarily on Mac OS X macOS. But when you open iMovie on iOS, well, it’s pretty heavy. It’s powerful. Clips is not that. Clips is something that people of all ages can grasp if they spend, say, 10 minutes with it. No fade in from black. But if you want to add an emoji on top of it? Of course you can do that. Want to add a block of text using iOS’ native dictation feature? Sure, yeah. Want to stitch together stuff and add a style à la the 2016 breakout app Prisma? No problem. Obligatory Clip pic.twitter.com/LtIwAvzRVm — Jordan 'Jaws' Novet (@jordannovet) April 6, 2017 It’s a great follow-up to the Messages app that was updated for iOS 10, which lets you do whimsical things like make a really big emoji if you hold down on it, or send a disappearing message — those types of features exist in popular apps like Messenger. Similarly, Photos for iOS 10 got even with Google Photos with image recognition. The big picture: Apple is getting more competitive for some of the basic things that people do on their phones and tablets. But there is no social network here in the way there is on Instagram or Snapchat. You can send your Clips one by one to one person at a time. It’s about creating stuff, rather than racking up all the comments and likes and exploring the vast pool of content from others. For me, the most fascinating part about Clips is how Apple has expressly chosen not to monetize this app, and perhaps as a result of that, not to bring it cross platform to, say, Android (let alone macOS). Apple’s Services business aggregates revenue from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iTunes (two out of three of those are available on non-Apple operating systems), and this is in fact the brightest spot in terms of growth for the company, even if it’s certainly not the biggest. The spirit behind Clips is about enhancing the core Apple smartphone and tablet experience, not about Services. Probably many people with iPhones, iPads, and iPods will appreciate the lack of ads in Clips. But it’s still a surprising move, given investors’ interest in Services as a way for Apple to maintain healthy levels of growth over the next few years. Ultimately, Clips’ restriction to iOS and its lack of ads is the latest reminder that at Apple, iOS still rules. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Thom Holwerda from OSNews reports that the decision to develop a modular Mac Pro was only made in recent months and development started just a few weeks ago. He speculates that we won't see the new Mac Pro until late 2018 at the earliest but most likely early 2019. What made Apple do a 180? Well, after the announcement of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, orders for refurbished "old" MacBook Pros supposedly went through the roof, and after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher. This response to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar took Apple completely by surprise. Combined with the problems surrounding the LG UltraFine 5K display and the constant negativity from professional Apple users, the company decided to double down on professional users. Notably, Apple is also said to be considering more retina MacBook Pro models without the Touch Bar and other pro features such as the ability to hook up your iPad Pro to a Mac and use it like a Cintiq. As announced, the Apple is also releasing a pro iMac. We could see that new iMac this October, perhaps with a new keyboard as well.

Apple Music 2.0 for Android brings a sleek coat of paint paired with a few new features tagging along for the ride. With a focus on introducing "greater clarity and simplicity", Apple has organized content into sections such as Library, For You, and Radio, dressed in bold headers specific to each section. In addition, the Now Playing tab allows users to read lyrics for songs they are listening too - for you know, those who have the desire to belt out a number to their favorite tracks. Navigating music has become arguably easier with a new music list which sits comfortably below 'Browse'. Apple Music will also send customized recommendations for playlists, albums, and more, influenced by the type of music you are listening to, which is rather neat. The new design is a welcomed addition and a worthy upgrade from the previous version. However, it may come as no surprise that the Android version is not exactly on Apple's radar considering how long it took for the 2.0 update to arrive. Back in December, we reported that Apple announced their music streaming service reached 20 million paid subscribers, which is quite a feat but still leaves the company chasing Spotify's 50 million paid subscribers. Considering Apple Music for Android currently has ten million downloads on Google Play, it may leave you wondering what percentage of Android users pay for a subscription and account for Apple Music's user base. Regardless, it is great to see Apple supporting their app on its competitor's platform, even if it took them nine months to catch up with iOS 10. Head on over to the Google Play Store to check for updates or to download the app. Source: TechCrunch Gallery: Apple Music 2.0 for Android Tags Apple Apple music Android Android apple music Apple music 2.0 Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Follow @TwitterDev Previous Story Huawei defeats Samsung in legal fight in China Next Story NBA Playgrounds is a return to arcade-style basketball action Community Activity Refresh Early Redstone 3 concept animations released in Front Page News Happy Birthday: Windows 3.1 is 25 years old in Front Page News The Big Wrestling Thread! in The Sporting Arena Question for persons who do not live in US, what type of local food do you like that might someone in the US may not? in General Discussion 'Cortana speaker' may be Microsoft's answer to Amazon's Alexa and its supported devices in Front Page News The Problems of living in Texas in Real World Issues Strange behavior in the last few days... in Site & Forum Issues Images of Samsung's refurbished Galaxy Note7 appear online, packs smaller 3,200mAh battery in Front Page News Advertisement Trending Stories Happy Birthday: Windows 3.1 is 25 years old Apr 6, 2017 with 34 comments First details of Microsoft's Surface Pro 5 hint at evolution of current design 19 hours ago with 34 comments Android usage: Marshmallow sees its first loss; latest version of Nougat is stagnant Apr 7, 2017 with 9 comments OnePlus ignores the cries of its customers wanting Nougat on the OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X 2 hours ago with 0 comments Related Stories 7 Days: A week of Android announcements, Windows 10 anticipation, and fresh fruit Mar 25, 2017 Instagram finally supports sharing multiple photos and videos in one post [Update] Feb 22, 2017 It's now possible to request an Uber ride directly from Google Maps Jan 13, 2017 The six original Mega Man games are coming to iOS and Android next month Dec 19, 2016 deals TigerVPN: Lifetime Subscription $780.00 $29.00 96% off VPN Unlimited: Lifetime Subscription $499.99 $39.00 92% off Private Internet Access VPN: 2-Yr Subscription $166.00 $59.95 64% off Pay What You Want: Ashampoo Best Selling Software Bundle $429.92 $1.00 100% off VPNSecure: Lifetime Subscription $450.00 $39.00 91% off Show Comments 2 Comments - Add comment Sort by oldest first (thread view) Sort by newest first (thread view) Sort by oldest first (linear view) Sort by newest first (linear view) Advertisement Report Comment Close Please enter your reason for reporting this comment.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 Australia’s consumer watchdog takes Apple to court SYDNEY: Apple has been taken to court by Australia’s consumer watchdog for violating laws by allegedly refusing to look at or repair some iPads and iPhones previously serviced by a third party. The tech giant “made false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers’ rights under the Australian Consumer Law,” the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) charged. The proceedings, against Apple Pty Ltd and its US-based parent Apple Inc, were brought on behalf of 275 consumers. Under Australian law, each breach could attract a fine of up to A$1.1mil (RM3.68mil), although it was up to the court to determine the size of the penalty. The case followed an ACCC investigation into reports that users who had an error that disabled their iPads or iPhones after updating their operating systems were “routinely refused” by Apple to have their devices looked at or serviced. These customers previously had their devices serviced by a third-party, “even where that repair was unrelated to the fault”, the government body said. “Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party,” ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third-party repairer not only impacts those consumers. “(It) can also dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer.” Apple in Australia had no immediate response. Sims said companies must remember that consumer rights extended to software or software updates on goods they sell. “Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law,” he said, adding that the ACCC was seeking remedies including financial penalties. — AFP Tags / Keywords: Australia , Apple , court Related Stories Related Stories Pakistani killed in ‘horrific’ Australia crime spree Singapore slashes jail term for showbiz pastor Record crystal meth bust in Australia Creepy crawly cargo caught in Australia Family tragedy sees Australia flood death toll rise You May Be Interested Foreign residents to pay higher fees Upside seen in property market Chong Wei-Lin Dan final on the cards Hang up if 'banks' call for personal data, says ABM Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Writer, food critic and vibrant personality Fay Khoo dies Surviving the age of emails Golf - McGirt making move at Augusta, top players eye leader Hoffman advertisement Latest News Indian police arrest alleged kingpin of U.S. tax scam Man arrested over Stockholm deaths suspected driver of truck - police Timber worker from India found drowned in Baram river 20 killed in Myanmar wedding boat crash Rohani defends under-fire Shabudin Most Viewed in News ‘Why did you run off?’ family asks motorcyclist Woman hacked to death over ‘honour’ Dog attacker apologises, says he just 'snapped that day' Full statement by Shabudin Yahaya on 'Rapists Asked To Marry Underage Victims' Reports Five brothers arrested over transgender's murder All eight Ivy League varsities accept M’sian-born lass Foreign residents to pay higher fees Man, 69, forces wife, 63, to have sex with friend, 61, for RM20 Big catfish catch feeds fisherman’s family for days Rohani defends under-fire Shabudin Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Photo: Dan Taylor/Heisenberg Media ©Dan Taylor David De Min has created an app which allows the user to edit videos during the process of filming, saving hours of time Share Comment Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. Usurv Velapp A video editing app endorsed by the co-founder of Apple will “make a difference to people’s lives”, according to its Kent-based founder. Velapp aims to save hours of time by allowing users to edit videos during the process of filming. Currently available on Apple iPhones, before the official launch in the coming weeks will see it showcased across a number of platforms, it uses the phone’s 3D touch technology to help select ‘highlights’. Users simply press harder on the screen when the best bits occur to easily cut sometimes lengthy videos down to precise points, then can share instantly via social media. A classic example, founder David De Min says, is a toddler taking its first steps - parents tend to film for long periods in anticipation of it happening, but with Velapp, you can capture the magical moment without wasting minutes, if not hours, finding it and cutting it in subsequent editing. The CEO, who attended Canterbury’s Kent College as a teenager and still lives in the city now, told KoS how it all started on a trip to the Himalayas with his brother, Michael. “We got two motorbikes and I was doing filming for a music video,” Mr De Min said. “Using Go Pros we filmed some of the most amazing memories – fly fishing, trading trout for jumpers and so on. “The roads are treacherous so we had some pretty close calls, it made for great filming. “After two-and-a-half weeks we came back with 235 hours of footage. “I consider myself a pro but it still took three weeks to cut it down, it was an absolute nightmare. “I thought ‘there must be a way to improve this’? I was pulling my hair out. “You realise what the best bits are when you’re filming at that time, in the moment, not afterwards, so I applied that idea to the technology, it’s as simple as that.” Like many entrepreneurs, Mr De Min is a natural hustler, who has the confidence and determination to get what he wants. When invited to an event where Steve Wozniak - the late Steve Jobs’ partner in crime - was the headline speaker, he was relentless in his quest to personally pick him up and show him how Velapp works. He went to Rolls Royce in Berkeley Square in London and demanded one of their finest models, telling them it was a great opportunity for the car manufacturer to get some exposure - an offer which they eventually accepted. “People kept asking who I was and I told them ‘I’m no one, I’m a random guy who started a little company in Kent’,” he said. “Eventually we got into this interview room and I spoke to Steve for half an hour, while there were a queue of journalists just waiting to have a few seconds with him. “I demoed the app and he was so impressed. “He gave me his business card and we’ve stayed in touch ever since – it’s by far the coolest card I’ve ever seen.” These are unquestionably exciting times for Mr De Min but he has had to overcome a number of significant obstacles on the road to where he is today. Born in Holland in 1990 to a Dutch father and an English mother, he moved to Oman as a small child before arriving in Kent in 1999. Diagnosed with dyslexia on arrival, he attended East Court, a special school in Ramsgate, to help him build his basic academic skills. Eventually studying IT, business studies and design and technology at Kent College, his creativity shone through - achieving 120 marks out of 120 for an A Level design project during his time on the course. “I think I look at things in a different perspective,” he said. “I really struggle with words and I’m not good at writing but have always been quite creative. “You can’t let a failure or a setback stop you, so many people have doubts about themselves. “You need to have that passionate belief and I think having such a drive is helping me push forward and make a difference to people’s lives, even just by saving them time – that’s what keeps me going.” The biggest hurdle for him to overcome, however, was the tragic death of older brother Jamie, who lost his battle with cancer aged just 17, despite a bone marrow transplant from Mr De Min. “It’s a difficult subject but I try to look at it from a positive because he always said he wanted us to be happy, he was such an inspiration. “It’s certainly brought the family together, my other brother Michael is one of my best friends and now we’ve both got a very different outlook on life. “Now when I see siblings fighting or not talking to each other I think it’s so sad and such a waste because I know what I’ve lost. “I just think ‘why are you arguing? You should be so close’. “It makes you think life is so short and you’ve got to make the most of it, and that’s the attitude I take into my work as well.” Now back at his parents’ home in Canterbury “to keep costs down”, Mr De Min is readying himself for take-off, with a clear aim of seeing Velapp become part of our everyday lives. “The absolute dream would be to have the technology integrated as standard when people open the camera on their phones,” he said. “We are some time away from that but in this industry things move pretty quickly, so who knows?” Mr De Min is also launching a competition, with a prize of £200 in cash, a Velapp t-shirt and the option of mentoring and support from a renowned business advisor in the UK. To enter, simply download Velapp, use it and upload your best Velapp video to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter with the hash tags #Velapp and #Kent – and don’t forget to like the Velapp Facebook page.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley essay contest winner looks to change the world Thursday Apr 6, 2017 at 12:40 PM Apr 6, 2017 at 5:52 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — Enrique Arcilla has recently discovered his writing has not only allowed him to craft stories for the edification of others, but the process is also crafting him. The 16-year-old junior from the Academy for Academic Excellence in Apple Valley has won several writing contests, with one essay getting the attention of the Mojave Water Agency. Arcilla was chosen as the MWA 2016 Essay Contest winner, with his essay titled, “The Path to Sustainability,” focusing on a water-wise population in 2036 through efforts begun some 20 years earlier. “I actually entered the contest because of the opportunity to win a $5,000 scholarship,” said Arcilla, who lives in Apple Valley. “But as I worked through the process of research and writing, I soon found myself becoming more aware of the issue — that’s when I became more of an environmentalist.” Arcilla said the MWA essay was one of many pieces he’s written that has broadened his understanding of the world and has begun to craft his perception of life. The MWA essay winner was also given the opportunity to speak at the agency’s 2016 High Desert Water Summit at Barstow Community College's Performing Arts Center. The agency was so impressed that it invited him to serve as emcee of the 2017 High Desert Water Summit at High Desert Church last month. Arcilla is currently participating in several writing contests, including one with the Lions Club International where the young writer has focused his essay on privacy rights as they relate to national security. “These contests are not just about winning scholarship money, but about the edification I’ve received by my participation,” Arcilla said. “I wish more people would become engaged in the process of learning about issues and taking action.” Arcilla is the son of Ricardo Arcilla, a business analyst at St. Joseph Health, St. Mary, and Monica Loaiza-Arcilla, a math and social studies teacher at Vanguard Preparatory School. Both have supported their son in his academic endeavors. Arcilla is a member of his school’s mock trial team, volunteers at St. Joseph Health, St. Mary, works with AAE’s Make-A-Wish Club and plans to attend Pomona College to study sociology and economics. “I’d like to obtain my masters in sociology, with an emphasis in political science,” Arcilla said. "My ultimate goal is to work for the United Nations in economic and social development. I’d like to help influence the growth of nations for sustainable patterns of growth.” Arcilla credits his parents, teachers and friends who have encouraged and influenced him to push the boundaries of learning and activism. “I think those around me have helped me to become more outgoing and to try new things that I might have been afraid to fail in,” Arcilla said. “I read that failure is just a stepping stone to success.” Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, RDeLa Cruz@VVDailyPress.com or on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.

By Christian Zibreg, Apr 6, 2017 Tweet 4 Comments Apple has confirmed it’s working on a completely rethought, highly modular Mac Pro that won’t arrive this year. Thom Holwerda, managing editor of OSNews, is not entirely convinced that the machine will ship next year either. After talking to people and sources “who know their stuff”, he now suspects we won’t see the new Pros before late 2018 or early 2019 given how long it takes to develop a new desktop like a Mac Pro. Keep in mind that his comments appear to be derived from anecdotal evidence, meaning you should take the story with a grain of salt. “Constant negativity” from pro users is said to have prompted Apple’s top dogs to pull a 180-degree turn and double down on professional users. Still, the decision to go ahead and develop a modular Mac Pro replacement struck Thom’s sources as having been made in recent months, “with development starting only a few weeks ago”. Apple’s change of heart came as a result of MacBook Pro complaints. Here’s an interesting quote: After the announcement of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, orders for refurbished “old” MacBook Pros supposedly went through the roof, and after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher. This response to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar took Apple completely by surprise. Assuming the project was really approved just a few weeks ago, Thom concludes that we can expect the new Mac Pro in late 2018 at the earliest. “Most likely it won’t be until early 2019 before it ships,” he speculated. When Apple’s execs announced minor Mac Pro updates on Tuesday, they told the press that next-gen Mac Pros along with Apple-branded pro displays “will not ship this year”. Curiously enough, they never mentioned “next year” or any year for that matter. I've also made a small update to my original story. After reviewing the transcript — Apple never explicitly said Mac Pro would be next year. pic.twitter.com/gJ6hSgBKir — Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) April 6, 2017 “All in all, there is definitely excitement in the air regarding professional Mac use, and to be honest—that’s been a while,” Thom writes. I agree with his comment, but I don’t think the next Mac Pro is really two years away. True, creating the next Mac Pro will take longer than it usually takes to do a new Mac. After all, it’s going to be a complete overhaul of the entire system—from the housing, which will be highly modular, to most of the internals and other parts. I just don’t think it’s going to take two whole years before first shipments of the next Mac Pro start arriving at customers’ doorsteps. To put it another way, by 2019 existing Pros will have been even more hopelessly outdated than they are today three years after they were introduced (Tuesday’s minor CPU upgrades to the Mac Pro lineup changed little in that regard). Worse, Apple’s rattled pro users who have recently jumped ship, or are considering switching platforms soon, will be highly unlikely to return to Apple’s fold in 2019. Apple knows this and I think they’re working around the clock to put the next Mac Pros in customers’ hands as soon as possible in order to regain lost trust. Will the next Mac Pros ship in 2018 or 2019, do you think? Source: OSNews Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Is Apple working on 8K display for its completely rethought Mac Pro?

This seemed to suggest that the Touch Bar would be more or less a staple for MacBook Pros in the future, but that may no longer be the case. In a report from OS News (via AppleInsider), they have heard that the next update to the MacBook Pros could see the higher-end 15-inch laptop launched without the Touch Bar. This doesn’t mean that Apple will be killing the Touch Bar, but rather Apple will be giving 15-inch MacBook Pro customers the option of whether or not they want the feature. Apparently this is due to poor professional response to the laptops, and based on that feedback Apple reportedly plans to give their customers that option. Presumably the model without the Touch Bar will be cheaper, so for those who aren’t willing to shell out so much money could potentially save themselves a couple of hundred. This is also in line with the rumors that 2017’s MacBook Pro refresh could see prices reduced. As it stands the cheapest 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar is priced at $1,500, with the version with the Touch Bar priced at $1,800, although there are differences in specs that would also justify the difference in price. Take it with a grain of salt for now, but how do you guys feel about a 15-inch MacBook Pro model that won’t come with a Touch Bar? Yay or nay? Filed in Apple >Computers >Rumors.

Every time Samsung comes out with a new model, we like to put it up against the best that its arch-rival, Apple can produce. The other day we looked at the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8 Plus, so it is only befitting that we look at the two smaller models as well. The Apple iPhone is a solidly built device, but that is not the problem we Android lovers have with the iPhone – we object to its restrictive iOS and that is not going to change when we look at the iPhone 7. These two devices could not be more different in their specifications or design philosophy, but we will look and see just what common threads we can find. The iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S8 look nothing like one another inside or out. The iPhone 7 is an all-metal design with large bezels all around, whereas the Galaxy S8 is an all glass design with no bezels on the right or left and only small ones at the top and bottom. Even though the Galaxy S8’s display is 1.1-inches larger, the device itself is less than 10mm taller and 1mm wider and weighs only 17 grams more. Besides the size of the display, they use a different technology and different resolutions. When it comes to processors, the iPhone 7 uses its own Apple A10 Fusion and the Samsung Galaxy S8 uses the newest Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor in the US Model, although the Samsung Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor is used in other markets. The iPhone offers 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of fixed internal storage while the Galaxy S8 offers 64GB of expandable UFS 2.1 storage. The primary cameras are both 12MP – although the Galaxy S8 uses a Dual Pixel variety. The front-facing cameras (FFC) are only a megapixel a part – 7MP on the iPhone 7 and 8MP on the Galaxy S8. Both will provide you with excellent photos and social media selfies. They both use a non-removable battery, but the Galaxy S8 is much larger and offers rapid charge and quick wireless charging. They both provide a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and authorizing mobile payments – the iPhone only offers Apple Pay while the Galaxy S8 provides Android Pay and Samsung Pay. They have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth (iPhone with v4.2 and S8 with v5.0), GPS, and NFC (the iPhone’s is only good for Apple Pay), and they each have a connector for charging and data transfer but the Apple plug is proprietary, and the Galaxy S8 uses a standard reversible Type-C port. Please take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below, and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. Specifications Apple iPhone 7 The Apple iPhone 7 looks very similar to the iPhone 6s that it replaces. Oh, it has a few enhancements, especially when it comes to the processor, but Apple’s leaps and bounds in the cameras area are starting to slow down. Externally, you will notice that the antenna lines were moved to the top and bottom of the device to make them less conspicuous. The Home button is no longer physical, but a touch-sensitive button to sense your fingerprint. The 3D Touch, introduced on the iPhone 6 has been improved, as well as the Display Zoom. Apple threw in an IP67 certification for dust and water resistance, but the real improvements are in the processor and GPU. Let’s take a look and see just how the iPhone 7 holds up to the new Samsung Galaxy S8. The Apple iPhone 7 is sporting a small, by today’s standards, 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display with only an HD resolution of 1334 x 750 pixels and 326 pixels-per-inch (PPI), which Apple likes to call their ‘Retina Display’. The display does include an improvement on Apple’s 3D Touch that allows the user to press a finger, with varying degrees of force, to make multiple selections. The powerful processor is their new Apple A10 Fusion quad-core clocked at 2.34GHz and coupled to a PowerVR Series 7XT Plus six-core graphics processor. The iPhone 7 packs only 2GB of DDR4 RAM and either 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of non-expandable internal storage. Apple did make some considerable changes in its camera area on the iPhone 7 Plus, but not on the iPhone 7. It still packs a 12MP sensor, phase detection autofocus (PDAF), Quad-LED dual-tone flash, and OIS, but they did increase the aperture from f/2.2 to f/1.8 that should allow better low light shots. For its FFC, the iPhone 7 replaced the 5MP with a 7MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 for selfies and video chatting, or as they would call it, AppleTalk. It uses a small 1960mAh non-removable battery to supply power and Apple still offers no form of rapid charging for their batteries. The Apple iPhone 7 comes with many changes and refinements – an improved camera lens, a Quad LED flash, an improved 3D Touch, improved stereo sound, improved Home button, and added IP67 dust and water resistance. Apple kept the same 2GB of RAM, but finally, did away with the ridiculously low 16GB model and now offers 32GB of non-expandable memory as the standard amount. Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack and supplied an adapter for regular earphones or you can switch to Bluetooth earphones to avoid the proprietary plug. So far, Apple and the Moto Z line have lost their earphone jacks. It measures 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm and weighs in at 138 grams. Pricing starts out at $649 for the 32GB model and jumps to $750 for 128GB. The iPhone does have an NFC chip, but only for Apple Pay; so there will be no available Android Pay. Apple still uses its proprietary plugs and ecosystem services like iTunes, Apple Pay, iMessage, and AppleTalk, making it increasingly difficult for iPhone users to communicate with Android folks. Samsung Galaxy S8 The new Samsung Galaxy S8 only jumped up one number, but it looks and acts nothing like its predecessor. Gone is the flat display on the Galaxy S7 as Samsung introduces their new Infinity Display that seamlessly wraps around the sides of the device and it has allowed Samsung to squeeze much more display into a smaller area. Also missing is a favorite of Samsung – the physical ‘Home’ button that is now an on-display key. The lower part of the display now has 3D Touch capabilities and when pressed, the ‘Home’ as well as the ‘Back’ and ‘App’ keys magically appear on the lower part of the display. The fingerprint sensor is now on the back of the device, inconveniently near the camera lens, but Samsung gives us alternative ways to unlock the device – facial recognition and an iris scanner. The new Galaxy S8 is a real beauty and one sexy device, even more so than the ‘Edge’ display, but does it have the specs to beat the iPhone 7? Let’s check out the Galaxy S8 to see where it stands. The Galaxy S8 jumps the screen from 5.1-inches to a larger 5.8-inch Infinity Display that uses the Super AMOLED QHD+ display with a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 PPI. Out of the box, Samsung set the default resolution to 2220 x 1080 to conserve battery life, but it can be manually turn up to the maximum through the settings. The display uses a 18.5:9 aspect ratio making it taller and slightly narrower, although it truly does go edge-to-edge taking up 83.6-percent of the front of the phone. The Galaxy S8 retains the ‘always-on’ screen to help save battery life and makes it easy and quick to check notifications. Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protects the display. The newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor clocked at 2.35GHz and an Adreno 540 GPU are used in the models destined for the US. In other countries, the Galaxy S8 will use Samsung’s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and has 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 expandable memory via a microSD card. We were surprised that Samsung used the same camera from the Galaxy S7 with a Dual Pixel 12MP sensor. Samsung said they concentrated on making advancements to their imaging software and kept that same f/1.7, 26mm, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung did up the FFC from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor and added its own autofocus while retaining its wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, and Live HDR. The camera area should continue to take great pictures, but it is odd that Samsung did nothing to the primary camera’s hardware. Samsung also kept the same sized non-removable 3000mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. The Galaxy S8 has many ‘extras’ and some of them you will use and others you may not, but they are there just the same. It has the better IP68 certification rating against dust and water; it sports a heart rate monitor and oxygen saturation sensor. Samsung Health has replaced Samsung’s S-Health and you will find a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung’s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things). Samsung’s new Bixby personal assistant works a lot like Google Assistant, but also uses the camera to answer your questions – point it at a historical building and it will tell you the history of the place or aim it at a sign in a foreign language, and Bixby will translate it for you. Another new feature is the DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a desktop experience – this concept has never proven to be popular in the past, but we will have to wait and see if DeX takes off. The Galaxy S8 can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which will allow Galaxy S8 users more freedom to make mobile purchases just about anywhere a merchant can swipe a credit or debit card. Either the Galaxy S8 will come with Android Nougat 7.0, followed by a quick upgrade, or it may possibly include 7.1 by release time. It measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, weighs in at 155 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 will cost about $720 outright and is now available for pre-order to be delivered no later than April 21. …And The Winner Is… The Final Word There was never a doubt that the Samsung Galaxy S8 would be the winner of this comparison and not because we are Android lovers and consider the Nougat 7.1 superior over the iOS used in the iPhone – the Galaxy S8 is simply a much more advanced device. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch display and that just does not cut it for most users, nor will the HD display of only 326 PPI. The design of the phone is getting a little outdated and a little tired looking, especially when compared to Samsung’s Infinity Display on the Galaxy S8 – the bezel free sides and small bezels at the top and bottom make the large bezels on the iPhone almost ‘clown-like’. The iPhone only gives its users 2GB of RAM and 32GB of standard fixed memory, whereas the Galaxy S8 doubles the RAM to 4GB and has a minimum of 64GB of expandable memory. With an excellent camera, and all of the added features it brings to the table, the Galaxy S8 is the clear winner in this comparison. The iPhone 7 is nice little phone, but other than the Apple name; it is lacking many things for a real power user. You really cannot enjoy a game or video with a 4.7-inch display. Once you try a larger display, there is no going back – try going back to a 21 or 26-inch TV after watching sports or a movie on a 60-incher. The iPhone may run fine on just 2GB of RAM, but then you cannot run two apps at once in a split-screen mode, you need RAM for that to happen. The iPhone takes nice pictures, but DxOMark scores it less than last year’s Galaxy S7. It does offer better sound through its stereo speakers, but for only $70 more than the iPhone 7 the Galaxy S8 gives you 32GB more expandable internal memory, a bigger and better display, and a slew of additional features, making it the winner.

Langford will continue in his current role as manager of APAL’s intellectual property division until June. During his time at APAL, Langford has managed the Australian Pome Fruit Improvement Programme (APFIP) – including oversight of APFIP’s role in the certification of nursery trees – and served as an effective liaison with international breeding programmes, and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).  He has also been a director of Prevar, a world-class apple and pear breeding programme. Langford has been instrumental in developing APAL’s world-leading intellectual property business, based on the Pink Lady trade mark, which is now registered in more than 70 territories worldwide. His departure comes as APAL develops a new industry strategy, which aims to align with the organisation’s focus on supporting commercial apple and pear growers. “Sadly, as we work through this process one of our longstanding team members, Garry Langford, has informed us he will be leaving APAL in the coming months to pursue new opportunities,” APAL chief executive Phil Turnbull said in a release. While not yet finalised, the new strategy will place more emphasis on the commercial side of the business to open new opportunities for growers. “We will continue to manage APAL for the benefit of the Australian industry and Australian growers in line with our constitution,” Turnbull added. “However, we will also focus on a new level of rigour around performance and a renewed accountability for outcomes. We want the value we create for our growers, licensees and stakeholders to be more transparent as we grow. “I’ve been extremely gratified and encouraged by our team’s ability to pull together as we have worked through this review. The Board is unanimous in its support for our strategic direction, and the APAL team are engaged and enthusiastic about the future.”             Comments (0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Sign up for free news updatesGo Popular news Read: LatestMost read 1New inspection plant puts Cabrero on the map 2One Banana helps Peruvian families 3Fruitday extends offline reach 4Aussies feel boost of Japan FTA 5Fruit consumption falls further 6Garry Langford to depart APAL 7Zespri releases more Gold3 8Pakistan faces tough challenges 9E-commerce pioneers to speak in Hangzhou 10The Greenery doubles its profits 1Spanish port strike to go ahead 2Mindanao must endure El Niño 3Hamburg Süd tests low-sulphur fuel 4Industry leaders to address FPI 5Global Plant Genetics ties up blueberry deal 6NZ police investigate kiwifruit fraud claim 7Apple imports shine in India 8Zespri sets sail for 2017 9Audio: brands key to adding new value 10E-commerce pioneers to speak in Hangzhou Upcoming Events April to June 2017 Fresh Produce India MUMBAI (India) 27-28 April 2017 FPJ Live - The UK Fruit & Vegetable Congress Belfry Hotel & Resort, Birmingham (United Kingdom) 4 May 2017 European Tomato Forum Düsseldorf, Germany 1-2 June 2017  Keep informed...  Twitter  Blog  Podcasts  Video  RSS Feed  Instagram Sign up for free news updatesGo Features & Analysis Strong first half for Costa Australia’s leading fresh produce group saw pre-tax profits rise 26.6 per cent, boosted by a “solid performance” across its four core categories Online dating for fresh produce They describe themselves as the matchmakers of fresh produce – but what does this latest wave of fruit and veg e-commerce platforms offer suppliers?

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

And this is an important one indeed, because it fixed a big security flaw in the Broadcom Wi-Fi chips used in recent iPhone models. While Apple reveals little when the security update shows up as a notifications badge on your Settings app, the security flaw is a big one and could let attackers within Wi-Fi range inject and run all sorts over code on your smartphone. The security flaw was pointed out by Google Project Zero security pro Gal Beniamini. Beniamini in his detailed blog post, pointed out how it mainly impacts the iPhone 5 and newer models and even messes up Google Nexus devices; including some Samsung Galaxy models as well. The flaw is to do with Broadcom’s Wi-Fi SoC that is used in large number of mobile devices today, so there’s really no telling how widespread this issue really is. Beniamini’s research hints that it is indeed Broadcom’s WiFi SoC commenting that the chip “lacks basic exploit mitigations, such as stack cookies, safe unlinking,” and also doesn’t use the available memory protection features. For Apple’s iOS users, it’s just another quick fix that comes on time for all Apple devices. Google too released its Android update last week, but there’s really no telling how many have received or downloaded the patch thanks to interference from manufactureres and their custom software modifications. Apple on its support page states that the update is available for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, iPod touch 6th generation and later. Oddly the update is also said to re-enabled some iCloud settings and features that were by default disabled. Apple told Tom’s Hardware that only a small number of iCloud users were impacted and that Apple will be sending across emails to all affected customers to make them aware of the issue. Apple also said that the change in iCloud settings was a problem that affected its users on iOS 10.3 and that the issue was fixed in iOS 10.3.1, which is the newest update.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Alleged armed robber shot; second suspect still at large Friday Apr 7, 2017 at 12:01 AM Apr 7, 2017 at 10:14 PM Paola Baker Staff Writer @DP_PaolaBaker APPLE VALLEY — An alleged armed robbery at a local pharmacy was foiled when one suspect was shot by the pharmacist Friday evening, authorities said, but a second suspect remains at large. The incident, which occurred at Jonathan’s Pharmacy in the 19300 block of Bear Valley Road, was reported just before 7 p.m. Friday. Details were scarce, but authorities confirmed one suspect was shot while another one remains outstanding. According to scanner traffic, the pharmacy was robbed at gunpoint by two suspects, described as black men wearing bandannas over their faces. The pharmacist opened fire and struck one suspect, Apple Valley Sheriff’s Sgt. Griffith said, but the second fled before deputies arrived. An employee on scene told the Daily Press she had just left work when a friend called to ask about what happened. “I thought it was a prank call at first,” the employee said. “I’ve heard about pharmacies being robbed before, but never would have imagined it happening here.” The employee said the pharmacy’s boss and two technicians were there when the incident occurred. They were OK but “very shaken up,” the employee said. The wounded suspect suffered “non-life-threatening” injuries, Griffith said, and was taken to a local hospital before being arrested. No further details on the suspect were available Friday night. According to scanner traffic, the second suspect fled the scene in a black 2000 Nissan Altima. No further details were available. The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is asked to call Sheriff's dispatch at 760-956-5001.
