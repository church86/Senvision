Nonetheless, the iPhone maker will have to press the limits because this is the 10-year anniversary of the smartphone. Image Source: YouTube.com iOS 11 rumors We’re so far away from the unveiling of iOS 11 that it’s nearly impossible to say for certain what Apple’s next mobile operating system will bring with it, but there are a few features that seem to be widely expected. One is a sort of dark mode designed to make it easier to look at the iPhone or iPad while in the dark. After all, it can be downright painful to look at something extremely bright when in total darkness, so a dimmed screen would be easier on the eyes. Some iPhone users say that even sliding the brightness option all the way to minimum doesn’t help, so a dark mode would be helpful. Then again, this mode could arrive as early as 10.3, which is expected in March. We’ve been hearing something about a theater mode with that release (although should you really be looking at your iPhone in a dark theater while watching a film anyway?) Some also claim that iOS 11 will bring support for virtual reality, which Android already supports. If it does, then it seems likely that only the iPhone 8 lineup will support VR because it will probably need additional hardware. However, there’s a chance that Apple will skip right over virtual reality in favor of augmented reality, which CEO Tim Cook has expressed more interest in than VR. Many are also expecting some big improvements to Siri because the tech world is turning into a battleground for digital assistants. Samsung is expected to show off its new digital assistant Bixby as early as February, and Google keeps making its own Google Now better and better. Clearly Siri will need further improvements just to keep up. iOS 10.2.1 beta 4 released Apple continually updates iOS and has now pushed out iOS 10.2.1 beta 4. This version is mostly a bug fix designed to improve performance and fix problems. It came less than a week after the third beta and a few weeks after the second beta. Clearly Apple is moving fast here, and it’s a good thing. iOS 10.2 is currently the official public version, and it’s the only one the iPhone maker is still signing. This means that those who want to roll back to the previous version in hopes of a jailbreak arriving can no longer do so. Unfortunately, it also means that iPhone users who have been plagued by the 30% battery bug are stuck until Apple fixes it. Hopefully iOS 10.2.1 will do it, seeing as iOS 10.2 worsened the problem which appeared with the previous version, making it more prevalent.

In this review, we’ll talk about the ActionSleeve’s build quality, comfort, and usability, as well as where you can get your own. A solution for some rigorous sports The Apple Watch is designed to be both a watch and a fitness tracking accessory. It normally sits on your wrist, but the problem is that some sports and other forms of physical activity tend to require your wrists more than others, so sometimes the placement of your Apple Watch is inconvenient. For example, if you’re doing push-ups, then you might be flexing your wrist a lot, which has the potential to stretch out your stock or aftermarket Apple Watch wrist strap or put extra strain on the holes that the clasp normally interlocks into. That said, you’re more prone to wearing out your wrist straps faster in these scenarios, and they can get pretty costly. Another problem has to do with sports where you are actively using your wrists in blunt-force scenarios and the Apple Watch could become damaged. For example, if you’re playing volleyball and you give your Apple Watch a few good whacks because you misjudged a serve or ball return, it’s possible you could end up with a damaged device. ActionSleeve is here to put your Apple Watch in a place where it’s out of the way, but can still accurately monitor your health and fitness activities. Because it’s still connected to a part of your arm, you’ll still get heart rate information and it’ll continue to track your calorie burning. Build quality   First off, ActionSleeve isn’t as sexy looking as some of your classy Apple Watch wrist straps, like the timeless Milanese Loop or the fancy leather options from Apple or Nomad. Nevertheless, it’s intended for sporting activities where heavy use is expected, so function is certainly more important than form in this case. It’s basically an elastic strap with a flexible shell embedded inside of it with the sole purpose of popping your Apple Watch inside of. This protective shell helps keep your Apple Watch safe from shock that could occur from balls hitting it or being tackled, etc. One side of the shell provides easy access to the side button and the Digital Crown: The other side has two openings for both of the microphones, keeping vocal clarity at its highest: Comfort The strap itself is extremely comfortable to hold and to feel on your upper arm thanks to the elastic fibers. A strong Velcro pad helps tie the ActionSleeve to your arm wherever it’s comfortable. Your personal preference for adjustment isn’t going to be a problem because it’s infinitely adjustable to fit any arm. It’s a little awkward to gaze at your Apple Watch screen from your upper arm when you’re used to glancing down at your wrist, but it’s not impossible. In fact, you can easily read what it’s saying and control your Apple Watch from your upper arm. The fact that it’s now closer to your mouth also makes it more convenient to mutter words to Siri too: The good, the bad, and everything else ActionSleeve is a highly affordable accessory for your Apple Watch, priced at just $30. It fits both the 38mm and the 42mm versions of the device, whether you’re using the original generation or second generation of the device, which means it fits every Apple Watch made to date. Also important is that, it comes in both black and red colors, which are the signature colors of Twelve South themselves. Here’s a short list of pros and cons for anyone who like short summaries: Pros: Very affordable Helps get the Apple Watch out of the way for some sports and activities Comfortable to wear Flexible and durable fibers are sure to have a long service life All fitness functions of the Apple Watch sill work on the upper arm Unique and original idea Cons: Not everyone will like having their watch on their upper arm Can be a little awkward to get used to seeing the watch screen this way Overall, I recommend this product to anyone who uses their Apple Watch for sports and wants to try something new that might help to get the Apple Watch into a more convenient location where it won’t get battered or worn out faster. If you want to pick one up, you can head over to Twelve South’s website today, where they’re $29.99 with free economy shipping anywhere in the United States.

But last week, The Wall Street Journal cited sources inside Apple who claim the company is looking to “build a significant new business” in the area of scripted TV, talking with veteran producers over the past few months about buying rights to television programs and trying to woo experienced studio and network marketing executives to come on board. While Iovine didn’t provide much in the way of specifics—shrugging off question’s about the report’s claim that Apple would begin offering original scripted content by the end of this year—he clearly signaled the company is much more open to a wide range of TV shows now, saying “If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you’re not musicians, you know? We’re going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We’re going to try.” Comments « Daily Deal: Next FlipBook Maker Pro for Mac Daily Deal: Kinkoo 3-Outlet Surge Protecting Smart Power Strip » Related Stories Apple Music creative team discusses the service’s exclusives, future Apple looking to produce original TV content for Apple Music subscribers Apple Music’s ‘Carpool Karaoke’ to feature different celeb hosts for 16 half-hour episodes Apple clarifies relationship between Apple Music and iTunes Match Apple acknowledges Apple Music now includes ‘all the benefits of iTunes Match’ Apple Music tops 20 million subscribers Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Report reveals insights into Apple’s HomeKit strategy and vendor requirements Apple moving international iTunes operations to Ireland HBO GO gets Single Sign-On, TV app integration Apple to join the Partnership on AI (Update: formally announced) Dropcam co-founder Greg Duffy joins Apple Apple files lawsuit against Qualcomm in Beijing Apple near deal to begin manufacturing in India iOS 10.3 to improve in-app rating experience, allow developers to respond to App Store reviews Apple releases first iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2 betas Pokémon Duel released for iOS Recent Reviews Revogi Smart Lightbulb, Smart Lightstrip, Smart Candle + Smart Meter Plug Audeze iSine10 In-Ear Headphones MOCACARE MOCACuff Connected Blood Pressure Monitor Apple AirPods Elgato Eve Motion Olloclip Core Lens Set for iPhone 7/7 Plus Logitech Pop Home Switch Starter Pack Elgato Eve Light Switch iHome iPLWBT5 Docking Clock Radio for iPhone and Apple Watch Brydge 12.9 iPad Pro Keyboard Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

Email | 16 Jan 2017 | Print  ExtraBITS for 16 January 2017 by TidBITS Staff In ExtraBITS this week, Jason Snell and a panel of Apple experts judge the company’s performance in 2016, developer Greg Raiz offers a better take on the iOS Activity sheet, former Apple automation guru Sal Soghoian explains why app extensions can’t replace existing Mac automation tools, collaboration tool Trello gets a new owner, and Apple veteran Chuq Von Rospach reviews Apple’s 2016. Apple in 2016: The Six Colors Report Card -- Jason Snell of Six Colors has issued his report card on Apple’s 2016 efforts, relying once again on a panel of 37 industry watchers, including many TidBITS and Take Control staffers and authors (Adam Engst, Tonya Engst, Josh Centers, Jeff Carlson, Kirk McElhearn, and Rich Mogull). The consensus was that Apple had a rough year compared to 2015, with lower scores for the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and hardware reliability categories. On the positive side, the panel felt that Apple improved in a few areas, including the Apple Watch, cloud services, home automation, and developer relations. See if you agree with the panel’s ratings! Read/post comments How to Fix the iOS Activity Sheet -- In a post on Medium, Greg Raiz, CEO of app development agency Raizlabs, explains how Apple could improve the Activity sheet in iOS (it’s commonly called the Share sheet, but that’s misleading because it frequently contains actions unrelated to sharing). He points out that the seldom-used AirDrop takes up far too much space, the app with which you want to share is often buried, and there are too many customization options. Raiz presents a cleaner and simpler Actions sheet that distinguishes between actions within the current app and sharing data with other apps. It also prioritizes app actions and orders share apps by frequency of use. We hope Apple redesigns the Activity sheet along these lines for iOS 11. Read/post comments Is Apple Planning to Replace Automation with App Extensions? -- Sal Soghoian, the automation guru recently released by Apple, has penned a compelling editorial for MacStories explaining why app extensions are not a replacement for automation tools like AppleScript and Automator. He does an excellent job of explaining what app extensions are and how they compare to existing automation tools. The real story here is the concern that Apple could even be considering such a move. Soghoian hints that Apple might see it as a way to further merge iOS and macOS app development, but the reality is that dropping user automation tools in favor of app extensions would likely be the last straw for many professional Mac users. That in turn could lead to a “reverse halo effect” as former Mac users switch away from iOS and take their influencer networks with them. Read/post comments Atlassian Buys Trello for $425 Million -- We’re tremendously fond of collaboration tool Trello, which just announced that it’s being purchased by enterprise software company Atlassian for $425 million. Trello claims that it will be able to take advantage of Atlassian’s research and development to improve its service, but some users are concerned that Trello will become as complex as other Atlassian products. Regardless, since Atlassian paid so much, we suspect that the company has big plans for Trello, so we’re not too worried about one of our favorite tools going downhill. Read/post comments Chuq Von Rospach’s Review of Apple in 2016 -- Apple veteran Chuq Von Rospach has reviewed Apple’s performance in 2016, and he has some tough words for the company, saying that it “simply isn’t firing on all cylinders” and is “out of sync with itself.” He points out how Apple has missed its ship dates and left products to languish. More specifically, Von Rospach accuses Apple of being out of touch with its customers, relying too heavily on data, and getting sloppy in its execution, with numerous bugs and quirks in its offerings. However, he takes pains to note that his criticisms are not revealing fundamental problems; Apple just needs to recalibrate a few things to get back on track.

An obvious target for his wrath would be the iPhone, especially given Apple’s other problems with keeping cash overseas. Bringing iPhone production from the USA to China would, for Trump, theoretically bring some of Apple’s money back to the US, and create a few good ole’-fashioned blue-collar jobs. But there’s one problem: if iPhone factories came to the US, you can be sure that robots would be the only ones getting more jobs.  Don't Miss: I really hope Apple’s iPhone 8 looks nothing like this concept A shining example of this comes today from the chairman of Pegatron, a Chinese-based manufacturer that also has some small plants in the US, which mostly make repair components for HP and Dell. TH Tung, Pegatron’s chairman, said that those US-based plants could easily increase production by three to five times if necessary — for example, if Trump introduced crippling tariffs on Chinese-made components. For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android. But that increase in production wouldn’t come by hiring more workers. Instead, it would almost exclusively come from increased capital spending and automation. The relative cost of skilled labor in the US and China is such that it’s cheaper to build a robot than it is to hire one US worker to replace one Chinese worker in the supply chain. Regardless of geographical location, increased automation in technology manufacturing is a given. Foxconn, Apple’s biggest manufacturing partner in China, is pushing ahead with building fully-automated assembly lines in its Chinese plants. Foxconn is said to be making 10,000 of its automated “Foxbots” per year, and that’s with manufacturing still in China. If Trump forced Foxconn to move production to American plants, where labor is exponentially more expensive, you can be certain that Foxconn’s automation plans will pick up speed. This isn’t all idle speculation. Following Trump’s election, rumors spread that Apple was conducting a feasibility study into moving iPhone production to the US. Although that might seem like a victory for Trump — Apple never looked at moving iPhone production stateside for Obama! — it’s likely just good forwards planning from Apple. The question of iPhone manufacturing has already come up between Tim Cook and Donald Trump, so Cook having a study that says it’s impossible to move iPhone manufacturing to the US is really just an insurance policy. Unfortunately for Trump, it’s really a moot point. Even if he could get iPhone manufacturing shifted to the US — and that’s a huge, towering if — it seems that all he’d be doing is giving new jobs to the people who build Foxconn’s robots. “Make the Chinese robotics industry great again” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.

The rules took effect Monday, in a country where domestic third-party app stores -- not from Apple or Google -- are serving billions of downloads to Android smartphones. Chinese internet companies such as Baidu, Tencent and a host of smaller, shadier local app stores have been feeding the demand, at a time when Google has largely pulled out of the market. The government, however, has problems with the proliferation of app stores and the lack of industry oversight, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement on Friday. Some app stores have been offering products that violate users’ rights, contain security vulnerabilities or spread "illegal information," it said. The new rules intend to force the stores to better audit their products. Cyberspace Administration officials will keep records on the app stores and investigate those that fail to register or which are found falsifying information.  The new rules are hardly a surprise. China has been heavily censoring the internet for years. Foreign websites such as Facebook and Twitter have been blocked from the country, and local internet services are often required to delete comments or shut down user accounts found posting antigovernment content.    However, in some cases, apps have provided one way for users to circumvent the strict controls. That happened with The New York Times, whose main website was blocked in the country in 2012. Despite the censorship, the company’s news app was offered on Apple's app store until China ordered its takedown earlier this month.   Third-party app stores in China have also been known to spread malware. Last year, a mobile Trojan likely sourced from the country managed to infect millions of devices across China, India and Indonesia by imitating Android apps.    The country has over 650 million mobile internet users, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. The huge user base has made its app stores some of the biggest in the world.   The Rise of 'Data and Analytics' Roles Points to Digital Business Transformation More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The recommendation to pass on Apple’s newest laptop offering stemmed from inconsistencies that saw users report anywhere from 3.75 to 19.5 hours of battery life. After a software fix, and a re-test over the holidays, Consumer Reports altered its rating to ‘buy.’ To resolve the issue Apple issued a software fix to take care of an “obscure and intermittent bug” caused by turning off browser caching during the testing. The move is one Consumer Reports implements on all laptop tests and is designed to simulate real world browser usage. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE According to Consumer Reports: With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge. We tested each model multiple times using the new software, following the same protocol we apply to hundreds of laptops every year. In the second test, the MacBook Pro performed admirably, logging battery life scores of 15.75 hours for the 13-inch with the Touch Bar and 18.75 hours without. The 15-inch MacBook Pro recorded 17.25 hours.

'If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you're not musicians, you know?' Iovine added.  Scroll down for video  Jimmy Iovine (right, with Jay-Z) told reporters at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour Apple wants to create 'an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video.' APPLE'S TV PLANS  The Wall Street Journal first claimed Apple has plans to create original shows and movies. The firm is apparently in talks with producers, marketers and other networks about the content. Apple is said to create content that is comparable to Netflix's 'Stranger Things' and HBO's 'Westworld'.  Sources say the content will be available to those who pay the $10-a-month subscription for Apple Music.  'We're going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We're going to try.' Iovine was promoting his HBO documentary The Defiant Ones, which centers on his relationship and partnership with Dr. Dre. The pair teamed up on Beats Electronics, which Apple bought for $3 billion in 2014, a deal that gave both Iovine and Dr. Dre senior titles at the iPhone maker.  The tech giant has reportedly talked to 'veteran producers' about producing its own  to take on Amazon and Netflix as well as traditional studios. It is believed that Apple will bundle the shows and movies with its music streaming service, Apple Music, and the first shows could hit screens by the end of 2017, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Microsoft's 'Transformer' phone revealed: Folding handset... British scientists forced to close Halley Antarctica... Share this article Share 40 shares The Wall Street Journal reported the move last week, which it says could be Apple's way of offsetting 'slowing sales of iPhones and iPads'. The firm has already produced several music documentaries, and recently bought the right to James Corden's Carpool Karaoke,  which is being turned into a 16 part series with celebrity hosts. The Wall Street Journal reported  Apple has talked to 'veteran producers' about the content, which could be available by the end of 2017. It is believed that Apple will bundle the shows and movies with its music streaming service, Apple Music,in a bid to compete with its rival Spotify An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.  It is believed that the original content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. And although Apple Music does offer a handful of documentary-style segments on musicians, users have yet to see the value in the content. Apple seems to now understand that the public wants more than just short stories about musicians and could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' or Netflix's 'Stranger Things', sources revealed. Netflix and Amazon Prime may be the two firms to beat in this industry, but The Journal reports Apple isn't looking compete with these streaming giants. Instead, the Cupertino company has its sights set on Spotify. CARPOOL KARAOKE ON APPLE James Corden announced in January that he will be appearing 'at some point this year' on the show, which has been sold to Apple as a 16 part standalone show.  James Corden presides over his late-night show's 'Carpool Karaoke' segment, but the series spin-off will have a succession of hosts. It'S believed that the content will be available for users who pay a $10-a-month fee to stream music from Apple Music, according to people familiar with the matter. The firm already offers these users access to 'Carpool Karakoke', which it bought last year Celebrity pairs including Alicia Keys and John Legend, Ariana Grande and Seth MacFarlane, and Blake Shelton and Chelsea Handler will be featured on the 16-episode series to be released weekly on Apple Music. A debut date has yet to be announced, but E! has reported that it will be later this year. Corden, who will appear with Will Smith on one episode, said he was proud The Late Late Show has created a segment that works so well it will stand on its own. Apple, which revolutionized music consumption when it launched iTunes in 2001, in 2015 made a concerted push into the booming area of streaming through Apple Music. The company says the service has drawn over 15 million subscribers but it still trails leader Spotify, which said it had 28 million paying subscribers at the end of 2015. If the allegations are true, this move could put Apple in the lead, as it would offer much more content than Spotify. Apple has already signed a deal with CBS Television Studios and Fulwell 73 in July 2016 that turned 'Carpool Karaoke' into a full-blown series. This new series will only available for subscribers to the iPhone maker's music streaming app and E! has reported fans will be able to watch it sometime later this year. And just a few days before announcing the purchase of 'Carpool Karaoke', the firm revealed details of an original TV series called 'Planet of the Apps'. Apple could release content that is comparable to HBO's 'Westworld' (pictured) or Netflix's 'Stranger Things', sources revealed. But the idea is to compete with its rival Spotify TIMELINE: TEN YEARS OF IPHONES  2007: After being unveiled in January, the first iPhone goes on sale amid passionate Apple fan reaction and queues outside retail stores. 2008: On July 11 2008 the second generation iPhone 3G launches, including in a white colour option for the first time. 2009: The iPhone 3GS goes on sale in June, and sales for the year reach more than 25 million. 2010: The introduction of the iPhone 4 includes the first major redesign of the iPhone.

Owens of MasterChef Junior fame. Will.i.am will also be involved, and contestant will compete for funding of up to $10m. The casting call in July was looking for app creators who have a vision to 'shape the future, solve real problems, and inspire change within our daily lives.' The firm is apparently in talks with producers, marketers and other networks about the content. Apple has tested the waters with original content and is still working on release its 'Planet of the Apps' 'Over 2 million apps are available on the App Store, with new apps published every day,' said Silverman and Owens, Co-CEOs of Propagate. 'Planet of the Apps will give app creators the chance to break through and share their ideas with the world. 'This is an exciting format that taps into what is driving culture today. Developers who make it to the final round of the show will also meet with venture capitalists who will be investing up to $10 million, though Apple says developers are not required to take the money or give up any equity in their apps. Apps featured in the show will also receive prime placement in the App Store.    Read more: Apple Sets Its Sights on Hollywood With Plans for Original Content - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 40 shares Most watched News videos Serena Williams awkwardly neglects her fiancé after Aus Open win Many Clouds dies after beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Incredible moment truck crashes through middle of bus Grandma accused of killing son-in-law celebrated during testimony Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border George and Laura Bush welcome the Obamas to the White House 2009 Harriet was rescued from a South Korean meat farm Look what the cat dragged 'OUT'!

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Mobile Image Source: Samsung Everything we already know about the Galaxy S8 Chris Mills @chrisfmills January 16th, 2017 at 3:17 PM Share Tweet Samsung’s next flagship phone, and the first big device since the Note 7 inferno, is set to drop sometime in the next few months. As per hallowed internet tradition, we’re already awash with rumors and leaked images about what to expect, and when. Don't Miss: The NES Classic Edition was in stock at Best Buy for just 20 minutes Flat screen or edge? One of the biggest questions remaining about the Galaxy S8 is whether we’re going to see one phone or two. Last year, Samsung released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge — basically, the same phones, but the Edge has a curved bezel that lets you do something with the side of the screen when the phone is on your bedside table, or something. So far, rumors are split on whether Samsung is going to go all-out on the edge with the Galaxy S8, or if we’re going to get a flat version as well. The edge version of the Galaxy S6 and S7 proved to be reasonably popular, so it’s not clear how many people Samsung would be annoying if it goes with an edge-only approach. One this is fairly clear: we are getting a version with a curved edge. Numerous design renderings and leaked photos have shown a curved-screen version, and given that the edge display is one thing that strongly differentiates Samsung from Apple (and the rest of the Android crowd), Samsung is unlikely to do away with the curve. Headphone jack is here to stay One rumor that looks likely is that Samsung will buck the trend and release a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack. This is a no-brainer move for Samsung: Apple has suffered a backlash from loyal fans over its decision to remove the headphone jack, and Samsung has proven itself capable of making a waterproof phone that keeps the headphone jack. This is good news for most of the human race, as a disturbing number of other Android manufacturers have decided to follow Apple’s lead and remove the headphone jack. HTC and Motorola are both pushing higher-end phones that are 3.5mm-jack-free, so Samsung should be able to get easy money selling to the small market of people who have normal headphones. Watch for two sizes Even though Samsung might stick solely with curved screens for the Galaxy S8, that doesn’t mean we’ll only get one phone. Leaks and rumors from insiders suggest we’ll see two Galaxy S8 models this year: a Galaxy S8, with a 5.7-inch screen, and a Galaxy S8 Plus with a 6.2-inch screen. Insert jokes about copying Apple here. If those screen sizes seem big, that’s because they are. Apple’s two iPhone models have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, by comparison. If Samsung’s phones had the same-sized bezels, they would be objectively huge. But the saving grace here is that screen size does not equal phone size. By shrinking the bezel and using a curved screen, Samsung may well be able to fit a huge screen into a phone the same size as Apple’s iPhone, which would be a big advantage when it comes to usability. All the power you’d expect Between a combination of spec leaks and just accepting the obvious, we have a decent idea about what will be powering teh Galaxy S8. You can expect Samsung to use a combination of its own Exynos chip and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, depending on which carrier and region a phone is sold for. That chipset will be backed up by 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of onboard storage would give Samsung back the edge, as Apple raised the base storage to 32GB on the new iPhones. One detail that has consistently come up is the existence of a “Game Mode,” a software setting that would fully unlock the phone’s processing power. In addition to boosting gaming power, it would also let Samsung win the battle of benchmarks. This is kind of amusing, as Samsung has been caught out before using software settings to try and game the benchmarks. A “Game Mode” would just make the power-mode software available to everyone, thereby making it OK to use on benchmarking apps.

He said Apple is looking for ways to set the streaming music service apart from Spotify, and that Apple Music is going to be a big part of the pop culture experience. Apple wants to turn Apple Music into your pop culture hub “At Apple Music, what we’re trying to create is an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video,” Mr. Iovine said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Last week industry sources said Apple was actively looking for high quality scripted original shows for Apple Music—show that are on par with the original series from Netflix and Amazon. The company’s plan is to start airing shows by the end of 2017. Adding original shows is a way to make Apple Music stand out against Spotify and gain more marketshare. “We’re fighting ‘free,'” Mr. Iovine said. “So a simple utility where, ‘here’s all the songs, here’s all the music, give me $10 and we’re cool,’ is not going to scale.” He was referring to the free tiers Spotify and Pandora offer, which make up a substantial part of their subscription bases. In contrast, Apple Music costs $9.99 a month, and offers a three month free trial. Talk About Pop Music For Apple, adding TV shows is about more than slicing out a bigger piece of the streaming music pie. Apple wants to be in the middle of pop culture, and that means more than the latest songs and albums. He said, If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you’re not musicians, you know? We’re going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We’re going to try. Apple is already working on that with its music industry documentaries and streaming concerts, along with planned shows like the Dr. Dre-based miniseries Vital Signs, the upcoming Planet of the Apps reality show, and the Late Late Show spinoff Carpool Karaoke. Now that’s going to include top-notch shows in the coming months. It looks like Apple is finding a way to compete more with Spotify than Netflix and Amazon. It also looks like Apple wants to carve out a new place that’s unique, much like MTV did in the 1980s. MTV was the pop culture nexus back then, and that’s where Apple wants to be now. That’s not a direct assault on Netflix and Amazon—at least not yet. It is, however, a direct attack on Spotify.

The iPhone dramatically changed a lot of things, least of all the way we use phones. It changed the way we use apps and maps and cameras and social media. To call it transformative is an understatement, despite how glitchy the original product actually was. But I think the more important iPhone launch was the launch of the iPhone 4S on October 4th, 2011. With the iPhone 4S came three features that were arguably more monumental than anything else we’ve seen in smartphones: iCloud on iOS 5; Siri, Apple’s personified artificial intelligence; and much better camera capabilities, including an eight-megapixel rear camera and 1080p HD video capturing. iCloud had actually been announced in June 2011, but didn’t become available until later that year with the launch of iOS 5 on iPhone 4S. iCloud in its previous form, then called MobileMe, was by all accounts a disaster. Walt Mossberg said it was too flawed to be reliable, and Steve Jobs reportedly lambasted the MobileMe team for a botched rollout. With iCloud, Apple was once again trying its hand at wirelessly syncing an absurd amount of data across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. And it was a good move. iCloud is still far from perfect — at the moment I’m trying to figure out why the heck my iMessages are coming in out of order — but the cloud has essentially become the backbone of everything we do on our computing devices. The 4S planted the seeds of what we now consider common knowledge: the smartphone really isn’t just a phone The iPhone 4S also ushered in the era of Siri. Siri was the butt of many early jokes, and five years later, Apple is in serious danger of being leapfrogged by newer AI entrants from Google and Amazon. But Siri was one of the earliest voice-controlled virtual assistants that worked well on a consumer product (Google rolled out voice actions on Android phones the year before, in August 2010, but Siri was meant to be an assistant). It took a little while before the iPhone 4S’s new and improved camera, and all of its smartphone competitors, had a serious impact on the digital camera industry. But eventually it happened. In 2013 The Wall Street Journal reported that global shipments of compact digital cameras were down 42 percent in the first five months of the year, and that the global market was predicted to shrink to 102 million unit sales, compared with 144 million units in 2010. Flip video cameras, once a pocketable darling of the video-capturing world, were toast; Cisco had shut down Flip a couple years after its ill-fated $590 million purchase of the company, because who needed a handheld HD video camera when smartphones could do the job? (Anecdotally, the iPhone 4 and 4S also changed my job: at the time I was a video producer on The Wall Street Journal’s live-streaming web shows, and we couldn’t get the phones into the hands of reporters fast enough, so they could send us high-quality video or Skype from remote locations around the world.) The iPhone 4S wasn’t without its own problems. There were early reports of battery issues, and some users complained that there was no audio on outgoing calls. But the 4S managed to evade the Antennagate-grade fiasco that plagued the iPhone 4. The 4S is no longer made or supported. It was, in the minds of a lot of people, just another iterative product in a decade-long series of products, an “S” year in a timeline when numeral changes signify something much more. But it was the gadget that planted the seeds of what we now all accept as common knowledge: that a smartphone really isn’t just a phone. Editor’s note: A previous version of this article said Siri was one of the earliest voice-controlled virtual assistants and the first one you could carry in your pocket. It has been updated to reflect that Google had introduced voice control on Android devices a year earlier.

San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department officials said John Reed, of Apple Valley, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, which occurred between Flathead and Kiowa roads. Authorities responded to a report of a hit-and-run collision involving a pedestrian a little before 7:30 p.m. and found Reed’s body in the roadway. Authorities on Friday told the Daily Press there was not a vehicle description available and additional information was not immediately available Monday. Reed’s daughter told the Daily Press on Monday that her father, who had lived in Apple Valley for roughly eight years, was walking a dog that was not injured in the collision. “My dad was a God-loving man who is now in heaven with his mother,” said Tracy Reed, who lives in Orange. “He had two children, me and my brother, who also lives in Orange, and two grandchildren. He previously lived in South Gate but moved up to Apple Valley maybe eight years ago.” The Apple Valley Sheriff’s Station Major Accident Investigation Team is conducting the investigation and anyone with information is urged to contact the Apple Valley Sheriff’s station at 760-240-7400.

Details were slim initially but Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine has essentially confirmed the service’s video ambitions. Speaking at the Television Critics Association press tour, Iovine said that the goal at Apple Music is to create “an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video.” Iovine’s comments about video shouldn’t be limited to just music videos as one would expect given that Apple Music is primarily a music streaming service. The video ambitions go far beyond just music videos. The executive hinted that the company is going to consider other types of video programming as well. “If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you’re not musicians, you know?,” he was reported as saying, adding that “We’re going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We’re going to try.” Apple has gradually been expanding its interests in the video arena with moves like the acquisition of James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke series. It’s also going to launch a reality-style show called Planet of the Apps in the coming months which will feature big stars like Jessica Alba, will.iam, and Gwyneth Paltrow. It will certainly be interesting to see how Apple Music embraces video in a bid to differentiate itself from the competition like Spotify which has also started focusing on video content.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple Accused Of Monopolistic Behavior With Its iOS App Store By Tyler Lee on 01/15/2017 20:52 PST The iTunes App Store is owned and controlled by Apple, in which developers, musicians, movie studios, and more can upload their creations where it can be purchased and downloaded by users of Apple’s products. Recently it seems that consumers aren’t too thrilled about Apple’s monopoly over its iPhone apps. So much so that a class-action lawsuit has been filed against Apple claiming that they tried to monopolize the market for iPhone apps between 2007 to 2013. These consumers are claiming that Apple made it so that apps for iOS devices must be sold through the iTunes App Store, as opposed to giving customers and developers the option of selling it from third-party websites or platforms. This practice allegedly violates antitrust laws. They also claim that this has affected the price of apps, especially since Apple requires a 30% cut, which in turn has led to some developers charging more for apps to make up for the difference. If this case sounds familiar, it is because it was actually filed a while ago when the California Northern District Court threw out the case in 2013. However the decision was successfully appealed and the appeals court has since reversed that decision, thus requiring Apple to face these antitrust allegations. Apple has since declined to comment on the court’s decision. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps, iOS and Legal.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said "this year and the next will be the key to democratizing AI," adding that the technology should be used to maximize people's time.  (JASON REDMOND / AFP/GETTY IMAGES)   By Aaron RicadelaBloomberg Mon., Jan. 16, 2017 Microsoft Corp. and its competitors should eschew artificial intelligence systems that replace people instead of maximizing their time, chief executive officer Satya Nadella said in an interview Monday. “The fundamental need of every person is to be able to use their time more effectively, not to say, ‘let us replace you’,” Nadella said in an interview at the DLD conference in Munich. “This year and the next will be the key to democratizing AI. The most exciting thing to me is not just our own promise of AI as exhibited by these products, but to take that capability and put it in the hands of every developer and every organization.” Nadella is pushing Microsoft into consumer and industrial applications of software that can make inferences about its environment. He cautioned his own company and competitors about “parlour tricks” that show AI’s power without preserving workers’ dignity. The 49-year-old who’s entering his fourth year as Microsoft’s CEO after succeeding Steve Ballmer in 2014, has presided over a 73 per cent run-up in Microsoft’s shares and Azure cloud-computing revenue that’s been doubling year over year. He’s compelled Microsoft’s product groups to co-operate to ship products faster and has greatly expanded Microsoft software available on platforms other than Windows, including those from Apple Inc. and Google. Microsoft last month closed its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp. “There’s a thin line between hubris and confidence,” Nadella said. “Always there is risk of hubris coming back, missing trends. The only long-term indicator of success is, ‘how good is your internal culture?’ ” Article Continued Below “What I’ve learned if anything in three years as CEO is, it’s not about celebrating one product,” he said. “That, to me, is the sign of a company that’s built to last. In tech it’s even more harsh.” Microsoft suffered for a decade from a tendency to make stabs at technology it failed to propagate widely that ended up benefiting other companies — mainly Apple. It developed tablet PCs, pocket computers and smartwatches in the early 2000s, and was selling software for cars in the 1990s.  “Because of Microsoft’s technical orientation, engineers have always wanted to stuff more and more features and tricks into the products,” said Michael Cusumano, a professor of management at MIT Sloan School of Management who’s written three books about Microsoft and its leaders. “The products ended up becoming huge. That’s what slowed them down.” On the AI frontier, Japan Airlines Co. is using Microsoft-developed holographic capabilities to simulate aircraft engines for training of repair technicians and to avoid costs of sending full repair crews to each broken plane. McDonald’s Corp. used Microsoft technology to develop an automated order-taking system that compensates for noise encountered during orders at a drive-through. Microsoft has also designed software that can protect staff who work in environments surrounded by robots. Microsoft last Friday said it acquired Maluuba, a Montreal-based AI startup specializing in analyzing written content, for example sifting through businesses’ documents to find experts in given fields. Yet Amazon.com Inc.’s Web Services division has been rapidly releasing AI services for businesses including the ability for developers to build spoken conversation support and speech translation. Alphabet Inc.’s Google last year rebuilt its Translate service using neural networks to improve accuracy and produce language that sounds more like what a native speaker would say, and has made strides in image recognition, music and art. “They’re all great advances,” said Nadella, who’s reorganized the company’s research arm around AI and shipped products including Azure cloud-computing services and tools for developers to build applications for artificial intelligence applications. “We should be competitive there and we should be pushing there and we will be doing that,” he said. “But what’s Microsoft’s unique contribution beyond doing that is democratizing the access to the same tools that we use for ourselves so that every developer can use them to create their own intelligence,” he said. As Nadella and other tech leaders head to the Davos elite gathering in Switzerland this week, cloud-computing’s relationship with data privacy in Europe is also top of mind for Microsoft and its competitors. European businesses and governments could be reluctant to store data in clouds operated by American tech companies if the U.S. government can order access to it, and Microsoft has sued the U.S. Department of Justice in two cases over the issue. Nadella said having data centres in Germany operated by Deutsche Telekom AG has “helped build trust with the German customers.” The incoming Trump administration, European Union and China together need to weigh issues including the balance between security and data privacy, the CEO said. “We have business in each one of these countries,” Nadella said. “These countries are going to have to work together and there are rightful concerns each one of these constituents has.” Read more about: Microsoft Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

"If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you're not musicians, you know?" Iovine continued when further pressed. "We're going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We're going to try." Iovine also noted that Apple was really competing with free streaming music providers possibly hinting that its video content would be used to attract more subscribers. "We're fighting 'free.' So a simple utility where, 'here's all the songs, here's all the music, give me $10 and we're cool,' is not going to scale." Apple will soon be airing 16 half-hour episodes of Carpool Karaoke with a different host for every episode. Recent reports claim the country has been in talks with veteran producers in recent months about buying rights to scripted television programs.

We predict the iPhone 8 release date, UK price, tech specs, new features and more. Latest: the CEO of a charging company has been dropping hints that the iPhone 8 could feature a wireless charging range of 15 feet; an analyst has predicted that the next Apple smartphone will be rebranded as the iPhone X; and an Apple hardware partner has confirmed it is ready to make curved screens by David Price | 26 Jan 17 Share Tweet   Comments Contents Release schedule Release date Design New features Specs Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up, a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event in September last year, so we're now looking ahead to the next generation. In this article, we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and on sale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging. Recent updates (click the links to skip ahead) Apple hardware partner Japan Display confirms it is ready to make curved screens. New predictions that Touch ID will be built into the iPhone 8's display and will be joined by a new security feature: facial recognition. Reports that Apple is working on big 3D Touch improvements. Predictions that late 2017 will see the launch of an 'iPhone X'. New Apple patent hints at an edge-to-edge screen on the iPhone 8. Cryptic comments point to 15-foot wireless charging and a 5.8-inch screen. Reports of fast-charging tech and tap to wake coming to the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Release schedule Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) After that point it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. iPhone 8 release date rumours: The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The sourced added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. 'iPhone X' Here's a leftfield prediction: Apple may not call its late-2017 smartphone the iPhone 7s or the iPhone 8, but the iPhone X. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company, has sent out a research note to clients predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. With iPhone version numbers getting alarmingly high, it would make sense for Apple to switch to a different branding convention at some point - distracting customers, one might say, from quite how many of these things Apple has cranked out without fundamentally changing what it's offering. But to rebrand its biggest seller would still be a bold, bold move. We'll count this as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, even though it's not the worst idea in the world. Macworld poll: What do you think Apple will call its next iPhone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Release date Some pundits predicted that the iPhone 7 would sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes. But, they said, everything would change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly predicting a big iPhone launch in 2017. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now. Read next: Best place to buy an iPhone in the UK But what happens after the blockbusting launch of the iPhone 8 (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone)? It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump did not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Since then, Trump has stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means. These statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Other Apple products made in the US Apple does build some products in the US, if rarely, and only in the cases of far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, for instance, but this is a niche product made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Mesa, Arizona. Rather than iPhones or even recognisable consumer products, it was widely reported that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the firm has since denied this, claiming it will only be using the facility as a hub for receiving, configuring and distributing servers rather than manufacturing any new product. Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Design iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen iPhone 8 design: 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. iPhone 8 design: Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. DigiTimes (a Chinese-language website), predicts that the chassis of the iPhone 8 will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than the more usual manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing anonymous sources in the Asian /supply chain. This would be something of a surprise, given Apple's clear recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4s had steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time: whereas the iPhone 4s was milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that offers greater strength. iPhone 8 design: New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of the Deep Blue iPhone 7. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. iPhone 8 design: Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. iPhone 8 design: No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple plans to give the iPhone 8 an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, covers "Electronic devices having displays with openings" and various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them. This in turn would allow Apple to expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it wouldn't need to leave space around the edge for those various apertures and controls. Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section... iPhone 8 design: No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8, and there's now more evidence to back up his claims. You can read about Apple's new Touch ID-related patents below, but reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has supported Munster's prediction with claims that Apple's new Touch ID technology developments will mean it is indeed possible to put the sensor into the display itself. Kuo also claims Apple is going to add a facial recognition element into the mix. In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". iPhone 8 design: Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. iPhone 8 design: Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games iPhone 8 design: A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no longer receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. iPhone 8 design: Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in a new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. In January 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, is ready to start building flexible displays. (This is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the firm didn't name Apple, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and the clues point to the iPhone maker. iPhone 8 design: Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." iPhone 8 design: Sapphire iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somwhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be signifcantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? iPhone 8 design: Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. iPhone 8 design: Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. iPhone 8 design: Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. iPhone 8 design: Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: New features That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? iPhone 8 new features: Fast Charging According to Forbes citing infamous Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, the iPhone 8 could be the first entry in the iPhone series to feature fast charging technology. More specifically, Forbes claims that there will be a new "Tristar 3, Hydra" chip that manages the charging port. "In normal people words... [it] will include fast charging,", Dickson claims.  However, it's worth noting that if fast charging tech is included in the upcoming iPhone, it may not be compatible with existing fast charging standards as the tech isn't being produced by Qualcomm, which provides "Quick Charge" for Android devices. Will it happen? We assume so. It has been a feature long-requested by users, and is one readily available on most if not all of Apple's Android-based competitors.  iPhone 8 new features: Tap to wake According to Forbes, one of the three (yes, three) variants of iPhone 8 will feature 'tap to wake' technology that has been available for budget Android users for quite some time. While the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus (sporting the same design as the 6/7) will miss out on the technology, the all-new iPhone 8 should get the 'tap to wake' treatment. This strikes us as a little odd as it's a feature available on budget Android smartphones, so why wouldn't it be on Apple's flagship? Also, Forbes source claims that it's "currently on the roadmap" for the iPhone 8 only, so there's still a chance this may change before release later this year.  iPhone 8 new features: Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  iPhone 8 new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), even though Apple has been offering the feature for a while now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate, but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. And the iPhone 8 may have a glass back in any case. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that builds iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. Long-range wireless charging We say that inductive charging is disappointingly short range, but Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance. And while this seems more of a long shot, some cryptic comments from the CEO of a charging company suggest Apple may be planning something even more ambitious. Steve Rizzone, CEO of Energous, spoke to The Verge before CES 2017 and dropped some clanking great hints about the exclusive and secret "key strategic partnership" that the company signed a couple of years back and which has delayed the launch of its wireless charging tech... which has a range of 15 feet. "That 'key' partner is suspected to be Apple," observes The Verge, "and Energous - though declining to state its partner's name - is certainly happy to fuel the speculation. Rizzone says the partnership is with 'one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world. I cannot tell you who it is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home.'"

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggests that Apple is working on just that. According to Kuo, Apple is improving 3D Touch with new technology that should make it more sensitive and potentially capable of more complicated gestures. iPhone 8 new features: Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August when Digitimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. iPhone 8 new features: Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Specs It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... iPhone 8 specs: Screen resolution A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. iPhone 8 specs: Screen size What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. In January 2017 this theory was backed up by a source in Asia. DigiTimes predicts that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch iPhone in the second half of 2017, citing anonymous sources in the Taiwanese supply chain. "Apple will launch 4.7-, 5.5- and 5.8-inch new iPhone models in the second half of 2017," the site writes, "with TFT-LCD panels to be used in the former two models and AMOLED for the 5.8-inch one." There remains some confusion, however, about whether that 5.8-inch measurement will take into account the extra space provided by the screen's predicted curved edges. Indeed, it's possible that this 5.8-inch phone's chassis will be the same size as that of current Plus models, gaining 0.3 inches of diagonal screen size through the curved edges and the lack of bottom bezel and Home button. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. iPhone 8 specs: Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." iPhone 8 specs: Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. iPhone 8 specs: Battery life One rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement recently. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." In December 2015 Apple gave its critics an early Christmas present by unveiling a battery pack for the iPhone 6 and 6s that is, without wishing to be unpleasant and apologies for the language, pretty gosh-darn ugly. (To be fair, we've not yet got our hands on a review sample, so we may be won over by its feel, performance, usability and so on.) In a single surprising step the company put its famed sense of taste and design nous in doubt (coming after the suspect decision to put the charge port for the Magic Mouse 2 on its bottom), and simultaneously reminded everyone that iPhone battery life is generally felt to be subpar. Is this a tacit acknowledgement that battery life is a problem for the iPhone range? Can we therefore expect the iPhone 8 to see improvements in this department as Apple looks for a more full-time and less bulky solution to the issue? We might (battery technology is improving all the time), but this probably isn't the mea culpa some iPhone users were looking for. When discussing the new case, Tim Cook emphasised that it wasn't for everyone (at £80 you'd hope not), and that he felt that even those who did need the case would only use it in relatively extreme scenarios when power wouldn't be available for a long time: when hiking, for example. I would agree that Apple is aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but it knew that long before it released its battery pack. And battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And now anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. In a crazy sort of way, the ugliness of the battery pack almost makes sense as a demonstration of what drastically improved battery life actually looks like. "You want twice the battery life? Even if that means your iPhone has a massive lump on the back? Yeah, DIDN'T THINK SO." iPhone 8 specs: LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections. LiFi uses visible light communication (VLC) instead of radio waves like conventional WiFi routers. Intrigued?

We round up rumours of a new 12-inch MacBook, after no refresh in October 2016. by Lewis Painter | 25 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Is a 13in MacBook going to launch in 2016? When will the 2017 12-inch MacBook be released? What can I expect from the next 12-inch MacBook in terms of tech specs? How much will the 2017 12-inch MacBook cost? Will the 12-inch MacBook replace the MacBook Air range? Apple released the 2016 variant of the 12in MacBook back in April 2016, and almost a year on, we're looking to the future and what we could expect from this year's model, the 2017 12in MacBook. Here, we sift through the latest rumours surrounding the 2017 MacBook and also our personal predictions based on previous Apple events, and knowledge of the company. Those of you that want to find out more about the current 12in MacBook released in April 2016 can take a look at our 12in MacBook review, which covers everything from pricing to performance and design, sprinkled with our personal opinions of Apple's latest MacBook. Apple decided not to update the MacBook or MacBook Air line during its October 2016 event, and decided to cut the 11in MacBook Air completely. This suggests that the MacBook is set to replace the Air line. We suspect a refresh to the MacBook line in March 2017 to confirm the replacement.

So, when are we likely to see the next-generation 12in MacBook? Considering that Apple released the 2016 variant of the laptop in April, we assumed we wouldn't be seeing another upgrade until 2017 - and we were right. But 2017 is finally here, so when can we expect to see the new MacBook appear?  Apple has trademarked three new MacBook mode numbers, according to a Russian trademark filing. The three new model numbers, A1706, A1707 and A1708, were tipped to be a 13in and 15in MacBook Pro, and a MacBook with a 12in screen. This is all according to the reliable KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo - we aren't sure if these model numbers correspond with the new MacBook Pro models - but we will update this article once we confirm the model numbers. We had originally expected to see the 2016 variant of the MacBook announced during 2016's spring Apple event, which was one year on from Apple's unveiling of the very first 12-inch MacBook models. But instead, Apple revealed the iPhone SE, a 9.7in iPad Pro and new Apple Watch straps, with no mention of an updated MacBook. A few weeks later Apple surprised us by updating the MacBook without any bells and whistles or another event. According to Macrumors, a 12in MacBook will go into production in early Q2 2017, so about April time.  Apple is a company of habit - new iOS software is showcased every June (along with macOS, tvOS and watchOS) which is then released alongside the latest generation iPhone months later, in September. It has been that way for more than a few years now, with the only exception being with the launch of the iPhone 4. Following Apple's MacBook habits to date, it suggests to us that we'll be seeing the 2017 MacBook sat on our laps between March and May 2017.  New MacBook 2016 rumours: Will the 12in MacBook replace the MacBook Air? In October 2016 Apple showcased four new MacBooks, none of them an Air model. It seems Apple wants us to believe that it hasn't officially killed off the Air, but it all looks like an indirect confirmation of the 12-inch MacBook replacing the Air in Apple's affection and ongoing product portfolio. Apple's MacBook Air design is now eight years old, and it's quite possible that the MacBook is lining up to replace it in the near future. When the MacBook Air first launched, its biggest selling point was its thin and light design, hence the name; but the MacBook now outshines it in those areas. To be honest, barring a major and revolutionary redesign it seems unlikely that the MacBook Air has much of a future ahead of it. Plus, for those looking for ultimate portability there's the new iPad Pro with a 12.9in screen. Here's why it doesn't matter that the MacBook is expensive, underpowered and only has one port The last time there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (white and black, and then eventually aluminium). Those were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air reduced. It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models replacing the MacBook Air models at a lower price than they are now, at least eventually - especially considering the MacBook Air’s less-than-exciting 2016 update. According to trusted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the 12in MacBook is now Apple's best-selling computer, closely followed by the 13in MacBook Pro, which adds further fuel to the rumour that it'll soon replace the MacBook Air thanks to its popularity. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claims that Apple is planning to introduce a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in model in the third quarter of 2016. Kuo is a goldmine for inside Apple information and has been called "the most accurate Apple analyst in the world", providing accurate rumours regarding the iPhone 6s months in advance of its release, along with a flurry of predictions about the upcoming iPhone 7 which many assume to be true. Current rumours suggest an October hardware event where Apple will announce the 2016 MacBook Pro - will the company announce a larger MacBook alongside it? However, while Kuo is usually accurate, we're not too confident about this one. The rumour hasn't been backed up by any leaks or other sources, and it seems like a pretty strange move to release a new MacBook only 1in larger than the current model, so it's best to take this with a pinch of salt. If true, we think it signals the end of the MacBook Air range. See more MacBook Air rumours here. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: UK price While we’re still a way away from the official announcement of the 2017 MacBook, we can already speculate about the pricing as Apple rarely changes the price of its range from generation to generation, unless it’s a fairly hefty upgrade. Currently the base MacBook sells for £1,249. With that being said, the 2016 MacBook Pro will set you back £1,449 for the basic variant and £1,949 for a more powerful variant - and the prices have all gone up since Brexit too (Basic Air is £100 more, and basic MacBook is £200 more expensive!) New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Design and features Looking at the change in design from the 2015 MacBook to the 2016 MacBook, it suggests that we won’t be seeing huge physical changes. In fact, the only change in design from the original MacBook and the 2016 MacBook was the addition of a new colour option, Rose Gold, to go alongside the readily available Gold, Silver and Space Grey options. Aside from that, the design hasn't changed for the MacBook. It's incredibly thin at 13.1mm, and it weighs just 0.9kg, making it 24 percent thinner than the MacBook Air, and we don’t expect that to change dramatically in future. Will the 2016 MacBook have a Force Touch keyboard? Update 14 October: According to 9to5Mac, Apple is in talks with the Foxconn startup, Sonder - a company that uses E Ink technology to display its keys (see a video here). This allows a way of customising keys and even adding symbols which would not be possible on a regular keyboard. It's rumoured that Apple will use this technology in their next MacBook. Back in autumn 2015, it emerged that Apple had filed a patent that appeared to show its design for a Force Touch capable keyboard. Along with the 2015 MacBook Pro, the 2015 MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, which gave electric pulses that feel like clicks, but is a glass plate that doesn't actually move. Like on the iPhone 6s, you can press harder for a deeper click to access menus and options within certain apps. The new MacBook also has keys unlike any other Mac, which have very little travel in order to make the chassis ultra-thin. The newly discovered patent shows what seems to be a whole keyboard and trackpad area fit to house this technology. As this shows, the whole keyboard and trackpad, plus areas to the left and right of the pad, could theoretically be customised to the user's tastes and, for the first time, not have a physical keyboard. However, we have seen Apple file patents in the past that are to bookmark ideas for the future. It'd be amazing if this technology were included in the new MacBook next year, but we feel this is one for the coming years. It would potentially allow you to have several language keyboards saved and switch between them on the adaptable display. We can but dream. Imagine typing on a surface that felt like a keyboard, but was actually electric feedback telling your brain you're pressing keys? If this is Force Touch's future, we are excited. Will the MacBook feature an Apple Pencil-compatible trackpad? It's not the only new addition to the MacBook either, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. According to a patent filed by Apple which was recently approved, an upcoming Mac could boast compatibility with the Apple Pencil - although the Apple Pencil depicted in the patent is far more advanced than the one on sale at the moment. The Pencil in question features a number of sensors that could detect movement, orientation and depth and, according to the patent, could be used with a Mac as an 'air mouse' or possibly even a joystick for gaming. The patent reads: "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." It doesn't end there, either - apparently an upcoming Mac trackpad will feature Apple Pencil support, allowing users to use and draw directly onto the trackpad with the precision of the iPad Pro. While the patent doesn't mention whether the trackpad will be built into a MacBook or offered as a standalone Mac trackpad, we imagine that if Apple plans on utilising the patent, it'll do so with its newest line of laptops - the MacBook.  Will Apple discontinue Thunderbolt? One question that has arisen is whether the introduction of USB-C spells the end of Thunderbolt. We don't think that Apple will drop Thunderbolt from its Pro Mac line up any time soon, but the standard may well disappear from the consumer level Macs eventually. The reason we think it will remain on the MacBook Pro, Mac Pro and the iMac is Apple's efforts to convince the industry to adopt it since its introduction in 2011. However, Apple also promoted FireWire to the industry and eventually removed that from its Macs. New MacBook 2016 release date rumours UK: Tech specs What can we expect to see from the 2017 MacBook in terms of design? While rumours are scarce at these early stages, there is one interesting rumour that, if true, could herald in a new generation of Force Touch-enabled keyboards for Apple's laptop line. Processors The next-generation MacBook is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors: that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But there's another, less predictable, possibility. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has spotted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE" being supported. This isn't a chip family that anyone has heard of, but it's probably an Apple custom ARM chip: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Apple might be about to put ARM chips in its new MacBooks. RAM Macrumors has recently quoted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as predicting the MacBook will get a refresh towards the second half of 2017 with Kaby Lake processors, and thinks we'll see a 16GB RAM model too. This would double the current crop's 8GB.  Image courtesy of Techtastic Will the 2016 MacBook have LTE connectivity? It seems that sharing your iPhone's cellular connection with your MacBook wasn't enough for Apple, if the latest patent approval is anything to go by. The patent, as described by the US Patent and Trademark Office, will allow the company to embed LTE hardware in the 2017 MacBook, making it the first cellular-enabled Mac in Apple's range, past or present.  As well as LTE connectivity, the patent describes the use of Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth and satallite connectivity, and mentions ways to boost the signal without interference from the metal body of the MacBook. It's worth mentioning that this idea isn't new, though - it was originally filed on June 8 2015, and there was also talk of a 3G-enabled MacBook Pro back in 2008, but the idea was eventually rejected by Steve Jobs as he felt it'd tie the user down to a particular carrier.  Thinking of buying a Mac?

Samsung 1 The rumoured Samsung Galaxy S8 which will not have a headphone jack   Samsung files patent for a mobile phone with a foldable SCREEN The swirling rumours, first reported by ETNews, follow four consecutive years in which the smartphone makers picked spring to reveal their new phone. The tech giant has followed in the footsteps of rival Apple, confirming to SamMobile that it will replace the jack with a USB Type-C port instead. Apple lovers were fuming when Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 in in 2016 without a headphone jack, instead replacing its classic earphones with £159 wireless AirPods. Despite widespread backlash the phone still sold out, with UK customers desperate to get their hands on one when it was released. The phone - initially believed to be launched in February at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona - will also ditch the signature home button.

And it might even be able to fold, if a recent Samsung patent is anything to go by. Samsung fans can also reportedly expect an ‘Edge’ style screen and improved camera, as well as a 4K display. It's expected to come in two models, one with a 5.1 inch dual-curved display, the other with 5.5 inches. The company have suffered bad press of late.

These drawings were made in pursuit of a patent related to the device. In these drawings, the iPad is given the power to show notifications in several ways, the lot of which are displayed on the iPad’s smart cover in low-power lights. These lights would work very similar to what we’ve seen with previous manufacturer smart covers. The LG G5 Quick Cover and Samsung’s S View covers for Galaxy smartphones. HTC One had a Dot View case as well – though all of these solutions used the display of the phone to function. Apple’s new smart cover for the iPad would use integrated lights to show notifications. If this case is meant to show users all their notifications without needing the display to turn on, the iPad Pro’s battery will inevitably last longer than it otherwise would. This case could also make use of the lights to expand the collection of use-case scenarios for the iPad Pro, acting as a visual controller. Connectivity to the tablet would be provided by the iPad’s Smart Connector. The Smart Connector has only appeared on the iPad Pro (both sizes) thus far – we’ll expect that this will be the way it’ll stay for quite some time into the future. Unless, of course, the next iPhone lineup includes the iPhone Pro we’ve been waiting for. If that were the case, we wouldn’t be surprised to find that a similar smart cover were being patented by Apple soon, as well. Keep an eye open for said patent and we’ll watch out on our end. Until then, have a peek at Apple’s Road to iPhone Pro. This is only the latest in a line of similar patents from Apple on iPad covers. See also the solar panel, sketch pad, and others from back in May of last year. If this keeps up, Apple will have cornered the market on amazing or otherwise fantastic accessories for the iPad Pro that are also yet to be manufactured. Perhaps they’re saving the whole collection for a rainy day.

Very few details about the iPhone 8 have been confirmed by the tech giant so far, but rumors have been emerging stating that Apple’s next flagship device would be the company’s most revolutionary product yet. While the specs of the iPhone 8 would most likely be inferior to its top-tier Android counterparts such as the Samsung Galaxy S8, Note 8 and LG G6, Apple seems to be cooking up a number of killer features that would make its premier device truly one of the kind. There was once a time when Apple’s iPhones boasted the most advanced specs of the day. Over the years, however, the Cupertino-based tech giant has steadily been overtaken by its rivals in the smartphone market in terms of both raw power and unique features. The 1GB of RAM in the iPhone 6 is a testament to this, especially since the device was released at a time when its Android rivals boasted at least twice the amount of memory. While this trend might continue with the iPhone 8, the upcoming device’s unique features are rumored to more than make up for the upcoming flagship smartphone’s lack of raw power. Rumors about the iPhone 8 are abounding, but most of them paint a picture of a formidable device that, while lacking in raw specs with its A11 chip and possible 4GB of RAM, could still be a game-changer. Much like the original iPhone that was released back in 2007, the iPhone 8 seems to be a device that is designed to change the smartphone landscape for years to come. This is, of course, speculated to be ushered in by a number of killer features that would debut on the device. [Image by Sean Gallup/Getty Images] One thing that has made headlines about the iPhone 8 is the rumor that the smartphone would feature a revolutionary form of wireless charging. PC Advisor noted that according to speculations, the iPhone 8 would be the first consumer-grade device that would be capable of wirelessly charging itself up to 15 feet away from a charging port. Numerous analysts have already weighed in on the feature, such as KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo, who stated that long-range wireless charging would be one of the most notable features of the device. Wireless charging might not be new to the smartphone market, but Apple’s approach to the technology appears to be different from its competitors, such as Samsung, whose technologies required the device to be in contact with a charging platform. If Apple could indeed pull a rabbit out of its hat and introduce real long-range charging options for consumers, the iPhone 8 would once more become a device that is truly one of a kind. Another particular feature that has been emerging from the rumor mill is the adoption of a brand new metal frame for the upcoming flagship. The iPhone 8 is speculated to feature a glass front and back, much like the iPhone 4 and 4S from 2010 and 2011, respectively. Unlike its glass-front and backed predecessors, however, a MacRumors report suggested that the iPhone 8 would be far more durable and resistant to damage, thanks to a stainless steel frame. [Image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images] Apple has adopted an aluminum frame since the debut of the iPhone 6. While the metal frame made the device extremely thin and sleek, it also made the iPhone prone to bending and scratching. This eventually culminated in the notorious “Bendgate” issue, where iPhone 6S Plus units were found by consumers to bend with normal use. While the bending issue has been addressed in the iPhone 6S Plus that was released the following year, the stigma of a flimsy, bending iPhone has never really left Apple. Thus, with the return of a sturdy glass and metal design, Apple might end up making the iPhone 8 into one of its most durable mobile devices yet. Couple this with the rumor that the iPhone 8 would feature a wraparound OLED display, and the device becomes even more attractive for avid Apple fans and conventional consumers alike. Lastly, the addition of a color that is codenamed “Ferrari” is also something that seems to be in the works, allowing Apple to expand its devices’ color palette even further. The iPhone 8 is a device that is designed to break the innovation slump that Apple has been suffering from during the last few years. Since the release of the iPhone 6 back in 2014, the improvements in the Cupertino giant’s smartphones have been pretty basic and understated at best. While this is a safe route for the tech giant, the fact that its rivals, such as Samsung and LG, are experimenting with new concepts is something that Apple immediately needs to address. If rumors about the iPhone 8 ring true and the device does get released with revolutionary new features, Apple could once more establish itself as the undisputed leader in the smartphone market.

But that article was a bit of a tease, since it left you hanging with a set-up system that you hadn’t used. In this edition, I’ll explain how you can actually control your Accessories with Apple’s Home app, as well as Control Center, Siri, and even your Apple Watch. Controlling Accessories in the Home App -- To access an Accessory (which, you’ll remember, generally maps to a particular device), go to the Rooms screen, tap the Hamburger button, and choose the Room that contains the Accessory. In the Room’s listing, you’ll see all the Accessories associated with that Room. For things like smart bulbs and smart plugs, you can tap the Accessory icon to turn it on or off. That’s simple to say, but it’s actually one of the key uses of the Home app, since it gives you remote control over any Accessory that turns on and off. (For some other devices, like room sensors, tapping their icons will have no effect because they’re always on.) To work with Accessories in additional ways, either press and hold or 3D Touch an Accessory icon. That brings up a screen that shows more details and controls. For example, a room sensor shows its current status, a smart plug has a simple on/off switch, and a smart bulb offers a brightness slider. If a smart bulb supports multiple colors, a Color button appears too; tapping it brings up buttons that let you choose a color for the light. Tapping Edit in the center of a button brings up a detailed color wheel. Choosing a color there replaces one of the circles in the main color selector with that color. The Color screen also has a Temperature tab, which is the same thing, but with various degrees of white light. Frustratingly, Apple’s Home app doesn’t let you copy your color selections between devices, so if you want to be sure that all your bulbs have the same color, you’ll need a third-party HomeKit app with finer control, like Matthias Hochgatterer’s Home app. But if you’re dealing with lights that should work together anyway, you can group them, which you do from the Details screen. It’s All in the Details -- When you tap and hold or 3D press a HomeKit Accessory, you can also access its Details screen, which presents a few Accessory options, like name and Room location. You might remember some of these options from initial Accessory setup, as I detailed in “A Prairie HomeKit Companion: Setting Up Accessories and Rooms.” I want to focus on two options in the Details screen. The first is the Include in Favorites switch. You should enable this for any Accessory you plan to use with any regularity because it adds a shortcut for that Accessory to the Home screen of the Home app, to Control Center, and to the Home app on the Apple Watch. Note that Control Center won’t display more than nine Accessories at a time, so it pays to be picky. The second is the Group with Other Accessories option, which combines your Accessories so that they act as one — their individual Accessory icons will be replaced by a single new icon. This is useful if you have say, multiple smart bulbs in a single light fixture, or multiple lights in the same room that you want to be in sync. I use it to group our living room floor lamps to keep their brightness and color settings the same. To group Accessories, tap Group with Other Accessories. On the next screen, give your group a name and select the other Accessories to add to the group. Tap Done when you’re finished. The icons for those Accessories will be replaced by a single icon for the group. To ungroup Accessories, go to the Details screen for the group and tap Ungroup Accessories. Remember, if you plan to use the group frequently, don’t forget to set it as a favorite! If you want to adjust one Accessory in a group independently, go to the Details screen for the group and tap Accessories to reveal individual icons for the Accessories. From that screen, you can adjust each Accessory on its own. Setting Scenes -- Tinkering with Accessories constantly gets tiresome. Thankfully, HomeKit offers shortcuts, called Scenes, that combine actions together. For example, you could have a Scene called Good Morning that turns on all of your lights, a Scene called I’m Leaving that turns off your lights and turns down the thermostat, or a silly party Scene that turns your living room red. To create a Scene, tap the plus icon in the upper-right of the Home or Rooms screens and choose Add Scene. Home will suggest some Scene names, or you can create your own name by tapping Custom. Once your Scene is named, tap Add Accessories, and then tap individual Accessories to add them to the Scene. Tap Done to move on. Next, you’ll be taken to a screen with the Scene Name, and the Accessories included in the Scene. Adjust the Accessories as you normally would. For instance, tap a smart bulb icon to turn it on in the Scene, or press and hold to adjust its brightness and color. Finally, at the bottom are options to Test This Scene, which activates it temporarily; Add Accessories, where you can modify the Accessories included in the Scene; and Show in Favorites, which I recommend enabling for essential Scenes. Suggested Scenes -- I recommend three Scenes to everyone: Good Morning, Good Night, and Scenes to quickly adjust the brightness in your primary living areas. For instance, I have three favorited living room Scenes for adjusting brightness: Living Room Bright, Living Room Dim, and Living Room Night, which set my living room Hue lights to 100 percent, 40 percent, and 0 percent (very dim, but not off) respectively. With these Scenes, I can easily dim the living room to watch a movie, but also quickly brighten it up if I need to find the remote or change my son’s diaper. Adjust these scenes as you see fit, but I recommend using my names, as they’re easy to identify and Siri has no trouble understanding them. When configuring the Good Morning and Good Night Scenes, the settings will depend on your Accessories and living situation. Think carefully about what to activate and why. My Good Morning Scene does three things at the moment. It turns on the smart plug that controls the lamp in the laundry and music rooms and sets the living room lamps to 40 percent brightness. During the Christmas season, it also turned on the plug that controlled the Christmas tree lights. My Good Night Scene does the opposite, though it dims the living room lamps to 0 percent instead of turning them completely off. These Scenes are set up in such a way to light up the house sufficiently to navigate in the morning, without being painfully bright. Even though we have Hue bulbs in our bedrooms, these Scenes don’t touch them at all. Why? I set Good Morning to activate automatically during weekdays. If my wife and son get a surprise snow day, I don’t want them getting a rude awakening at 5:30 AM if I forget to turn the Automation off. I often want to control the bedroom lamp independently of everything else when I go to bed, either turning it on so I can find my way around or leaving it off if my wife is sleeping. I use Good Morning and Good Night as general-purpose Scenes throughout the day. I activate Good Night after my wife leaves for work and then Good Morning before she gets home. Nothing is happening in either bedroom, so there’s no reason to mess with those lights. All that said, I don’t recommend that you create Scenes right away. Instead, experiment with your Accessories and figure out which settings you like and which devices you use most. Setting up Scenes will be easier once you have a sense of what you’re doing regularly. But if you just want to create some goofy Scenes to turn your living room blue or whatever, don’t let me stop you! That’s part of the fun of home automation. (If I ever install a HomeKit-equipped thermostat, I’ll probably create a Game of Thrones-inspired scene that turns my lights blue and drastically lowers the temperature. Because I’m a huge dork.) Once you’ve created a Scene, you can find it in two places in the Home app. If you set it as a favorite, it’ll be available from the Home app’s Home screen (and in Control Center). Otherwise, look in any Room with which the Scene is associated. If a Scene is split between multiple Rooms, you can find it in any of its Rooms. Control with Control Center, the Apple Watch, and Siri -- Jumping in and out of the Home app every time you want to turn on a light is more work than flicking a switch on the wall. Thankfully, Apple offers some quicker ways to activate your Accessories. I usually use Control Center on my iPhone to manipulate my HomeKit devices. In iOS 10, Apple redesigned Control Center with multiple pages, and if you have any HomeKit devices favorited, swipe to the left twice to reveal an additional Control Center page that lets you control both Accessories and Scenes. In the Home page of Control Center, a button in the upper right lets you switch between controlling favorite Accessories and Scenes. Tapping an Accessory or Scene turns it on or off. As with the Home app, you can press and hold or 3D Touch Accessories in Control Center to see more advanced settings like brightness and color. Control Center can display only nine Scenes and nine Accessories, so while you should favorite the items you use the most, you also want to be selective. If you own an Apple Watch, the Home app built into watchOS 3 also lets you control favorite Accessories and Scenes. I recommend adding it to your Dock for quick access. Tapping an Accessory or Scene activates it, while the … button lets you adjust things like brightness — which you can do with the digital crown, which is neat. That said, I don’t use the Apple Watch Home app often, as I find it unreliable. It frequently throws No Response error messages for all of my Accessories. Like many Apple Watch activities, I can perform the same task on my iPhone more quickly. Of course, you can also control HomeKit with Siri, which is a big win when it works. If everything is set up correctly, you can use a number of commands, such as: “Turn all my lights on.” “Turn off the bedroom lamp.” “Set the thermostat to 72 degrees.” “Make my living room blue.” “Good morning.” (Activates the Good Morning Scene) “Set Scene Good Morning.” (Does the same thing as above, which is useful if Siri doesn’t recognize the Scene name on its own.) For the most part, Siri controls work well, even with Hey Siri on the Apple Watch (though my watch usually takes a minute to recognize the command). You can even use these same Siri commands with the fourth-generation Apple TV, assuming it’s running tvOS 10 or higher and it’s signed into the same iCloud account as your other HomeKit devices. That’s about all you need to know about controlling HomeKit devices for now. In the next installment of this series, I’ll explain how to set up a hub so you can operate your HomeKit devices when you’re out of the house and how to set up Automations to make your devices work on their own.

Jimmy Iovine confirms Apple Music’s plans to offer original video content Posted Jan 16, 2017 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Qonto wants to become N26 for business banking Earlier this month, The Wall St. Journal reported how Apple is working to bring in veteran producers to help create original content, including TV series and movies for an expanded Apple Music service. Now, Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine has offered additional insight about Apple’s plans in this space, as well as how it hopes to differentiate itself from existing streaming competitors, like Pandora and Spotify. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Iovine essentially confirmed reports of Apple Music’s further expansion to video, while speaking over the weekend at the Television Critics Association press tour. “At Apple Music, what we’re trying to create is an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video,” he said. And by “video,” he didn’t just mean music videos and those that fit within the broader musical genre, as with Apple’s earlier purchase of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” or Dr. Dre’s “Vital Signs, ” a semi-autobiographical scripted TV series that will be also distributed by Apple. Instead, Iovine hinted that Apple will consider other types of programming, as well. “If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you’re not musicians, you know?” Iovine said, according to The Hollywood Reporter’s account. “We’re going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We’re going to try,” he added. The exec also commented on how Apple will make its service stand out, as compared with today’s streaming music rivals, like Spotify and Pandora, which focus on converting free users to paid subscribers. “We’re fighting ‘free.’ So a simple utility where, ‘here’s all the songs, here’s all the music, give me $10 and we’re cool,’ is not going to scale,” Iovine said. Apple Music has no free tier, beyond its free trial, which is a decidedly different strategy from its peers. Spotify, for example, has said that 80 percent of its paid subscribers began as free users, which is why it continues to offer the “freemium” tier as an entry point to its service. Meanwhile, Apple not only focuses on making Apple Music a paid offering, it also shut down other free streaming content, like its ad-supported iTunes Radio service, which offered curated stations based on genre. Those became available only to Apple Music subscribers, starting early 2016. These moves may be paying off. Apple said in December 2016 that its music service now has 20 million paid subscribers, or roughly half of what Spotify has in terms of paying customers, despite the latter’s multi-year head start. Of course, also Apple benefits heavily by nature of owning the platform, giving it a means to promote its own content and services through built-in apps on its hardware. Ahead of this planned expansion to scripted original programming, Apple has experimented with video content of an unscripted nature. It streamed a Taylor Swift concert and a Vice docuseries called “The Score.” It’s also planning to launch a reality-style program “Planet of the Apps,” which features celebs like Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, Jessica Alba, and will.iam offering mentorship to app developers. But Apple isn’t the only music service expanding to video in an effort to gain subscribers. Spotify also launched video last year, offering content from partners like  ESPN, Comedy Central, the BBC, VICE Media, Maker Studios, MTV, TED, NBC, ABC News, Vogue, Elite Daily, Tastemade, Wired, Fusion, and others. It later expanded to original programming focused on artists, biographies, live performances, and more. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

Latest: an Apple hardware partner confirms it is ready to supply curved screens, and an analyst predicts that the next iPhone will be branded as the 'iPhone X' by David Price | 26 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Name Design New features When will the iPhone 7s be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus handsets for 2017? Welcome to our iPhone 7s rumour roundup, in which we gather and analyse the latest clues and speculation about the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, new features and more. If you've come here in search of information about the current iPhone range, allow us to direct you to our iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7 Plus review, iPhone buying guide 2016/2017 and best iPhone deals UK. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus, during a special event on 7 September last year. But we're already looking ahead to the next iPhone in 2017. In this article we sift through the clues and evidence pointing to Apple's iPhone 7s launch later this year, and predict the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, design and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information emerges, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone 7s rumours. Updated, 26 January 2017, with confirmation that one of Apple's hardware partners is ready to make curved screens; on 23 Jan, with a detailed report predicting a more sensitive second-gen 3D Touch in the iPhone 7s; on 20 Jan, with predictions that the late-2017 iPhone update will be rebranded as the 'iPhone X'; on 4 Dec, to add further detail to reports that the iPhone 7s will feature wireless charging, as well as claims (from Donald Trump) that Donald Trump is pressuring Tim Cook to build iPhones in the US; and on 17 Nov, to report on a source's claim that Apple is integrating augmented reality into its next iPhone Read more: iPhone 8 rumours | iPhone 9 rumours | Best cheap iPhone deals UK iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Release date The iPhone 7 was announced on 7 September, and pre-orders began on 9 September; it went on sale on 16 September. (Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Mind you, it's possible that Apple might bring the iPhone 8 forward... as we discuss in the next section. iPhone 7s release date rumours: Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president-elect, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump did not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. More of this sort of vague thing has emerged since then. Trump stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means.  To be frank, these statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was originally going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) It was understood, rather boringly, that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the company has since stated that it will merely be receiving, configuring and distributing servers from this hub rather than building any products. Any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the iPhone, will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Name Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". iPhone X Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at the research firm Cowen and Company, has sent out a client note predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - the letter X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. It's rather leftfield, and we'll count it as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, but it's actually not the worst idea in the world: those relentlessly rising model numbers draw attention to quite how long Apple has been churning out iPhones, and make each one seem like merely the latest update in a long line of identikit devices. This would be a statement of intent, a declaration that this one is different. We'll talk a bit about Timothy Arcuri's other predictions later in this article. Macworld poll: What will Apple call the next iPhone? iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Design What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. iPhone 7s design: Edge-to-edge screen, with no Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s. Technology that could help with this development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple is plotting the use of an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, refers to "Electronic devices having displays with openings", and appears to cover various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them, thanks to small (and in most cases tiny) holes in the screen. This in turn means Apple can expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it doesn't need to leave space around the edge for the various apertures and controls we've grown used to. The holes could be filled in with a material that doesn't block radio signals, for instance, although in many cases they will be so small that the user wouldn't notice them. iPhone 7s design: Larger screen Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, who we quoted earlier, has also made some predictions about the screen to be included in what he predicted will be called the 'iPhone X'. There will be three models, Arcuri says: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones, to match the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a new 5.8-inch iPhone - the biggest ever iPhone screen. This latter, clearly flagship model, will have an OLED screen and a "wraparound" design with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated under the glass, with no separate Home button. iPhone 7s design: Curved/flexible screen There have been consistent rumours, stretching back years, that Apple is going to make an iPhone with a curved or flexible screen - although flexible might be a misleading word to use here. Very few people imagine that an iPhone in the near future will actually be able to 'flex' in any meaningful way (being folded in half to fit in a pocket, for example); most pundits just mean that it will have curved edges so that the screen continues a little way down the sides, like the Samsung S7 Edge. Some relatively firm evidence was added to this theory in January 2017, when the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, confirmed [paywall article] that it is ready to start building flexible displays. (Again, this is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the company didn't mention Apple by name, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and analysts are understandably putting two and two together. iPhone 7s design: Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 - that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." iPhone 7s design: Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. iPhone 7s design: Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. (A slight complication here is that Apple has historically made red products as part of the Product Red HIV/AIDS charity, rather than as a cosmetic preference. Macotakara doesn't comment on whether this will be tied in with that charity.) Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: New features Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. iPhone 7s new features: New 3D Touch AppleInsider is predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will feature second-gen 3D Touch with greater sensitivity and greater gesture versatility than the current version, thanks to changes in the underlying design. According to a research note from the respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by the site, the next iPhone will have 3D Touch based around thin film instead of flexible printed circuit boards. While this would improve the way the technology works, it would create design headaches; for one thing, thin film sensors don't incorporate the metal conductive plate that protects the current screen from deformation, so Apple would have to add a passive metal backplate or risk a repeat of the Bendgate scenario. The development would also add to manufacturing costs, and with UK prices already up to account for the weakness of the pound, Apple hasn't got much room for manoeuvre if it wants to protect its profit margin. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts iPhone 7s new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component.  iPhone 7s new features: Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand."

Michael Lopp has worked for Apple, Pinterest, Peter Thiel’s shadowy intel company—Palantir and now he runs the engineering team at Slack, the cloud-based intranet service. It turns out that this high level tech exec also likes playing Destiny, the first person shooter from Activision. Playing online has taught him a lot about leadership, because it encourages the kind of teamwork that requires someone to take the helm. In certain Destiny multi-player modes, if there’s no one making decisions, everyone dies and no one has fun. But playing in groups means playing with strangers, and “the internet is full of… colorful people,” he said. Yet Lopp has watched the leader of the group he plays with and found that he never loses patience with anyone that joins them on a mission. That’s inspired the latest leadership shortcut Lopp is using with the nearly 200 engineers he manages at his unicorn employer. “I’m being unfailingly kind,” he explained. “I didn’t say ‘nice,’ I said kind.” Lopp offered this new tip as the last in a long list that he presented at Calibrate 2016, a one-day conference in San Francisco to mentor engineers into leadership roles. Sharethrough published his September presentation Thursday on YouTube. ‘I guarantee that you are undervaluing the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things’ Lopp explained that he has been in leadership roles for 20 years, first at Netscape, the once dominant internet browser (which lives on in the heart of Mozilla’s Firefox). He has realized that leadership is really an “impossible job,” because you have a million problems to fix and dozens of people looking to you to fix them. “You are greatly outnumbered by chaotic, beautiful snowflakes,” he laments. “There’s too much to do. There’s far too much to do, and their expectations of you are unattainable.” So he’s collected a series of what he calls “hacks” that help him do better work as a leader. On one of his slides, he defined a hack this way (emphasis his): “Hacks. Small bits of wisdom that pay unexpectedly high returns on time invested.” He added, “and it kind of feels like cheating.” Some of the best tips from his talk follow: Arrive two minutes early to everything At Apple, he says, there’s a joke about “Apple Standard Time,” which says that every meeting starts ten to fifteen minutes late. He surmised that this originated with some executive long ago who showed up to meetings late, so teams learned it was okay to be tardy. This rippled out throughout the company and became part of the culture. It’s funny and it’s cute, but, as Lopp points out, “This is bad. Why is this bad? Because there are six people sitting there who got there on time that you’re paying… to read Twitter.” “Curate the appearance of availability.” He won a lot of credibility when he started at Pinterest by meeting with everyone on his team in one-to-one meetings or in small groups. It created a sense that everyone could talk to him, but it took him months to get through them all. So he scaled this better at Slack by creating office hours every two weeks that anyone could sign up for. While the times always fill up, the practice also creates a sense of accessibility for team members who never take advantage of the time slots. Do one-to-one meetings every week One-to-one meetings are open-ended, strategic conversations with one person on your team. They aren’t goals check-ins or task management, but focus on broad topics, such as the vision for a product or feature, leadership development or cultural troubleshooting. He promised these meetings provide “incredible signal about your team.” Keep these meetings. He asked, “The moment you have a one-on-one with your boss, and she cancelled it or she moved it, your reaction was what? You’re not important.” Prep three prompting questions for every meeting Writing down three questions in advance helps if a meeting isn’t coming together. He doesn’t use the questions if the meeting seems to be working on its own. If it’s not, though, they always help him to get the conversation going. Fix some small problems all the time Every team has huge, strategic goals that it needs to achieve. It’s tempting to not sweat the small stuff. Lopp seems to argue for a middle road. Fix some of the small stuff, though maybe not all of it. In fact, it might even be OK to just adjust some of the small stuff, rather than totally correcting it, but fit some time in regularly for minding details. “What I like to see out of leaders is they are constantly thinking: ‘Where are the small bugs?’ And how are they fixing them,” he said. “I guarantee that you are undervaluing the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.” Always know your key stats Every team leader at a tech company will have key metrics that they should be keeping an eye on. It could be things like active users, job applicants, conversions or weekly downloads.  “There’s a set of numbers in your business that are incredibly important,” he said. “Having those ready is going to speed things up.” Share information profusely At Palantir, he said, they actually had a term called “Rumint,” which stood for “rumors intelligence.” Rumors form when there are gaps in information about topics that people care about. When companies grow rapidly, those gaps start to form quickly and the gaps turn into gossip. One time at Pinterest their CEO accidentally sent out the meeting notes from an executive meeting to the entire company. There was nothing damaging in it, but these notes normally only went to the executive team. It made the staff so happy to see them that the CEO started distributing their notes every time. Buffer, the social media optimizer, has gotten out of the startup phase in part by leaning into transparency. Do open postmortems on your own mistakes “This hack is one of the biggest differences between a leader and a senior leader,” he said. Mature leaders are better at admitting that they screwed up openly. They also excel at explaining how they came to the wrong decision, what they learned and how they are going to fix it. “Which is, by the way, every postmortem you’ve ever been through,” he said. New leaders think a mistake is going to get them fired. “This is the thing about Silicon Valley: failure is learning,” he said. High five the apocalypse “Freaking out does no one any good,” he promises. When there’s a disaster on his team, Lopp described himself as “walking about as the sky falls with a smile on my face.” He said, “The sky falls every two weeks. It’s how I know I’m alive.” Lopp has written two books on topics like this, Managing Humans and Being Geek. He has also posted his own explanations of five of these hacks on his blog. He closed the talk with a bit of reassurance, saying, “I was joking.

In this installment, we’ll explore some of the details involved in setting up the software. If you’re impatient, I have a compact guide to HomeKit in “iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course.” General Advice -- Before you begin, you need at least one HomeKit device. In “A Prairie HomeKit Companion: Core Concepts” (3 November 2016), I recommended two categories of HomeKit device: A smart plug, such as the Elgato Eve Energy or the iHome SmartPlug. You plug one of these inexpensive smart plugs into an electrical outlet to turn it into a smart outlet. Then you can turn any device plugged into it — a lamp, heater, or fan, for instance — on or off by controlling the plug. A smart lighting system, such as the Philips Hue. The Hue system is much more expensive than a smart plug, but it offers capabilities that a smart plug and lamp combo can’t, such as dimming and color changing. For more on the Hue, see “Getting Started with the Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs” (1 August 2016). I recommend these devices for two reasons: they’re immediately useful and they’re not scary. A smart lock or a thermostat is a big investment that might require professional installation, but bulbs and plugs can be installed by anyone. Plus, if you program your lamp incorrectly, it could annoy you by turning on or off at the wrong time, whereas a mistake with a smart lock or thermostat could result in you being locked out of a cold house. Remember that not every home automation gizmo is HomeKit-compatible — Apple must approve all HomeKit devices, which is an expensive and time-consuming process for manufacturers. Apple publishes a full list, and if you have any doubts, check the box for the “Works with Apple HomeKit” badge. Finally, when you first launch the Home app, you’ll be prompted to create a Home, name it, and choose a background photo. Don’t stress about these choices, because you can easily change them later. The name “Home” and the default background picture are sufficient. You can set up multiple Homes, but for the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume that you have only one. Setting Up Accessories -- To take advantage of Home, the HomeKit control app built into iOS 10, you have to add your HomeKit Accessories to it. As I explained in “A Prairie HomeKit Companion: Core Concepts,” Accessories are the actual home automation devices. First, power on your Accessory. The next step depends on your device. You have to set up Hue lights in the Hue app itself and then add them to HomeKit from the app, as I explained in “Getting Started with the Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs.” However, you can set up many standalone devices, such as the Elgato and iHome plugs, directly in the Home app. Here’s how to do that: In the Home or Room screens, tap the plus button in the upper right. Tap Add Accessory. If everything is working correctly, your Accessory should appear on the Add Accessory screen. Tap it. Next, you’ll be prompted to either type in or scan the device’s HomeKit code. That code can be found either on the device or in the box. Some devices, like those from Elgato, provide their codes on convenient cards. Be sure to save those codes, ideally in a secure vault like 1Password, because you need them every time you set up the devices. The final screen offers a number of options: Identify Accessory: Tapping this button activates your Accessory so you can spot it in the real world, often with some sort of blink or flash. This is handy if you’re not quite sure which device in your house you’re working with. That might seem ridiculous, but just wait until you’re setting up multiple smart bulbs with names like SMARTBULBFN2187. Accessory Name: By default, this is the factory name of the device, like “Eve Energy 810D.” I recommend changing it to something more descriptive, like “Music Room Lamp.” Location: From here, you should choose the Room in which your Accessory will live. The default is — get this — Default Room, which is sort of a waiting room for your Accessories. If you haven’t yet set up a Room, you can do so from the menu — just give it a name and choose a picture (the default is fine). Type: This field describes the type of Accessory. You can leave it alone. Include in Favorites: Enabling this switch makes it so the Accessory appears in the Home screen of the Home app, as well as in the Home pane of Control Center. Unless you have a lot of HomeKit Accessories (one TidBITS reader told me he has 75!), I recommend leaving this switch turned on. Setting Up Rooms -- Now let’s talk about Rooms. As you might recall from “A Prairie HomeKit Companion: Core Concepts,” Rooms are the second level in the HomeKit hierarchy, under Homes. HomeKit Rooms, of course, should match up with the physical rooms where you have Accessories. I have Rooms like Bedroom, Living Room, and Laundry Room. You get the idea. You access Rooms in the Rooms screen of the Home app. In that screen, tap the hamburger button to see and switch among a list of your Rooms. To add a Room, tap that hamburger button, choose Room Settings, and tap Add Room. Accessories are always in a Room, even if it’s just the generic Default Room. As you set things up, you’ll want to move Accessories from one Room to another. To do this, tap and hold an Accessory (or use 3D Touch if your iPhone supports it), tap its Details button, and then choose Location to pick a new Room from the list. Why are Rooms so important? Two reasons: they organize your Accessories in a logical manner and to support Siri. I can tell Siri to turn on my Living Room lights, and all the lights associated with that Room turn on. Once you’ve set up one or more Accessories and Rooms, and put the Accessories in the appropriate Rooms, you’re well on your way to automating your home or office. Just as Accessories are tied to a Room, so are Scenes, which are collected actions for your Accessories. In the next installment of this series, I’ll discuss additional Accessory options, controlling your Accessories, and creating and using Scenes.

But if a new report from The Investor is to be believed, Apple is about to even the odds with its upcoming iPhone 8 handset. Citing 'multiple sources', the report says the company's next smartphone, expected to arrive later this year, will come with an IP68 rating. Related: MWC 2017 An anonymous source told The Investor: “Apple’s iPhone 8 will feature the IP68 rating protection as part of drastic upgrades marking the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year." The '8' in IP68 means a phone can be submerged in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to half an hour, while the '6' in the rating refers to the dust resistance and guarantees “no ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust tight)”. Not to be outdone, Samsung will also apparently maintain the IP68 rating for its upcoming Galaxy S8, which is due to arrive in the coming months. The Galaxy S7 comes IP68-certified On top of that, the sources claim Samsung will introduce this high-level water-proofing on its lower-end handsets, such as the recently unveiled A3, A5, and A7. Quality water proofing is becoming an increasingly popular feature, with LG debuting a new mid-range handset at CES 2017 that comes with the IP68 rating. Related: IP67 vs IP68 And with the upcoming LG G6 reportedly ditching the modular design of the LG G5, the company's next flagship is also expected to arrive fully IP68-certified. As with all these reports based on information from anonymous sources, the information is far from verified, so there's no guarantee the iPhone 8 will come with an IP68 rating. But it would make a lot of sense for Apple to catch up to its biggest rival in that department, so we wouldn't be surprised to see a fully waterproof iPhone arrive this year.

Monday, The Hollywood Reported published an interview with Apple executive Jimmy Iovine, who said that adding original video content to the music-streaming service is part of the plan to turn Apple Music into a pop cultural phenomenon. Here’s the full quote: At Apple Music, what we’re trying to create is an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video. If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you’re not musicians, you know? We’re going to do whatever hits popular culture smack on the nose. We’re going to try. Enriching Apple Music with scripted TV shows and original movies should help the service better compete with the likes of Spotify and Pandora, which are largely free. “We’re fighting ‘free.’ So a simple utility where, ‘here’s all the songs, here’s all the music, give me $10 and we’re cool,’ is not going to scale,” said Iovine. Iovine made the comment on Saturday at the Television Critics Association’s winter press tour, where he promoted his upcoming HBO documentary titled “The Defiant Ones,” which centers on his relationship and partnership with Dr. Dre. Apple recently aired its first-ever documentary on Apple Music about Roland’s popular drum machine. Aside from its upcoming Carpool Karaoke show, based on the popular “Late, Late Show” segment from James Corden and featuring a different host every episode, Apple is also working on additional video content like a six-episode dark drama starring Dr. Dre, an unscripted reality show focused on apps and more.

Whether you prefer something that just charges your iPhone 7 or something that can power multiple devices at once, there are quite a number of dock options available out there. Here are some of the best charging docks for you and your iPhone 7! Ziku Aluminum Charging Dock Spigen wood stand Marcase aluminum charging stand Megadream 3 in 1 charging station Satechi 7-Port USB dock Ziku Aluminum Charging Dock If you're looking for a simple iPhone stand that you can rely on to charge your iPhone 7, then take a peek at the highly rated Ziku Aluminum Charging Dock! Simply plug your iPhone 7 into the metal pedestal, and your phone will start charging in an instant. This stand can even make eye-level FaceTime calls even easier, and it makes catching your on-screen alerts as convenient as possible. The stand can even fit the majority of iPhone cases, although there are obviously exceptions to the rule if you're using something like a massive Lumee or Prynt case. See at Amazon Spigen wood stand If you prefer your stand to have a bit more of the hipster kind of feel to it, and if you don't want to break the bank, then we recommend looking at Spigen's wood stand. Not only are you able to charge your iPhone 7, but you also have the option to charge your Apple Watch, making this a sort of 2-in-1 wonder-dock! The only downside is that you have to provide all your own charging cables and cords. At the bottom of the dock, secure silicone pads stop the thing from sliding around your desk, making it the perfect work accessory for fast-charging throughout the day. See at Amazon Marcase aluminum charging stand Futuristic, stylish, and supremely cool to look at, the Marcase aluminum charging stand has your iPhone 7 and your Apple Watch's battery's back! Designed from aircraft-grade aluminum and a scratch-free TPU, the Marcase aluminum charging stand is a sleek and modern looking accessory to pair with your iPhone 7. The lower portion of the stand keeps your phone fully charged, while the upper level displays your Apple Watch's face for easy screen-reading — even when it's charging! You can pick up this particular charging dock in space gray or rose gold, but there's no word on whether there will be a silver or a gold option in the future to perfectly match your iPhone 7. See at Amazon Megadream 3-in-1 charging station Keep the modern, fashionable wood look with all of the reliable charging capabilities of a regular dock with the handcrafted Megadream 3-in-1 charging station. Made from a high-quality rosewood, this dock has charging options for your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and so much more. Because the Megadream charges your Apple tech at an angle, it's also the perfect stand for watching movies or presentations. This 3-in-1 charging dock isn't only eye catching, it's beautifully designed and a great accessory for any home or office. See at Amazon Satechi 7-Port USB dock If you're looking to charge a plethora of Apple devices while still keeping things in line and organized, then we suggest taking a closer look at the Satechi 7-Port USB dock! This is a really great unit! I'm using it as the home base for my company WiFi hotspot devices, and it keeps them nice and neat... It's nice that it has a power button for the whole thing, allowing you to turn it off if everything is fully charged or if you don't have anything charging on it. (Amazon user Jeff Afford). With the Satechi 7-Port USB dock, you can easily charge your iPhone 7, your iPad, your iPod, and so much more. You can even pick from a black or white model to better match your style of iPhone/Apple tech! However, if you don't have a ton of tech to charge, the price tag might not be as worth it as some of the other options on this list. See at Amazon What's your pick? Do you have an iPhone 7 charging dock that you simply cannot live without?

Share on Facebook Reader comments Best Charging Docks for iPhone 7 8 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating bfarneth Except for one, all of these stands require you to plug in your charging cable to the phone, meaning your cable falls out of the stand when you unplug it (usually falling to the floor) or the cord is left dangling there. Not to mention the phone has to balance on the connector, in some cases, when it's plugged in. That's hardly convenient or good for the cable. Sent from the iMore App 0 2 weeks ago Reply Quintus Title is so misleading. These aren't the best charging docks! They are different charging solutions for your electronics. If you want to talk charging docks, the best one by far on the market now for the iPhone 7 is the ElevationDock. I have been using them for years. Solid construction and a true docking solution. https://www.elevationlab.com/products/elevation-dock-3 1 2 weeks ago Reply Gator5000e Gravitas by Henge Docks is the best in my opinion. The dock is very heavy so you can pull your phone off of it without the dock coming off the desk. Also, it has an audio out port so you can connect the dock to a table radio using an audio cable. So I dock my phone at night and play it through my (old but still great) Cambridge Soundworks clock radio. The audio goes though the lightning port out the audio port. I also have an older Bose Soundwave and do the same thing (connect the dock to the Bose thru the audio out port) with a second Henge Dock I have. I couldn't be happier with these docks. 0 2 weeks ago Reply dpscott I have an Oittm desktop charging dock. Great quality Sent from the iMore App 0 2 weeks ago Reply scharfat everdock by Fūz Designs. I have the Duo and love it. http://fuzdesigns.com/index 0 2 weeks ago Reply Rainman76#WN I love my Bellingham Powerhouse charging dock. It doesn't require the charging cables for my iPhone or Apple Watch since they're built into the dock. I wish it was a little heavier though because it's a little difficult to take my phone out one handed. Outside of that it's great.

MacBook Pro: Kaby Lake models 'to enter production this year' Samsung Galaxy Note 7: Battery faults to blame for fires According to a research paper posted on MacRumors, the next handset will introduce advancements in "biometric identification technology" that could be used to scan the user's face for heightened device security.  Sources claim a bespoke display may need to be manufactured to house the technology, which also includes a redesigned Touch ID sensor featuring an "optical-type" system expected to be positioned underneath the display.  The iPhone 8 is also believed to include a flexible OLED display that will improve 3D Touch interactivity, while a metal structure will "avoid deforming the form factor", the site adds.  This bolsters earlier rumours that Apple's next smartphone will have an all-glass design reinforced by a stainless steel internal structure, replacing the existing  aluminium body and glass display.  Added to that, it is also reported the iPhone will be more water resistant. The Korea Herald says it could receive an IP68 weatherproof rating, which would allow it to be submerged in water at a depth of more than three feet for 30 minutes.  iPhone 8: Will 'iPhone X' feature facial recognition? 19 January Facial recognition and gesture controls could be coming to the next iPhone as part of an expected design overhaul to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Apple's iconic handset.  A report in AppleInsider claims the new device, dubbed "iPhone X", could introduce "some form" of facial and gestural recognition that may be monitored by infrared and laser sensors close to the front-facing camera. According to sources, both the FaceTime camera and Touch ID sensor will be embedded into a "wraparound" 5.8ins OLED display, which could also appear on upgraded versions of the iPhone 7 and a possible iPhone 7 Plus, the site adds.  If true, the claims would bolster earlier rumours that this year's handset will feature a curved OLED display similar to the screen on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.  It is also being said that the iPhone 8 will feature a completely new design, with DigiTimes claiming a stainless steel chassis will be used along with two pieces of glass for the outer body, replacing the existing aluminium construction and glass display. In addition, Apple is also rumoured to be introducing wire-free charging, with The Verge reporting that wireless company Energous may be working with the Cupertino-based firm to deliver the technology by the end of the year.  iPhone 8: Could it be more water resistant?  16 January Apple's next smartphone could be more water and dust resistant than the iPhone 7, according to reports. The Korea Herald suggests the iPhone 8 could receive an IP68 weatherproof rating, which features on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and may also be on the "upcoming Galaxy S8". Sources claim the rating is among several "drastic upgraders" introduced to celebrate this year's tenth anniversary of Apple's iconic smartphone, the site says. The iPhone 7 holds a water and dust resistance level of IP67, meaning it is completely protected against dust and can be submerged in liquid at a depth of three feet (one metre) for around 30 minutes. An IP68 rating means it can be submerged in water at greater depths. However, tests have shown that the current iPhone is more weather resistant than its IP67 rating would suggest, says MacRumors, although liquid damage itself is "still not covered" under a standard Apple warranty. Last week, rumours that the new iPhone will receive an all-glass casing were bolstered when sources confirmed to DigiTimes that a stainless steel frame will replace the longstanding aluminium design currently used on Apple handhelds. While the new device is set to be a real game-changer, TrustedReviews says Apple may introduce two other variants alongside it, which could be called the "7S and 7S Plus" and feature an "iterative design". The iPhone 8 is expected to arrive this autumn. iPhone 8: Apple to swap aluminium body for stainless steel frame 11 January Apple's new iPhone will have a stainless steel chassis instead of its longstanding aluminium design, sources have confirmed to DigiTimes.   The new device, rumoured to be called the iPhone 8, is "expected to abandon its conventional aluminium back cover" in favour of "two reinforced glass panels" attached with a steel frame in the middle, the site adds.  Sources at the new handheld's supply chain told DigiTimes that the cost of the forging process is 30 to 50 per cent cheaper than "the current unibody CNC machine process" and provides more stable quality control.  The tech giant is expected to continue outsourcing orders for "internal structures" from Catcher Technology and Casetek, says MacRumors, as the steel bezel will require "further refinement" using the existing CNC machining process.  The report is consistent with rumours surrounding the design of the new iPhone, the majority of which suggest a glass body will be used to be more scratch resistant and to assist with new wireless charging functions.  Speaking to The Verge ahead of the Consumer Electronics show, Steve Rizzone, chief executive of the US-based wireless company Energous, revealed that the firm had signed an exclusive deal with a "key strategic partner" and would ship products featuring its wire-free technology "by the end of 2017".  Last year, AppleInsider reported that the Cupertino-based company had been approved for a patent to position the home button and FaceTime camera underneath the display, suggesting the firm may also install an OLED screen on the device.  iPhone 8: 'Best is yet to come', Tim Cook says 9 January Apple chief executive Tim Cook says "the best is yet to come" as rumours surrounding the next iPhone begin to grow, a mere four months after the launch of the iPhone 7. In a statement celebrating ten years since the tech giant first announced its iconic handset, Cook says the company is "just getting started".  He did not, however, unveil any details about what the company is planning to introduce on its next handset, which is rumoured to launch this autumn with a significant design overhaul. US-based wireless company Energous last week revealed it had signed a deal with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world", fuelling speculation the new iPhone may have wireless charging features. Speaking to The Verge ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Energous chief executive Steve Rizzone said the company had agreed a deal with a "key strategic partner" and would ship products featuring its wire-free technology "by the end of 2017".  According to MacRumors, the next iPhone will feature an all-glass case to house the wireless charging features as the existing metal casing can "limit the speed" of battery charging. This would also correspond with Apple designer Jony Ive's vision of a phone resembling a single sheet of glass, the site adds, a concept he has wanted "for several years".  While the iPhone 8 is expected to be a real game-changer, TrustedReviews says Apple may be working on two other models, which could feature an "iterative design" and be called the "iPhone 7S and 7S Plus".  iPhone 8: Energous fuels wireless charging rumours 6 January Rumours that the iPhone 8 will offer wireless charging have been bolstered by claims from Energous that it has signed a deal with "one of the largest consumer electronic companies in the world". Speaking to The Verge ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, chief executive Steve Rizzone said the company had agreed a "key strategic partnership" and will start shipping transmitters that can charge devices wirelessly from several feet away "by the end of 2017". He added: "I cannot tell you who [the partner] is, but I can virtual guarantee that you have products from this company on your person, sitting on your desk, or at home." According to the Verge, Energous "certainly doesn't mind speculation" that this partner is Apple. The US-based company, which develops wireless products, was first expected to release a wire-free charger towards the end of 2015, adds the site, although its plans changed when it signed the agreement that year. Under the deal, Energous's partner will be the first to ship its products inside "phones, laptops, tablets, and certain wearables and accessories".  If true, the shipping time would fall into place with the expected launch window of the rumoured iPhone 8. It was reported by MacRumors that the phone will feature an all-glass case to accommodate wireless charging features, as the current metal design can "limit the speed at which charging takes place". This also fits into Apple designer Jony Ive's vision of a phone that looks like a single sheet of glass, the site adds, a concept he has wanted "for several years".  Apple often uses its iPhones to unveil technology that will then be transferred to its other products. Its fingerprint scanner and Lightning connector both debuted on the phones, as did the virtual assistant Siri, which last year appeared on the MacBook range.  iPhone 8: Will game-changing handset feauture new Touch Bar? 4 January Apple's latest smartphone, the iPhone 7, is only a few months old, but fans are already creating concept designs for the iPhone 8.  A video from YouTuber Apple Designer imagines a smartphone that combines several rumours about the next generation, such as the absence of the home button and a USB-C charger, into one design. Video of iPhone 8 Concept avec Touch Bar The imagined phone also includes an adapted version of Apple's Touch Bar at the bottom of the display in place of the home button. It could be used to unlock the device or expand the keyboard to include emojis in the Messages app. See related  iPhone 7 vs 6S: Should you upgrade or wait for iPhone 8? MacBook Pro: Kaby Lake models 'to enter production this year' Samsung Galaxy Note 7: Battery faults to blame for fires It is believed the iPhone 8 will be released this autumn, with the tech giant skipping an 'S' version, the traditional follow-up to a new number, in favour of a new device to celebrate the phone's tenth anniversary. The Korea Herald reports it will feature a plastic curved OLED display from Samsung, with sources claiming it may incorporate "new sensing technology" that allows users to touch the sides of the device.  However, TechnoBuffalo says Apple are often slow to "adopt to new trends" and it's more probably the iPhone 8 will be a "general follow up" rather than a generation overhaul.  iPhone 8: next iPhone may get curved OLED display 19 December Apple's iPhone 7 has only been on sale for three months, but attention is already turning to next year's smartphone reveal. Celebrating the phone's ten-year anniversary in 2017, the tech giant is rumoured to skip past the '7S' variant and instead debut the iPhone 8. While this year's device was closer to an evolution of the formula, the iPhone 8 is tipped to have many more significant changes, including a raft of new technologies. A report issued by the Korean Herald suggests the iPhone 8 will receive a plastic OLED display that will feature curved edges similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Sources claim the new iPhone may incorporate "new sensing technology" that allows users to "touch any side of the device", the site says. Speculation surrounding an OLED display began in October, with AppleInsider reporting the firm has recently been approved for a patent to position the home button and FaceTime camera under the screen. Last month, it was rumoured that the iPhone 8 may feature an "all-glass casing" to accommodate wireless charging, says MacRumors. It is also believed Jony Ive has wanted to design a device that looks like a single sheet of glass "for several years", the site adds. iPhone 8: The iPhone may finally get wireless charging 02 November Barely two months have passed since the launch of the iPhone 7, but attention is already turning to next year's big Apple smartphone launch.  The tech giant is tipped to go straight past introducing an 'S' version of its current phone, and will instead debut the iPhone 8 next year. Unlike this year's device – criticised by some for being a minor upgrade – 2017's iPhone is rumoured to be a game-changer, and will introduce several new technologies and features in one fell swoop.   The big rumour is that it'll get a completely edge-to-edge OLED display, with no buttons whatsoever on the phone's face.  Now a new report issued by Nikkei suggests that the iPhone 8 could introduce a feature many of Apple's Android rivals already have up their sleeves – wireless charging.   According to the paper, Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn is currently testing wireless charging modules, which could make their way into next year's smartphone.  MacRumors says it's unclear if wireless charging will be a feature included in all upcoming iPhone 8 models, or if it'll be offered exclusively on the iPhone 8 Plus, just as this year's iPhone 7 Plus has exclusive camera hardware.   Rumours about wireless charging are nothing new, and Apple is thought to have lofty ambitions for the technology.  Earlier this year it was reported that the company was exploring "extended wireless charging", which would allow users to do away with their charging mats. Instead, the new technology would allow Apple to use radio waves to reach and recharge phones up to 15 feet away.   The iPhone 8 will arrive next September, so there's still plenty of time before all is revealed.  iPhone 8: Everything we know so far 28 October Apple's iPhone 7 hasn't been on sale for two months yet but fans are already readying themselves for next year's release.  In any normal year, 2017 would see the introduction of an iPhone 7S – Apple only releases new, redesigned devices once every two years, with improved "S" versions filling in the gap.  If rumours are true, though, next year promises to be different as 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of Apple entering the smartphone industry. It has gone on to become the company's most profitable venture by a significant margin, which is why fans are expecting something special to celebrate.  Releasing an S version of the 7, a smartphone that has been criticised by many for being too similar to the iPhone 6 and 6S, would be an unpopular move. A lot of iPhone fans are resting their hopes on 2017's device being a game-changer.  Here are all the rumours so far. iPhone 8 release date It seems a safe bet that the phone will be released in September, Apple's traditional time for unveiling new devices. However, it could be that the tech giant will break with tradition as it marks ten years of iPhones, says PC Advisor. Complete design overhaul The iPhone has been redesigned many times since it hit the market in 2007, but every handset has had the same face – two large bezels top and bottom and a round home button underneath the display. But early rumours are pointing towards a radical new design language coming next year. It's believed the iPhone 8 will do away with the bezels and instead feature a complete edge-to-edge display with the home button, selfie camera and speaker either hidden beneath or integrated into it. The latest word comes from respected and consistently accurate Apple tipster Ming-Chi Kuo, whose most recent scoop has been picked up by MacRumors. He says the edge-to-edge iPhone won't look like a single sheet of glass, as has been reported, but will be reinforced by an aluminium or stainless steel frame. The phone will be made predominantly from glass, though, stepping away from the aluminium designs used since the iPhone 5. Curved glass? In June, the Wall Street Journal suggested the new phone might have curved glass, something Apple is believed to have been working on for some time. MacRumours says this could mean the display of the iPhone 8 is curved at each edge, in the manner of the Samsung Galaxy S7. No more LCD The iPhone 8 may not use a traditional LCD (liquid crystal display), replacing it with a flexible OLED (organic light-emitting diode). This will make for a thinner phone that uses less power - something that might help with battery life. The OLED should have colours that are more true to life and a higher contrast ratio, says MacRumours. No more wires? Apple is "late to the wireless charging party", says PC Advisor, and pundits are confident it will join in with the iPhone 8 - removing the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is widely seen as a step towards that. According to TechRadar, Apple might just "go beyond rivals and offer a truly wireless charger that works at a distance". A similar camera It's rumoured that not much will change with the iPhone 8 camera, although the optical image stabilisation (OIS) technology introduced on the iPhone 7 might be extended to the selfie camera on the new device. Glass or metal? Sources claim Apple will return to glass-bodied phones after several generations of aluminium. TechRadar says there might be a choice: the iPhone 8 could be glass and the iPhone 8 Plus metal - or vice versa. Three sizes?  The latest rumour comes from Japanese newspaper Nikkei and has been doing the rounds on the usual assortment of dedicated Apple blogs and rumour sites.  Nikkei suggests Apple may introduce not two, but three iPhone 8s next year, all of them with different size displays.  At the moment, Apple makes its smartphone with 4.7ins or 5.5ins screen sizes. These are expected to remain, but a five-inch model will reportedly slip between them. All three will have glass casings, but only the most expensive model will get an OLED display.  Price? It really is too early to speculate, except to say the phones are unlikely to cost less than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which start at £599 and £719. iPhone 8: Is this Chinese phone the best look yet? 25 October Apple's iPhone 8 should make quite an impact when it arrives next September.  Rumours suggest that Apple is set to skip doing an S version of the recently introduced iPhone 7, partly because the device is a refreshed iPhone 6S, but mostly because 2017 marks ten years since the introduction of the original iPhone.  It's said that Apple has something special lined up for the iPhone's tenth anniversary, and that the iPhone 8 will be a completely re-designed handset, with an appearance unlike any iPhone before it.  Apple is tipped to switch to OLED displays, replacing the LCD panels it has used since the original device. It is also rumoured that the iPhone 8 will have an edge-to-edge display with curves at the edges, so the phone's face is a large, uninterrupted screen with no bezels or buttons.  If you haven't yet bought the iPhone 7, that may be enough to keep you from upgrading until next year. But if Xiaomi's latest handset is anything to go by, you'll be able to buy a phone just like the rumoured iPhone 8 very shortly. The Chinese company has just revealed its latest flagship handset. Called the Mi Mix, it is set to launch on 4 November, and it features a huge 6.4ins display tucked right up to the edges of the phone, covering 93 per cent of the device's face. The only significant bezel is at the bottom, but it features no buttons: everything is controlled onscreen, except for the fingerprint scanner on the back. Inside it gets the latest Snapdragon 821 chipset mated to 4GB or 6GB of RAM, depending on which spec you choose. There's no word of a UK release, but in China it'll cost the equivalent of £425 when it arrives.  The iPhone 8 is expected to be a little different, using a glass case rather than a metal one, and with the fingerprint scanner and FaceTime camera embedded under the display. But MacRumors still says the Mi Mix "may give us some idea of what Apple's next phone could look like".  iPhone 8: Home button could be behind the display? 10 October Apple's iPhone 7 has been out for less than a month, but the rumour mill for next year's iPhone model is already in overdrive. Apple is tipped to skip over the iPhone 7S next year and leap straight to iPhone 8, with a radically redesigned handset marking ten years since the introduction of the original handset in 2007. It's said that next year's iPhone will look completely different thanks to an edge-to-edge OLED display that could take up the entire front side of the device, as well as a glass body similar to the one on the iPhone 4 and 4S. The phone's iconic home button and large top and bottom bezels will be no more. To achieve this, Apple has to embed hardware like the FaceTime camera, speaker and – crucially – home button underneath the next iPhone's display. AppleInsider believes it may have found out how the internet giant can overcome this design hurdle.   Last week, the site reported a newly uncovered Apple patent filed in 2014 and recently approved, accurately outlining fingerprint and sensor technology that would allow fingerprints to be read on a scanner behind the screen. It's one of the biggest leaks so far to support rumours that Apple is working on a home button-less smartphone. To get around the gap between a user's finger and the sensor below the display, Apple proposes using electrostatic lenses in order to achieve an accurate image of the finger or thumbprint through the screen. As ever with patents, it's unclear if Apple is actively developing the technology and if it will end up in an iPhone, but this new information does reveal one of the methods Apple might use if it decides to go ahead with a new smartphone with no home button.

Pic courtesy/YouTube iPhone 8 is presently the much talked about smartphone. The upcoming smartphone is doing rounds on the internet pretty well. 2017 seems to be a significant year for Apple Inc, as it will mark the 10th anniversary of Apple’s iPhone launch. Apple is expected to make quite a number of changes in iPhone 8 including its glass body and wireless charging facility. Improved dust and water resistance is another upgraded feature that iPhone 8 is expected to get along with the other two. A report has stated that iPhone 8 will sport an IP68 rating, which means it can stay in up to 1.5 metres of water for around 30 minutes. As of now, iPhone 7 has IP67 rating, which means the device can be immersed in 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes. Apart from being water and dust resistant, iPhone 8 is also expected to feature a bezel-less design. The long-range wireless charging trait of the phone will not require users to place the phone on a charging station close to it. The 3D touch technology on iPhone 8 is also expected to get an improved version. As of now Apple lovers only need to wait for the launch of iPhone 8.  Tags: apple apple inc iphone 8 iphone 8 features wireless charging dust and water resistant apple smartphones iphone 7 mobiles gadgets technology tech news Previous StorySamsung probe finds battery was main cause of Note 7 fires: SourceNext Story Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 set to launch in India on January 19 Related Stories Mumbai food: Heady mix of latest cocktails with infused alcohol Food News | 28-Jan-2017 What is good and bad about Apple iOS 10.2.1 Technology News | 25-Jan-2017 What is good and bad about Apple iOS 10.2.1 Technology News | 25-Jan-2017 Flipkart Republic Day sale: Offers in Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, other consumer electronics Technology News | 24-Jan-2017 Download now: iOS 10.2.1, macOS 10.12.3 updates for iPhones, iPads and more Technology News | 24-Jan-2017 Tech Rewind: When the Apple Macintosh was first introduced Technology News | 24-Jan-2017 PHOTO VIDEO In Pictures: 17 challenging roles played by Bollywood actors 'Raees', 'Rustom' and more: 22 films inspired by real life Photos: Shilpa Shetty Kundra, Jacqueline Fernandez rock the airport look Spotted: Dia Mirza, Neha Dhupia and Rhea Chakraborty in Bandra Photos: Jackie Chan, Raveena Tandon on 'The Kapil Sharma Show' Why did Vidya stop communicating with her parents while shooting for 'Bhool Bhulaiya'?

The iPhone has created a stir since its launch. San Francisco - Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple and Alphabet’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.  A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said.  The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered "Essential" with the US Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" among its goods and services. It's unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android.  While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin's phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple’s iPhone and Alphabet’s new Pixel reside. It's expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Read also: How smart is Google's new digital assistant? Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe's most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google's robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin's next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects.  Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What’s the next platform?... It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn." Talks Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard, Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter.  At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone's screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin's team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said.  Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone's functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said.

Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone.  Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin.

There’s finally an app for that By Steffen Reich, Jan 16, 2017 Tweet 1 Comment The ability to store and play podcasts on Apple Watch is one of many features advocated for regarding future watchOS updates, but so far it has fallen on deaf ears at Apple. With the cries for podcasts on Watch slowly reaching fever pitch, developers have taken matters into their own hands and released a fully functional podcast app that enables the transfer of your favorite subscriptions from iPhone to Apple Watch. The app goes by the name WatchPlayer and (while moody at times) gives a solid account of itself, effectively beating Apple to the punch in the podcast race. Find out below how the data transfer is realized, where it trumps Apple’s stock apps and what areas of WatchPlayer could do with some attention. WatchPlayer does not tap into your Podcasts app to replicate your file structure or current subscriptions. Instead, you start off with a clean slate and options to either paste your podcasts’ Feed URL or search the iTunes catalogue. In view of some of the quirks of the app, which will be dealt with later, that’s a good thing. After tracking down the podcast you are after (which has worked without fail for me) WatchPlayer is going to download the audio file and store it inside the app. Transmission to your Apple Watch gets underway when you hit the designated icon on iPhone and open the app on your watch. This is where we will have to skim over the shortcomings quickly. The transmission can cut out at times, it can stall and completely choke with longer podcasts. Mind you, transferring music through Apple’s Watch app hasn’t been a walk in the park either until the latest generation of watches arrived, but what elevates Apple’s syncing is the simple existence of a progress indicator. WatchPlayer does not give you any sign as to how much data has been sent over to your watch successfully, which is frustrating at best and infuriating at worst. Consequently, as soon as the data transfer clocks more than five minutes, chances are you will start wondering if the process has hit a dead-end. For there is virtually nothing to suggest the success or speed of the data transfer, you are often better off avoiding the transmission of multiple podcasts at once. Send and listen to one at a time, and you will curtail frustration. Notwithstanding that, WatchPlayer could not possibly do enough wrong for me to advise against trying it. If you are willing to give it a bit of rope in terms of bugs, it excels in an area Apple thus far has not even broached. As far as the Apple Watch app goes, the interface is self explanatory and feels snappy on Series 1 and Series 2. It opens and plays quickly and implements Force Touch to delete all podcasts in one go. What’s the feature Apple will not be offering with their presumed take on podcasts, you wonder? Perhaps the coolest trait of WatchPlayer is that if you don’t have any wireless earbuds handy, the watch will utilize its external speakers to blare out the podcast. Apple seems adverse to that notion, incomprehensibly considering the sturdy sound quality WatchPlayer is capable of producing. Notable features and bugs aside, WatchPlayer comes with all the other bells and whistles you would expect. It is undeniable that this application requires cosmetic and functional improvements, but despite its current flaws the overall package is just too appealing for podcast fans to give it a miss. If you’re into listening to your favorite shows on long walks or workouts, get it while it’s hot (and free). WatchPlayer requires iOS 10 and is compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Find it for free in the App Store.

L.A. Now Are you an immigrant? We want to hear your story BUSINESS Technology Apple now taking film and TV pitches Tim Cook Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at an event to announce new products at Apple's headquarters in March 2016. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks at an event to announce new products at Apple's headquarters in March 2016. (Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP) Paresh Dave, Daniel Miller and Meg James Apple Inc. is taking pitches from Hollywood producers and courting television marketing executives as it considers bolstering its Apple Music service with original movies and TV shows, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Apple has toyed with playing a larger role in entertainment several times, only to either retreat in the face of roadblocks or opt for smaller moves. A goal of streaming broadcast and cable television seamlessly to Apple TV never materialized, for instance. Instead, it’s worked on a concert film with Taylor Swift and video shorts with artists such as Drake. It cut a deal with CBS for a program based on the “Carpool Karaoke” skit featuring late-night talk show host James Corden and is planning a reality show about technology start-ups. But Apple has the cash, cachet and incentive to push further. Less clear is whether the Cupertino company’s  ambition is to take on HBO and Netflix or simply to launch occasional gambits to encourage Apple Music sign-ups. A person not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive talks said Apple has told people in the entertainment industry that productions greenlighted and funded by the company would become available to people who pay $9.99 a month for Apple Music. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the discussions. Though the Apple Music service has reached 20 million subscribers in less than two years, many consumers see no reason to ditch YouTube, Spotify and other rival streaming services. Spotify has double the number of paying members, while YouTube hasn’t released such figures. Access to high-caliber programming could force people to reconsider.  According to an entertainment industry executive, content creators have been pitching scripted projects that Apple would produce.  But executives at several Hollywood studios said Thursday that they are not in talks with Apple about joint productions or even licensing old TV shows or movies. An Apple spokesperson didn’t respond to a request to comment. Apple finds itself at a pivotal moment, coming off its first annual sales decline since 2001. The company’s widening power in global technology and entertainment stems from sales of its iPhone. The pricey and hugely profitable gadget has turned Apple into the world’s most valuable company. But with more than 1 billion iPhones sold, sales have begun to flatten out. People are switching to new models less often or are opting for other brands, whose devices are often more affordable or customizable. The company has yet to demonstrate a product or service that can take over for the iPhone’s once-phenomenal sales growth. But many analysts view selling access to entertainment as at least part of the solution. Apple has been a major distributor of entertainment since the launch of the iTunes online music store in 2003 and the mobile App Store five years later. Sales from the stores contribute to Apple’s $24 billion in annual services revenue. Though that represents a quarter of what the iPhone brings in, it’s a low-cost business. Adding content production to the mix could send expenses soaring and drag down profit. Licensing fees have held back Spotify’s earnings, while Netflix has cut into potential profit to bet billions of dollars annually on its own content-making division. Hollywood veterans are skeptical of Apple’s ability to succeed in the same pool. Apple’s entry would come years after those of its competitors. It would need to develop a knack for knowing not just what buttons people want on their computers, but also what celebrities they want to watch. Staying hip in hardware, software and showbiz could stretch the company’s creativity. Bill Mechanic, the former chairman and chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment, noted that outsiders making a foray into Hollywood have been predicted to “take over the world” before, but it never quite happens that way. An industry as old, cyclical and diffuse as the entertainment business is difficult to dominate — to say nothing of doing it for long. “You can’t ignore companies like Apple,” said Mechanic, now a film producer. “Those are players that have the deep pockets to withstand a learning curve, and they find their niche. I don’t mean ‘niche’ as a small thing. They find their place in the stream of content.” Onetime Hollywood upstarts such as HBO, Amazon and Pixar have found their corners in the ecosystem. They required — in the parlance of the tech industry — a “killer app” to hook viewers and legitimize their production businesses. For Netflix it was “House of Cards,” for HBO it was “The Sopranos,” for Pixar, then led by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, it was “Toy Story.”  Apple could be looking for such a project. And its investment will be welcome, said John Landgraf, chief executive at TV channel FX. “There are extraordinary amounts of resources and capital in Silicon Valley and they are beginning to flow through Netflix, Amazon and now others in the programming business, and that is creating an acceleration in the increase in programming,” he said.   Producer Bill Gerber said the industry benefits from having more buyers for programming. “If they make movies like they make iPhones, they will be great,” said Gerber, whose credits include “Gran Torino” and "The Dukes of Hazzard.”  But should projects backed by Apple fizzle, it wouldn’t shy away from retreating from Hollywood yet again. The company has a history of halting or revamping ventures despite previous investment. A new factor in Apple’s favor this time around in film and TV is the long list of former high-level studio executives available as resources. Last year saw a major changing of the guard. Former 20th Century Fox Chairman Jim Gianopulos stepped down from his post; Rob Moore, the former vice chairman of Paramount Pictures, exited that studio; and Jeffrey Katzenberg sold DreamWorks Animation to NBCUniversal and vacated the CEO role. If Apple were to develop a massive operation, the company would easily get such veterans’ attention.

Image: Google play By Manish SinghIndia2017-01-16 12:24:42 UTC India’s Reliance Jio telecom operator is offering a bouquet of apps at no charge to its subscribers, hoping to lure them away from Netflix, Apple Music and a range of other services. The company has quietly released another app, this time going after Apple's HomeKit, and Google's Health services.  SEE ALSO: India's richest man is offering 4G for free to all his 52 million users for 3 more months A health and fitness centric app called Jio Health Hub is listed on the company’s Google Play listing. The app, which says "unreleased" in its description, is aimed at allowing people to have all their health related documents available at one place and provide them with the ability to readily share the reports with others. The features of Jio Health Hub puts it into the same category as Apple's HealthKit and Google Health. The two popular services retrieve medical and fitness information from other similar apps and serve as a central dashboard. Apple, additionally, has partnerships with hospitals for directly feeding patient information via HealthKit.   "All of your data is stored in the cloud which is accessible from anywhere and on any device but with your secure credentials, which means you can carry your medical records with you at all times without having to carry any papers, physical files, test films or lab reports," the description for Jio's app reads. According to the description, the company has partnered with labs and hospitals, which will automatically push medical records to the app. It hasn't listed which hospitals support this app, however.  Jio Health Hub, which is not available for iOS users yet, also has features to quickly store medical records in the app from non-partner hospitals too. The description suggests that a user could simply take a picture of the record using the camera on their smartphone and save the image in the app. BONUS: At 98 years old, this has to be the world’s oldest yoga teacher Topics: Health & Fitness, Health App, reliance jio, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Computers by Shara Tibken January 12, 2017 2:19 PM PST @sharatibken Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Apple introduced redesign MacBook Pro computers in October, the first major update in four years. Sarah Tew/CNET Consumer Reports is doing an about face on Apple's MacBook Pro. The endorsement reverses an earlier call by Consumer Reports telling consumers to avoid the new MacBooks, for the first time ever, because of big fluctuations in battery life. The publication on Thursday said a software update issued by Apple has fixed the battery problems it found in earlier tests. "With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge," Consumer Reports said. "Now that we've factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops' overall scores have risen, and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings." Apple plans to roll out the software fix it gave Consumer Reports to all users in several weeks, the publication said. Users enrolled in Apple's beta software program already have access to the update. Apple referred CNET to its comment from earlier this week about the Consumer Reports battery test. It said, in part, that the setting used by the publication to test the MacBooks "is not a setting used by customers and does not reflect real-world usage." It also said it had fixed the bug found in the test and that "this is the best pro notebook we've ever made, we respect Consumer Reports and we're glad they decided to revisit their findings on the MacBook Pro." Apple's new MacBook Pro, unveiled in October, was the first major update to its high-end laptop in four years. Apple executives, speaking in an exclusive interview with CNET before the launch, dubbed the changes -- including a thinner design and a Touch Bar above the keyboard -- a "milestone" and a "big step forward" for its top-of-the-line notebooks. See also Does the Mac still matter? Consumer Reports will retest MacBook Pro battery life CNET's take on the new MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro was redesigned as people start to take a second look at PCs, many of which employ full touchscreen monitors, foldable bodies that let them turn into tablets and -- most importantly -- competitive pricing. These Macs were meant to show Apple still cares about its computer lineup, given how much attention it's focused on its top moneymaker, the iPhone. Sales of the phone, which turns 10 this year, make up about two-thirds of Apple's revenue. But demand for the iPhone is slowing, which is why Apple needed to please some its long-time core customer base -- designers and creators who rely on the Mac. It didn't take long, though, for people to complain about everything from the pricing, the lowest option for a Touch Bar version is $1,799, to the removal of the MagSafe charging port. Battery life quickly became a big issue, with many saying they got about a third the promised 10-hour battery life. Apple tries the second-screen approach with the MacBook Pro Touch Bar The new Touch Bar is as close as a MacBook Pro is going to get to a Touch Screen. by Dan Ackerman 2:34 Close Drag One thread about the topic on Apple's support site has had more than 30,000 views and over 500 comments since it was first posted in late November. CNET, for its part, didn't see any battery issues in its many tests of the new MacBook Pro. Reviewer Dan Ackerman gave the 13-inch Touch Bar model an 8.6 rating (out of 10) and said, "Apple's smart, useful Touch Bar makes it well worth splurging on the step-up version of the streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro." CNET tests laptop battery life with a looping video playback, while Consumer Reports uses a browser-based benchmark. CNET's tests showed battery life in line with Apple's numbers. Battery drain In December, Apple removed the "time remaining" battery life estimate from its Mac software, saying the number has been inaccurate and the percentage remaining tally was a better measure. Consumer Reports' first findings from its MacBook Pro battery test came out nine days later. "After factoring together our complete test results, Consumer Reports finds that all three MacBook Pro laptops fail to meet our standards for recommended models," the publication said at the time. "This is a real departure from past MacBooks." The publication re-tested the machines after Apple identified an issue with the Safari browser that appeared to affect battery life during the publication's proprietary benchmarking tests. Apple released a software update to fix the issue on Tuesday. 53 Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Even though Consumer Reports now recommends the new MacBooks, Apple hasn't escaped unscathed. "Bottom line to me is that this news itself does not do any good for Mac, whether or not a battery issue exists," Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. "Even if there were no battery issue, it is hard to recover the product reputation as this news can stick to [a] consumer's mind." And there are still plenty of people experiencing battery issues. Jeff Geerling, a St. Louis, Missouri-based web and app developer, published a lengthy blog post Tuesday on why he returned his new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in favor of one with normal function keys. "The battery is the straw that broke this camel's back," the 31-year-old wrote. "After two times using the Touch Bar model on the road without power nearby, I nearly lost it when my laptop was under 10 [percent] battery remaining after only three hours of use." Geerling, a self-proclaimed Apple fanatic who has owned more than dozen Macs over the past 20 years, said he may think twice about buying a Mac in the future. The battery issues he experienced "made me look elsewhere for the first time in many years," Geerling said in an interview. "If Apple continues to neglect the Mac while other manufacturers like Dell and Lenovo are catering to developers ... that's where I start to feel nervous about the future of the Mac."

ESPN has revealed that it's in talks with Apple about streaming, too. We've got everything you need to know about the rumoured Apple TV streaming service - read on to find out more. by Lewis Painter | 16 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments The rumours of an Apple TV streaming service are nothing new, with speculation regarding an Apple owned streaming service stretching back to 2009, but things are hotting up as evidence rolls in, including a confirmation from the boss of ESPN. Here’s everything we know so far about Apple’s rumoured streaming service, including what it might feature and when it might be released.  Last updated to include information on a Wall Street Journal report claiming that Apple is talking to Hollywood producers about buying the rights to TV shows. Apple TV streaming release date: When is Apple's streaming service launching? There have been rumours for some time that Apple would launch a streaming service for TV content, kind of like a TV/Movie version of Apple Music, but it sounds like the rumoured Apple TV streaming service won't be launching anytime soon. The latest reports suggest it will be further delayed as Apple continues to negotiate with the TV networks in the US. ESPN's boss John Skipper has confirmed that he is working on a deal with Apple for its streaming service, but that Apple is having more trouble convincing other networks to join in. According to the Wall Street Journal, Skipper said: "We are big proponents of believing [Apple TV] would be a fabulous place to sell some subscriptions. We have ongoing conversations." "[Apple is] creating a significantly advantageous operating system and a great television experience and that television experience is fabulous for sports." A December 2015 report from Bloomberg claimed that Apple is putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks are proving too resistant to the idea. In fact, Apple may ditch the idea altogether, focusing instead on offering the tvOS platform for media companies to sell their content directly to consumers via the App Store, states the Bloomberg report. Following the above reports, news surfaced in February 2016 that CBS talks with Apple had stopped following months of discussions, suggesting a change in tactic. As first reported by CNN, CBS CEO Les Moonves claimed that talks with Apple had stopped following months of conversations with content providers: "We had conversations awhile back, and we haven't had recent conversations with them," Moonves said.  Moonves continued the interview by putting pressure on Apple, remarking that "the phone is always ringing" with other digital companies trying to partner with CBS for similar services. It seems like the clock is ticking for Apple, and we may never see the much-fabled TV streaming service. With this being said, we'll be updating this section with any new information as soon as we receive it so make sure you keep checking back for the latest news.  Is it true that Apple might buy HBO? One of the latest updates in the Apple TV streaming saga is a rumour that Apple is considering buying HBO, the home of Game of Thrones as part of an acquisition deal with Time Warner. A New York Post report claims that Apple might even buy Time Warner, Inc. That purchase would include HBO, CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network. The Post article explains that Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes is under pressure to spin off HBO. The report claims that "Apple is staying extra close to any possible movement on this front". 21st Century Fox made an offer to buy Time Warner in 2013 but was rejected. AT&T and Fox are also said to be interested in buying Time Warner. Whether it Apple would benefit from purchasing HBO and/or Time Warner is another matter, Apple already has access to HBO shows, so it doesn't really need to own the company. Owning Time Warner would be a headache as Apple would have to liaise with several cable networks not to mention turning old school cable channels into digital offerings. What's the delay with Apple's TV streaming service? According to Bloomberg's report at the end of 2015, the TV networks are resistant to the idea of an iTunes streaming service because if Apple’s demand for content at a price that the networks aren’t happy with. CBS CEO Les Moonves, who has often commented on the rumoured service, has also claimed that Apple has put the streaming service plans “on hold”, according to Bloomberg. Even back in August 2015, we were hearing that talks with CBS, Fox, and NBC had stalled, according to Bloomberg. Reports back then suggest that Apple was not likely to launch the new service until 2016. When it does, don’t expect the company to have confirmed deals in place with UK suppliers, it would appear that currently all its efforts are going into making agreements with US TV networks. As well as being unsuccessful in coming to agreements with the partners, Apple has also failed to increase network capacity enough to ensure a “glitch-free viewing experience” for customers, according to the report. Bloomberg explains that the programs would need to be stored locally to the customer – that streaming a show from California to New York would not be appropriate. Apple currently has four data centers in California, Nevada, North Carolina and Oregon. Perhaps related to this, Apple is said to be in talks with at least one operator of small “micro-data centers”, writes Bloomberg. Reports from May 2015 also suggested that Apple is struggling to get TV programmers on board, and it's all down to local TV stations, apparently. At the time, Re/Code said that Apple wants to beat rivals by offering local stations, but it pursuing those stations has thrown a spanner in the works ahead of its launch. "TV executives who are talking to Apple are optimistic the service will launch eventually, and that the most important hurdle to clear will be money, not technical issues," says the report. The report from The New York Post on 14 July 2016 suggests that Apple is in advanced talks with ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox in the United States. So why has it taken so long to come to some kind of deal? The report claims that the issue stems from local affiliate feeds, as the networks didn't directly have the rights to them and, therefore, couldn't negotiate on their behalf. Tim Cook urged networks to do the ground work on Apple's behalf, chasing up affiliates around America to get the appropriate rights to complete negotiations with Apple. The report also claims that Apple is looking to collect a 30% fee from all subscriptions, as it does with all other subscription-based services. However, The New York Times suggests that some network operators aren't happy about it, and goes on to describe a 'bullish' Apple that had an Autumn 2016 release date in its sights, which has now passed. Apple’s Jimmy Iovine on Apple TV streaming Speaking to Wired about Apple Music Jimmy Iovine, who joined Apple with as part of the Beats acquisition, said: “We all know one thing, we all have different television delivery systems, don’t we all wish that the delivery systems were better, as far as curation and service? They’re all technically good. And Netflix is starting to cross the code because they’re starting to make some original content. It is really good, but still I mean none of us make movies here right, so we’re all punters, or what do you call them in the music business, fans right? We want to watch movies. Sit down with your girlfriend or a bunch of friends and try to find a movie online. That box helps you none — it doesn’t help. You’re on your own. And eventually, that will catch them unless somebody digs in and really helps the customer. And entertainment needs that, it needs to live and breathe.” His words could be considered a hint that a TV streaming service is something Apple is working on. Iovine has reportedly been involved in helping Apple broker content deals with TV companies, according to Cult of Mac. Apple TV Streaming Service: What is it? So, what is the Apple TV streaming service? According to reports that date as far back as 2009, Apple has been trying to break into the TV industry with some sort of content streaming service. However, those 2009 rumours turned out to be just that – rumours. Fast forward to 2015 however and it looks like Apple may once again be setting their sights on the industry, according to a report by Re/Code. It’s claimed that Apple is in talks with TV programmers about potential deals that could allow Apple to offer a payment based TV streaming service to rival the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant Video. The idea is that instead of providing hundreds of channels to consumers like current paid TV offerings, Apple would put together bundles of popular TV channels and stream them directly to your iPhone, iPad or Apple TV using the internet. It means that Apple wouldn’t be a stereotypical TV provider, but maybe that was Apple’s plan all along – after all, Apple has a habit of taking existing technologies and improving them. The report also claims that Apple has shown programmers demos of the proposed service, but talks are still in the early stages. It also mentions that there are several TV programmers that haven’t even been approached by Apple yet. Update (16/01/2017): This was followed up by a January 2017 report by The Wall Street Journal claiming that Apple's recent ventures into video, including plans to produce 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke and a new reality show called Planet of the Apps, are part of a plan to take on Netflix. According to a source with knowledge of the subject, Apple has been in talks with major Hollywood producers about buying the rights to scripted TV shows - although the source couldn't mention specific shows or producers.  What the source did mention was how Apple might sell the service. Apparently, subscribers of Apple Music would gain access to the content at no extra charge, making Apple's music-streaming service more appealing to fans of Spotify and Netflix, two of Apple's biggest competitors.  We think that Apple should offer the content currently available on iTunes - movies and TV shows - for streaming, just as it offers music on Apple Music to subscribers. With an episode of Big Bang theory costing around £2.49 a go, it is illogical to download episodes from iTunes when you can just watch them on All4. Apple TV Streaming Service: What will it cost? With regards to cost, Apple’s subscription will reportedly cost around $30-40 (probably US-only service to start), which is a tad pricier than other American TV providers such as Sling TV, which offers a $20 base package. But what does this price tag get you? It’s claimed that the service will offer around 25 different channels, with the likes of ABC, CBS and Fox being lined up as partners.  There is one major US provider missing from that list – NBCUniversal. According to the WSJ, it’s because Apple and NBCUniversal’s parent company Comcast have had a falling out. “Apple and Comcast were in talks as recently as last year about working together on a streaming television platform that would combine Apple’s expertise in user interfaces with Comcast’s strength in broadband delivery,” reports the Journal. “Apple came to believe that Comcast was stringing it along while the cable giant focused on its own X1 Web-enabled set-top box, the people said.” This goes against a report published by Re/Code which claims that the reason that Comcast isn’t a part of the rumoured Apple TV streaming service is simply because Apple hasn’t approached the company. Comcast apparently acknowledged its non-talks with Apple in a letter sent to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) as part of an effort to acquire its biggest competitor, Time Warner Cable. The note was in reply to a note written by “Stop Mega Comcast”, a coalition opposing the deal. The coalition claimed that Comcast may be withholding NBCUniversal content in an effort to “thwart new video competitors”. Comcast responded by saying “Not only has NBCUniversal not ‘withheld’ programming from Apple’s new venture, Apple has not even approached NBCUniversal with such a request.” It’s interesting that denial of a working relationship becomes news, but that’s what happens when Apple is involved. It’s also worth noting that the likes of Fox, ABC, CBS and others haven’t confirmed talks with Apple, and that the report is can be viewed as more of an acknowledgement that something may be happening, rather than concrete evidence. But the question is – what’s in it for the providers? The New York Post has claimed that Apple has offered to share data with providers to get them on board with its internet-enabled TV streaming service. It’s been claimed that Apple will provide companies with details regarding who its viewers are, what they watch as well as when they watch it. This could help providers with advertising, as Apple is taking a step back and letting providers decide whether ads will be included. The tactic is an interesting one, as Apple is offering something that traditional cable companies, as well as the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime won’t offer to providers. Why is this? It could be to try and catch up to Sling TV, which offers a similar service without a cable TV subscription. Apple is also apparently asking the TV providers to supply their own streams for the upcoming streaming service. According to TV industry executives, Apple is asking TV networks to handle both the responsibility and cost of the streaming infrastructure. It may not be a huge ask – many video services that are currently supported by Apple TV (including Fox in the US) organise their own streams by working with various content delivery networks, so this may be the next logical step. Apple TV Streaming Service: On Demand options When Apple showcased the Apple Watch at its 9 March event, it also announced a new and exclusive partnership with HBO to offer HBO Now, the premium channels first service outside of a traditional cable provider. The Apple TV app allows you to browse HBO’s full catalogue of shows and films for $14.99 a month, and was iPhone/iPad/Apple TV exclusive for three months after its 10 April 2015 launch.  In the UK new Apple TV owners can get an iPlayer app, Sky Now Entertainment, Movies and Sports, and, of course, Netflix.

Like the launch of Apple Pay and Apple Music, the launch of Apple’s TV streaming service, if it ever launches, is likely to do so in the US - especially since rumoured providers are mainly US based. With regards to a UK-specific launch, there are no rumours and we don’t expect a UK variation to be available anytime soon.

The star said the cast of Apple Tree Yard were 'banished' from shooting a raunchy encounter. The Palace of Westminster opened its doors to commercial filming several years ago despite complaints from some MPs that the historic building was being turned into a theme park. Actress Emily Watson said the cast of Apple Tree Yard were 'banished' from shooting a raunchy encounter on the Commons estate Productions including the movie Suffragette, starring Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan, have paid up to £10,000 a day to use the backdrop. Although TV cameras have been recording Commons proceedings for more than a decade, prior to 2013 any filming connected to 'advertising, fundraising or for commercial purposes' was banned. Dramas supposedly set in Westminster were shot elsewhere, with Manchester Town Hall doubling as Parliament's neo-gothic corridors and meeting rooms.

Share this article Share In the 2011 film The Iron Lady, which saw Meryl Streep win an Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher, the Commons chamber was actually a 5,000 sq ft replica. The imitation chamber – first used in Granada TV's 1986 adaptation of Jeffrey Archer's First Among Equals – has been sold on eBay for more than £123,000. However, despite the more broadminded approach to filming in recent years, it seems the parliamentary authorities have drawn the line at sex scenes. Suffragette was the first movie to shoot scenes on the parliamentary estate In new BBC drama the Apple Yard, Watson plays a high-flying geneticist who embarks on a passionate affair with a stranger she meets at the Houses of Parliament. The story sees the characters get up close and personal in the crypt under the Commons.  But Watson told the Sunday Telegraph they had to film the encounter elsewhere - and suggested the House authorities had been too prudish. 'We were banished. Because as it turns out you can blow up James Bond on Westminster Bridge but no sex, please!' she said.  A spokesman for the Parliamentary authorities said: 'Parliament is proud to support a number of commercial filming projects which help to offset the costs of running Parliament and offer new ways to bring our iconic buildings to a wider audience.  'All requests are considered on a case-by-case basis and seek to balance access for cameras with the need to minimise disruption to Parliament's core work.'        Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Serena Williams awkwardly neglects her fiancé after Aus Open win Many Clouds dies after beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Incredible moment truck crashes through middle of bus Grandma accused of killing son-in-law celebrated during testimony Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border George and Laura Bush welcome the Obamas to the White House 2009 Harriet was rescued from a South Korean meat farm Look what the cat dragged 'OUT'!

Andy Rubin, the brains behind the world's most popular operating system Android, is said to be working on a smartphone that will set new standards in the mobile industry. Rubin is planning to announce a new company called 'Essential' which will take head-to-head competition with the likes of Apple, Google and Samsung. As per a report by Bloomberg, the new company will focus on delivering high-end smartphones which will be equipped with advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) based digital assistant. The report further highlights that the company is planning to launch a new smartphone which will boast a large edge-to-edge display (something similar to Xiaomi Mi Mix). The report adds that the phone boasts a screen larger than the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus but will have a smaller footprint due to lack of bezels. Rubin's Essential is also reported to come up with a pressure sensitive display, similar to what we have seen in Apple's iPhone 6s and later. It is also said that the company is working on a modular angle and is developing a new connector that can be used to add other accessories as well, just like we have seen in the Moto Z series. The report further states that the company is testing high-end design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic. Rubin is said to be in talks with Foxconn to manufacture the new smartphone, sources close to the development told Bloomberg. The smartphone is expected to hit the market in mid-2017 and will be priced close to Apple's iPhone ($649 or Rs 44,255). Rubin has registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. The company is now said to running with 40 staff members, who have previously worked with Apple, Google and other top notch firms. The company has already listed some of its patent in smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating software for mobile phones" with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For those who are not aware, Rubin was one of the founder members of Android. When Android was acquired by Google in 2005, Rubin was Vice President of Mobile and Digital Content until March 2013, where he looked after the operating system for eight years. In 2013, he stepped down from Android division and he left the company in 2014, to start an incubator for hardware startup called Playground Global. Andy Rubin Essential Products Inc.

The T-Mobile iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be big sellers when pre-orders kick off on September 9th. Advertisement T-Mobile customers are accustomed to high-profile launches of the iPhone by now.

Apple’s site says to visit an Apple Store to do the Upgrade Plan with T-Mobile. T-Mobile’s site doesn’t even mention it, of course, because they have their own deals to promote. Are you aware of some way of doing it online or is it a store only situation? 09/19/2016 Lac Bui Reply I would like to buy I Phone 7 plus (Silver) 01/15/2017 ntinsley7 Reply I don’t agree, read that http://techpp.com/2014/09/10/buy-factory-unlocked-iphone-6-iphone-6-plus/ Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

These are in connection to now president-elect Donald Trump’s campaign of making America great again. Anyone who have heard Donald Trump’s speeches would think that he is making promises that are too difficult to achieve. It might be the case but that did not stop the incoming president to discuss the matter to big tech companies like Apple. In fact, because of his previous meeting with the tech giant, more partners of the company are seemingly willing to jump in. Last week, reports from various publications revealed that major Apple suppliers are beginning to consider moving to the US. This includes setting up plants and investing billions of dollars that will, in effect, pour in jobs and infrastructure. Companies like Foxconn Technology Group and Sharp have expressed their willingness to conform to the new president’s edict. Now, it looks like Pegatron is also willing to jump into the fray. According to Nikkei, Pegatron’s chairman Tung Tzu-Hsien has expressed interest of increasing its production in the US. Furthermore, he also mentioned that the company is ready to implement the said improvements as soon as its conditions are met. Pegatron Chairman Tung Tzu-Hsien (via asia.nikkei.com) He also said that expanding the current workforce to even as much as ten times is not a problem at all. Pegatron currently has a few manufacturing and assembly lines across the United States as well as Mexico and Czech Republic. While this may sound very good indeed, it may not be very beneficial to everyone. The main reason why the manufacturing companies thrive within Asian market is due to the proximity of other suppliers. These companies have, on their own, built a small community that ensures faster transit of parts and goods. Merely moving the big companies to the United States does not guarantee cheaper final products. In fact, because most of the parts needed to make a product would still be sourced outside, final product cost will suffer. Furthermore, labor cost in Asia is far cheaper than that in the US. This is another reason why most companies prefers to have their assembly and production done in Asia. That being said, with companies aligning themselves to Trump’s economic policies, it is highly likely that production in the United States might happen sooner than expected. In fact, Apple has already done so with the current generation Mac Pro computer. Consumers could be looking at future iPhone and iPad devices made and assembled in the US. However, people should be wary that this may lead to increased production cost that will eventually be passed on to consumers.

Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage NEW YORK: Tech major's tight-lipped approach is widely thought to be hindering its ability to hire the best people in the field of AI, which often relies on open source developer tools. Chris Lattner, Apple's head of developer tools and the creator of its uberpopular programming language, Swift, this week announced plans to join Tesla. People leave their jobs for all kinds of reasons, especially when they are offered exciting new jobs at important, on-therise companies. But someone in Lattner's circle of developer friends shared some insight at to why Lattner may have been calling it quits at Apple now, even as one of his major contributions, Swift, had really taken off. The person we talked to said one big reason was that Apple's culture of secrecy was wearing on him, particularly because it was his job (and his life's work) to create opensource developer tools. “He always felt constrained at Apple in terms of what he could discuss publicly -resorting to off-the-record chats, surprise presentations, and the like,“ the person told us.“Similarly, I know he was constrained in recruiting and other areas. Eventually I know that can really wear people down.“ This wouldn't be Apple's first time losing someone because it insists on secrecy over collaboration. As we previously reported, Apple's entire networking team quit within a one-week period back in 2015 when Apple asked the team to build a bulletproof network and then refused to allow it to collaborate with others outside the company in its field doing similar work via an organisation called Open Compute Project, sources told us. The Apple networking team then took the networking tech it built at Apple, based on open-source software, and launched its own startup called SnapRoute, which has since taken the network world by storm. After its members quit, Apple relented and officially joined the OCP. Apple was also forced to change its policy of secrecy for its artificial-intelligence team. In December it allowed that team's members to start publishing research papers on their work and otherwise collaborate with academia. Just a few weeks ago, the Apple AI team published its first paper. That was a major reversal, and it came because Apple's tight-lipped approach was widely thought to be hindering its ability to hire the best people in the field of AI.AI is the biggest trend in the tech industry these days, and those creating new ways for computers to learn and to reason want to show off their own accomplishments to the greater AI community. Yann LeCun, Facebook's AI director, said that at Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research unit, known as FAIR, publishing wasn't just allowed but required. When it comes to opensource software, Apple hasn't been completely absent. In addition to Swift, it has allowed for the sharing of numerous other key technologies including WebKit, ResearchKit, and CareKit. It also uses opensource technologies in its products and contributes back to those projects.Secrecy almost certainly wasn't the only reason Lattner left, though. His baby, the Swift language, is Apple's relatively new language for building Mac and iOS apps. Apple released it at its Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014, and it quickly became one of the most popular programming languages around. While Swift was always a team effort, after Apple opensourced it a year ago, it quickly built up a large community of people to work on it, both inside and outside Apple.

Rohit KVN   January 16, 2017 10:58 IST Android co-founder Andy Rubin's Essential mobile to take on Apple, Google and Samsung in 2017; all you need to knowCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic via Flickr It's been a little over two years since Android co-founder Andy Rubin left Google to build a hardware startup. Now, it has come to light that Rubin is planning to launch a new mobile device that is poised to set a new benchmark in the smartphone industry. Besides working in Google, Andy Rubin has also had stints at Apple and General Magic, a WebTV project, which was eventually sold to Microsoft. And his vast experience of working with top technology firms is expected to benefit his new venture, dubbed as Essential Products Inc., which envisions to build a big ecosystem of smart consumer electronics products, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the company's plans. Also read: No Samsung Galaxy X vs Apple iPhone 8 smartphone war this year? Rubin's Essential Products Inc. was officially registered in November 2015 and as per latest reports, it has 40 odd staff members, who have the experience of working in Apple, Google and other top firms of the Silicon Valley. The company has already listed some of its patents related to smartphones, tablets, accessories and computer operating software for mobile phones, among its goods and services at US Patent and Trademark office, under the name "Essential." As per latest reports, Rubin's Essential is on the verge of finalizing a top-end phone of the same name with state-of-art technology including wide edge-to-edge bezel-less display (similar to Xiaomi's Mi Mix), advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based digital assistant, top-notch build quality, powerful processor, 3D Touch feature (like iPhones) and snap-on mods (similar to Moto Z series) among other features, enough give markets leaders -- Samsung, Apple, Google, Motorola and other -- a run for money. If things go as planned Rubin's Esstential phone, which is said to re-invent mobile phone, is expected to make its debut in mid-2017 for a base price of $649 (approx. €612/Rs. 44,285). Android co-founder Andy Rubin's Essential mobile to take on Apple, Google and Samsung in 2017; all you need to knowGeekbench Browser screen-shot (via mobiltelefon.ru) In a related development, Essential phone has appeared on Geekbench website scoring 1844 and 5426 points in single-core and multi-core tests respectively. The mobile phone with model number: Essential FIH-PM1 runs Android 7.0 Nougat and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 quad-core with 4GB RAM. It is believed that Rubin's Essential is collaborating with supply partner Foxconn International Holdings to make the phone, hence the device bears FIH in its model number. Though the phone has got powerful Qualcomm processor, it has to boast game-changing features to stand out among competitors or else the brand will fade away in no time like Apple's former CEO, John Sculley's Obi Worldphone series.

Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp., people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered “Essential” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and “computer operating software for mobile phones” among its goods and services. It’s unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Alphabet Inc.’s new Pixel reside. It’s expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe’s most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google’s robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin’s next venture was a startup incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics, and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. “New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,” he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. “What’s the next platform?… It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn.” Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least $300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard Co., Google, and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin’s new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin’s phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus’s (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The startup is experimenting with enabling the phone’s screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin’s team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Essential’s engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone’s functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360 degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang, and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the startup. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.

Now that it’s available nearly everywhere, here we’ll be sharing four great reasons why owners should use Samsung Pay. Like triple reward and other incentives. Advertisement Released in late 2015 users will need a Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, or a Galaxy S7 to enjoy all it has to offer. Not to mention the latest Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch and a supported bank. Read: Samsung Pay vs Android Pay: What’s The Difference Between Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and now Android Pay, not to mention LG working on its own version, wireless mobile payments are here to stay. For those who’ve yet to try it, here are a few reasons why I use Samsung Pay. Furthermore, why it’s worth recommending to those with a Samsung smartphone. Advertisement Advertisement Samsung Pay was first announced during the Galaxy S6 announcement in early 2015, but wasn’t released until September after a short beta. Apple Pay had a one-year lead on Samsung, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. In addition to only being supported at select retail stores or update payment terminals. In fact, we recently wrote an article on why we don’t use Apple Pay, and stated some good reasons to avoid it. That said, Samsung Pay works almost everywhere and has none of those limitations. As a result it’s absolutely worth using. Here’s a list of supported devices, carriers, banks and credit cards. Update: In late 2015 Samsung added support for Chase and Mastercard, two huge partners that will allow millions to enjoy Samsung Pay. Then in December added gift cards, additional features and improved the user interface. Throughout 2016 Samsung has added loyalty cards and support for over 500 banks or Credit Unions. If you have a device, bank and card that works with Samsung Pay, take advantage of all it has to offer. Advertisement Safe & Secure All Samsung smartphones that work with Samsung Pay feature the latest cutting edge technology in terms of security on a smartphone. From fingerprint scanners to the latest monthly security patches. Between users needing a fingerprint to actually use Samsung Pay to make wireless payments with their phone, and all the security measures in place are why it’s safe to use. Here is Samsung’s thoughts on security: “your purchases remain yours alone. Samsung Pay uses several layers of security. It keeps your payment information separate and doesn’t store or share it, so you can pay without worry.” Samsung Pay doesn’t store or share payment or credit card information, making it safe to use. Not to mention multiple layers of security are in place to keep it safe from hackers trying to steal information. Yes part of the technology behind it was hacked last year, but it didn’t compromise S-Pay in any way. In fact, it’s believed the reason behind it was to try and steal the technology used. That brings us to our next point, why this service is so great. Samsung Pay Works Almost Everywhere Unlike Apple Pay or Android Pay, Samsung’s method works almost everywhere. It’s accepted everywhere that works with Apple Pay, in addition to any payment terminal that accepts a credit card. Samsung claims nearly 95% of all retail stores in the United States will work. So yes, almost everywhere. Advertisement The service uses both NFC and MST (magnetic secure transmission) to make wireless payments. All a user needs to do is tap their phone to the payment terminal, touch the fingerprint scanner for authentication, and you’re all done. This is done with NFC, but it’s also backwards compatible with all swipe-based magnetic payment terminals. Meaning anywhere you can swipe a credit card, you can use Samsung Pay. If NFC (Apple Pay style) isn’t accepted, it uses the magnetic signal. Which is sent when swiping a debit/credit card. It’s fast, easy, and secure. Apple and Google both use NFC, which is Near Field Communications. Meaning that select locations around the US like Starbucks, vending machines, retail stores and others need to have updated payment terminals inside their stores for it to actually work. Devices with the “Paypass” or “Apple Pay Accepted Here” signs you’ve probably seen like the one above are required. As a result many places don’t accept Apple or Android Pay, making it useless for those with an iPhone or recent Android devices. Advertisement This is key. Samsung Pay works at all of those locations, as well as the others. Making it extremely convenient unlike any other mobile payment service on the market. I’ve made payments at stores that don’t accept Apple Pay, like Walmart, and the cashiers constantly tell me, “Hey, that doesn’t work here”. Then are shocked to see it works. The responses I’ve received are everything from confusion, amazement, to curious and full of questions. Rewards New to our list is Samsung Pay Rewards, which debuted on November 14th 2016. This reason alone is enough to suggest owners try it. The goal is to get more people to try the service, and to thank the millions that already have. Samsung Rewards works just like a points-based credit card reward program. Every mobile purchase made will earn points. Users can double-dip by earning points from the card and Samsung, not to mention earn rewards on a debit card. Something that typically doesn’t happen from banks. These points can be redeemed for Samsung products, vouchers, gift cards, visa cards and more. The company also has double or triple bonus programs planned. Imagine getting 4x points, points from the card issuer, then getting a gift card. Impressive, right? The more you use Samsung Pay each month, the higher tier users will be. From Silver, Gold and Platinum for better rewards and more double-ups. Additionally, there will be instant winners for random giveaways simply for earning points and making payments with your wireless device. More information can be found here. Easy to Use And finally, Samsung Pay is extremely simple to use. So much in fact that once it’s setup users don’t even have to turn on their phone to make payments. Which is one of the many reasons I use it daily. Setup takes less than a minute and consists of installing the Samsung Pay app if it isn’t already installed. Then using the camera to capture and save your credit or debit card. Users can also enter the information manually. Once done, you’ll never need to use the Samsung Pay app again. Although there are free gift cards and other incentives in the “announcements” part of the Samsung Pay app. Check it to earn free $25 gift cards, Dunkin’ Donut freebies and more. Slide up on the home or lockscreen to instantly launch Samsung Pay Once done simply swiping up from the bottom of the screen (even while the phone is turned off) will initiate Samsung Pay. Users will be instructed to pay with their fingerprint. Now just hold your phone up near the terminal or NFC reader. It takes less than two seconds, and you’re all done. The transmission is secure, and doesn’t go very far so hackers can’t collect the information. Users can swipe up while the phone is off, or turned on, right from the homescreen or even the lockscreen. There’s a persistent little tab on the bottom (shown above) making it quick and easy. This can be removed if users would like, but then you’ll need to open the app before making payments. Samsung’s phones can tell which signal is required, and there’s no difference in the process or timing whether it’s NFC or MST. It just works, and works well. Users can also swipe through a list of cards if more than one has been added, which is also a swipe and fingerprint tap away. There’s no finding a card in your wallet, digging through a full purse, or hoping the location works with Apple Pay. Just pull out your phone, swipe, tap and pay. Samsung plans to add additional banks, cards and more features in the near future. We’ve seen a lot added in 2016 and expect that trend to continue next year. We’re also hearing they could have some big deals and rewards during Black Friday. Hands down Samsung Pay is the best wireless mobile payment method on the market. It’s fast, secure, safe, and more importantly easy to use everywhere. As a reminder, Samsung Pay doesn’t work at gas pumps or ATMs, but that’s about the only limit users will run into. If you have a capable device and a supported bank or card, give it a try today. You’ll be glad you did. It works amazingly well on my Galaxy S7 Edge. 17 Responses 11/14/2015 John Reply Considering the lead time before Samsung Pay release, you’d think they would have gotten more banks on board. Of the five, two are obscure. Samsung really needs to get on the ball with this before a competitor/phone manufacturer gets MST which makes this app work nearly everywhere – which is also the sole reason why one should get Samsung Pay. Once that benefit is gone and Apple puts it into their next phones, Samsung is buried. 11/24/2015 Peter Reply Samsung has the patent for MST. Also, since Samsung’s older phones already have NFC built-in, they can update the Samsung Pay app to support all legacy Samsung devices with NFC included (work only for NFC). That would be great. 11/15/2015 eric coultas (@glimmerman76) Reply John samsung owns all the mst payment patents. 03/26/2016 Abelardo Reply Please sign my petition for capital one to support Samsung Pay.

Do you give the server your phone? 04/08/2016 Nick V Reply I love Samsung Pay! I accidentally left my card at home one night and had shopping and dinner to do. I explained to the cashiers that I need to pay with my phone as I didn’t have my card. They looked at me all strangely (I do live in Idaho haha!) and said ok … as I’m holding up my phone to their swiper deal, they start saying “Ummm, I don’t think we have that …. OH MY GOD IT WORKED!!” Haha! Three different store cashiers reacted this way … it was awesome! I highly recommend it! 04/08/2016 Lalo Reply Thats the standard reaction at every store I have used it at too. The only store it didnt work at for me was Wal-Mart self check out lanes. The cashier had to suspend the transaction but I was able to pay at a different station that had a different card swiper model. 04/09/2016 Kathryn Reply !!!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 2512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

I found that even in some stores there are card readers that will not play nicely with the app. I just avoid those lines now. It’s probably about time an update to this article because the list of cards and banks that you can add have more than doubled. 06/21/2016 Finn Reply Does it really work when the phone is switched off? On the S7 Edge it doesn’t appear when the phone is off and it takes 30 seconds to activate when the phone is switched on. 12/22/2016 Unplugged Reply On my S7 Edge, the phone switches on immediately. No 30 seconds. You just swipe up from the bottom of the phone. BTW, the Samsung Watch S3 uses MST, so you don’t even have to get out your phone. 10/16/2016 Joe shmoe Reply I have been using it for the better part of 2 weeks and its works awesome it has cut the amount of cards I carry in my wallet by half.I have only had 2 places that it didn’t work gas station swipe and at a very old retailer using the swipe on a cash-register. So much quicker then having to pull the card out of my wallet. 11/18/2016 Max Reply i read some news said MST need to save your signature for reference when you use it? it work when the phone should switched on ? if i choose to use NFC to make the payment i think i want to be faster, if i still need to use POS to connect phone and check the signature, can i be faster ? it is not all the samsung phone can use MST just like Galaxy S6 Edge ? anyone know ? 11/28/2016 cara Reply One MAJOR issue with Samsung pay is it’s propensity to double charge your card. Twice now, Ive had a double charge occur when using Samsung Pay. It hasn’t happened at merchants like Panera who are set up to accept Samsung Pay or tap but, at merchants who have magnetic strip readers. For now, I will not be using the service. I’ll wait until they work out the bugs. If I didn’t check my account regularly I would never had known! 12/04/2016 Joseph Reply http://www.samsung.com/us/samsung-pay/compatible-cards/#bank The above website lists the hundreds of banks which are on-board. 12/18/2016 Joe T. Reply One thing I didn’t see mentioned in the article was Samsung Pay’s support for reward cards. I just ask the cashier at the food store if I can aim the phone at their scanner and it takes. Even my library card works. Samsung pay has emptied my wallet of all these miscellaneous cards. 01/15/2017 Nate Admiraal Reply I would get another Samsung phone purely due to the ease and convenience of Samsung pay. It’s the greatest thing since sliced bread — a bit off topic, but the only thing that gives me pause is the loss of the IR blaster — which was SO useful for TV/AC/garage door opener, etc. etc. Why oh why did Sammy ditch that feature?

A Falcon 9 rocket carrying 10 Iridium Communications satellites rumbled aloft from Vandenberg Air Force Base on California's central coast shortly after 9:54am local time, amid clear skies and a majestic view of the Pacific Ocean. The rocket's first stage touched down upright on an unmanned drone ship miles offshore about 8 minutes later, a feat that SpaceX accomplished four times in 2016 and captured on the company's webcast.

"Mission looks good. Started deploying the 10 Iridium satellites," said Musk, who watched from the control room with Iridium's chief executive officer, in a Twitter post. "Rocket is stable on the droneship." Musk later confirmed that all of the satellites had deployed, marking completion of the company's mission. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Recovered Falcon rocket boosters in a hangar at the Kennedy Space Center. Photo: AP The triple success — launch, drone-ship landing and mission completion — was a relief and welcome start to the new year for the company. SpaceX hopes to launch 20 to 24 rockets this year, an aggressive pace given that eight missions were completed in 2016. Iridium, one of SpaceX's largest commercial satellite customers, has signed on for six more launches, all of them scheduled for Vandenberg. NASA contract Saturday's success was critical because SpaceX has a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to send astronauts to the International Space Station and is targeting November for the first demonstration flight and May 2018 for the first test flight with humans aboard. Advertisement Musk, who's also the CEO of Tesla Motors, founded the company 15 years ago with the express goal of sending humans to Mars. The company makes rockets at its headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and has contracts to launch commercial satellites as well as fly missions for NASA and the US military. The closely-held company has roughly 5000 employees. SpaceX has been awarded NASA contracts valued at $US4.2 billion to resupply the Space Station using its unmanned Dragon spacecraft and ultimately to ferry astronauts to the station from the US with a version of the Dragon that's capable of carrying crews. Iridium's upgrade The satellites deployed on Saturday are part of the Iridium NEXT constellation network, providing new and better communications services such as allowing air-traffic controllers to monitor planes flying over oceans anywhere in the world. Iridium, based in McLean, Virginia, is counting on SpaceX to take 70 new satellites into orbit with seven separate launches over the next 14 to 18 months. The new satellites would let Iridium offer new services and continue servicing existing clients without interruption. Its existing satellites are 19 years old, which is old by industry standards. The satellites were placed in a temporary orbit about 625km above the Earth, where they will be tested in the coming weeks, Iridium said in a statement. The satellites "will then be moved into their 780km operational orbit and begin providing service to Iridium's customers," the company said. "Thanks @elonmusk - a perfect flight! Loved watching sats deploy with you in the control room," Iridium CEO Matthew Desch said in a Twitter post. Bloomberg 0 comments Log in to comment New User?

To Apple and to common sense 16 Jan 2017 at 01:05, Richard Chirgwin A US appeal court has opened the next round of the long-running Apple versus Samsung patent case, this time to recalculate the damages Sammy owes Cupertino. Apple won US$399 million in damages when courts agreed that various patents were infringed by Samsung, including rounded corners on the case, and the gridded home page design. That was overturned in December 2016, with the Supreme Court deciding the damages should only cover the value of what Samsung copied, not the profit of the entire range of infringing smartmobes. That's what the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will now rule on: between zero and nearly US$400 million, what's the right quantum of damages to inflict on the embattled Samsung? As Macrumours notes, the world's big names in design (Calvin Klein et all) have filed an amicus brief because they want the court to find that the design elements in question are sufficient to make up the whole value of the copy. Their argument is that since people can identify a Coca-Cola bottle by shape alone, copying the iPhone's shape should qualify Samsung for the maximum damages. On the other hand, Faultline writing for The Register argued in December that the phones behave entirely differently, the copying is trivial, and the damages could reasonably be cut to as little as $50 million. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 33 Comments More from The Register Silence is golden: How Google hunts Android malware in the wild When mobes and gadgets stop verifying app installations, you're gonna have a bad time 19 Comments More mobe malware creeps into Google Play – this time, ransomware Charger seeks to drain bank accounts of unlucky 'droids 5 Comments Samsung revival hamstrung by 2014 Google deal – analyst Sammy can't stand out from the crowd because of non-compete pact 13 Comments Google's Chrome cloaks Pirate Bay in red screen of malware death Scam ads abound 29 Comments Is Google using YouTube to put one over on Samsung?

As we've come to expect from Nintendo, this is a console that does things a bit differently to everything else on the market, but despite some initial misgivings (and the ongoing feeling that this console will not be everyone's cup of tea), I left the preview event convinced of this machine's potential for great things. Since the Game Boy's release 26 years ago, Nintendo has sold both a portable and a home console, but the Switch represents the merging of those two categories into one device. When plugged into a TV the tiny Switch behaves exactly like a regular games console, but it can also be taken on the go and used like a portable.

A pair of innovative new controllers called Joy-Con are the other star of the show, giving the console the potential to be a capable home gaming system, a great portable, and an instant party machine all at the same time. Small packages The console itself is surprisingly little — about the size of a large phone or a tiny tablet — with the front dominated by a 6.2-inch touchscreen. It's unassuming to look at until you combine it with the Joy-Con controllers, which — with advanced motion sensing, a new kind of tactile feedback technology, a bevy of buttons, sticks and triggers and more — are basically the ultimate evolution of the Wii remote. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The Switch in its three main configurations: TV mode, tabletop mode and portable mode.  For traditional games like The Legend of Zelda or Skyrim you'll want to slide the Joy-Con into the Switch to make an all-in-one device, or attach them to the included grip to make a regular controller (you can play this at home or on the go, as the Switch has a handy kickstand so you can set it down anywhere). One of my favourite features is that each Joy-Con can be used on its own as a full controller. This means that you can take it travelling with you to play on your own, but at a moment's notice you can break the controllers off and hand one to a friend for some Street Fighter II. Advertisement As an all-in-one I found the machine to be very comfortable and immediately got the hang of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (an enhanced port of the Wii U game) as though I'd been playing on Switch for years. Nintendo's portables have always been solid — I'd go so far as to say some have been virtually indestructible — and the Switch feels like it follows in that tradition. The Joy-Con snap satisfyingly into the Switch or the grip, and won't budge unless you press a dedicated button to release them. Some of the more interesting games on their way to Switch, however, require you to hold a wireless Joy-Con in each hand. Arms is a one-on-one fighting game where each combatant has springs for arms and flings his or her fists around will jumping, dodging and weaving to avoid being hit. The sensitivity of the Joy-Cons is really on display here, as every slight tilt, flick and thrust is registered as an in-game action. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link At launch, the console will come with either grey Joy-Con controllers or a neon red and blue pair.  Nintendo is so confident in its Joy-Con controllers that another game, 1-2-Switch, encourages you to play without even looking at a screen. A variety of mini-games each show off a function of the Joy-Con by having them stand in for a different object — a box full of marbles, a gun, a sword, a cow's udder, a sandwich or a table tennis paddle — and the result is as impressive as it is ridiculous. As fun as all these very Nintendo games are, I was relieved to see that, when attached to a TV and used with a traditional controller, the Switch was indistinguishable from any other home gaming system.

Like a gaming laptop, the Switch holds back when it's running on battery power but operates at its full potential when plugged in. Obviously performance will differ from game to game, but Mario Kart 8 is a good example of how this will ideally work. On the console's 720p screen, the highly-detailed game looks great and runs at a flawlessly smooth framerate. When plugged into the dock, the machine ratchets up the processing power to display at a full 1080p while maintaining that same level of performance. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Up to eight consoles can connect wirelessly together for multiplayer gaming, although you'll usually do this in handheld mode, not with eight TVs. Photo: Tim Biggs Looking at a game like the new shooter Splatoon 2, the options for how you want to play are significantly broader on Switch than on any other device. You might get competitive online at home on the big screen, get some practice in on the bus, or meet up with some friends to fight it out together. Up to eight Switch consoles can link together wirelessly for local multiplayer. As flexible as they are, the compact form of the Joy-Con won't be ideal for every game — the shallow control sticks and placement of the tiny buttons makes it a bit cramped for shooters, and there is no D-pad which means it felt wrong to me when playing Sonic Mania — but they make for excellent portable controls and a fine standard pad. Serious players have the option of buying the Pro Controller — which is more or less an Xbox-style pad but with the same sensitive motion-sensing found in the Joy-Con — for long sessions of solo gaming. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Games look great in handheld mode, even though they're technically at a lower resolution than on the TV. Photo: Tim Biggs Having a variety of control options isn't anything new for Nintendo, but where the Wii U's hodge-podge of different inputs made things difficult for game developers and players alike, the Switch takes a much smarter approach. There is only ever one screen on at a time, for example, and the different Joy-Con configurations mean you won't need to buy heaps of different controllers to take up space in your cupboards. The price of play Battery life has been one of my primary concerns since the Switch was first revealed and, as you might expect from a machine this small and mighty, the numbers are not great. Nintendo is keen to point out the Switch may last for more than six hours of continuous play on a single charge, but that's absolute best case. Photo gallery 12 games coming to Nintendo Switch If you're playing the demanding Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the company says you should only expect three hours. The good news is that Switch uses the standard USB-C — so cables and portable chargers made for phones will work to top it up on the go — but it's fair to say Nintendo has compromised on battery life in order to make a machine powerful enough for console gaming. My other primary concern was storage, as a portable this small obviously isn't going to be packing a huge hard drive. Thankfully, although the Switch has a meagre 32GB on-board, you can buy a standard microSDXC card to expand that (Nintendo says theoretically you could use up to a 2TB card, but the largest you'll find in stores right now is 256GB). Unless you buy all your games on cartridges and download nothing from the online store, a decent card will be pretty much mandatory. Which brings me to the price. In Australia the Switch will cost $469.95. This is a lot of money to be sure, but since it includes the console, two Joy-Cons, a grip and the TV dock, I feel it's a fair price. But add a 64GB card ($50) and a Pro controller ($100) and things start to look quite expensive. Down the line you might also need a second pair of Joy-Con ($120) and a charging grip ($40), or another TV dock ($130) so you can move between your lounge and bedroom. These are all optional extras, of course, but it brings the price of the ultimate Switch experience to about the same as a premium smartphone. Can Switch compete? Nintendo wants the Switch to cover all its dedicated gaming bases for at least the next five years. It will be home to the next blockbuster Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Pokemon and Metroid games, while also providing plenty of funky inputs for experimental touch and motion games. At the same time, its processing power and ability to mimic a standard console or handheld is a clear attempt to get game-makers outside of Nintendo involved. As is common with hardware launches, many of the slated games not made by Nintendo have either come to other platforms previously or will release simultaneously on Switch and others. Yet exclusives may matter less than usual if Nintendo can sell gamers on the idea of playing anywhere and with anyone. Games like Sonic Mania or Stardew Valley will benefit hugely from the Switch's versatility, as will many multiplayer games, so I could see myself opting for the Switch version of some games (or re-purchasing the game on Switch) instead of playing on PlayStation or Xbox. But the distance from here to March 3 is a long time in the video game business, and Nintendo still has a bit to prove. Talk of social integration and parental controls via dedicated smartphone apps is promising, but solid details on the system's interface and online subscription service are still forthcoming. 10 comments Log in to comment New User?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Captain honored during last Apple Valley Town Council meeting as sergeant at arms Sunday Jan 15, 2017 at 4:12 PM Jan 15, 2017 at 4:12 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department Capt. Lana Tomlin was honored for her service Tuesday, during her last meeting as the sergeant at arms here. Both the Town Council and Ross Sevy, representative for 33rd District Assemblyman Jay Obernolte, presented Tomlin with plaques and thanked her for her service. Never one to favor the limelight, Tomlin joked about what Mayor Scott Nassif called an “impromptu ceremony” in her address to the audience. “I got an agenda and there was nothing about any presentation, and that might have been purposeful,” she said. “The reality is I don’t necessarily like the attention on me.” Tomlin went on to thank her colleagues, as well as town staff and the citizenry. “I’m in awe of the hard work and dedication of the Sheriff’s personnel that make up the Apple Valley (Sheriff's Station),” Tomlin said. “But I do want to thank the Council, and I want to thank town management, specifically Frank Robinson, and the citizens of this community for making this one of the best assignments of my career.” A 26-year veteran of the county’s Sheriff’s Department, Tomlin was promoted to deputy chief of all desert region stations in December. She was promoted to lieutenant in 2007, according to a previous Daily Press report. Tomlin transferred to the Apple Valley station on Jan. 1, 2011, and was promoted again, but she remained in the town after being named captain. Nassif previously told the Daily Press crime rates fell in the town during a six-year period under Tomlin’s guidance. On Tuesday, he said the departing captain was instrumental and important to Apple Valley. “We’ve appreciated everything you’ve done for our community,” Nassif told Tomlin. “Hopefully that led to good things for you, and this (plaque) is in appreciation for your commitment and dedication (to) the Town of Apple Valley for providing (for) the lives of our citizens.” Tomlin’s replacement, Capt. Frank Bell previously served as lieutenant in Apple Valley. Most recently, Bell served as captain of the department’s Employees Resources Unit in San Bernardino. Tomlin's transition to headquarters is scheduled for Jan. 21. Matthew Cabe can be reached at MCabe@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6254. Follow him on Twitter @DP_MatthewCabe.

Tech rogue Peter Thiel thinks so, telling the New York Times this week that he believes "the age of Apple is over." "We know what a smartphone looks like and does," said the Facebook board member, PayPal co-founder, chess prodigy, and Trump transition team member. "It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation." Loyal fans agree, citing lackluster "improvements," a lack of innovation, and a year that saw sales fall for the first time since 2001. As Apple celebrates the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, the company appears to have gone into "maintenance mode" while everyone waits for its next big thing to emerge — if ever. Ronan Timoney, a 23-year-old economics and finance student in Ireland, has had Apple laptops since 2010, iPhones since 2011 and an iPad since 2012. As a young, avid Apple user, he's exactly the kind of customer the company should be wooing for their long-term success. But his most recent smartphone purchase was an Android.

"Their products have become fashion accessories rather than high-powered gadgets, and prices now outstrip quality," said Timoney. He "will not be buying any Apple products for the foreseeable future," he said. 2016 was a particularly rotten year for Apple. Annual sales fell for the first time since it launched the iPod in 2001, going from a record $234 billion in 2015 to $216 billion. Its new lineup of MacBook Pros this year failed to impress. The best thing about the iPhone 7 is its camera. It also forced users to invest in $159 wireless AirPods, which had a delayed launch, or use an awkward dongle to use their old headphones. Not very "Appley." Core Products for 2017 And what's in store for 2017? Reportedly three new faster iPad models in different sizes as the company tries to fend off other touch-screen phones and computers, but iPad units have declined in 10 of the last 11 quarters. Instead of "thinking different" the company is "thinking slightly better." To be sure, "Apple is a great American success story," but, "a lot of that innovation came from the Steve Jobs era," said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners known for his bearish views on the company. CEO Tim Cook is an efficient caretaker but doesn't necessarily have the late Steve Jobs' "founder's fire" that can propel a company past the threshold of what was thought to be possible, said Gillis. "Amazon, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Facebook, what do they have in common? They're all still driven by their founders. They're still able to make big bets and change directions. Is Apple positioned for the next thing?" asked Gillis. Related: Apple's Poor Performance Takes a Bite out of Tim Cook's Salary That's the big question as longtime users and investors wait to see where the company's $2 billion annual increase in research and development has been going and on what acronym it might it plant a flag next. AR? IOT? VR? AI? "What you're seeing is a point where Apple is making a slower transition away from being a company that historically came out with whizzbang products every couple of years to a company that makes great products we all need," said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures, who previously covered Apple as a Piper Jaffray analyst for over a decade and remains bullish. "As they shift resources, you get what happened in 2016: Not that exciting of a product year." Who's Driving Innovation? He thinks the next big things for Apple will be whatever it decides to do in the car space, artificial intelligence, and, according to the kind of Apple rumors that used to capture fanboys' and pundits' imaginations, a foldable phone with bendable glass. But it won't be Apple making the device, countered Gillis. "They're not driving the innovation... Samsung will be the ones who make it." Even hardcore Apple users say they've noticed a change. Apple is becoming more like Microsoft, a former wunderkind that became large, profitable, boring, and angered pro users. Is Microsoft the New Apple? As a Mac user, I.T. manager Dan Fox is used to standing out at his PC-filled office at an Orlando-based engineering firm. "Apple made these gorgeous, sleek, shiny devices that looked like they were from the future," he told NBC News. "They were cooler than anything else on the market and, more importantly, they actually worked better," said the 45-year-old Fox. His family members are all Apple fans too, and their house is full of MacBooks, Apple Watches, iPads, iPhones, Apple TVs, and he even sprang for the AirPods. As of late though, the "cutting edge" upgrades to the Surface and Office 365 have him considering that Microsoft might be becoming the new Apple, with well-built and innovative products, he says, that show an attention to details. He still loves Apple, but says he feels "Improvements are iterative, and it's almost as though Apple is now relying on its brand more than its tech. It feels like they are stalling on innovation to squeeze one more model out with a tiny upgrade. Rinse. Repeat. Things are starting to feel… stale."

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Why Apple is making its original TV content push now Dan Moren 16 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Everybody’s getting into the content game these days, and from a report in the Wall Street Journal this week, it appears that Apple is no exception. The company is said to be planning a major push into original TV programming, looking to produce “critically acclaimed programs like Westworld on Time Warner Inc’s HBO or Stranger Things on Netflix.” This is on top of the previously announced continuation of James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke series (albeit without Corden himself) and the rumored Dr. Dre-produced scripted show. So why is Apple, which has often enjoyed solid reputations with media companies, looking to throw its hat into the content ring? Isn’t this veering away from the company’s core mission of creating products that surprise and delight its customers? What exactly is Apple’s goal here? Video helped the radio star? From the Journal’s report and what we’ve heard about Apple’s plans to date, it sounds as though all of the originally produced content will be made available to subscribers of the company’s US$10-a-month Apple Music service. That’s a huge amount of added value for current subscribers, who (as far as we know) won’t have to pay any more to access Apple TV shows, but it also provides a good opportunity to attract more customers to the service. It also helps Apple Music catch up to competitors like Spotify, which offers some original video content, and Amazon, the yearly Prime subscription of which includes tonnes of video and throws in music for an extra fee. Besides obviously meaning a chance to bring in more recurring revenue, adding exclusive video content to Apple Music (which might subsequently need a rebranding) also provides a regular incentive for more customers to sign up, since the company will presumably roll out new shows every once in a while. And if one of those shows happens to become the water-cooler series that everybody’s talking about – like, say, Westworld or Stranger Things – well, a lot of people will want to sign up just so they don’t miss out. The halo effect There’s nothing new about Apple selling content, of course. The company’s more or less been in the business since 2003, when it launched the iTunes Store. At the time, and for many years after, Apple was adamant that the store existed primarily as a way to get more people to buy iPods, since for a long time they were the only devices that were compatible with content from the iTunes Store. Meanwhile, as Apple said during its financial check-ins, the store itself was operated on a slightly better than break-even basis. Of course, that’s no longer the case, especially since the App Store came into play – from the little that Apple breaks out of its financial results, the store now regularly operates at a solid profit. The same opportunity exists for Apple Music and video content, though. Obviously, if Apple’s devices are the only ones where you can get the shows (and though Apple Music exists on Android, I’d be surprised if it got access to original Apple content right away), then it provides a powerful argument to buy Apple devices. Would that make a major dent in Apple’s bottom line? Hard to say. But it could provide a nice bump for the Apple TV and the iPad – and it certainly wouldn’t hurt iPhone sales at all. Speak softly, but… There’s one more reason to get into the original content game from a business perspective, though it’s perhaps a bit more petty than Apple often seems to be: sticking it to all those traditional networks and studios. Look, Apple’s reportedly been trying to get a video streaming service off the ground for what seems like years now, and it’s found itself blocked more than once by those content partners who are determined to hold onto their dwindling business model. Even features like the single sign-on that launched for iOS and tvOS late last year have been slow to pick up support, despite the ease it would offer consumers. So, in the tried and true ethic of Apple, if you want it done right, do it yourself. Rather than sitting around and waiting for the networks and studios to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century – or, worse, creating their own siloed content services, à la CBS – Apple gets the opportunity to do streaming on its own terms. Granted, that may mean that those content providers are less enthusiastic about doing business with Apple, especially since their own shows would presumably take a backseat to Apple’s prominent marketing of its in-house efforts, such as in the new TV app that’s now front-and-center on Apple’s set-top box. But at this point, it seems that Apple’s never going to get exactly the concessions it wants from the studios and networks, so why should it hold itself back? Clearly there are plenty of benefits to Apple developing its own content, or at least giving it a whirl and seeing how it goes. Of course, all of that depends on a single question, which we probably won’t see answered for a while yet: is Apple’s content any good? We’ll have to watch and see.

Opinion | 07 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (103) Tell Us Your Mac Automation Stories by Adam C. Engst The news that Apple had laid off Sal Soghoian, who has been a fixture in the world of scripting and automation for decades, hit hard at MacTech Conference back in November. Although Sal hasn’t been making as many public appearances as he used to in the days of Macworld Expo, his indefatigable efforts to promote user automation inside and outside Apple have had wide-ranging impact. Sal worked tirelessly within Apple to encourage support for AppleScript and Automator (among much else), and to ensure that Apple apps provided the necessary scripting dictionaries and Automator actions. He was long a champion for the user, believing that users know best what they need to do and that automation technologies were essential for enabling users to create and streamline their own workflows. What should we make of Sal leaving? Apple didn’t lay him off specifically, it instead eliminated the position of Product Manager of Automation Technologies. It’s my understanding that multiple groups within Apple wanted to hire Sal afterward, but Apple was under some sort of hiring freeze that prevented him from migrating within the company. So it doesn’t look as though Apple was trying to get rid of Sal personally, which is good. What’s less good is that it would appear that Apple doesn’t see the need for having a position that evangelizes user automation. A 9to5Mac reader sent email to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, to ask that Apple not kill AppleScript and Automator, and was told “We have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS!” Federighi’s response prompts the question of whether Apple’s future actions will bear out his statement. It may be overreaching to read too much into his precise words, but “intent” is an aim or a plan, not a guarantee. And “support” can mean “maintenance mode” rather than “advancing the state of the art.” Regardless, eliminating Sal’s position isn’t a step in the right direction. Sure, Apple could have plans to replace AppleScript and Automator with super secret magic unicorn technologies, but based purely on what the company has done and said, it’s hard to believe that. It wasn’t always like this. The reason AppleScript survived the purge of products and technologies after Steve Jobs returned was that Jobs understood the importance of automation to key Apple markets, like publishing, finance, and TV and film, not to mention the enterprise and IT worlds. These industries live and die by custom workflows based on AppleScript and other automation technologies built deep into macOS. Jobs personally approved the inclusion of Automator in OS X, and he enabled and supported adding AppleScript as a development language to Xcode. And it was because of his support that Apple’s automation team went on to develop AppleScript/Objective-C, script libraries, and JavaScript for Automation. But the Apple of today is an entirely different company, focusing as it does on the iPhone and iOS. Even so, it’s obvious to anyone who uses iOS that there is still an important role for automation. I can tell Siri to “Change ‘Floating’ to 8 AM” to adjust the time of my wake-up alarm, but I have no way to automate the five taps necessary to play the audiobook we listen to every night in the Hoopla digital library app. Five wasted taps every night isn’t the end of the world, but if you can’t automate the little stuff, you certainly can’t automate the big stuff. If Apple’s seeming indifference toward automation worries you because you rely on scripts, macros, workflows, and more to get your work done quickly, effectively, and accurately, here’s what I’d like you to do. Leave a comment on this article outlining how you depend on Mac automation tools in your job. If there are too many examples to fit in a single comment, just focus on those that are the most important to you. I’ll compile all the comments and publish them as a future article, and I’ll also send a copy to Craig Federighi and Apple CEO Tim Cook so they see concrete examples of why we need these automation technologies to continue to evolve. To kick things off, here’s my most important bit of automation. When it comes time to publish a new or updated Take Control title, I start with three versions of the book: a PDF, an EPUB, and Mobipocket file. A copy of each must be stored in several locations on our internal file server and uploaded both to our Web server and to Amazon S3. Plus, the uploaded versions must be renamed precisely according to an algorithm that’s replicated on our server, so the site can update itself and serve the correct files based on the presence of properly named uploads in the right directories. When I used to do this by hand, it took 15–20 minutes, and I ran the risk of renaming a file incorrectly or uploading to the wrong directory. (And making a mistake meant that I had to spend even more time figuring out what I’d done wrong and fixing it.) Now that I have a series of Automator workflows performing these tasks for me, it takes me just seconds to initiate the uploads, and there are never any errors. So that’s my automation story — tell us yours! Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of Automating Your Mac If you use copy and paste, you’re taking advantage of an important shortcut. But did you realize that the Mac offers dozens of shortcuts that make tedious tasks quick, accurate, and repeatable?

It's just pure magic how I can get first and third party apps to collaborate to do just about anything. For instance, I can have the Finder duplicate/rename 300 screenshots, send them to Pixelmator to crop, and then Transmit to upload to my server. It's just a pain in the neck to do it by hand and honestly, it's nothing short of magical having all these apps work together to complete my task for me. Reply Tommy Weir  2017-01-09 14:05 I have a custom naming approach for all files on my system. And every year, they are sorted into relevant groups and archived off using the automator actions which the developers of DevonThink Office Pro provide. It's a simple thing, a folder is monitored, files are imported and tagged. But the knowledge that the organisation is done and it's consistent year in and year out. I can't tell you what that means for my peace of mind in my business. 2. My son uses folder actions all the time, resizing images, converting and renaming them for different use cases, it's like his party trick for employers while he's studying in Boston College. 3. I use a combination of Automator, Hazel and Keyboard Maestro together with some scripts I picked up online to keep my computer organised. These various tools move files around to their rightful folders, rename files to my standardised system, save email attachments and move them to the right folders, clear up strays that land here or there, archive off application installers and delete old files that are backed up and not in use for some time. Reply Chuck Shotton  2017-01-09 15:03 Well, in a nutshell, most of the Web industry on Mac OS in the early days of the Internet would not have existed if not for Sal's work with AppleScript, AppleEvents, scriptability/recordability of applications, AppleEvent Dictionaries, the Script Editor, and the concept of scripts as runnable applications. Every external extension created for MacHTTP or WebSTAR, Userland Frontier, and all of the other HTTP servers on the Mac depended exclusively on these technologies. It was how applications talked. It's still how they should talk, but Apple (NeXT) seems to have never embraced it as they should have. Even the newest incarnation of MacHTTP, MacHTTP-js, depends on a slew of AppleEvents to do its job. Let's hope this great legacy isn't lost just because it doesn't work on iOS... Reply Anthony Reimer  2017-01-09 15:39 I use AppleScript and Automator for automating actions in the Finder. Some common things I have created that I use at work: • Clean the desktop of shared computers. • Automate server connections. • Take any downloaded dmgs and move them to an Installers folder automatically (using Folder Actions). • A service that opens the current URL in a specific browser (e.g., if a page needs Flash, open it in Chrome). I also use it as an integral tool to integrate with FileMaker Pro. (e.g., export text data from FileMaker to a file, have BBEdit clean it up, then upload that edited file to a web site using Fetch — AppleScript + FileMaker scripting can make this a single step for the user). The Mac Admin community is all about automation for both the efficiency that comes from it and the consistency of result. While Python and shell scripting are core to that automation, I know I still put Automator and AppleScript to use on a regular basis. Reply Anonymous   2017-01-09 15:51 For 16 years now approximately 15 times a year I do financials based on a series of companies. The workflow I've created reduces 21 pages of reports to a readable 4 and about 90 minutes of my time to 20. That's roughly 16 * 15 * (90-20) = 16,800 minutes or 280 hours or 35 work days or 6 work weeks of my life. That's time with family, time doing other work things, time that I am not simply throwing down the hole of clicks and points. Thank you for HyperCard, AppleScript, Automator and anything else Apple can provide to give me more time! Reply Paul Ellis  2017-01-09 16:21 Which Mac automation stories? Back in the day, when I regularly had tasks that merited automation, I used QuickKeys. Nowadays I use Hazel for the few regular automated file-handling tasks I have. I've found that on those comparatively rare occasions when I have a repetitive task that could do with automating, Automator invariably lets me down. It's quicker to complete the task manually rather than trying to bully Automator into action. Here's an example: automating iTunes playback. I leave iTunes running when away from my house for an extended period, to stop the place appearing to be empty. A few years ago I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to use Calendar to automate playback, but then found the Calendar events I created didn't 'travel', but had to be created afresh every day. I can no longer be bothered with this palaver: I simply remote in with Teamviewer and manually toggle playback. Welcome to C21 Mac automation, conspicuously lacking in usability and utility. Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-09 16:33 One of the hardest things with automation is picking the right tool. For what you describe, I'd use Keyboard Maestro, which can really easily play random music from iTunes at specific times. Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:31 I work at a small newspaper and we depend on AppleScript. The most important is one AppleScript that creates working pages from a master InDesign file. It applies the right styles, sets the date of the edition on each page, sets the page numbers and saves a copy to disk with an appropriate, dated filename. This was written almost 5 years ago and has prevented many mistakes, not least with incorrect dates going to print! Previously staff would duplicate an old page — risky for many reasons. On the other end, we use AppleScript to reliably produce the PDF files for use by our printers, custom settings and all. Other things we’ve done with AppleScript include scripting BBEdit to fix common mistakes in stories, retrieving and setting weather forecasts, TV listings, football fixtures & scores, creating the barcode (and checking it is correct — an occasionally major problem before). Newer stuff is often in Python but with an AppleScript interface. Code here: https://github.com/ppps Reply Rob Wells  2017-01-09 17:21 Oh, and that's just AppleScript. There's all sorts of stuff we do with Hazel and Python scripts run as LaunchAgents (through Lingon). Our newsroom is an all-Mac office and on occasion in the past a member of staff has suggested buying cheaper Windows machines. Alongside the longevity of Macs (most of ours are almost 10 years old), automation is always the big reason I give for why we would be worse off. My understanding is that bigger newspapers have software written for them to handle this stuff, which we could never afford. Mac automation technologies have enabled us to do it ourselves in-house. Reply Mike Warren  2017-01-09 17:57 I'm so old I remember when the whole reason for having a computer was automation . I consider AppleScript a programming language. I've created programs for record keeping, budgeting, a foreign language dictionary, flash cards. I use AppleScript for a daily email message to my partner (it pulls info from flat-file databases, Calendar.app; assembles a message, sends it via Mail.app, saves it as my Safari home page.) I have so many little scripts and Keyboard Maestro routines that I feel hopeless when I have to use someone else's Mac. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:00 Keyboard Maestro, with an accompanying mix of Apple Script and shell scripts, is a wonderful glue for web applications with lacking APIs. After a recent migration between institutional repositories (for academic publishing) hundreds of full text files where missing because of a bug in the new systems import script. There were no APIs for uploading new files to existing records in the system, and some manual steps were required in the upload form, but the automation tools allowed me to reduce each process from maybe 30 error prone clicks in both of the applications and Finder to about three clicks per record. It saved me several hours of tedious work. Reply Daniel  2017-01-09 18:12 Another error in the same migration required me to verify the order of attached files in both of the systems, also for a few hundred items. By automation I could with a single keyboard shortcut navigate to the next item in a list of IDs, find the record in both of the systems, then open all attachments in order in new windows and tile them on the screen in two columns allowing me to see differences at a glance. If in order, a new click got me to the next item, else I could handle the error before moving on. Reply Thomas Tempelmann  2017-01-09 18:54 As a developer (for apps such as Find Any File, iClip and iBored), I recently have started using Automator and AppleScript to assist my customers when they have some technical troubles and are not too computer-savvy. I have scripts to collect files I need to look at, fetch system information, email them to me, or copy, move and delete files to fix some of their setups. And just the other day I used AppleScript to verify a slow memory leak in one of my apps, which required 1000s of mouse moves. With AppleScript, it took me 15 minutes to write the code, then have it perform its task for about one hour to cause the issue that otherwise took users days or even weeks to run into. A few hours later, and I managed to identify and fix one of the most obscure bugs I had for a long time in my app. Also, I'm happy to have spent the money on Script Debugger, which makes writing AppleScripts much less of a pain, indeed :) Reply gastropod  2017-01-09 19:43 Currently my main automation use is somewhat indirect. To tolerate Mail.app at all, I've found Mail Tags and Mail Act-on to be indispensable. They do a lot of automating for me by greatly expanding the filter tests and actions available, and by allowing for single key actions such as moving selected messages to a folder without having to drag through the folder tree. Since I run a majordomo server and several mailing lists, intricate mail sorting is a lifesaver. In the past, I used Quickkeys to remap the keyboard and add macros to music software such as Finale. Saved me hours a week and a lot of frustration. I'm planning to dive into Keyboard Maestro soon, partly to improve the modern Finder window handling train wreck. which costs me at least an hour a week in getting windows back where they're supposed to be. Reply gastropod  2017-01-12 22:21 I entirely forgot the services I created with Automator a few years ago to do routine exif handling. Automator calls on exiftool to show all metadata in BBEdit, strip all metadata, strip all but a few exif/iptc fields, alter GPS data, etc. Not only do they save some effort when used, they save the time it takes to periodically check the exiftool docs, since it has so many options I can never remember them. It's also much easier than the command line to do things to an ad hoc file selection. Reply Naomi Pearce  2017-01-09 19:49 Early in the days of Automator, Sal made a comment, something about it changing the way applications work together where you don’t have to learn the application, just find the action for the feature you want it to do. I looked at him sideways and thought, “yeah, right, okay buddy.” Some time later, I had worked on a proposal for several days (days because it involved a fair amount of PR-101 that had been requested), finished it, print-to-.pdf and sent it off. I followed up on it the next day and Andy Taylor of MacSpeech, Inc. said “well, yes, he’d received the Executive Summary and looked forward to the rest of it.” Wait, what?! Print-to-.pdf was something one took for granted, particularly from Word, and I opened the document and sure enough, it had not printed the whole document to .pdf, just the first page. I could get it to print page 1, or print from page 2-on, but not the whole document. Minutes were ticking by, and panic ensued. I was screwed. Or was I? I remembered what Sal had said about Automator and fired it up. I clicked on “workflow” to create a workflow. I used the search and found an action to combine PDF pages and dragged it over. Clearly, it needed to know what PDF pages to use to combine, so I found an action to Get Specified Finder Items and dragged it on top to make that happen first. Then I found an action to open the result up so I could see it (open finder items, I think it was called), and dragged that action below Combine PDF Pages. That’s all I could think of needing to do, so I dragged the page-1-only document and page-2-on document into the first action, and hit run. No more than 15 minutes after I first thought “what?!”→ just like magic → problem solved. And I never learned the applications, just found the actions for what I wanted to do. I’ll be darned. Wow! Only on a Mac. Reply Walt Jump  2017-01-09 20:21 I use Automator to routinely download specific files from government databases, rename them, and move them to specific folders for use by my FileMaker databases. This saves me at least 1-2 hours a day. I also use a program by someone who accesses the PTO databases and provides one file for data obtained from multiple databases by the use of Apple script and Automator. Reply Douglas Mobley   2017-01-09 21:08 The museum where I volunteer has a project to digitize old newspapers to aid the searching of them. The workflow, in simplistic terms, consists of photographing each page, processing the pages through Photoshop, and finally OCRing the images into newspaper issues. I had been using Photoshop actions to automate one step of the process but I was able to improve my productivity (measured as pages per hour completed) by more than 50% in the last year, using AppleScript to automate the workflow. Creation of folders and renaming of files is handled by Applescript control of Finder, and the processing of the page images through Photoshop is handled with AppleScript. I have used Automator to record and then understand what system events to include in my Applescript. Reply valm1  2017-01-09 21:10 The ability to adjust things in order for them to suit your needs is a first requirement for computers. That is why I liked Apple from the 1980s, and that is why I stopped using them 20 years later. I still have an iPad, but only two, maybe three apps are actually very useful. The rest is either buggy, full with ads or just plane useless. And the user cannot do a thing about it, unless you jailbreak the thing. No updates for individual apps either, so we are stuck with a buggy iOS emailer. I have never lost so many emails - many days of work. Never been so disappointed with Apple - a total waste of money and, especially, of my time. Reply Jeff Porten   2017-01-09 21:23 I think I've been writing AppleScripts for as long as the language has existed, and I've done a great deal of professional consulting doing one-off AppleScripts for my clients. I'd be lost without it. Most common use cases: 1) an AppleScript that cleans up and organizes my Desktop icons according to a custom grid, grouping them by color tag. 2) a randomizer selection when I have a group of files to read or movies to watch, picks "some item in the current folder". 3) any application missing a keystroke; i.e., I have dozens of one-line AppleScripts mapped to Quicksilver launch keys, so I can hit control-command-3 and label a Finder item yellow. (Then there's "comment and label yellow", which uses the yellow label to remind me that an item has a Finder comment.) Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-09 23:16 I've used Macs since 1986, and our family has owned more than 15, along with assorted iPods and iPhones. With Apple's recent neglect of the Mac lineup, AppleScript is pretty much my last remaining reason for staying loyal: if they take that away, there's little reason for me to stay on the reservation. And if my computer isn't a Mac, there's not much reason for my next phone to be an iPhone. I have a fairly elaborate Home Automation system that is totally based on AppleScript and the XTension program. I love how it makes it easy to control and modify the behavior of the system. I've thought for years that an enhanced version of Automator could finally—finally!—make Home Automation accessible by mere mortals. In my opinion this is a gigantic missed opportunity for Apple. I'm frankly very worried. There are so many signs that Apple has lost its soul chasing shiny iObjects. Reply chrischram@gmail.com  2017-01-09 23:23 I have several Photos libraries on two different disks. I use an Automator app, with a bit of embedded AppleScript, to wrangle these libraries and let me select which one to open. I use AppleScript to collect the data from my weather station and upload it to my web space. It's more reliable than the software that came with the station. I also use AppleScript to massage the weather data and import it to a Numbers spreadsheet. Reply Jake  2017-01-09 23:47 I book several music venues in NYC. I book 100-200 acts per month. I rely heavily on automation, mostly with Keyboard Maestro, AppleScript, a bit of automator, TextExpander, and now also with Better Touch Tool to create app-specific touchbar buttons which trigger my applescripts. For those in doubt about the touchbar, I find it to be the best tool Apple has come out with in years. It's an amazing launcher for all my macros, and I have MANY. It's very powerful! I have actions that add confirmed events to the calendar (BusyCal), send confirmation emails at specific dates/times (much of which is because of a powerful CLI utility called iCalBuddy), resize and reformat images automatically, update web calendars with band descriptions, pictures, links, etc...basically everything I do relies on Mac automation in one form or another. It literally turns hours of work into minutes and allows more music to happen in New York. For me, automation is the best part of using a Mac! Reply Firitia  2017-01-10 01:21 Making netboot images requires automater (or system imaging utility which is just a shell around it). Over history the reability of it has been dubious. In 10.12.2 it is not working: the image source (sierra installer) cannot be found, even if you manually select it. In 10.12.1 it could be found, but the programm crashed anyway when trying to make the image. In 10.12.0 it was working. In 10.11.5 also. But it crashed in 10.11.4, 10.11.3, 10.11.2. Working in 10.11.1 and 10.11.0, but not 10.9.5, and so forth with the ups and downs into the times of the past. (Perhaps I mistake some version numbers, and with some versions it appeared to work on one but not on another computer, but the general idea remains.) In addition to that, when you save a workflow for next time, that next time trying opening it either opens, or it does not at all, or it just crashes the program. Reply Jon Gotow  2017-01-10 00:37 Another developer chiming in here (I'm the author of Default Folder X, App Tamer, Jettison, HistoryHound, and a bunch of other stuff going back nearly 30 years). I use AppleScript in 3 primary ways: 1. For automating processes in my own business, including email parsing and message handling, and software development and testing. 2. For customer support, sending AppleScript applets to customers to help them fix problems or collect debugging information. Having someone run an AppleScript is far more reliable than trying to walk them through a set of steps. 3. Integrating my software with other developers' products. As an example, Default Folder X can detect when Path Finder, a popular Finder substitute, is running and ask it to perform various tasks instead of the Finder - which is exactly what Path Finder users want it to do. That wouldn't be possible (or would be much harder) without AppleScript. Reply DeeAnne Lau  2017-01-10 00:52 AppleScript is used in many of the programs that I use! I am really appalled. I use it to tailor my spam controller program, SpamSieve. I have a Repetitive Motion Injury plus a pinched nerve in my neck. Being able to use scripts to control the Finder or web actions have saved me from much pain. I use A Better Finder Rename applets and use Automator to make contextual services that can be triggered by keystrokes. I use Script Debugger, also, to help me understand the underlying aspects of scripts as I compile them and look for problems. I still rely on some of Dougs Applescripts for iTunes to do things in that (frustrating) program. I use Hazel to manage organization of my downloads and printer folders. I am retired, but I still use my Mac for financial management, communications, learning, and recreation. I rely a lot on AppleScript and Automator. Reply paule  2017-01-10 01:16 I use automator to do mass re-namings of files of photos I take for my son's football team. I estimated once that using automator saves me about 45 minutes per week -- and reduces the error count to zero. Over 14 rounds of footy, that's nearly 11 hours of saved effort. I know I could write a shell script to do the same thing, but Automator makes it easy for me to do (it's been over a decade since I last wrote a shell script!) Reply Felix Deimel  2017-01-10 04:21 I'm using parts of AppleScript to allow users of my professional remote management app, Royal TSX to automate keyboard input. This can range from having a password automatically entered to complex scripts that inject values from their associated connections or credentials. The 10.12.2 update made this completely unreliable as uppercase characters or special characters appearing anywhere in the text can completely mess up the casing. Sometimes it's correct, but it's completely unpredictable and the frequency of errors is very high. I've posted a radar and TSI about this but have yet to hear back from Apple. Here's a copy of the bug report: https://openradar.appspot.com/29182929. One of my customers posted a +1 kind of radar for this here: https://openradar.appspot.com/29825727 If anyone around here is affected by this as well I'd appreciate you "duplicating" my radar.

I know of the existence of Automator, Applescript, javascript, shell scripts and other bizarre animals but am not knowledgeable at writing them. But I find using them to be useful, fun and good for my marriage. When I decided to also implement bootable clones for backup, I attached all clones to my wife's iMac and cloning is done from my MacBook Pro by authenticated traffic. This gives comfort and protection against ransomware affecting the MacBook Pro. I had disks mounted and making noise all day. My wife rightfully pointed to noise and energy bill: a perspective for divorce. But my MacBook Pro's clones are all sitting attached to the iMac, away from CCC and its easy to use automation tools. So I found on the internet "Mount" and "Eject" Applescripts, adapted them to my needs and, to trigger them, use a timer software (Task Till Dawn). Thus these drives are only mounted and doing noise one hour per day, around midnight. Marriage saved ! Thank you Applescript ! Reply Andy Lietz  2017-01-10 08:07 We're a prepress and printing house and we use AppleScript all the time to automatically typeset and alter layouts in InDesign with data from Excel and FileMaker. AppleScript is the "glue" that binds it all together and one of the major reasons we're on the Mac. But as a programming language, AppleScript feels more and more old-fashioned now compared to, say, Python or Ruby. I've met Sal at MacWorld and especially admire him for persuading Adobe to put good AppleScript support into InDesign. It's very sad to see him (and, it seems, Apple's support for automation) leave the company. Reply Bill Cheeseman  2017-01-10 08:26 I was a trial lawyer specializing in major environmental, financial and intellectual property litigation in a large law firm.

Reply Charles Butcher  2017-01-10 09:26 For me, AppleScript as a way for non-programmers to tie applications together is probably the most important differentiator for MacOS. I've been loyal to Apple since my first Quadra 800, but if they abandon AppleScript I'll probably move to Windows or plain UNIX. I run my freelance business on FileMaker Pro. AppleScript lets me create calendar events and to-dos straight from FileMaker, use BBEdit to clean up text from within another application, scan and OCR documents straight to DEVONthink, and a host of other small tasks that over the years must have saved me many hundreds of hours. Sure, AppleScript can be a pain to write, and I've never got on with Automator. But the fact that so many apps support AppleScript, even if only in limited or idiosyncratic ways, is a real achievement. People say the Mac has been "dumbed down"; I've been OK with this so far, but losing AppleScript would be a big blow to professionals. Reply John Cooper  2017-01-10 09:47 I use Keyboard Maestro for window management, application launching, and text expansion, and A Better File Rename for mass renaming of files.

I am in academia, so I’ve mostly developed scripts to automate or help with my teaching and with my record keeping. Initially with Excel, I’ve created a script that would create an Excel spreadsheet formatted and with all the formulas to compute grades putting the precise dates I would teach excluding the holidays. And this would be created by me just copying the webpage where the roster of students for the course is. Then, to take attendance I would use a script that would prompt me with the student name and I would just say “present” or “not here” to have the appropriate mark entered in the sheet (“P” or “A”). Macs had the ability to work with voice command I believe since v 7.5 (my earliest Mac OS version) via the SpeechRecognitionServer. Same thing wold work for entering grades (my office mate decided on a Mac after witnessing me doing both the grades and attendance). After that, I would create from each of my student a web page with his/hers record. I could have 1 or 1000 students and the pages would be created in a flash. I would ftp ( using the Terminal app) to my site and name every file according to their location. Then, to enter grades in the (brain dead) software the College uses to get student grade, AppleScript with Safari and Javascript and I automatically put grades attendance status and last class attended by having an AppleScript that reads the Excel or Number (the one I prefer) spreadsheet data. At the college, at one point the Math Department was creating final exams for remedial level Math courses by getting questions from a 2000+ problems from a MS Word document. This document was divided in various sections. These exams were made by randomly selecting one question from each section. It was a long and laborious process. I was asked to help and from then on we would get all (7 per semester) exams created in less than a minute. They would come already formatted ready for printing. Using Smile, from Satimage (Satimage.fr an AppleScript based developer tool) I have created various QT movies that helped me with teaching, Pre-Calculus trigonometry, Calculus differentiation and integration, statistics distribution, etc. I have created Mathematical libraries for all kinds of Mathematics operations, including Matrix algebra and Statistics Library to help me teach Statistics (much faster and easier to access than R or other scientific software). Using AppleScript and a Mac Mini server Apple could easily disrupt the Education Market by simplifying everyone’s life. It would be cheaper and error free, very likely also more secure and private, without violating any law (FERPA). But hey, who wants to make a ton of money anyway? I’ve created an (AppleScript) app that everyday puts the APOD (apod.nasa.gov) as a background picture of my desktops (I’ve many). I’ve created a script that would search and display the lyrics of the current iTunes song. I use AppleScript to organize my folders, I use AppleScript to apply rules to my incoming Mail. I use AppleScript to generate and save passwords. I use AppleScript… Yes, I would say that Mac automation is the single most important reason I use Macs (actually, now most of my extended family uses Mac because of me). So, yes, Apple should support Mac Automation, because each automation user implies in many others that follows.

The weathercat Macintosh software I, and thousands of others, use has many Apple scripts built into it. Many of us write scripts to enhance automated transmission of weather data to 8 international weather gathering organizations, including the National weather service. Other Macintosh weather software also uses Apple scripts to enhance their products. Apple prides itself in being user customizable. Automator and scripts are the main reason this is possible.

Reply Rob  2017-01-10 10:48 I use Automator, and especially folder actions, a lot. It enables me to add batch capabilities to Photos, and extend its usefulness now that it is surplanting Aperture. I also use scripts to organize email. But much of my automation is now done with IFTTT...I find it amazing (and so, so sad) that while that is growing Apple is apparently headed in the other direction. And it works particularly well with smart home stuff and Echo. Reply Sam Reichberg  2017-01-10 11:36 Sorry, but "hiring freeze" sounds like BS, coming from the most valuable company in the universe and affecting one of its most valuable members. It sounds more like the work of an efficiency expert accountant lurking in the background. Axing automator does not seem just like an isolated incident. It probably reflects the strategic view that Apple computers (including smartphones and tablets) should serve a menu of isolated self-sufficient apps (except for Apple's own apps, of cour$e). Nothing can be further from truth. Switching among multiple apps does not just requires a bunch of extra clicks. Cumulatively it is debilitating and interferes with even the desire to use the appliances. The approach should be just the opposite: make multi-app automation easy and use will skyrocket. Reply Gavin Eadie  2017-01-10 12:25 Wow! A lot of responses, maybe mine's already in there but .. I use AppleScripts for various Finder conveniences. One I rely on daily creates a alias, on the Desktop, to a new folder created in Dropbox every midnight. The folder is named for the date and each day I drop any new material I want to keep into that "today" folder. The script is kicked off by launchd at midnight (+1 minute) and every time I log in. It's not a big deal but I suspect I wouldn't have the personal rigor to do this manually every day. Having set this up fourteen years ago (Dropbox added more recently), I rely on its convenience and the historical record it provides. Reply Aaron Priven  2017-01-10 13:30 Without automation, we couldn't do all kinds of the work we do at AC Transit creating bus stop signs and schedules. Having said that, I would love to stop using Applescript and use either Adobe's Javascript implementation, where we're just scripting Adobe apps, or Apple's Javascript for Applications, where we're also scripting other apps. Applescript, the language (as opposed to AppleEvents and the other underlying technologies), is really hard to work with.

Helpful when your arms ache! Reply Steve Cunningham  2017-01-10 16:25 I think it is a fool's errand to address any comments to current Apple Management. From their actions alone, Occam's Razor suggests that they are phasing out the Mac and OS X no matter what they say. The writing is on the wall. That being said, Applescript is one of the main reasons I own a Mac. I have written hundreds of scripts to make my life easier. Two I would pick to highlight are a Software Marketing and Tracking System and a Dead Man Monitoring System. The Software Marketing and Tracking System uses Applescript, Filemaker, and Mail to automatically track software trials, purchases, channels of distribution, etc. Incoming emails are automatically processed to log purchases, issue serial numbers, create a customer database, and track trial installations. The whole system is driven by email arrivals and requires no manual intervention. This has saved man-years of manual effort. The Dead Man Monitoring system is described in the next post Reply Steve Cunningham  2017-01-10 16:15 (Continued from previous post) The Dead Man Monitoring system is for a paralyzed patient who cannot communicate. It guarantees that help will be summoned if someone doesn't enter the patient's room every two hours. Since I am the sole caregiver, if anything were to happen to me the patient would die of dehydration before anyone found her. The system uses a motion sensitive camera to track entrances and exits from the patient's room. When detected, the camera places a message in a folder which triggers the Monitoring script to log it and reset the Dead Man Counter. The Monitoring Script also runs automatically every two hours and, if there has been no activity, initiates a series of alarms and notifications, first locally and then to a list of external responders. A schedule for which hours are monitored during the day can be set and changed as well as the list of responders. Everything is done with Applescript. The system runs on a UPS protected Mac Mini and uses Launch Agents to monitor itself for failures.

People at the NYT knew I was a Mac and puzzle guy so they consulted with me and I said I could come up with a replacement rather quickly using AppleScript. Now the scripts are used to typeset all their print puzzles, upload PDFs to FTP servers for proofreading, and export various electronic versions for online solving.

I could do this by hand in a couple of minutes, but would I every single day? Nope. I love Applescript.

From simple tasks, to chaining scripts together in workflows to run entire departments, it has proven its worth again and again.

My favourite, but not that impressive, was converting 1400+ files from Excel into an online web help. Half a day of scripting and about an hour of runtime and the whole thing was finished. That's kind of the point. If you can't automate tasks, then it ceases to be a computer. I have no great love of Applescript, but I do think Apple Events was a truly great innovation. My hope is that Swift will provide a way to work directly with Apple Events, without resorting to horrid workarounds. The sooner the better. Reply Nick Morris  2017-01-11 10:42 This would be a great loss. Although I am not a huge fan of AppleScript (I find the syntax annoying and at times impenetrable - I also don't like the lack of good debugging tools) I have nonetheless used it, and Automator, for years for a wide range of tasks. At present, I use a combination of AppleScript and Automator to blog from my Mac and to produce eBooks. I have scripts and folder actions that: • Post Evernote notes to my Wordpress blog (yes, I could use Postach.io, but they have been somewhat unreliable of late) - this requires some PHP in the AppleScript • Pass Evernote notes to Scrivner for eBook production • Pass images from an Evernote note back to Evernote as individual notes for posting to Instagram • Resize images for blog posts • Resize images for posting to Twitter One of the most fun scripts I had (and I found this on the Internet and adapted) automated Keynote to send out a tweet when a slide was shown. The tweet contained the text in the speaker notes for the slide. This script caused a lot of confusion as the audience couldn't work out how I was presenting and tweeting at the same time! Reply Rob Lewis  2017-01-11 12:42 I don't think Apple management is considering the "Reverse Halo Effect" that Brent Simmons wrote about: http://inessential.com/2016/11/21/the_reverse_of_the_halo_effect The idea is that with Apple discontinuing or failing to update so many products (like Airport Wi-Fi routers and external displays), a lot of people who once automatically bought Apple's solutions because they could be depended upon to "just work" are forced to look elsewhere. And if you're looking at other monitors, why not other computers? Why not other phones? The walls around Apple's painstakingly constructed (and very profitable) garden are crumbling, and it won't end well. The likely demise of AppleScript and Automator are, well, another break in the wall.

I'm a photographer and one of my favorite workflows that I have created involves launching an application, called PostHaste, every time I insert a SD with fresh new photos, in my mac, this creates automatically a folder on the server that is renamed with the contents of the clipboard, previously copied from the latest event in my calendar. After this, a new Finder window is prompted to the foreground revealing the newly created folder, next to it Image Capturehas been launched allowing me to drag and drop the new photos into the new folder window. My photos then are automatically renamed by Hazel. Reply Patricia Pfitsch  2017-01-11 16:17 My husband and I run a small transcription business. Our clients are production companies who send us raw film footage they’ve taken for documentaries. We create a written transcript of the film by transcribing what they hear and see—then we we send the transcript to the client. Our clients are usually under a tight deadline so it’s crucial that we can create the transcript fast—often we need to transcribe hours of film and get the transcripts to the client within a twelve-hour period. That kind of speed depends on using AppleScript to create shortcuts for names and other words and phrases that are repeated continually in the dialogue. (You’d be amazed at how many times people say ‘you know’ in conversation.) We also use AppleScript to start and stop the film while we’re transcribing. AppleScript is the key to our success and without it we’d be out of business!

Reply Emmanuel Levy  2017-01-12 05:10 We at quomodo.com have developed a Web Server environment where XML + Applescript somehow are used instead of the widely used mySQL + PHP. Main advantage is, XML is both the database language and the web page language. Thanks to that environment, we are able to develop enhancements and new features way faster and more freely than if we used the usual mySQL - PHP framework. A specific — yet, very simple — cgi sends the http requests to our AppleScript hub (Smile), which in turn sends the hard stuff to some osax (mainly, XMLLib.osax). A herd of Smile apps handle up to 100 requests a second (approximate — I did not measure recently). Our DIY web site system works wonderfully for 50,000+ sites maintained by 100,000+ admins.

And when I switched from my previous note manager to Evernote, I wrote an AppleScript that transferred my old notes, nicely categorized.

Reply Mark Leslie  2017-01-12 11:51 I work for a global sports apparel brand, and we could not match the speed of the marketplace without Applescript and MacOS automation technologies. Many years ago when we first implemented large automated workflows, we absorbed two successive years of +20% increases in product SKUs without the need to scale up existing production art team staffing. Not only that, but the very significant decreases in user errors (typos, component placement, file naming) reduced previously typical rework while freeing proofing efforts to be more focused on essential product details. In all aspects of our business - product creation, preparation of manufacturing visual spec documents, color management, merchandising materials / catalogs, product photography - Applescript and deep cross application connections drive our capabilities. Data from corporate data stores are piped to drive workflows and assign metadata attributes to assets. We use hot folders on servers to drive MacOS purpose built “appliances” running as asset creation engines. Assets created in this way are then transferred to other servers for delivery to another art team. With everything we have in place, and all the successes we have achieved, we still regularly discover new opportunities for automation. I can’t foresee any end to how we can harness the deep reach and power of Applescript, Apple Events, and scriptable applications.

Soon after I started I began seeing opportunities to improve the department's efficiency by writing AppleScripts to automate many tasks that are done repeatedly in the department. From simple scripts to automatically create job folder structures (use many times a day by every department member) to more complex ones that automate processes and interactions with Excel, Acrobat and InDesign. I've even written a basic imposition program for InDesign with AppleScript. These scripts save untold man-hours over the course of a year. It will be a sad day if this ability is ever removed from MacOS. Reply Joern Dyck  2017-01-14 16:43 I once had the task to open and save 5.000 videos on a remote Xserve. Because back then, QuickTime files would only play in a browser after the file was loaded completely. (Today everybody expects that the video starts to play after the first few Bytes have been loaded.) Apple provided a way to prepare old videos for this: just open the file and save it again with the QuickTime Player, unaltered. But nobody can manually open 5.000 files in the QuickTime Player and save them again. With AppleScript, you just iterate through all files in the folder, open them one by one with QuickTime Player and save them again. It's a few lines of code, and the poor Xserve would be busy for some nights. (Because AppleScript is happy to work at night). I have solved many problems like this with AppleScript. Rarely gets AppleScript the credit that it deserves. Reply Chris  2017-01-17 11:24 I provide workflow support to some non-technical artists and creative professionals.

Automated many workflows over the years that preflight InDesign layouts, update links, create press-ready PDFs, automatic FTP transfer of files, also scripts which convert and archive files into organized files and folders which adhere to strict naming conventions. I have automated workflows for our Mobile apps group where print layouts are re-purposed for mobile and online web applications. These automated workflows save hundreds if not thousands of manual work hours to the point where if for some reason a script stops working there is a cry and backlash from the staff who refuse to go back to the old manual workflows. Can't say how much AS has helped. Thanks to Sal for all he has taught and done for the AS over the years. Its hard to put into words. Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-17 14:10 A key feature of AppleScript, which is largely overlooked or mocked, is that it's _accessible_ to non-programmers. The most overlooked feature (or failure to realize the value and necessity) of AppleScript seems to be the ability to communicate with numerous disparate applications within a single body of code to accomplish a complex task. Many prep-press technicians (pre-press primarily in the earlier days) have to "just get things done" any way they can and AppleScript EMPOWERS them to do that. We always use straight AppleScript, never use Automator. AppleScript, for me, _IS_ "Why Mac"?" - it's about being agile. If Apple kills the Mac, they';ve killed our automation. If they kill off AppleScript, they've lost future Mac sales. Much of what we wrote in the mid 90's can still be wrangled with in order to update as needed because the platform has remained stable. If Apple shifts gears on us, they've largely negated the advantages and efficiencies we've enjoyed since 1994. I work for a large commercial printer. Over the last 22 years we have used AppleScript to: 1. Construct entire print production workflows 2. Convert numerous file types to preferred file types 3. Create files for output on systems that were "not Mac compatible" 4. Automate (pre-press) near-line archive storage system retrievals (system 1) (46 GB's in the late 90's!) 5. Automate the archival of and then the retrieval of said near-line archived files (system 2) (over 50TB and counting) 6. Convert proprietarily built EPS files to more output-friendly EPS files using Illustrator 8 & "Scripz" 7. Generate web previews for a web-based print ordering system 8. Batch modify file names from digital cameras 9. Convert exported metadata (XMP files) from Lightroom to other text file formats 10. Work around bugs in Illustrator 8 by reading/altering/re-writing EPS files (late 90's) 11. Convert PMS colors in EPS files to either Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, or Black using Illustrator 8 with "Scripz" then Illustrator 9. 12. Create HTML table-based reports from various data sources 13. We were able to build an AppleScript/QuarkXPress-based automated imposition system that we used for over 10 years (late 90's) 14. Creating and populating Quark files from text files then generating several different forms of EPS and/or PS files based on output requirements, delivering them to remote servers 15. Exchange data with AS/400 via FTP with Fetch and raw text processing (2000) 16. Mount/dismount server volumes 17. Before iTunes existed, I built my digital jukebox using SoundApp and FileMaker - controlled by AppleScript 18. Automate the retrieval of, response to and attachment processing of incoming emailed orders using Entourage (since 2006-ish) 19. Automate the construction of a monthly auto trader magazine using Quark 4 and GraphicConverter, a more free-flow layout (not just dropping images in static locations) with flush-bottom columns, thousands of vehicles in less than an hour, hands-off (2000-2005) 20. Remove the necessity for pre-press operators to use the Finder to create jobs in Quark (v3 - v4) which involves creating a folder structure based on an invoice number, opening the desired Quark template (from thousands), saving it in the new folder, and updating slug lines in the document 21. Automatically check for and copy/install various files and/or folders (pre- OS X) 22. Automate the conversion of Quark files to InDesign including update fonts 23. Automate the extraction of table data from Word and data from Excel, manipulate and save as tab-delimited text files. 24. And numerous other utility scripts to manipulate, machinate and export text 25. Automated file copiers/movers based on an input control text file - part of our imposition proofing system built on-the-fly because something else in the workflow changed and we had to adapt while maintaining productivity. Reply Argyl Dickson  2017-01-17 14:44 We produce hundreds of short video files ranging from as short as 5 or 10 seconds to 5 or 6 minutes. The project architecture we put these assets in requires a .jpg file for the opening video frame and the ending video frame otherwise there is a flash during the start or end. It would sometimes take an hour or more to open up each video file and save out a still frame from the front and end of the video. So I wrote a script that we can now drop hundreds of files on and generate start and end frame .jpg files with the proper name modification and what would normally take sometimes hours is literally done in less then a minute. This is just one example of how applescript has saved me and the clients I work for hundreds of man hours through automation.

Reply David Popham  2017-01-17 18:43 I use AppleScript mainly to automate InDesign and Illustrator, and the big advantage it has over JavaScript is how multiple applications can be tied together in a single script. Data from an Excel spreadsheet can be cleaned up in BBEdit then used to create a graph in Illustrator which can be placed in an InDesign document. Among the things I've done: - created more than 200 country profile sheets containing 13 tables and 13 charts - created a font management system - saved a company that I worked for from having to pay thousands of hours of labor for simply clicking a mouse (opening InDesign files and turning on/off certain layers, checking in/out files in vjoon K4) - processed thousands of Illustrator files for press - reformatted thousands of Word labels for my sister-in-law's real estate business Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:26 In my company we use AppleScripts in our own work every single day, and we often write scripts to help our customers with their various and unique problems. The time saved is enormous. A few examples: when we make appointments, my office manager clicks on the event in the calendar, then triggers a script (via DragThing) that creates emails that go to the customer and to me. The script also sends a text message to my phone. Each day, a script runs at 8:01 AM on my office manager's Mac, scanning the calendar for appointments the next business day. Emails are automatically sent to remind the customers of their appointments. The emails are all exactly as I want them-- never a mistake-- and they go out automatically. I wrote a script for a plastic surgeon. She has a form for new patients on her website. The results of the form are returned in an email. When those emails arrive, the receptionist clicks on them, then runs a script that reads the data and creates a new contact in Contacts. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:58 The script also creates a record in FileMaker, then prints a PDF for the doctor with all of the information presented in the layout she prefers. AppleScript ties apps together, giving a real 1 + 1 = 3 effect. Mail, Calendar, Contacts, FileMaker-- and many others-- can be part of a system held together with AppleScript. I write scripts for my customers who use InDesign and they save a ton of time with them. And, they get great results. For example, a picture on a page needs a caption below. I've written a script that get the width of the picture, then makes a text box the width of the picture and offset a standard amount vertically, then sets the style of the text in that text box to "caption style" (and creates the style if it is not present). It then groups the picture and the caption box, so they can be moved without messing up their relative positions. I'm not the best AppleScripter but I'm able to write scripts that I and my customers use to great advantage. Reply Christian Boyce  2017-01-18 00:59 I think of AppleScript as the Mac's "secret weapon." I love using it to make someone's life a little (or a lot) better. Reply James  2017-01-18 08:07 I use Applescript in our work environment for almost everything. From art preparation, to book creation, to ebook conversion, to file validation, to file distribution. Applescript drives our video management, MathML creation, and cover creation. The cost savings with Applescript are the sole reason my team's work has not been outsourced. The creation of chapter-level ebooks alone saves $1m a year in external costs, and is faster and more accurate than what a vendor can provide. Our Applescript driven page layout system has topped 1.2 million pages and keeps our costs well below industry rates. Simply put, without Applescript and the Apps which whole heartedly support it (like InDesign), my team's output would be a mere fraction of what it is while costing much more. Reply Olle Westbergh  2017-01-18 09:39 Oh no. We rely on Apple automation technologies a lot in our company workflows. If they are eliminated we would be forced to move from OS X to Linux or Windows… Reply Henry Domke  2017-01-18 13:57 AppleScript has been essential for automating some of the tedious parts of file preparation for my art business. The custom application created by Automated Workflows has saved me many hundreds of hours of work. Ray Robertson and Ben Waldie used AppleScript to create the application that keeps us running. It also has reduced errors. Please continue support for automation technologies! Yours truly, Henry Henry F Domke Henry Domke Fine Art Nature Art for Healthcare www.henrydomke.com Reply Larry McMunn  2017-01-18 17:08 In 1993 I bought a new product called AppleScript. I took a chance on it because it promised me — a graphic designer and artist — the ability to automate a lot of my page layout tasks without learning to program. Within two years, in 1995 I was able to partner with one of the largest mutual funds in the world to produce documents using this technology. Over the years, we added more and more financial companies to our client list producing quickly and efficiently tens of thousands of pages annually for these clients. 22 years later we are still using the core ideas and concepts developed back then. The success of our company would not have been possible without the power and flexibility of AppleScript. These documents get typeset and assembled automatically from many sources. Only the power of AppleScript will let us integrate this variety of data sources into a cohesive workflow. Some of these documents are developed from as many as 25-30 data sources. And these varied data sources come from text files, Word Docs, Excel workbooks, and a variety of databases from Filemaker to 4D to giant mainframe entities. Reply Eric Geoffroy  2017-01-19 11:53 It's the one ring that rules them all. With AppleScript I can control the Finder, web javascript, Python, bash. Many of my automated solutions use a diverse toolbox. Instead of a bunch of disconnected scripts, I am able to use AppleScript to push and pull data from these and other programming languages all controlled by a master script. Windows, Linux, and iOS do not have this. It's one of the few unique things Macs can do. Windows has copied everything else that used to make the Mac special. The time savings in automated solutions is huge. I've measured some of our old manual processes that take 2-6 hours and introduce human error. These same tasks have been reduced to 20 minutes. The ratio is 30:1 in some cases. I used to worry my company would make us use switch to PCs which would have destroyed our workflows. I fought against Microsoft Windows for years. Now I fear what Apple itself will do. Reply Rick Pepper  2017-01-19 11:54 Agreed - Apple is becoming their own worst enemy (and ours). Reply Ash  2017-01-19 17:57 A computer that can't be programmed by the end user isn't a computer, it's a toaster. I use Applescript all the time, to reorganize files, crop photos in batches, convert text files into spreadsheets and vice-versa, and to prepare text files for publication. I would hate to lose Applescript - it is the reason I love my Mac. Reply alldritt  2017-01-19 18:01 As the developer of Script Debugger (AppleScript editor/debugger), I have a mountain of automations for my business. I have build automations which compile Script Debugger, collect release notes from our bug tracker, manage software versioning and perform software uploads. As a one-man shop, I need these things to be done quickly and correctly. Back when I did this by hand, there were always errors. I have bug tracking automations that process crash reports and customer support emails in various ways. I have email marketing automations. The list goes on and on. Automation makes it possible for a tiny organization like mine to accomplish what it does. At a personal level, I have many automations for day-to-day life. For instance, my local library sends email confirmations when I borrow books, CDs and DVDs. I have an AppleScript to process these emails and create Reminders for when each item is due back to the library. Reply Hanaan Rosenthal  2017-01-20 17:26 When I was 21 my wife and I had $2500 in the bank. With not even a high-school education I quit my job delivering candy, bought a used Mac II for $2,435, and called myself a Mac Consultant. Within a few short years I was using AppleScript for automating workflows for NYT, Fidelity Investments, Reuters and other large clients. I was not merely improving workflows, I was creating products that could not exist without automation. For example, the financial page and weather charts in the daily NYT paper, which are still being generated daily using my AppleScripts to this very day. Reply Mark  2017-01-23 08:08 I'm not a developer, I work in feature film post production. Since our projects are highly sensitive, all video shared across departments has to be heavily watermarked & individually marked per the recipient. This can be done inside Media Composer, but its clunky, slow, relatively manual & ties up the editing system. I was able to learn & write an AppleScript application which takes Quicktime files & creates FFmpeg commands to convert them to our required formats along with multiple burnins - names, dates, timecode's, even cutting off frame handles using filename data. Many variables are automatically read from the source files. AppleScript then formats all this data for the FFmpeg filters. Drop Quicktime files, choose presets, press encode. The formatted FFmpeg 'jobs' are split into batches and sent to the Terminal for batch processing. All this happens in the background, film editing work continues. The time savings are enormous. Hours per day. AppleScript is indispensable for us. Reply Apta  2017-01-23 23:50 I use an AppleScript for the Mail app to automatically grab the raw source of spam messages and send an email reporting the spam to Spamcop. It's very tedious to do that manually and, when there is so much junk mail to report every day, I would give up if it weren't for AppleScript. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part I: Above, several of my clients and AppleScript Pro alumni have described very cool automated solutions. So I’m discussing Mac automation in general… Like many others, I got my first computer because I wanted to avoid dull, repetitive, manual tasks. Then I realized that although I was accomplishing more on a Mac at work I was still repeating many manual steps every day. The market demands that commercial software must appeal to tens of thousands of users in order to be successful. Consequently, no software does exactly what we need for our own work. To move beyond that, I started making shortcuts with macro utilities to drive the UI, but otherwise my only choice would have been to become a full-fledged programmer and write my own apps from scratch. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part II: Mac automation technologies like AppleScript and Automator provide a “middle way” solution which bridges that gap. I can customize existing applications to do exactly what I need to get done, without creating an entire program from the ground up. AppleScript’s English-like syntax and Automator’s puzzle-piece interface are often derided by traditional programmers. But it is a great solution for people working in deadline-driven production environments, where a user may only be able to focus on automation a few hours a month. In the publishing world, the automation potential is huge. Often a six-week process can be reduced to a couple of days. Companies really need these types of customized solutions, and Mac automation is often the only answer. App extensions must, again, appeal to thousands of users, and while saving some time they end up requiring users to go through the same manual steps every day. Reply Ray Robertson   2017-01-24 10:12 Part III: We must also remember that AppleScript in the hands of an experience script is a rapid development environment. One of my first clients had an IT staff of 40 people, with one group dedicated to text automation and another dedicated to images. Using a Windows platform, major new automation implementations would typically take six months, but not be able provide full automation. Enter AppleScript, where my development would typically take two weeks and be crucial to the workflow. And fixing last-minute problems where other technologies fell short? Typically a day or two. We need these automation technologies to continue because they remain a major advantage to the Mac platform, saving companies huge amounts of money every year, and making the lives of so many users much less tedious. ### Reply Anon  2017-01-24 10:28 I work as a developer on macOS for a large, multinational packaging design company. Amongst other things, I write AppleScripts to automate the laborious parts of the work. When I automate something, I estimate how much time we save per use, then log every use in a database. Its then relatively simple to calculate how much was saved by each app every year. Last year AppleScript based solutions saved us well over £100k. And that's quite puny compared to my old employers' stats. The fact that we can do this is what keeps up buying Macs. If we couldn't, then Windows would start looking like an attractive option to some. As it is, we can say, "Hey! Don't go to Windows or you'll lose £100k plus a year!". Pretty persuasive. I know AppleScript has some pretty big flaws. If you have to get rid of it then so be it, but only if its replaced by something better. Reply Hank Roberts  2017-01-24 16:20 I asked at NASA how to download the full earth imagery from DSCOVR http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/ and one of the scientists there sent me an Automator script I can run that goes to their archive and collects new pictures. I'd never used Automator before and am learning how. Reply Carl Forde  2017-01-25 01:19 I work for a Real Estate marketing company. A couple of our main products are built around our template editor which enables customers to drag n drop images and edit text fields. These changes are transmitted to a Mac running InDesign. A PHP routine updates the IDML and invokes an AppleScript routine that causes InDesign to render the changes and output an updated PDF. This PDF is converted to a JPG which the customer views in their browser. All the complexity of InDesign is hidden from them. All they worry about are their images and text. We can make the templates as complicated as desired and at the end, the customers get exactly the marketing materials they want (the PDF). All because Mac applications have a programmable API. Reply has  2017-01-25 07:45 @Ray Robertson III: [abr] "Using Windows, major new automation implementations would take six months but not provide full automation." That's an endemic cultural problem, not a technological one. Teams of programmers who only know how to program run by managers who only know how to manage. They know nothing of the problem domain and have no interest in learning, yet assert their skill at Teh Codez qualifies them to solve problems in that domain despite repeated failures. I'll take a talented, ambitious artworker—the REAL domain expert—and teach her how to code any day, than try to convince the bureaucratic deadweights of your average corporate development team to change their ways. The former is highly motivated to raise her game; the latter to protecting its turf and resisting change or loss of control. It's not about Mac vs Windows, it's about users vs entrenched interests. And in that respect AppleScript is just as isolated and indifferent to the other 99% as Real Programming is. Reply has  2017-01-25 08:40 Mac Automation is already a FAILED PRODUCT and Apple knows this. They're a $½Tn global business serving ½Tn customers; it has no interest in 10000-user products and kills even successful ones (Xserve, Aperture, etc) with zero remorse. Automation as we know it is already dead—it just hasn't stopped twitching yet: what Apple needs now is a user interaction model that serves the other 99% too. Mac Automation's true value to Apple now is the vast unique insights it offers in shaping what comes next; learning from its failures as much as its successes. Today's QUERY-driven Apple Event Object Model ("scriptable app" interfaces) may be flawed; but imagine a worthy successor as THE cornerstone of our future QUERY-driven Siri world. AppleScript's Pascal semantics and syntactic fakery is a convoluted horror, but issuing simple human readable AND writable AND touchable AND speakable COMMANDS is the next UI/UX Revolution just waiting to happen. Let us teach Apple to see this too. Think Different Reply Ben Byram-Wigfield  2017-01-25 08:20 I write my own PDF Services (available in the PDF button of the print menu) and OS X Services for manipulating PDFs. A Folder Action watches a location, and any PDF placed there gets turned into a PDF of booklet spreads, which is saved to another folder. I have services to split PDFs, join PDFs, turn images into PDFs and turn PDFs into images, count the number of pages in a PDF -- all written using Python PyObjC! I use these services all the time, and without them, my work would be slow and tedious. Reply Doeke  2017-01-27 03:56 In our 50+ people organisation we use AppleScript to automate the creation of Word documents and email messages. Creating word documents with 100+ images is a real timesaver (considering doing this by hand). Also, we keep record of customer data (name, address and some dates), which will be used to fill into the Word documents and mail messages. This way, a lot of errors are eliminated, and we use this info for the billing process too. Besides AppleScript (8000+ lines of code) we integrate python code and a Postgres database.

Supplier Readying for Ramp-Up of New 10-Nanometer Tech This contract-chip manufacturer is expecting to move large quantities of chips built on its next-generation manufacturing technology, thanks in large part to Apple. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 15, 2017 at 1:10PM Contract-chip manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) recently announced its earnings results, provided forward guidance for the current quarter, and provided a lot of insight on the ramp-up of its next-generation chip-manufacturing technology, called 10-nanometers (10nm for short). Image source: TSMC.  TSMC's new 10nm technology is expected to bring performance, power, and area benefits compared to its current generation 16nm technology. Those improvements should allow its customers -- with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) being a big one -- to develop chips with better performance and more features than what they could create with older-generation technologies. On TSMC's most recent earnings call, company executives provided some key business and financial insight around its upcoming 10nm technology. The big bang comes in the second half of 2017 TSMC has previously said that it expects to begin production shipments of its 10nm technology in the first quarter of 2017. On the call, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang explained that, although production of 10nm chips will "start to ramp in the first quarter [of 2017]," shipments will "ramp-up very strongly in the second half. TSMC's Lora Ho later said that revenue from 10nm wafers will exceed 10% of the company's quarterly revenue in the third quarter of the year. For the full year, she said, TSMC's revenue from 10nm wafers will make up more than 10% of the company's yearly revenues -- implying that 10nm shipments during the fourth quarter of the year will make up much more than 10% of revenue. Several mobile-processor makers are expected to use TSMC's 10nm technology in the second half of 2017, including MediaTek (a low-cost mobile chipmaker that aspires to gain traction in the high end of the market), HiSilicon (Huawei's chip-development arm), and of course, Apple. Apple is likely to be far and away the largest customer of TSMC 10nm wafers. Apple's iPhone volume is likely to shift very quickly to the next-generation models powered by 10nm chips, and Apple's iPhone is the highest-volume premium smartphone in the market. TSMC builds the A-series chips that Apple designs for the iPhone, as well as several chips designed by Apple's suppliers. Image source: Apple.  The revenue-ramp profile that TSMC is talking about here -- small volumes in the first half of 2017; large volumes in the second half of 2017 -- is consistent with Apple's established iPhone-release schedule. Great market-share expectations Chang offered some commentary around his market-share expectations for its 10nm technology. He said that, a year-ago, he "vowed then that every new [manufacturing] node from now on will have a market share higher than our market share on 16 [nm]." Chang didn't give a specific market share figure for the company's 16nm technology, but estimated it at between 65% and 70%. He then told analyst Mehdi Hosseini that TSMC is confident that the company's share of the 10nm market would "very definitely" be above 65%." Gross margin impact of 10nm transition Ahead of new manufacturing-technology introductions, TSMC generally tells investors that, as those new technologies ramp-up, they'll dilute the company's consolidated gross profit margins for quite a few quarters. TSM Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. The transition to 10nm will be no different. Chang told investors that the company expects the ramp-up of its 10nm technology to negatively impact the company's gross profit margins by 2% during the second half of the year.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 15, 2017 8:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Tim Cook (right) looks engaged and enthusiastic sitting next to President-elect Donald Trump and Peter Thiel at Trump's tech summit in New York City last month. Drew Angerer/Getty Images reader comments 323 Share this story Apple has a busy 2017 ahead of it. Most credible rumors say the company is launching a revamped iPad lineup in the early part of the year, as well as long-anticipated desktop Mac refreshes. We can always expect a new iPhone in September, and you can bet that Apple will continue making the case for newer platforms like the Apple Watch and the Apple TV, too. Most importantly, the company needs to return to year-over-year financial growth after a disappointing 2016. Last year, revenue fell for the first time since 2001, and Apple missed some of its own internal sales goals. Ordinarily, Apple’s success hinges mostly on the products it announced and those products’ quality. But 2017 has a new and unforeseen variable: President-elect Donald J. Trump. Trump’s journey from dark horse candidate in a crowded Republican field to unlikely nominee to president-elect was powered by unending media coverage and harsh rhetoric. And much of his rhetoric was about American companies and jobs—chiefly, the desire that they bring manufacturing jobs into America and stop outsourcing them to other countries. Apple was a frequent target of Trump’s criticism on the campaign trail. This was the candidate, remember, who encouraged supporters to boycott Apple because of its encryption policies while also condemning the company for building its products overseas. As one of America’s biggest companies, Apple will continue to find itself singled out by Trump. Apple provides a good case study for the ways in which Trump’s stated economic and trade policies could benefit and damage large, multinational tech companies. Those policies combine typical Republican orthodoxy about low corporate tax rates with Trump’s bellicose proclamations about import tariffs. Depending on the way things break, Trump’s policies are going to be a double-edged sword for Apple and any company that relies heavily on overseas manufacturing and the global economy. Apple's jobs In January of 2016, Trump proclaimed in a speech at Liberty University that he would “get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries.” Since his election, Trump has backed away from or moderated his tone on some of the issues he brought up during the campaign, most notably his pledge to investigate and jail Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her alleged mishandling of sensitive information during her tenure as secretary of state and his stated desire to keep money out of politics (several of his cabinet appointees are major donors). Trump has continued to focus on Apple in particular, though. In a conversation with New York Times editors and reporters in the days following the election, Trump claimed to have spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook about building “a big plant in the United States” and about cutting taxes and regulations that would currently keep Apple from doing so (though he didn’t name any regulations in particular). Further ReadingTrump says he’s going to get Apple to “build a big plant” in US Apple manufactures most of its products with a pair of Chinese partners, Foxconn and Pegatron. And while human rights advocates and the press have long criticized the working conditions in these factories, the fact of the matter is that outsourced labor is nearly universal among gadget companies. Efforts to move this production to American shores usually fizzles out, as it did in 2013 when Google opened a factory for Motorola phones in Texas only to close it a year later. In recent years, Apple has done a little experimentation with and research about American manufacturing. In 2012, some of its freshly redesigned iMacs were built in the USA, and, in early 2014, Cook publicly toured an Austin, Texas, facility that manufactured redesigned Mac Pros. Last month, news broke that Apple had allegedly asked Foxconn and others to investigate the costs of moving manufacturing to the US (keep in mind that “investigating” something isn’t the same as planning to act on the findings of that investigation). The vast majority of Apple’s manufacturing still happens overseas, as has been the case since Apple shut down its last Mac manufacturing line in Elk Grove, California, in 2004. Whether Apple will move any significant portion of its manufacturing operations to the United States depends on the specific tax and regulatory benefits a Trump administration can deliver. Tim Cook got where he is by managing Apple’s costs, and Apple’s shareholders are unlikely to put up with any changes that cut too deeply into the company’s revenue. A recent New York Times report highlighted just how entrenched and complex Apple’s Chinese manufacturing arrangements are, and it also described how difficult and time-consuming replicating those arrangements elsewhere would be. Apple’s partners have received and continue to receive billions of dollars’ worth of help to build infrastructure, hire and train workers, and ship products around the globe. You can’t simply uproot that system and move it somewhere else. Trump’s policies may or may not account for this reality. Repatriation and other taxes Further ReadingApple could bring home billions in taxes if US passes a tax holiday Most of the stuff on this list is going to be about a Trump administration’s potentially negative impact on Apple’s bottom line, but Trump and the Republicans pride themselves on being good for businesses and tough on what Trump and GOP lawmakers call “burdensome regulations” and corporate tax rates. Among Trump’s other tax-related promises is his plan to “lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax.” And while the Republican-led Congress doesn’t always see eye-to-eye with Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan similarly lambasts the 35 percent tax rate and points out that “some of our foreign competitors are lowering their taxes rates on businesses as low as 15 percent.” If Trump aims to slash the corporate tax rate, he’ll have Congressional support for it. For a company that makes as much money as Apple does—over $265 billion in 2016 alone, and more than $300 billion in 2015—any significant cut to corporate tax rates would be good for the bottom line. And for Apple in particular, Trump’s tax plan also promises a “one-time tax rate of 10 percent” for companies bringing money earned in other countries back into the United States. This is a drum that Tim Cook has been beating since well before Trump ever announced his candidacy, most notably back in 2013 when he was brought in front of the Senate to testify about Apple’s tax practices. Cook said in September—well before the election, when Clinton was widely expected to win and maintain the Obama-era status quo—that Apple was tentatively planning on bringing its cash pile into the country at some point in 2017. If he can do it more cheaply under Trump than he could under Obama, expect him to jump at the chance or risk the wrath of his shareholders.

Masayoshi Son, whose group has an alliance with Foxconn, promised Trump that they would consider investing in manufacturing goods in the US, to create jobs. There's even been a Sharp executive who spoke with Nikkei Asian review who said that the idea is Mr Son's idea.   Foxconn is thinking of building a manufacturing plant in the US, as the country has a large market for TVs and other consumer electronics - with Foxconn rumored to be considering a huge $8.6 billion investment in US manufacturing.   TSMC are even considering the shift to American soil, with TSMC Chairman Morris Chang talking with DigiTimes that the manufacturing giant hasn't ruled out the possibility of a manufacturing plant in the US. If you think that 65% of TSMC's revenues are generated from chips being made by American companies, it would only make sense for TSMC to consider the big shift to the US.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 29, 2017 Fixing Bugs In A 37 Year Old Apple II Game 16 Comments by: Lewin Day January 15, 2017 Emulators are a great way to reminisce about games and software from yesteryear. [Jorj Bauer] found himself doing just that back in 2002, when they decided to boot up Three Mile Island for the Apple II. It played well enough, but for some reason, crashed instantly if you happened to press the ‘7’ key. This was a problem — the game takes hours to play, and ‘7’ is the key for saving and restoring your progress. In 2002, [Jorj] was content to put up with this. But finally, enough was enough – [Jorj] set out to fix the bug in Three Mile Island once and for all. The project is written up in three parts — the history of how [Jorj] came to play Three Mile Island and learn about Apple IIs in the first place, the problem with the game, and finally the approach to finding a solution. After first discovering the problem, [Jorj] searched online to see if it was just a bad disk image causing the problem. But every copy they found was the same. There was nothing left for it to be but problem in the binary. The revised title screen, with bugfix noted. It’s a tale of disassembly and dredging though decades-old scanned literature. The key to the bug was found in a copy of the Micro 6502 Journal from June 1980. If you don’t want the story spoiled, stop here — the problem came about when someone copied an Apple DOS 3.1 version of the game to an Apple DOS 3.3 disk. The disk formats aren’t backwards compatible, so the 3.3 disk version would only play on a DOS 3.3 machine. However, the game’s code uses bytecodes in the save routine that refer to DOS 3.1 functions that had changed in DOS 3.3. It was by searching for this bytecode that the journal popped up on Google with a hint. The article mentions the changes in bytecodes between DOS versions, giving [Jorj] the clue he needed to solve the mystery. In the end, to get the game to function properly under DOS 3.3, all that was required was to change the code to point to the proper register for DOS 3.3. With this done, the finishing touch was a modified title screen highlighting [Jorj]’s hard work. Credit where credit is due. Kindly, [Jorj] has uploaded the fixed game for the world to enjoy (.gz file download)! It’s always great to see people still working with and enjoying these old systems. The Apple IIGS even got itself an OS update at age 29.

BUG: a problem within code which is found and fixed. Feature: A problem within code which has not been found after 5 years. This has been a feature for a very long time. So this is not a bug fix. It’s a feature change plain and simple! Report comment Reply Apple ][ lurker says: January 15, 2017 at 9:25 am regardless if its a “bug” or a “feature” its a VERY good write up and, may I add, quite inspirational to see such determination! Report comment Reply jorjbauer says: January 15, 2017 at 12:27 pm Thanks! I think it’s fair to say it’s a feature change, although that wasn’t obvious when I started. Unless they actually distributed it on DOS 3.3 disks in this broken state at some point, which seems unlikely. Report comment Reply JoeyJojo says: January 15, 2017 at 11:14 am You sir, are an idiot… Report comment Reply Michael Simonds says: January 16, 2017 at 1:37 am Its not a bug or a feature, its someone corrupting the code. Report comment Reply GotNoTime says: January 15, 2017 at 7:44 am Change bytecodes -> addresses in this summary to make sense. All of the old Apple II stuff did this. They’d jump directly to routines in ROM and the DOS so if the devs weren’t careful, they’d break random programs because they’d end up jumping into the wrong part. A lot of work by Apple was spent keeping all the popular addresses the same when they altered code. Report comment Reply asdf says: January 15, 2017 at 11:12 am Were the programmers doing things they shouldn’t have, or did Apple not have any kind of function dispatch mechanism in their OS? The Commodore Kernal (sic) used a jump table which provided some compatibility across their 8-bit computers. Report comment Reply jorjbauer says: January 15, 2017 at 12:24 pm The latter. This is really early days, bootstrapped off of the history of the Apple I then II. Developers were creative about how to get things done using routines that existed in the ROM. I don’t know that any of them were initially documented. As they became commonly used, Apple worked hard to keep the memory addresses the same for the ones that were most popular — which explains the well-defined dispatch mechanism of the Macintosh. Lesson well learned :) Report comment Reply mime says: January 15, 2017 at 8:14 am good find, and the source has a nice writeup too. Real hacking, good stuff Report comment Reply Jibé says: January 15, 2017 at 9:09 am Great stuff ! I remember one of my favorite Apple ][ games was Robotron, but it was a hard one. So to achieve unlimited game life, I did some research inside the disassembled code and I changed “DEC lives” by “INC lives” at each kill !

Hot Topics: Milo Yiannopoulos Sanctuary city crackdown Lisa Hardaway Leaked email list? Laverne Cox at CU News tips Print   Email   Font Resize How do I get music onto an Apple iPod? By Dave Taylor For the Camera Posted:   01/14/2017 09:30:16 AM MST Dave Taylor For the Camera Q: I got my husband a new Apple iPod for Christmas and we're baffled: how do we actually get the music off CDs and onto the device so he can listen to his favorites? A: You ask a huge, profound question though you don't realize it! The answer will require you either to learn some new digital era skills or spend what could prove to be a substantial amount of money. Dramatic enough? :-) The issue you face is that while the music on a music CD is digital, the disc itself is analog: it's a "physical" thing. The iPod, however, has no analog capabilities and only works with digital content. So you either need to convert your analog CDs into digital form or you need to buy digital versions of the music. All Apple devices work closely with the iTunes program on your Mac or Windows system. If you have a Mac, it's already installed. If you're on a PC, however, you'll need to download and install iTunes from Apple (it's free: www.apple.com/itunes). Your computer does have a CD/DVD slot, right? If so, you're in luck: once iTunes is installed, inserting a CD will automatically give you the option of copying its contents (known as "ripping") into iTunes. That's the analog to digital conversion I mentioned earlier. If you don't have a CD slot, then you're out of luck: if your computer can't read the music CD, there's no way to digitize or rip its contents. Advertisement You might also be reading this and thinking "wait, I need to rip my husband's favorite CDs, one at a time? No thanks!" That's a quite reasonable response. In that case you'll just need to purchase new digital copies from the iTunes Store. You can access the iTunes Store directly from the iPod if you're on wifi and have your device set up, but probably iTunes on your computer will prove easier. Unfortunately, even though you've already purchased the rights to the music or audiobook on CD, there's no way for Apple to verify that, and you'll be paying full price per disc, typically around $10 each. 25 discs can then end up being $250. Suddenly that "rip your existing CDs" solution doesn't sound so bad, does it? My suggestion in this sort of situation is to copy the CDs while you're doing something else, like watching a favorite TV show or cooking dinner. Every so often you'll remember to eject the ripped CD and insert the next. Click on the iTunes buttons as appropriate and soon enough you'll be ready to sync the iPod with iTunes on your computer.

Reuters/Jason Reed Apple fans are expecting great things from the upcoming iPhone 8 as the next flagship is due for a feature-packed launching. This year, the Cupertino-based tech giant celebrates its iconic smartphone’s 10th year anniversary, so it’s only fair to assume that Apple is boosting the iPhone 8 with specs and features not seen on previous models. A new report seems to back that up, as a reliable source says that the new iPhone is certified dunkable. According to The Korea Herald, an insider told them that the iPhone 8 is set to receive an IP68 rating, which means that the upcoming Apple handset can be submerged underwater 1.5 metres deep for half an hour with no problem. As of the moment, only the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are certified with that kind of rating, which is the topmost level of weather protection there is. If the report turns out to be true, this will be a huge selling point for the iPhone 8. Apple’s latest smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, have an IP67 certification, which makes them dust resistant and water resistant. Both phones can be submerged for 30 minutes in one metre of water. The iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus were the first iPhones to equip some sort of water resistant feature, although they weren’t officially certified. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are the first Apple smartphones to have official ratings. Consumers are now considering water resistance as a factor when buying smartphones. While the feature used to be associated with only the most premium of handsets, it is fast becoming common among midrange and low-end phones. Apple rival Samsung recently launched its 2017 Galaxy A series smartphones (Galaxy A3, A5 and A7) that boasted of water resistant features despite the phones’ lower-end status.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Apple is beefing up its "HealthKit" today to keep competitors at bay. That's the service it's developing that will allow health and fitness apps to work together. Reuters has learned the iPhone maker is talking to leading hospitals like Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic and electronic health records provider Allscripts to explore how they can work with HealthKit. Cleveland Clinic says it's experimenting with it and providing feedback. Apple has already tied up with the likes of Nike, data provider Epic, and the Mayo Clinic. As of now, health data from medical devices and software apps aren't centrally stored. Apple wants to put all of that in one place so consumers and healthcare providers can see that more easily. But getting all that together for mobile use won't be easy because Apple will have to confront consumer privacy concerns and satisfy at least half a dozen regulators. HealthKit is expected to be incorporated into the iPhone 6 that comes out in September. Apple's competitors include archrival Samsung, whose latest smartphones and smartwatches can monitor your heart rate and how far you've walked, among other things. One thing that doesn't look too healthy: Apple's and Samsung's sales in emerging markets. Fitch Ratings predicts cheaper handsets from Asian rivals such as Xiaomi, Lenovo, Huawei and Micromax will steal market share from both of them next year, especially Samsung's.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Mon, Jan 16, 2017 - Page 16　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Android creator nearing comeback with Essential Bloomberg Just more than two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team filled with recruits from Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its chief executive officer, people familiar with the matter said. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centerpiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint Corp, people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products Inc with California regulators in November 2015. Late last year, the company registered “Essential” with the US Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and “computer operating software for mobile phones” among its goods and services. It is unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple’s iPhone and Alphabet’s new Pixel reside. It is expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe’s most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google’s robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin’s next venture was a start-up incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality projects. Rubin is convinced artificial intelligence is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. “New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,” he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June last year. “What’s the next platform? It’s about data and people training artificial intelligence systems to learn.” Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least US$300 million from big investors including Hewlett-Packard Co, Google and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密). The latter, known as Foxconn Technology Group (富士康) outside Taiwan, is in talks to manufacture Rubin’s new smartphone, people familiar with the matter said. At least one prototype of Rubin’s phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus’ 14cm, but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The start-up is experimenting with enabling the phone’s screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin’s team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 3010 times.

So the public did what it's always done, and came to see it. "Why is he tossing an apple?" asked a woman strolling through with two friends. "Because it's the Big Apple," one friend replied. The first woman said that she liked the inclusion of the apple. "I'm a dietitian, so that's good." This artwork in question: a 1989 studio photograph by the photographer Michael O'Brien. Trump, in a suit and tie, stands against a blue sky backdrop, an apple tossed from his hand hanging in midair. The portrait is temporary. It will hang in its spot on the first floor until the end of February. It's not an official presidential depiction - those aren't commissioned until the end of a presidential term, and they join the official gallery upstairs only after the pol has left the White House. "It's very witty, and we think a good representation," said David Ward, the museum's chief historian who was on hand to answer questions about the artwork. "It's simultaneously a respectful portrait, but it also references Rene Magritte." (You have seen the Belgian surrealist's most famous painting: man in suit and tie, blue-sky backdrop, apple covering his face). The portrait was already a part of the gallery's collection before the election. "We know Trump liked it, because he used it as the cover of his second book." Starting in a week, Trump's photograph will be displayed in federal buildings all over the country, as is customary. This portrait was an early chance for Washington to grow accustomed to seeing a new, literal face of power.   View Comments Hide Comments Related Content What is an executive order?

How to break free from the Apple ecosystem Antonio Villas-Boas Jan. 15, 2017, 11:00 AM 239,145 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock/Business Insider The iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch make for a great team, as they work with each other to streamline common tasks and make them easier to do. However, there are several reasons you might want to explore other options, like Android phones and Windows computers. Whatever your reason might be, leaving the Apple ecosystem can be a tough thing to do, and you might not find some of the useful features from the Apple ecosystem anywhere else. To make the transition easier, though, here are a few tips to start with:  View As: One Page Slides 1. First, you'll need new, non-Apple devices. The computer. YouTube/HP If you use software that isn't your web browser, your best bet is going to be a Windows 10 laptop. There are several Windows 10 laptops out there you might like at different price ranges. Here are five Windows 10 laptops that outprice the new MacBooks Pros, as well as out-speccing them.  Those laptops I suggest in the link above are pretty powerful, but while they're also pricey, they're still less expensive than the new MacBook Pros. There are a bunch of great Windows 10 laptops in the $700 range that aren't as powerful; those could fit your needs, too.  If 99% of the things you do on your Mac are based in a web browser, you could consider Chromebooks. They run Chrome OS, which is essentially the Chrome web browser, and they can cost a lot less than a Windows 10 laptop. The phone. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider There are a bunch of great Android phones, but if I had to pick one, it would be Google's own Pixel or Pixel XL. It's the purest expression of what Google thinks a smartphone should be, and you'll get the latest Android and security updates directly from Google as they're released, not several months later like the majority of Android smartphones. The smartwatch. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider If you have an Apple Watch, the bad news is that it's not compatible with anything else apart from Apple products. If you must have a smartwatch, go for Samsung's Gear S3 Classic or Frontier. They work with most recent Android smartphones, and they're very good as far as smartwatches go. And if you get a Samsung smartphone, you can use Samsung Pay with the Gear S3, too, which works in pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. Unfortunately, however, you won't find the useful Auto Unlock feature from the Apple ecosystem, which unlocks your Mac computer when you're wearing your Apple Watch.  2. Now, you'll need a new account to transfer contacts, photos, videos, and calendars from the iPhone you're trying to escape from. To move away from the Apple ecosystem means you'll need to adopt a new ecosystem: In this case, it's almost certainly going to be Google. Even if you're using a Microsoft device, you'll still probably going to want to use many of Google's useful services on that Microsoft Windows machine. If you don't already have a Google account, get one. It's the best way to transfer your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, in my opinion.   Download Google Drive on your iPhone to sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars. Google/Business Insider All your data in your iPhone can be easily transferred over to a new Android phone. Follow these three simple instructions on how.  Basically, it's download Google Drive, sign in or sign up, and backup in the app. Then, on your new Android phone, just sign in with your Google account during setup or in Android's settings. Don't worry about your photos taking up all the space, Google Photos offers unlimited and free storage for photos taken with cameras using 16 megapixels or less, and videos filmed in 1080p. If your photos and videos exceed those specs, Google Photos will automatically reduce their resolution. Don't worry, they'll still look great. 3. Now, transfer stuff from your Mac to your new computer. You can use a good ol' fashioned hard drive. Amazon/Seagate Just plug the hard drive in to your old Mac, transfer your files and folders, and unload them into your new machine. This only works for Windows PCs, though; for Chromebook owners, your best bet will be to use Google Drive (more on that in a bit). If you have a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, you get a ton of free OneDrive cloud storage to transfer your files and folders from your Mac to your Windows machine. YouTube/Microsoft Store You get a free terabyte (1,000 GB) of storage in Microsoft's OneDrive if you subscribe to Office 365 for things like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. That should be plenty of storage for all your files and folders on your Mac. To transfer everything, go to OneDrive and log in with your Office 365 login details. Then, start clicking and dragging your files and folders into OneDrive on your Mac's web browser. If you're switching to a Chromebook, or you want to move stuff to your new Windows PC without Office 365, use Google Drive, which has 15GB of free storage. Tech Insider/Flickr/Horia Varlan On your Mac's web browser, go to Google Drive and sign in with your Google account.  Then, you can click and drag files and folders from your Mac to Google Drive in your web browser. You can buy more storage if you need more than the free included 15 GB. It's not very expensive at $2 per month for 100 GB. 4. Switch from Apple's Messages to a universal messaging service, like Google Hangouts. Antonio Villas-Boas Having Messages on the Mac to send and receive texts you're also getting on your phone is a pretty tough feature to leave behind if you're ditching the Apple ecosystem, especially since you could get standard SMS messages on your Mac – not just iMessages between Apple devices – after OS X Yosemite was released. Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn't have an equivalent native app that will work with Android phones to send and receive text messages. There are some third-party apps, like mySMS, which received decent reviews, but they're not ideal or as good as Messages on Macs. To send quick messages to your contacts from both your computer and your phone, the best solution is to use a messenger app that's cross-platform (available on both computers and phones, just like iMessages) rather than using text messages at all. It helps to use a service where many of your contacts are likely to have accounts, like Facebook or Google. Google Hangouts is a great messenger app that also has video and voice chat. It's not quite the same thing as getting your actual phone calls on your Mac based on your actual phone number, but it's a pretty good alternative. You can use Hangouts from your Gmail account online, the Android app, or from the Hangouts web app.   Facebook's Messenger also works across all your devices, and it features video and voice-calling, too. Antonio Villas-Boas Use Android Pay instead of Apple Pay. Screenshot Most new Android devices support Android Pay, which is pretty much the same thing as Apple Pay. Android Pay is often accepted in the same places as Apple Pay due to the fact that both use NFC technology to make mobile payments. If you get a Samsung smartphone that comes with Samsung Pay, it's even better than Apple Pay and Android Pay, as it's accepted pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. The technology used for Samsung Pay, called MST (magnetic secure transmission), mimics a credit card's magnetic stripe, so there's no need for stores to upgrade credit card readers that support NFC for mobile payments.  Unlike Apple Pay, however, which you can use on from your Mac, you can only use Android Pay with your smartphone.  5. Use Spotify instead of iTunes and Apple Music. Reuters Spotify is a great, if not better, alternative to Apple Music as a music streaming service. However, many of you out there have probably amassed vast libraries of music through iTunes, and it's understandable why you wouldn't want to ditch it.  The good news is that you can upload your iTunes music that's locally stored on your computer and iPhone onto Spotify on your Mac — or, if you've already made the switch to a Windows machine or Android phone, you can do it there, too.  To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Mac, just download Spotify and get a Premium account. Then, go into Preferences, and make sure your iTunes Music library is selected as a Local File Source. Once you've done that, just grab any tracks that pop up in your Local Files tab and drag them over to My Music. That way, you can stream them from any device, including whatever non-Apple device you happen to buy in the future. To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Windows, you'll need to download and install iTunes on your PC, which seems counter-intuitive, but it'll make sense soon. Then, the easiest option to get your purchased iTunes music onto your new Windows Machine is to download it again from iTunes. You can find all your purchased music from your account in iTunes. Note that this only works for music you bought from iTunes. If you have local music files from elsewhere, you'll need to transfer it from your Mac to Windows machine with a hard drive, Google Drive, or OneDrive. Once you have all your iTunes music on your Windows machine, download and install the Spotify app for Windows. From there, you simply need to go to Spotify's settings > scroll down until you find the Local Files menu, and turn on the "source" where your local  iTunes music is stored on your Windows machine. Now, Spotify will be your new music player complete with playlists, even for music from your iTunes library.  To get your iTunes music onto an Android phone, the best way is to start from your Windows machine. From your Windows machine, put all your local iTunes music files into a playlist in Spotify. Then, you'll need Spotify's paid Premium service to get them onto your Android phone. Get the Android app, sign up for a Premium account, and make sure your Windows machine and Android phone are on the same WiFi network. Then, in the Spotify Android app, go to Your Library > Playlists > then select the playlist with all your iTunes music, and switch the Download button to the green "On" position.  If everything goes well, that's all there is to it! It's not the most convenient or effortless thing to do, but that's the price for sticking with local music files! WARNING: There is one thing you can't do, which is transfer Mac apps and documents that use that software. Unfortunately, you won't be able to transfer over your Mac apps and software like you can your files and folders. You'll have to download and install the software you want onto your new Windows machine. In some cases, you might have to buy them again to download the Windows version. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

 Watch the new Apple spot that people are comparing to the original iPod ads Kif Leswing Jan. 15, 2017, 10:52 AM 10,064 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple's first ad for its new futuristic wireless headphones, AirPods, is reminding a lot of people of Apple's original ads for the iPod. In the iconic spots, which aired from 2004 to 2008, black silhouettes danced madly to music in front of colorful backgrounds, equipped with Apple's white earbuds. These ads were famous because the songs Apple used for them often charted on Billboard after they aired.  Apple's new AirPods ad, which first aired this weekend, taps into the same concept, showing a gravity-defying dancer wildly gyrating thanks to his new wireless earbuds. The new Apple AirPods ads is set to "Down" by Marian Hill.  "Apple’s first AirPods ad reminds me of the iPod ads," TechCrunch's Romain Dillet wrote.

Craig Federighi, Apple senior vice president of software... Apple long ago established itself as a trendsetter, a company that prides itself on selling customers what they need before they even know what that is. But as the company delves into new devices and services, including the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless earbuds and software that links Internet-connected home devices to a smartphone, some analysts are wondering whether Apple should rethink its strategy. These new products have yet to be widely adopted — and, even if they are, they show no signs of transforming Apple the way the iPod and the iPhone turned a niche PC maker into a top-selling consumer electronics giant. “If we’re measuring innovation, Apple is over,” said Steve Blank, an adjunct professor at Stanford University and a former tech executive. “They are just turning into another commodity phone company.” Apple has been riding on the success of its blockbuster product, the iPhone, for years. Introduced a decade ago, the phone represented 63 percent of Apple’s sales last fiscal year. But that year also saw year-over-year iPhone sales decline for the first time, even as the company announced in July it had sold its billionth iPhone. Apple missed its sales goals for the year, and CEO Tim Cook got a 15 percent pay cut. More from Wendy Lee Move over, App Store: Startup looks for new way to distribute Passwords on shared devices can be snooping spouses’ best ally Plenty of users sticking with Yahoo despite data breaches “There’s a lot of pressure on them to come up with another product that can grow,” said Abhey Lamba, an analyst with Mizuho Securities USA Inc. “Otherwise, Apple will not be considered a growth company.” Apple remains the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of $626 billion — about $62 billion more than its closest rival, Google parent company Alphabet. Moneymakers like the Mac and the iTunes Store are so large that were they stand-alone businesses they would be among the biggest tech companies. Apple also believes the iPhone will continue to have a vibrant future. “Everyone has their opinions at this point, but it could be that we’re only in the first minutes of the first quarter of the game,” Apple marketing executive Phil Schiller recently told tech news site Backchannel. “I believe this product is so great that it has many years of innovation ahead.” Steve Jobs, the Apple co-founder who returned to run the company from 1997 until shortly before his death in 2011, was known as a master innovator. He introduced a series of dazzling products, including the iPod, iPhone and iPad, as well as popular services like the App Store, iTunes and Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Under Cook, the Apple Watch has been the company’s signature new product. AirPods, the wireless earbuds that have just gone on sale and that connect with Siri, have also drawn attention — mostly for shipping later than expected. These items generally require an additional Apple device, usually an iPhone, for full functionality. Other new offerings under Cook include the mobile payment service Apple Pay, streaming music library Apple Music and tools that help control Internet-connected home devices. None of those has come close to matching the iPhone’s success. The company did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The markets for these auxiliary products remain much smaller than the smartphone market, at least for now. Research firm IDC estimates the worldwide market for smartwatches was $5.9 billion in 2016, compared with the $404 billion market for smartphones. Unlike some competitors, Apple releases its hardware products at an enormous scale, and they are sold in many countries. That can make it hard to incorporate changes into devices, analysts said. “You get really constrained by your success,” said Bryson Gardner, a former Apple employee who left to start Pearl Automation, which develops car cameras. Some of Apple’s new hardware appears incremental compared with the competition, which is flirting with futuristic technologies. Google’s newest smartphone, the Pixel, works with a virtual reality headset. Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, unveiled glasses that record video. Those products, however, were rolled out in far fewer countries than, say, the Apple Watch. “It’s hard (for Apple) to take bets when you have to ramp up supply chain the way they do and scale the way they do,” said John Renaldi, a former Motorola vice president who is now CEO of Jiobit, a wearables startup.

Apple CEO Tim Cook took a 15 percent pay cut in 2016 after Apple... Apple has touted services as a key growth area. Revenue in that division increased 22 percent, to $24.3 billion, last fiscal year, representing 11 percent of Apple’s overall sales. But those online services, like its music store or online storage, generally require its hardware to be able to access them. “We remain very confident about the future of our services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base,” Cook told investors in October, according to a transcript on financial analysis site Seeking Alpha. Apple hasn’t made a strong enough case for why the services it offers are better than what’s already out there, said Lamba of Mizuho Securities USA. For example, Apple Music had more than 17 million paying subscribers as of September. Rival service Spotify claims more than 40 million subscribers. The services category also includes sales at Apple’s App Store. Apple typically gets 30 percent of the revenue from purchases of apps, most of which are made by outside developers. But the company could face competition for those sales as well, as other tech firms try to circumvent the App Store. Apple is also bullish on a 3-year-old software product called HomeKit, which links Internet-connected lights, speakers and locks to Apple devices and Siri, allowing customers to control the appliances with their iPhone or voice. Rivals Google and Amazon are also betting on a similar future, releasing the Google Home and Amazon Echo — stand-alone, voice-powered home devices connected to the Internet. These have proved popular with consumers. Apple chose not to create a stand-alone device, though its HomeKit allows similar services via Siri and the iPhone. Some analysts say Apple lost an opportunity to make Siri smarter, with better voice recognition and the ability to perform more tasks. “They were first with Siri but managed to screw that up,” said Blank, the former tech executive. “HomeKit, that’s gone nowhere.” Some Apple users also worry that Siri doesn’t work with some other Internet-connected devices. For example, Sonos speakers can play songs from Apple Music, but they are not part of Apple’s HomeKit and do not work with Siri. Apple did, however, put Siri in its Apple TV set-top box, another once-promising product that has lost its edge to competitors such as Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast. Apple still has a strong line of existing products, such as Macs. But when the company unveiled a major update of the MacBook Pro in October, the response was less enthusiastic than usual. Customers, especially technology geeks, complained that the new laptops had fewer ports and should have included more processing power. Chuq Von Rospach, a former Apple employee who has worked as a developer community manager for large firms including Cisco and Palm, said there wasn’t an entry level price-point for the Macbook Pros, which could put off students — potential future Apple fans. The lowest-priced new version sells for $1,500. Von Rospach said he believes Apple should also refresh its Mac desktop line — which Apple did not do last year — even though desktop computer sales in general are declining. Plenty of analysts believe that Apple has bigger aspirations. Neil Cybart, who runs the Apple analysis site Above Avalon, says Apple is in “transition.” Devices like AirPods and Apple Watch “are positioned as accessories to our smartphone, (but) over time they have the potential to do much more,” he said. For example, venture capitalist Benedict Evans has said he believes Apple could be building up its technology to enter the field of augmented reality, where digital information is overlaid on a view of the real world. “The more I look at the AirPods and Watch, the more I see building blocks for AR glasses,” tweeted Evans, who works for Andreessen Horowitz. Others believe Apple is building a product or service tied to electric cars, which would mesh with the anticipated autonomous-driving revolution. “It’s very difficult to say they are behind when you don’t quite see what is going on behind the scenes,” Cybart said. Apple has remained mum on its future projects. Chronicle staff writer Benny Evangelista contributed to this report. Wendy Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Apple Inc. awarding San Francisco Bay Area tech giant Apple Inc. (Apple) $399M in damages for infringement by Samsung Electronics Co. (Samsung) of three design patents related to Apple’s iPhone product.  The Supreme Court’s decision – which was reached unanimously – clarified the uncertainty of having to determine the “article of manufacture” in design patent damage analyses, particularly with regard to the sale of complex, multicomponent products like smartphones. Although the Supreme Court decision reversed the quite substantial damage award affirmed by the Federal Circuit Court, the ruling in the case may not be as bad for patent owners as many originally thought.  In fact, the Supreme Court may have unwittingly incentivized even more aggressive acquisition of design patents, which will now seemingly allow infringed-upon entities to shift the “article of manufacture” analysis in their favor. Damages Under the Patent Act In the case at-issue, Samsung had infringed upon three of Apple’s iPhone-related design patents.  The patents covered various design components of the iPhone product, including but not limited to the rounded corners and raised rim that distinctly characterize the frontal façade of the phone while held in-hand. As the Supreme Court noted in its opinion, section 171(a) of the Patent Act “has been understood by the Patent Office and the courts to permit a design patent that extends to only a component of a multicomponent product.”  Each patentable component may constitute only a small part of a more complex multicomponent design. Section 289 of the Patent Act governs the damages analysis for infringement of a design patent.  Under the Act, an infringer is liable to the patent holder for the total profit attributed to the “article of manufacture.”  Pursuant to the Federal Circuit’s interpretation of section 289, the “article of manufacture” in the present case was the end product that was ultimately sold to the consumer – the multicomponent smartphone (e.g. the iPhone).  Apple was therefore awarded damages equivalent to the total profit that Samsung made from its infringing smartphone products: $399M. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the judgment of the Federal Circuit, finding that an “article of manufacture” can represent both the end product ultimately sold to the consumer and a mere component of the multicomponent end product, even if the components are not sold separately to consumers.  The Supreme Court declined to resolve whether the “article of manufacture” in the present case was, in fact, the iPhone end product or simply one or more of the infringed-upon patents for various components of the iPhone.  The Court determined that the question was to be addressed and resolved on remand, and the damage award to be recalculated on the basis of such resolution. The $399M damage award represents the total profits Samsung derived from its infringing smartphones.  On remand, were the Federal Circuit to find that the term “article of manufacture” relates – in the present case – to the relevant iPhone design patent components, the damage award would have to be recalculated to reflect the profits derived solely from Samsung’s infringing components.  The damage award would likely be significantly less than the original $399M figure. A damage award based on an “article of manufacture” definition that limits the patent holder to infringement of components (and not to infringement of the end product in its entirety) is likely to incorporate an apportionment analysis in which the component’s contribution to the total profit derived from sale of the end product is assessed. Effect on Patent Holders The effects of the Supreme Court’s decision in Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc. to clarify the “article of manufacture” standard for design patent infringement remains uncertain, though there is some speculation that patent holders (and potential patent holders) will be incentivized to acquire additional component design patents.  The more component design patents a patent holder owns, the more likely it will be that the “article of manufacture” will be owned and sold to the consumer – thus leading to a larger damage award. To put it in simpler terms: for patent holders in design patent infringement cases, having multiple component design patents for any given product will help maximize the potential damage award. A multiple design patent strategy is now more important than ever. Given the ease with which design patents are obtained and the relative inexpensive cost associated with obtaining a design patent (at least when compared to the cost of obtaining a utility patent) innovators who must rely on design patent protection will almost certainly need to more strategically acquire design patents as part of a truly robust design patent portfolio building strategy. Of course, now we wait to see what the Federal Circuit will do, but in the meantime those seeking design patents would do well to apply for more design patents as a way of hedging against what could well become de facto apportionment law, albeit in a rather indirect way through what constitutes the “article of manufacture.” The Author Matt Scyoc is a team member at UpCounsel, an interactive online service that makes it faster and easier for businesses to find and hire legal help solely based on their preferences.

He was referring to the iPhone, launched on January 9th 2007. Like many products, it could be argued that it wasn’t until version 3 in 2009 and the iPhone 3GS when everyone else started to really share Jobs’ vision. The App Store had been available for a year by then and the notion of the smartphone as a truly portable general purpose computing device was born. Since 2007, Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones, generating about US $650 billion in revenue for the firm. In addition, Apple’s App Store generated US $28 billion of revenue last year alone. Of course, Apple’s sales in smartphones are now only 13% of smartphone sales globally, but Apple takes nearly all of the profit. Apple didn’t invent the smartphone and has to share honours with Google’s Android in driving the development of smartphone technologies and in particular the development of the mobile app environment. Certainly there would be nowhere near the adoption worldwide if Android had not enabled the development of inexpensive handsets. Smartphone adoption now stands at 43% of adults globally but goes up to as much as 77% in Australia and 72% in the US. This is now greater than the number of adults who own computers. There is not a facet of life that hasn’t been changed by the advent of the smartphone, with most of these changes occurring within the last 5 years. Australians spend on average an hour a day on mobile devices, with the majority of that time being spent on social networks. This is not as much as the nearly three hours a day spent by Americans on TV, but as TV itself moves increasingly to streaming, more of that time will be on mobile platforms. Irrespective of the total amount of time spent on smartphones, what they have given us is freedom and control in our lives. In health, education, politics and social discourse, smartphones have provided the universal accessibility for an almost fully democratic participation. On a more practical level, we have the freedom to buy products from anywhere at any time and not be constrained by what is on offer in our physical location. We can consult with health providers anywhere or even check on their advice. We have the freedom to share our opinions and thoughts with anyone at any time. The mobile phone played a significant role in the last US election and is now the primary means by which the US president will communicate with the country and the rest of the world. We have the wisdom of the world at our fingertips and even the ability to converse with our devices to allow them to guide and advise us. Most importantly, we can communicate and relate with our family, friends and colleagues at all times from anywhere in the world. We can use the phone to document our lives and share whatever portion of it with whichever audience we choose. None of this was really viable or possible before the advent of the smartphone, and certainly not before Apple and Google created the platforms to enable this to happen. Of course, the world had to change to adapt to the possibilities created by the smartphone. Businesses like Uber would not have been possible but they had to put the technology together with the idea and drivers to enact them. Technologies like Bluetooth have been developed alongside the smartphone to enable the connection of devices to the phone that have made possible wearables, headphones and other devices. The smartphone itself would have been worth nothing if the Internet had not existed and the world wide web and browsers hadn’t created the means to communicate and interact on a global scale. So many different technologies have been brought together in the past 10 years that it is wrong to think that it was simply Apple or Google that brought the world we live in to bear. What Apple did however was to create the vessel in which these other technologies were able to work together to achieve what they have done. They would not have worked in a world of desktop or even laptop computers, or other devices. Although we don’t know the exact details of what the smartphone will look like in 10 years time, we know it will still be here and the main device we interact with. As the TV has not gone away but simply got smarter, the same is likely to be the case with the smartphone. The artificial intelligence capabilities of the phones will be far greater and the technologies that interact with the phone will catch up to match its capabilities. Apple may not have invented the smartphone but it certainly made them the life transforming devices that we have now.

The iPhone maker has posted four videos to YouTube, varying in length from 15 seconds to a minute, all of which are trying to get you to purchase a shiny new pair of AirPods. Three of the videos feature a dancer called Lil Buck, who grooves to music through the streets of Mexico City while listening with AirPods. There are some nifty special effects that show Lil Buck dancing upside down and on walls, pushing a clear message that Apple’s first wireless headphones offer freedom like never before. Apple also uses the ads to showcase the AirPods’ compatibility with the Siri digital assistant, as well as a feature that pauses your music when you remove the AirPods. Check out the ads below: Apple actually launched the AirPods on December 13, just over a month ago, but it’s no surprise the company delayed its initial run of ads. After going on sale, Apple AirPods were almost immediately scuppered by poor shipping times as a result of high demand, leaving many customers unable to purchase a pair online in time for Christmas. Apple probably decided to hold off on the ads to save itself from further shipping woes. The AirPods are Apple’s first own-brand Bluetooth earbuds, and are inspired by the original wired earbuds the company ships with iPhone handsets as standard. They were announced in early September with a view to launch in October, but delays meant the AirPods didn’t go on sale until three months after the reveal. Unfortunately for Apple, the AirPods have been a source of much criticism, much of which centres around the seemingly high £159 price tag – although that’s not too bad for wireless headphones. Other users complained about the quirky design, and the fact that the controversial removal of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 could be seen as a ploy to sell more AirPod units.

Before you start testing out the iPhone 7 and its capabilities, you might want to know a little more about what exactly the IP67 rating means. Advertisement During Apple’s event on September 7th the company unleashed its new and improved iPhone 7 and a dual camera 7 Plus. During the live announcement up on stage Apple stated both have an IP67 rating. YouTubers will put that to the test, but regular users shouldn’t do the same at home. Read: 11 iPhone 7 Release Date Tips Before owners try taking their phone in the shower, take photos under water or just test out the water resistance, they need to know the phone is NOT waterproof.  Apple’s warranty does not cover water damage. So keep that in mind. Read on for more details on how much water the iPhone can really handle. Advertisement The iPhone 7 is IP67 dust and water-resistant, not waterproof. Advertisement For more information on IP-ratings and what they all mean can be found right here. It explains what each number stands for and how long a device can be in contact with liquid. Many potential buyers are excited about this feature but it’s nothing new. Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Note 7 have an IP68 rating, which is higher than Apple. So what’s the difference and which one can handle water better? Let us explain. iPhone 7 is NOT WaterProof When it comes to the iPhone 7 water-resistant rating all you need to know is it can handle certain situations but it’s not waterproof. The new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both have an IP67 dust and water resistant rating. That means they can get wet, but we wouldn’t recommend finding out how wet. In the right circumstances water will still damage and ruin an iPhone. IP67 Rating Let us explain. An IP67 rating usually states a device can be dropped in 1 meter or 3.3 feet of water for nearly 30 minutes. The actual rating system says 15cm – 1 meter and that 3.3 feet is actually the limit of its resistance and capabilities. Then there’s Apple.com which states the iPhone is splash and spill resistant in one place, and “splash and water resistant” in another. The company mention anything about going under water, using it in a pool, or anything remotely close to that. This is a marketing move. Apple doesn’t want users claiming they saw it in a commercial when trying to replace a broken device. Advertisement Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and Note 7 lineup are IP68 rated which means they can be submerged in 1.5 meters or 5ft of water for over 30 minutes. Samsung markets their phones that way. The Galaxy Note 7 can take photos or record video under water, and the S-Pen stylus can write on the screen while submerged. This was shown off right on stage during the announcement. We only say this as a comparison so iPhone 7 buyers can limit their expectations. At the end of the day the new iPhone 7 is water-resistant and will likely be just fine if you drop it in a toilet, get thrown in the pool, or decide to go for a run in the rain. It’s designed to be able to survive getting wet, but don’t try it just to test it. YouTube videos will surface of torture tests and we’d recommend watching those. Again, the warranty does not cover water damage. Don’t risk it. Being rated for IP67 water resistance gives users peace of mind when buying an $800 phone. Just don’t put that to the test. 3 Responses 10/06/2016 talk123 Reply IT SUCKS ALOT!!!!!!! 10/08/2016 lila Reply so we have been lied to kind of, i hope apple makes a water proof one for the iPhone 8, i mean look at samsung 01/15/2017 Arr Jahash Reply Absolute lies from Apple just to compete with Samsung. If you make a claim that your product is water resistant but but won’t include water damage in the warranty, then don’t make that claim.

Added by Duncan McLeod on 15 January 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Apple, BMI-TechKnowledge, Brian Neilson, Paul Theron, Sasha Naryshkine, Tim Cook Tweet Not everyone is worried about Apple’s future fortunes (see main story), or its direction under CEO Tim Cook. Local Apple bull Paul Theron, the founder and CEO of Johannesburg-based private client asset management firm Vestact, believes not only that the company’s prospects remain solid, but that the share price, at about US$120, is “absurdly cheap”. Apple, which is trading below its 18 May 2015 all-time high of $134,54/share, has an historic price-to-earnings ratio of 14. “That’s lower than Toyota, lower than IBM for goodness sake. It’s lower than banged-up banks like Citibank and Wells Fargo. That’s madness,” Theron said. The smartphone market is not mature, but is in fact still in its infancy, he said. This will play strongly in Apple’s favour. “Apple dominates the top end of the world’s most important product market — smartphones. The potential market is every person in the world. People who don’t have one want one. People who have one now want a new one.” What Apple needs to do, Theron said, is simply to “go on doing what it does best”, namely “designing, manufacturing and distributing smartphones”. He predicted the next iPhone — possibly to be called the iPhone 7s or iPhone 8 — could sell over 300m units a year. (In its fiscal fourth quarter — to 24 September 2016 — Apple sold 34,5m iPhones.) Paul Theron BMI-TechKnowledge director of research Brian Neilson is less bullish, and believes Apple’s reliance on mature markets is a handicap. “Apple is far less successful in emerging markets, and in some cases almost irrelevant, especially in the emerging low-cost smartphone market, the ‘next billion’ if you like,” he said. Google’s Android dominates in emerging markets. In the third quarter of 2016, Android had captured 87% of the global market, according to International Data Corp. Apple’s iOS had just 12,5%. However, the iPhone continued to mop up the bulk of smartphone industry profits in 2016, according to various research houses. Sasha Naryshkine, Theron’s colleague at Vestact, where he is a portfolio manager, is also strongly bullish on Apple. He said its valuation is even cheaper if one strips out the company’s cash balance of $240bn. “Even if you add the taxable amount in – for cash repatriated to the US – you could get a huge reinvestment or greater cash distributions to shareholders, increasing the attractiveness of the stock,” Naryshkine said. He also defended Cook, saying that although he “may be a corporate type,” he “may be exactly what the business needs right now”. “The bottom line is that Apple makes products and offers services that Mr and Mrs Consumer love. If that changes, then watch out.” This article was also published in the Sunday Times of 15 January 2017 Share this article Tweet Greg Mahlknecht >People who don’t have one want one. Um… no. People who buy pretty much any flagship phone could choose to have an iPhone for a similar cost, but the majority haven’t done so, because they don’t want one. >The smartphone market is not mature, but is in fact still in its infancy, he said. Clearly this guy isn’t a tech guy. I think anyone that keeps pace with the tech industry will see this statement and steer well clear of Vestact when it comes to investing their money! Industry figures suggest that smartphones are nearing saturation point, with sales numbers flat or slightly declining. And the argument “target market: everyone” is fallacious because Apple have made a conscious decision to only target a small segment of the market. Taryn “People who dont have one want one” – I think he is referring to smartphones here, and not Apple specifically. He says Apple dominates the top end of this market, which may or may not be true, but certainly illustrates Apple’s problem – they have positioned themselves as a niche only in a potentially huge market. Tyrone I’m not that sure I agree, but not for ‘overly scientific’ reasons: 1. There are definitely signs amongst my peer group, in which there are a few tech pundits / thought leaders, who are moving away from Apple. Reasons: Lack of real innovation at an insanely high price point. 2. I’m not in love with the mobile network supply chain model. But then that’s not an Apple-only consideraiton. To Greg’s point, the notion of “target market everyone” falls away strongly when you consider how ridiculously expensive Apple products are. James Francis Perhaps Paul Theron knows a lot about this topic. But the opening musings of this article (and in a way most of the others) smack of the kind of ‘insight’ I often hear financial types give over technology. All broad strokes and no nuance, often hiding critical differences. For example, it would be nice if Theron could explain why he is still so bullish despite clear shifts of the innovation culture under Tim Cook as opposed to Steve Jobs. It’s gotten so stark that some longtime Apple supporters are questions if Cook isn’t eroding Apple’s innovation edge. I’m not saying Cook IS worse, but he is certainly doing things differently. Knowing Theron’s reasoning for glossing over this would be nice, as it is definitely not been business as usual for Apple. Though personally I do think Cook is dropping the ball. Apple hasn’t invested in cloud to take on the emerging big three, it has orphaned the iMac world so badly that Microsoft (of all companies) is swooping in and stealing it, it is about to see its home beachhead (established by TV and Airport) degrade because Amazon’s Echo is defining the smart home market, it is falling behind practically every serious competitor in the connected car platform/services markets, and it has not managed to create a significant new hardware channel since the iPhone. Apple is resting on its laurels. Tim Cook may be running a healthy and productive company, but it sorely lacks the kind of thinking that under Jobs catapulted it forward. James Francis I definitely agree with your second point. I am not sure how he sees the market as still being in its infancy, unless he is generalizing grossly. Greg Mahlknecht He’s just plain wrong. He doesn’t have the necessary knowledge. He also doesn’t seem to understand fundamentals, like why Toyota and IBM have higher P:E. IBM might be in the same broad market segment as Apple, but their bread and butter is in massive decades-long contracts; Toyota is in an industry that changes very slowly. Apple’s bread and butter is in a market segment with effectively 2 year contracts and has a history of companies falling out of favour and dying in a few years. I’m not suggesting that it imminent, but the threat is there in a way it’s not for the other companies he mentions. The Navigator “Financial types” should not be allowed near to systems engineering technology like phones. They’re “financial types” because the’re not systems engineers. Maybe stick to Marketing. That’s what Apple does exceptionally well. D3Rp3R sounds like blackberry arrogance….

Added by Duncan McLeod on 15 January 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, BMI-TechKnowledge, Brian Neilson, Jony Ive, Microsoft, Samsung, Satya Nadella, Steve Ballmer, Steve Jobs, Tim Cook Tweet Steve Jobs with an early iPhone model Ten years ago this week, Steve Jobs took to a stage in San Francisco to unveil the first iPhone. In the intervening decade, Apple’s iconic device has revolutionised the way people communicate. But as Apple celebrates 10 years since the iPhone was revealed to the world – it went on sale six months later, in June 2007, and has since sold more than a billion units – there is a growing view that things are not as ship-shape at the world’s most valuable company, as measured by market capitalisation, as perhaps they could be. The wheels aren’t coming off (not yet, anyway), but some analysts and Apple watchers have begun fretting that the company has taken its eye off the ball, that without Jobs at the helm it has lost the edge, especially on innovation. The problem, they argue, is not so much the iPhone – which, in the most recent fiscal quarter, accounted for more than 60% of total revenue (such over-reliance on one product is an obvious risk) – but that the businesses that used to sustain it, like the Macintosh computer line, have become an “afterthought”. The Mac Pro, aimed at the professional market, for example, hasn’t been updated since 2013. And the new MacBooks haven’t been universally well received. Bloomberg journalist and long-time Apple watcher Mark Gurman wrote in a column in December that people “familiar with Apple’s inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did”. “They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company’s software team,” Gurman said. “They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.” Apple CEO Tim Cook Does this matter, though? After all, Apple makes the vast bulk of its profit from products like the iPhone and iPad, and no longer from the Mac. It might. One problem is, if consumers, fed up by sluggish development on the Mac, move to, say, Windows-based alternatives, they may become less inclined to stay locked into the Apple ecosystem. If Windows works well on the desktop, then what about considering an Android phone instead of an iPhone? And Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, is resurgent – a well-received operating system in Windows 10, paired with sexy new hardware like the Surface Studio all-in-one PC and Surface Book laptops, is making some long-time Apple users sit up and take notice. Overall strategy seems to be inferior because it is so dependent on bringing out the next big thing, and there may not be one Indeed, in the past five years, Microsoft’s share price – which trod water for years under former CEO Steve Ballmer – has outperformed Apple’s. A relentless focus on cloud-based software and software as a service is helping Microsoft reinvent itself for a new era. Perhaps the biggest problem in the longer term – one that’s been written about extensively in recent times – is that Apple has not come up with a new category-defining device since the iPad in 2010, when Jobs was still leading the company. The Apple Watch was meant to be this product, but smartwatches have proved to be a “much more niche category, and certainly not market making like iPods, iTunes, iPhones or iPads”, said Brian Neilson, director of research at Johannesburg-based consultancy BMI-TechKnowledge. The Mac Pro has not been updated since its 2013 overhaul “Under Steve Jobs, Apple could seize opportunities such as these, being the first to recognise market gaps – like the iPod, a gap Sony left wide open after the Walkman – and to execute well on bringing them to market, incorporating great design and clever marketing,” Neilson said. “On the design side, the most recent missteps the company has made under the guise of innovation have proven to be highly unpopular – and, frankly, stupid – like eliminating the 3,5mm earphone jack and needing a dongle for just about everything,” he added. Apple now seems to be playing catch-up in a number of categories “Worryingly, beyond the design missteps, the overall strategy seems to be inferior because it is so dependent on bringing out the next big thing, and there may not be one.” Also, instead of being a “market maker”, Apple “now seems to be playing catch-up in a number of categories, including streaming music and home media systems”. Apple’s reliance on a single product for the bulk of its revenue and profit is hugely problematic, Neilson said. What if the next iPhone is a flop, or it catches fire, like Samsung’s Galaxy Note7, which cost Apple’s Korean rival at least $6bn in write-downs? Apple’s “vertically integrated” business model — where it controls all aspects of the device, from the hardware to the software and the user experience — has worked well for it, but could ultimately work against it, Neilson added. “[This model] inevitably loses its shine as competitors emerge at each market layer with equally great products and user experience. Competitors can now innovate more rapidly than Apple can because there are more options, from many more players, in an ‘open systems’ environment, all interoperable.” See also: Apple is ‘absurdly cheap’ This article was also published in the Sunday Times of 15 January 2017 Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 55Digital migration has ‘failed’ 9Dear Telkom, we need to talk 9Muthambi ‘ignoring’ DA on TV box report 7ICT white paper ‘not constitutional’ 7The future of radio in South Africa [podcast] Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

By Mark Gurman and Mark Bergen. Added by Agency Staff on 15 January 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Andy Rubin, Apple, Essential, Google Tweet Andy Rubin Just over two years after leaving Google, Andy Rubin is preparing to take on the smartphone industry he helped create. Rubin, creator of the Android operating system, is planning to marry his background in software with artificial intelligence in a risky business: consumer hardware. Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple and Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its CEO, according to people familiar with the matter. A platform company designed to tie multiple devices together, Essential is working on a suite of consumer hardware products, including ones for the mobile and smart home markets, one of the people said. The centrepiece of the system is a high-end smartphone with a large edge-to-edge screen that lacks a surrounding bezel. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in early January, Rubin discussed the smartphone with mobile carrier executives, including some from Sprint, people familiar with the talks said. Rubin registered Essential Products with California regulators in November 2015. In late 2016, the company registered “Essential” with the US Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and “computer operating software for mobile phones” among its goods and services. It’s unclear if the devices will run on software based on Android. While still in the prototyping stage, Rubin’s phone is aimed at the top of the market where Apple’s iPhone and Google’s new Pixel reside. It’s expected to include high-end materials and the ability to gain new hardware features over time, the people said. Representatives for Rubin and Sprint declined to comment. Rubin sold Android to Google in 2005. He spent eight years at its helm at Google, turning the operating system from a tiny project into the globe’s most dominant software for running mobile devices. In 2013, he stepped down from Android to form Google’s robotics unit before leaving altogether in 2014. Rubin’s next venture was a start-up incubator called Playground Global, which backs artificial intelligence, robotics and augmented reality projects. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. “New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,” he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. “What’s the next platform? It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn.” Playground Global, which occupies a sprawling warehouse in Silicon Valley, has raised at least US$300m from big investors including Hewlett-Packard, Google and Apple supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry. The latter, known as Foxconn, is in talks to manufacture Rubin’s new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin’s phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus’s (5,5 inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said. The start-up is experimenting with enabling the phone’s screen to sense different levels of pressure, similar to an iPhone, the person said. Rubin’s team is testing an industrial design with metal edges and a back made of ceramic, which is more difficult to manufacture than typical smartphone materials, two of the people said. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry Essential’s engineers are developing a proprietary connector that serves double duty for charging the battery and expanding the phone’s functionality over time, one person familiar with the planning said. The magnetic connector would allow Essential or even third parties to create hardware accessories that add features to the smartphone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution, 360-degree photographs, the person said. Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter said, adding that all of the plans are still in flux. Technology news website The Information earlier reported Rubin was working on a phone. Helping run the project are former Google colleagues and Apple managers, including Rebecca Zavin, Joe Tate, Linda Jiang and Jason Keats. Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, is running software for Rubin. Keats and Tate are helping run hardware engineering, and Jiang is a key designer for Essential, according to a person familiar with the start-up. Kelly Liang, a former business executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 55Digital migration has ‘failed’ 9Dear Telkom, we need to talk 9Muthambi ‘ignoring’ DA on TV box report 7ICT white paper ‘not constitutional’ 7The future of radio in South Africa [podcast] Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Big Apple Circus files for bankruptcy The circus is leaving town. After 39 seasons of delighting New Yorkers, the Big Apple Circus is holding a bankruptcy auction to sell off its assets. Stage sets, a marquee sign, a trapeze, a glitzy ringmaster’s coat and clown costumes are just a few items that will be up for grabs. The auction will have two options for bidding — interested buyers can bid on the entire collection for one lump sum, or bids can be broken down into four separate lots, including vehicles and power units, toys and supplies, a pair of Big Apple Circus-branded big-top tents, and intellectual property, which includes copyrights and trademarks. Interested buyers must submit a deposit equal to 10 percent of their offer. The minimum deposit is $50,000. “[The Big Apple Circus] would like to keep all of the items intact and not break anything up,” Harry Stampler, president of Stampler Auctions, who is handling the sale, told The Post. “I’ve already had a few offers from California, but I can’t say how much they were for.” The one-ring circus filed for bankruptcy in November and is currently in Chapter 11, but hopes to resurrect the show later this year. Bids will be accepted online at stamplerauctions.com through 5 p.m. on Feb. 3; if two or more bids are received, an auction will be held Feb. 7 in New York. “The ultimate goal of the auction is to sell substantially all of these assets to a buyer committed to preserving an operating enterprise and restarting performances in New York City,” said Will Maitland Weiss, Executive Director of The Big Apple Circus. “We hope the Big Apple Circus will be back performing under the big top in the years to come.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under auctions ,  bankruptcy ,  circuses Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next New bank branch adds to economic upswing in the Bronx Read Next New bank branch adds to economic upswing in the Bronx Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 43,779 Customs agents ignore judge, enforce Trump's travel ban: ACLU 21,283 Emma Watson, Miles Teller lost 'La La Land' roles for being too demanding 16,147 Peru, Colombia vow to stand with Mexico against Trump 11,912 Massive protests at airports across US after Trump's immigrant ban Columnists Andrea Peyser This school failed its teacher — and his kids Jennifer Gould Ex-Time Warner CEO reopens famed Harlem jazz club SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Now On Lily Tomlin’s only showbiz regret involves Cher Deborah Roberts on Trump: ‘Take some deep breaths’ Rangers players take a break from the ice and hit up the beach SEE ALL Video :52 Baby monitor reveals toddler is a diehard Rangers fan More Stories pagesix Emma Watson, Miles Teller lost 'La La Land' roles for being too demanding Now On Decider Top 10 Sexiest, Dirtiest & Steamiest Movies On Netflix Right Now nypost Customs agents ignore judge, enforce Trump's travel ban: ACLU New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

The Cupertino-based tech giant had a successful launch for the iPhone 7 in 2016. This time around it is hoping the next generation of the smartphone will do even better. The company is certainly doing its part by adding great features to the upcoming smartphone. The recent iPhone 8 rumors reveal that Apple is reportedly going to make this year’s iPhone more water and dust resistant. Water and dust resistant smartphones have become more and more common over the past couple of years. Before, it was only the special phones such as the “Active” version of the Galaxy S series that was waterproof and dustproof. But now, even the flagship smartphones are getting this feature. Apple joined in on the action last year by making the iPhone 7 water and dust proof. It was the first time ever that the company had used this feature. It appears that it will not be the last either. iPhone 8 Rumors According to Forbes, several sources have confirmed that the iPhone 8 will have upgraded IP68 water and dust resistance. This means that not only will Apple continue to use the feature in this year’s iPhone, it will improve it even further. The improvement in the IP68 water resistance ratings mean the iPhone 8 could withstand being submerged in up to 1.5 meters of water for a period of 30 minutes. This is definitely a huge boost in features that iPhone 8 users will enjoy. Being able to use the iPhone underwater can give users a lot more flexibility with their phones. They can use it to take pictures while swimming and they can even use apps while they are in the pool. This is certainly only one of the features which Apple is going to add to the iPhone 8. Be sure to watch out for more news and updates on the latest iPhone 8 rumors as well as on the other trending topics in the world of tech.

An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod. A phone. Are you getting it? These are not three separate devices. This is one device. And we’re calling it, ‘iPhone’.” When it comes to iconic smartphones over the past decade, Apple's iPhone is arguably the easiest one for people to recall. While smartphones themselves were already in existence by then, none of them had been quite like the iPhone. It’s easy to forget, but before the iPhone came along multi-touch displays hadn’t been invented. There was no pinch-to-zoom and styluses were a necessity to properly navigate a smartphone. It wouldn’t be until the following year with the release of the iPhone 3G that the iPhone would truly begin its legacy with a more affordable price tag and the introduction of the App Store, but conceptually the original iPhone brought a lot to the table that would inspire smartphone development over the following decade. Ten years has passed since the original iPhone was introduced. The iPhone may have been a breakthrough for modern smartphones, but it was certainly not the only iconic smartphone to have surfaced over the past decade. Truly, smartphones are in a pretty amazing place right now. It’s hard to find one that doesn’t work perfectly well, even on a budget, and that’s thanks to the efforts of many manufacturers and software developers over the years. Although I would argue that all smartphones contributed in one way or another to the evolution of mobile tech, some stood out to me more than others. Reflecting on the past decade, here are the smartphones (aside from the already mentioned Apple iPhone) that I consider the most iconic: T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream) The T-Mobile G1 was a phone that I never owned but heard a lot about. As the first commercially available Android device, nobody seemed entirely confident on Android’s ability to compete with the multitude of mobile operating systems already on the market such as BlackBerry OS, Symbian, Windows Mobile, webOS, and iOS. Still, the platform showed promise and, as we can see today, has flourished well above and beyond many of those now extinct mobile platforms. Motorola Droid I don’t remember ever seeing the G1 marketed but advertising for the Motorola Droid, Verizon’s first Android device, was everywhere, and boy was it effective. The name became so recognized that people often confused “Droid” with “Android”, and for a while the term “Droid” was practically synonymous with the Android platform (which wasn’t too far off anyway). HTC EVO 4G The release of the HTC EVO 4G on Sprint was a pretty big deal given that it was the first smartphone in the U.S. to support 4G, albeit on Sprint’s old WiMAX network. It was also larger phone than people were used to at the time with its 4.3-inch screen (ha). Nokia Lumia 920 Nokia’s Lumia phones quickly became the face of Windows Phones after the 920 was released. The bright and bold color offerings combined with Nokia’s “tanky” polycarbonate build and exceptional Carl Zeiss cameras made the Lumia line a decent choice at the time even with its inferior app store. Samsung Galaxy S III It was the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy S II where I noticed people start to take Android seriously, and the success of the S II seemed to pour directly into the S III’s release the following year. The Galaxy S III's popularity is often credited to its excellent performance and open availability across all four major carriers. At the time carrier exclusivity was still the norm, which is thankfully a rare issue today. LG Nexus 5 The Nexus line had already grown in popularity with the Nexus 4 thanks to its affordable $299 price tag – which was practically unheard of at the time – but the Nexus 5 was the shining star due to its affordable price tag (although $50 more than the Nexus 4 at $349) and its “nearly flagship" performance. Moto G Speaking of affordable price tags and good performance, the Moto G is another iconic device that broke the mold. The Moto G wasn’t just affordable, it was downright cheap and looked good, and the terms “cheap”, “good performance”, and “good-looking” were three terms that just didn’t belong in the same sentence in reference to smartphones, but the Moto G managed to change that. HTC One (M7) While we’re on the subject of terms that didn’t go together, the same could be said for “premium build” and “Android” – until the HTC One (M7) debuted. The first in a now long list of smartphones that use the M7’s iconic aluminum unibody design, the M7’s build blew every other Android flagship build out of the water. It was sleek, the back couldn’t shatter, and it just felt like you got what you were paying for when you paid the price for a flagship device. Samsung Galaxy Note The Galaxy Note is one of my favorites because I remember being 190% sure that the Note was just too freakin’ big for anybody to ever want it. I liked the idea of an included stylus, but why did the phone need to be so big? Turned out its large size would be one of its most valuable assets. Nowadays it’s hard to find a phone that doesn’t have a 5-inch plus screen, and the Galaxy Note only became more popular after the original’s debut (although I am still interested to see how last year’s events will play out for the Note’s future). There were a lot of phones that didn't make the list that I still considered iconic, including other generations of smartphones that were mentioned, but I opted to whittle it down to the ones I considered most iconic thus far, otherwise an already long list would be even longer. But now we want to hear from you, dear readers. Over the past ten years, which smartphones do you consider to be the most iconic and why? Tell us your picks in the comments below!

Well, that case is still ongoing as the Supreme Court throws it back to the Court of Appeals. Earlier this week the U.S. Supreme Court released documents saying it couldn't determine whether the reimbursement previous court ruled would be correct in the case. Thus it decided to put it on Court of Appeals to figure out how much Samsung owes Apple. For a long time it hasn't been a debate whether Samsung abused Apple's design patents but instead the fight continues about how much they should pay Apple. Previous judgment of $399 million in damages was now overturned by Supreme Court because it wasn't sure that calculating the figures straight from Samsung's profits was right in this case. Apple's view is that the blatant copying of patented features is stealing and needs to be punished accordingly. The Cupertino giant, as well as fashion designers rooting for the company, have made the point that design makes, and sells the product. Samsung wants the courts to determine the damages from certain components that infringed the patents, which, lets be honest, is going to be hard to calculate. We'll get back to you in 2029 when the final decision has been made.

Automakers, technology companies and glass manufacturers are teaming up to turn the display that graces the front of an iPhone into the windshield of a car — one that can show ads, directions and vehicle information to the person behind the wheel. The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $1.5 trillion by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes. “When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you’re on a typical trip, it’s food, it’s fuel and it’s rest stops,” said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Owning the inside of the car is critical, it’s really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity.” How might a smart windshield work? A driver who is close to running out of gas would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a gas station. The car’s virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee — an ad placed by the gas company that fits with the driver’s buying patterns, also known by his smart car. At CES, the gadget show in Las Vegas this month, Panasonic demonstrated technology that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a display, before pulling off the freeway. Pairing such offerings with other connected subscription services could generate hundreds of dollars in additional recurring revenue per car each year, according to Tom Gebhardt, the head of Panasonic’s automotive business in North America. “When you start doing payments out of the vehicle, you have to secure those payments somehow, so we’re matching the facial recognition with your credit card,” he said. “We’re really investing in an integrated solution.” Corning is starting to sell carmakers the glass used in Apple’s iPhones for windshields and in-car entertainment systems. The company said the durability and thinness of the glass means that any image projected onto it is sharper than onto a typical windshield. While the product is less than 10 inches wide, Corning is working to expand it to a full windshield-size display. “They could be here in less than two years,” Corning Chief Technology Officer Jeff Evenson said. “We’re making the car much more active to set things up for these kinds of services.” Turning a car windshield into a billboard is part of broader efforts by automakers and tech companies to transform vehicles into connected devices. Many companies at CES announced deals and partnerships that use software, digital voice technology and cloud computing to handle everything from automatically scheduling a maintenance appointment to ordering a takeout pizza while on the road. Automakers including BMW, Hyundai and Toyota already offer basic displays near the windshield in some models that show information such as the vehicle’s speed. Alphabet, through its Waze navigation app, suggests nearby restaurants and points of interest during your drive, as does TripAdvisor. The next step is merging the two idea and projecting points of interest onto your windshield. Eventually, mapping and navigational data could be superimposed onto the road in front of the driver, much in the way that Google Street View displays information about an area on a static image. BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler acquired Nokia’s Here mapping unit in 2015 to ensure that they would not need to depend on Google for maps. Intel said this month that it has acquired a 15 percent stake in Here. “This is exactly the sort of thing the high-end carmakers are promoting as part of their highly integrated, immersive ‘cockpit’ concepts,” said Richard York, an executive at chip designer ARM who is responsible for automotive sales. The question of how the technology is regulated remains open, given concerns about driver distraction. For now, suppliers are eager to promote the displays as safety tools. For example, the speed and location of vehicles in a car’s blind spot might be projected onto the windshield. “We’re going to bring the safety aspect of the vehicles” into the augmented reality products, said Joseph Yoon, head of LG Electronics’ automotive research and development team. Boosters also say a windshield display is a safer alternative than drivers taking their eyes off the road to glance down and tap a dashboard system or check a smartphone. For many years BMW, Volkswagen and Jaguar Land Rover worked with Munich startup Metaio to investigate possible applications for augmented reality technology in cars, according to someone familiar with Metaio’s business. The main hurdle to superimposing an enhanced image for the driver was the “tracking problem” — establishing the direction of a driver’s gaze and adapting the image accordingly, the person said. Metaio was acquired by Apple last year, and ended its contracts with the carmakers. Panasonic’s Gebhardt said his company had mastered the technology and is seeking a customer willing to deploy it in a car. People usually understand information presented in an augmented reality format more quickly than on paper or a smartphone, according to Sunny Webb, who leads Accenture’s research and development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. That makes augmented reality an appealing medium through which to present location-based ads, as well as safety and contextual information to drivers. “Being able to overlay content in a windshield is a really interesting application,” she said. “There’s a lot of energy going into how to distribute content to passengers and drivers.” Meanwhile, Harman International, the in-car infotainment systems giant that is being acquired by Samsung Electronics, is moving into heads-up displays. In December it announced an investment in Navdy, a San Francisco maker of a projection display that sits on the dashboard in front of the windshield and provides navigation guidance, car behavior data and smartphone alerts. The two companies will start selling a heads-up display this year. Automotive supplier Magna International is reportedly expected to unveil an augmented reality product with a major German carmaker this year. Automakers also are considering the ability to push content such as video in front of passengers in addition to mapping or road services as a way to generate more revenue from each vehicle. “We want to have our direct customer relationship delivering premium services to them and being their direct contact,” Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of research and development, said. “That’s the clear goal for a premium car manufacturer.” Alex Webb is a Bloomberg writer.

Without Nintendo, haptic feedback for games wouldn't exist. No-one would be using thumbsticks on gamepads, and the concept of motion controllers would be alien. Nintendo was the company that introduced the world to touchscreen gaming, three years before Apple brought the iPhone to market. Heck, without Nintendo, technological breakthroughs such as glasses-free 3D might never have happened. It should come as absolutely no surprise, then, that its latest console – the Nintendo Switch – flies in the face of convention. Not content with being the first truly portable home console, the Switch is seeking to redefine gaming in the same way the Wii did back in 2006. And if that wasn't enough, Nintendo has also gone against industry standards, employing the use of an Nvidia mobile processor over a semi-custom AMD one, and offering up a multiplayer console experience right out of the box. Nintendo Switch review (hands-on): Switchin' it up Nintendo Switch's big sell is its versatility. Where the Wii U allowed you to play games directly on the GamePad's display, Switch puts the entire console into the palm of your hands. In that regard, it's no different to a handheld console like the PlayStation Vita – albeit a little bigger. Essentially, Switch is a portable home console, but the trouble it has to face is being thought of as a handheld gaming device that just so happens to plug into your TV – rather than the other way around. Regardless of how you perceive it, Nintendo intends the Switch to be a truly flexible gaming device. If you want a more traditional gaming experience, dropping Switch into its TV dock and grabbing a controller gives you exactly that. If someone else wants to use the TV, or you just fancy taking it on the road, you can just pick it up and keep playing instantly. Switch's “Handheld mode” lets you play as you travel, while “Tabletop mode” allows for either comfortable, untethered play, or effortless on-the-go multiplayer gaming. These various setups aren't an afterthought, either: Nintendo built these into the very core of Switch from the start. In addition to being thin and light enough to provide truly portable single-player thrills, Nintendo has designed it to be the perfect portable multiplayer console. Its controllers, known as Joy-Cons, come as a pair but can function as completely independent controllers. Slide them into a Joy-Con Grip and they unite to function as one standard pad, but you can also separate them from the Grip and pass one Joy-Con to a friend. That done, each functions as a discreet miniature controller, complete with thumbstick, face buttons and shoulder buttons. Can't quite see the attraction? Imagine being able to play Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in multiplayer literally anywhere in the world. Sold. Nintendo Switch review (hands-on): Switch vs Xbox One vs PS4 In the hardware stakes, it's hard to compare the Switch with the Xbox One and the PS4. As with the Wii and Wii U, Nintendo is forging a very different path with the Switch. It's not intending to go up against the two juggernauts of the gaming scene; instead, it's focusing on what it does best – bringing great games and excellent experiences to those who want them. A glance at the Switch's specs sheet – if Nintendo were to actually provide one – would instantaneously put many “hardcore” gamers off the Switch. For one, it's powered by a mobile chip (eugh!), only has a 720p built-in 6.2in screen (lol!), and it's limited to 1080p on a TV (PC Master Race wins again!). However, the moment you see Switch in action, these specs-based worries melt away – although it has to be said that the 32GB of expandable microSD storage pales in comparison to the 500GB and 1TB drives in its competitors. That “mobile” chip inside the Switch is pretty special, however. Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip is a miniature monster and, while we don't know how much RAM Nintendo has paired it with for the Switch, it's more than capable of pushing out visuals that surpass those of the Wii U (a more than capable Full HD console). Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ran at a silky-smooth 1080p 60fps during multiplayer on a TV – something the Wii U can't do – and, although the demo wasn't fully optimised for Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ran like a dream in Handheld mode at 720p 60fps. Breath of the Wild should also run at 60fps while outputting to a TV at 1080p, but the demo build was locked to 30fps to ensure smooth play on the show floor.   The Switch's 6.2in 720p screen isn't to be sniffed at, either. During my hands-on time, every game I played in either Handheld or Tabletop mode looked stunning on the Nintendo Switch display. Pictures were sharp, vibrant, and action looked crisp and fluid. While I'm sure Nintendo could have crammed a 1080p screen into the same space, it really didn't have to. At this scale the difference is barely discernable, and the boosts to battery life make the tradeoff worthwhile. Still, even with that extra little battery-saving nous, many will find a reason to complain about Nintendo's decision to equip the Switch with a battery capable of “around two-and-a-half, to six-and-a-half hours” of play time. For reference, that's about the same as Nintendo's major handheld the New 3DS, and Nintendo estimates that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can run off battery for about three hours of play. Thankfully, Nintendo has equipped the Switch with USB Type-C instead of a proprietary charger, so you can easily juice it up on the go. This many not seem like an ideal solution, but you have to remember that Nintendo sees this as a home console first, portable second. Nintendo Switch review (hands-on): Launch games and software So far Switch's biggest weakness, and quite possibly its downfall, is the complete lack of a launch lineup. Nintendo may be supplying The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on launch – which is a very welcome release indeed – but it smacks that Nintendo knew it had to prepare Zelda for launch because if it hadn't, there would be nothing to play on day one. Alongside Zelda, Nintendo's other launch title, 1-2 Switch seems like a game that should have been bundled in the box rather than a full-price title. Thankfully its intuitive use of the Joy-Cons, along with its social-focused gameplay and Wario Ware-style of absurd mini-games make it an absolute blast to play with friends. Third-party publishers are also onboard for day one, but that still only amounts to three extra games to play. You can take your pick from Just Dance 2017, Skylanders Imaginators and Super Bomberman R – three solid, but not overly compelling, games. Thankfully, there are oodles of titles due to launch in 2017, including big hitters such as Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Skyrim. We can also expect to hear about further 2017 releases during this year's E3 event in June, and the complete list of confirmed Nintendo Switch games suggests Nintendo's console will have a very strong lineup in time for Christmas 2017 – which is when most people buy consoles. Clearly Nintendo is taking a gamble, but it's in it for the long game. In terms of other software features, we know very little about Nintendo's plans. Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip is capable of 4K video output, but nobody knows if Nintendo plans to leverage that for Netflix or Amazon Prime Video streaming services. We also don't know if Virtual Console support is coming to Switch nor if the much rumoured Gamecube emulation is true or not. People hoped Wii U game support would be coming to Switch too, but with both Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon receiving new releases for Switch, that seems unlikely right now. Nintendo Switch review (hands-on): first impressions Before going into my hands-on experience with the Nintendo Switch, I watched the announcement live stream and felt somewhat disappointed. In my mind I'd built the Switch up to be something truly phenomenal, and with a launch focused around games that were still on their way, and so few of my questions answered, it was easy to feel deflated. However, the moment I finally picked up a Switch and started using the Joy-Con controllers to milk a cow, crack a safe, catch a sword, throw a punch and drive a kart, everything I love about Nintendo came flooding back.   The Switch may not be conventional, but that's what makes it so great: Nintendo has unshackled itself from the preconceptions of what a console is. It's the perfect device for someone who has to share the main TV in the house, or for those who prefer to play handheld games without the usual handheld compromises. Its eight-player local multiplayer capabilities and its out-of-the-box two-player functionality make it an excellent choice for multiplayer fanatics or game-loving families and – as with everything Nintendo – it's a device built for people who like to have fun. If you silenced the music being pumped into the venue, the Switch hands-on session would have echoed with the joyful screams of people playing absurd party games, interrupted only by the percussion of loud swearing emanating from the Splatoon 2 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe stands. Nintendo still has a lot of questions to answer regarding Switch, and we're hoping to see much more of the console in the weeks leading up to its 3 March launch. Nintendo die-hards won't even have to think about its £280 price tag, but for those that aren't quite so keen, the Switch's appeal is only going to grow over the course of 2017.   This article originally appeared at alphr.com Related Articles Hands-on Preview: Ghost Recon: Wildlands Hands-on Preview: Leica M10 is updated, but still retro-cool Hands-On Preview: Fujifilm X-100F Hands-on Preview: Halo Wars 2 The 5 ways you can control the Nintendo Switch Source: Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  handson  |  nintendo switch   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   15 weird wars we want to see represented in game form     Hands-on Preview: Nvidia Shield TV (2017)     Win a Crucial/Ballistix RAM & SDD prize pack!     All the news from Nvidia's CES 2017 keynote speech     HTC Vive's wireless TPCast peripheral gets a release date   More in Hyper (1 of 10 articles) FEATURE Hands-on Preview: Ghost Recon: Wildlands << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (2 of 10 articles) VIDEO Video Review: Gravity Rush 2 << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (3 of 10 articles) VIDEO Check out Ghost Recon: Wildlands' singleplayer campaign play << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (4 of 10 articles) NEWS Nintendo Switch won't support video streaming services on launch << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (5 of 10 articles) VIDEO The Ringed City DLC coming to Dark Souls III in March << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (6 of 10 articles) NEWS Hands-on Preivew: Torment: Tides of Numenera is a journey into the strange << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (7 of 10 articles) VIDEO Call of Cthulhu RPG coming to PC and console this year << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (8 of 10 articles) VIDEO Alone in the Dark creator announces new adventure game, 2Dark << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (9 of 10 articles) FEATURE 15 weird wars we want to see represented in game form << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> More in Hyper (10 of 10 articles) VIDEO Micro Machines World Series is hitting every platform this year << Prev Next >> View all Hyper articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Hyper News Hyper PixelCast 74 Review Review: Dead Rising 4 does it all again Feature Hands-on Preview: Ghost Recon: Wildlands Gallery Nintendo Switch fan event, Tokyo From our Partners     See more offers from the PC & Tech Authority Software Store     Sponsored Links Most popular tech stories 7 accounting packages for Australian small businesses compared: including MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Reckon, Xero 16 top tips for optimising Windows 10 How long will a UPS keep your computers on if the lights go out?

The handset is now available, in select regions, and, according to Samsung, it radiates “quality” and “luxury”.  If you're thinking of upgrading your phone, TV or PC anytime soon, Samsung is running a 0% finance offer at the moment which gives you 0% finance for up to 24 months on orders over £249 placed. The offer ends on January 23rd, however, so you need to be quick in order to get it on time. --------------------- Let's take a look back at the best of 2016 shall we? If you're an iPhone fan or you're embedded in Apple's ecosystem already, then you're left with the iPhone 7 series; not bad, but the major overhaul is coming in 2017 by all accounts. For everyone else in the Android space that basically leaves a handful of options, including the LG G5 or Samsung's Galaxy S7/S7 EDGE series, all three of which launched in FEBRUARY, so are bascially the oldest phone's of the year and are still kicking pretty much everything else's ass. The last choice came in at the last minute, and that's Google's Pixel and Pixel XL, which launched in October, and are pretty much the only other phones this year to draw our attention properly away from Samsung and LG's stuff. If Richard's glowing review of the Pixel XL is anything to go by then we may finally have a contender fit to take on the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 EDGE inside 2016. Yes folks, so far the Galaxy S7 series, despite being announced in February this year, has managed to fend off pretty much all comers as the king of the smartphone space - not a bad innings by any stretch. While the LG G5 was an innovative piece of kit, which launched around the same time, for whatever reasons consumers didn't flock to it the same way they did to Samsung's devices. In the run-up to the big reveal, both  Galaxy S7 devices proved possibly Samsung's worst-kept secret to date, not that this is meant as a slight against Samsung - pretty much every manufacturer is unable to keep things wrapped up tight these days and in-development products always leaks onto the web in abundance. Consequently, once again much of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge design, and many of the features, are not a surprise to anyone who had been keeping an eye on things in the six months or so ahead of the launch. As per the rumours, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are not tremendously different design-wise from the Galaxy S6 series, and this is no bad thing because those devices were absolutely gorgeous, made from high-end materials, and offered a premium feel in the hand - in my opinion some of the best handsets Samsung has ever made. All good stuff. But there are still some noteworthy differences and new features to make the Galaxy S7 edge stand out from its forebears. Enough that consumers are very interested, it seems, as according to a statement from Samsung's Dutch branch pre-order figures for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge in Europe were 2.5x higher than the Galaxy S6 series the previous year. The Galaxy S7 edge also proved the most popular model, accounting for 61% of all pre-orders inside Europe. The news came a few days after Samsung's chief of mobile, Koh Dong-jin, made a less precise statement that pre-orders globally had exceeded the firm's expectations. Although Samsung has lost a LOT of money and brownie points off the back of the Galaxy Note 7 "explosiongate" fiasco, there are signs that it is now clawing things back. That $5bn hit from the Note 7 is still there, of course, but of the $14bn decline in share market value the firm experienced following the catastophe it has now clawed back $9bn in one day of trading on November 30. Prior to the Note 7 debacle, back in August 2016, Samsung's share price peaked to an all-time high of $1480 per share, of course following the emergence of the Galaxy Note 7's issue, that figure drastically dropped off a cliff. Now though, Samsung has seen a share price increase up to a new all-time high of $1496 per share topping the firm's market valuation at $224 billion. Gloss "Pearl Black" Galaxy S7 EDGE Launches In South Korea Following a rumour trail Samsung has now officially launched the new glossy "Pearl Black" colour variant of the Galaxy S7 EDGE. Of course specs wise it is exactly the same as existing models, it is simply a new colour finish which is shiny compared to the existing matte Onyx Black, however, there is one caveat and that is it only comes in a 128GB storage variant. Sales will go live in "select markets", including South Korea, from December 9, however, Samsung is yet to reveal what other markets will receive the new handset. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Pops Up Running Google Daydream VR When Google announced the Pixel and Pixel XL alongside the Daydream VR headset it was quickly established that the duo would be two of the first devices to operate with the new VR kit. At the same time, we'd previously heard about how the in-development Galaxy S8 featured an alleged 4K display purpose-built for VR, and its "Project Dream" codename. While we wouldn't like to jump the gun ourselves, we could hardly blame anyone for assuming that this focus on the Galaxy S8 as a VR-built handset from Samsung might mean that the already launched Galaxy S7 series would not be compatible with Daydream VR. However, there's new evidence which suggests this might not be the case after all. A video has appeared on Youtube showing Galaxy S7 EDGE users in Canada (with the Exynos 8890-based variant) running with the Google Daydream VR hardware and managing with the Google virtual museum application without too much fuss. Obviously what this means is that it is possible to run a Galaxy S7 EDGE on Daydream with plenty of poking and tweaking; technically it's not officially supported in this way, at least not yet - the Galaxy S7 EDGE isn't an officially Daydream compatible device, nor does it officially have Android Nougat right now (a minimum requirement for Daydream VR) but clearly someone has loaded it onboard probably through Samsung's Beta program using non-final software. Video of Google Daydream FULLY RUNNING on the GALAXY S7 EDGE 7.0 Nougat Part 2 "Blue Coral" Colour Variant Coming To Select Markets From November 1 The new Blue Coral colour variant of the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE has already been announced in Singapore and Taiwan, but as of November 1 Samsung's US webpage features an announcement that the new colour will now be available in "select markets". Oddly, however, the announcement doesn't reveal exactly which markets have been selected. "Specific availability details will be announced by each market’s wireless providers and regional Samsung offices," said the firm's statement. Of course Taiwan and Singapore are already confirmed, and with the announcement on the US website it's reasonable to assume a US launch too. Will Europe and the UK get a look in? We will keep our eyes open and let you know as we hear more. Android Nougat Update Arrives For Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE - Also Vodafone UK Handsets From January 23 Reports are coming in on January 20 that, following the official start of the rollout of Android Nougat for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 EDGE, users are now finding the update appearing OTA on their handsets. The file for software build XXU1DPLT, comes in at either 1.2GB or 1.3GB and updates the unlocked handsets (SM-G930F and SM-G935F) to Android 7.0.1 Nougat (not 7.1.1, which will come later). Meanwhile, a user on Reddit reports hearing from a Vodafone UK agent that the rollout will begin for Galaxy S7 devices on that network from Monday January 23. In terms of content, we're looking at optimisations, bugfixes, security patches and tweaks for the Samsung firmware, as well as some additional enhancements. These include improved Always On Display features, notifications, and quick toggles, as well as improved battery performance. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Design & Display No prizes here for guessing that the Galaxy S7 edge features Samsung's unique edge display design - that's where the display panel curves around the two longer sides of the phone using flexible OLED screen technology and contoured glass. It's a signature look, and a very attractive one at that, adding a bit of unusual visual interest to make the phone more than your typical smartphone slab. However, get the Galaxy S7 edge alongside the Galaxy S7 and you'll notice another major difference - the phone's size. Last year's Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge were more-or-less the same in terms of the physical device size and display size, with a few extra millimetres here and there to accommodate the display curvature. That's all changed for 2016, with the Galaxy S7 edge being a significantly bigger model than the regular Galaxy S7 and packing a 5.5in display compared to the non-edge model's 5.1in screen. The rumours of some additional curves to the Galaxy S7 edge back panel were true, although it's a very small, subtle change that could easily be missed - on the whole it's the spitting image of its predecessor, including the welcome use of glass and metal in the same places and a selection of similar metallic colour options. Just as with the Galaxy S6 series, the build quality here is as superb as the visual design and it's a very robust feeling phone to get to grips with. Also worth noting is that the camera bump has been reduced quite significantly, although it's still not flush. If you've been following the Galaxy S7 series rumours for a while you'll know that water and dust proofing was rumoured, but, as is often the case, there were some conflicting rumours saying it wasn't so. Fortunately, the naysayers were wrong, and the waterproofing that's been missing since the Galaxy S5 has made a welcome return here. It's an IP68 certification, officially good for up to 1.5m of water for up to 30 minutes, although this is really just a legal disclaimer more than anything. At the end of the day, we want waterproofing for rain, spills, and for those rare occasions where you drop your phone in a sink/toilet/river - and in all these scenarios it should be fine. It's also worth mentioning the waterproofing has been achieved through coating of the components of the phone with protective layers, so there are no port covers or rubber grommets to contend with. The display itself is Samsung's usual high end Super AMOLED with a QHD resolution (2560 x 1440 pixels), that's the same resolution as the smaller Galaxy S6 edge display, though naturally the larger screen size means a slightly lower pixel density than both last year's model and the non-edge Galaxy S7; the Galaxy S7 edge's pixel density is 543ppi. Not that any of this is a problem of course, these are all high enough pixel densities to produce incredibly sharp picture quality, while the Super AMOLED provides the rich colour and contrast we've come to expect from Samsung flagships, as well as very good brightness, sunlight performance, and viewing angles. A new feature for the Galaxy S7 edge is the always on display (or AOD, for short)...well, it's new for Samsung's flagship series, anyway - we have seen this elsewhere before though. Of course this doesn't mean the display is literally always on, at least not completely, but it does mean that you can pick some information to be displayed even when the phone is in its sleeping state in a low-power mode. This utilises OLED tech's unique advantage - selectively powering only certain pixels. A shortlist of available display options for AOD includes calendar, clock, and notifications, although we suspect it probably has wider applications than that. As if the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge display specs weren't impressive enough just on paper, prominent display testing and analysis source DisplayMate has published its in-depth examination of the screen technology in use on both handsets. The findings are pretty glowing, to say the very least, with DisplayMate delcaring Samsung's phones as having the brightest displays it has ever tested, together with the most accurate colour it has ever tested too! "While the Galaxy S7 screen size and resolution remain the same as the Galaxy S6, its has been significantly improved for most display performance metrics. The most noticeable one is a Maximum Brightness that is 24% higher than the Galaxy S6, which is quite a significant improvement in high ambient light. The Contrast and Contrast Rating for High Ambient Light have also significantly improved," states the report. "The display on the Galaxy S7 matches and even exceeds the performance of Galaxy Note 5 that we tested in 2015 and rated it as the Best Performing Smartphone Display that we had ever tested. This is a particularly significant enhancement because the 5.1 inch Galaxy S7 display is considerably smaller so the display components had to be scaled down by 20 percent in area from the larger 5.7 inch Galaxy Note 5, and then still deliver the same Maximum Brightness from the smaller pixels." Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Hardware & Battery Another revived feature is the inclusion of a microSD card slot, which is great for multimedia collections. Samsung hasn't reintroduced a removable battery pack, however, as this is a unibody phone, but the cell has been bumped up from last year's 2600mAh to an impressive 3600mAh, just as rumours suggested. Obviously this will need testing, but a battery pack that size should offer very good performance, plus we've found the last few Samsung flagships have offered excellent battery life generally and even better with the excellent Super Power Saving mode. The Galaxy S7 EDGE battery life is noticably better than its predecessor and easily one of the best battery performers from the current crop of flagships. For a start, it's a bigger cell than the Galaxy S6 EDGE at 3,600mAh instead of the old 2,600mAh. But it also seems plenty of optimisations have been made, with the phone clocking up a 17 hours and 48 minute result in our continuous video playback test. To put that in perspective, the Galaxy S6 EDGE result was 13 hours, so you get nearly five hours more life out of the Galaxy S7 EDGE - that's most of a working day! Of course you've also got plenty of connectivity capabilities built-in, all that you might expect, including NFC, 4G LTE, and Wi-Fi. It has a microUSB port but it's not the new Type-C version. Both storage options are pretty ample with the base model being 32GB going up to a full 64GB if you're splashing out. Certainly we can see the sense in the modern app and content market of ditching a 16GB lower-tier, but although the presence of 256GB of microSD support is a welcome one it's only really any good for multimedia as Samsung hasn't implemented Android Marshmallow's native Adoptive Storage feature - in other words it can't use cards for storing apps. While the flexibility is nice, we can't help but wonder why Samsung wouldn't either open up support for Adoptive Storage OR introduce a 128GB top-tier storage model above the 64GB one. Without either option, some power users may be in for a tricky time, but most users shouldn't have too much of a problem. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Processor Samsung has pulled its usual trick of shipping different processor models in different regions - the Samsung Exynos and the Qualcomm Snapdragon. Officially the firm has said that CPU performance will be 30% faster than the Galaxy S6 series while the GPU has a 64% uplift. Samsung does have an interesting and rather PC-like solution to performance-related heat this time as well - the handset contains a heat pipe filled with water, and when the SoC heats up the water turns to vapour before being cooled via a heatsink. Smart. Interestingly, Youtube channel JerryRigEverything has now released a video showing the Galaxy S7 edge being dismantled on camera - in case you were wondering what its insides looked like. As well as being quite cool generally, the video showcases the heat-pipe setup from around the 4:30 mark. Video of Galaxy S7 Edge Screen Replacement - Charging Port Repair - battery fix Having spent a bit of time with a few other high-end 2016 Android phones using similar processor setups, I can say that the Exynos 8890-based Galaxy S7 EDGE is definitely in a similar ballpark. In general operation things are silky smooth for navigating Android and hopping between apps, and even when playing intensive 3D games this phone definitely packs a punch. I can't say I noticed any latency issues or lag whatsoever, even when trying to deliberately push the device out of its comfort zone, although it must be said the back panel did heat up a fair bit. Benchmarks tests do show that the Snapdragon 820 edition does ever-so-slightly outperform the Exynos hardware, in particular when it comes to graphics, but the main takeaway here is the difference between the two in most scenarios is a handful of frames-per-second; importantly not enough to be noticeable in actual real-world use. A quick glance at most benchmarking test results and databases online shows that the Galaxy S7 EDGE Exynos model is still one of the top performing smartphones on the market, and I for one think this is reflected in actual operation. NOTHING seems to shake this handset, it just waltzes through whatever you throw at it effortlessly. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Camera Typical of Samsung's flagship series both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge feature the same camera setup and, again, the rumours were spot on here with a 12MP sensor. That's a lower megapixel rating than previous models, but this is entirely deliberate as Samsung, like many other Android OEMs, has focused on improving other areas of the camera hardware. The sensor uses a higher-rated 1.4um pixels, up from the Galaxy S6, to help with noise reduction, alongside a very wide f/1.7 aperture (last year's was f/1.9 - lower ratings are wider and therefore preferable in allowing in more light), and super-fast dual-pixel phase detection.  Sensor: 12MP, 1/2.6" Aperture: f/1.7 Pixel Size: 1.4 µm Focal Length: 26mm Flash: Dual-LED Features: Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), dual-pixel phase detection autofocus, simultaneous video and still capture, touch focus, HDR (auto), face and smile detection, panoramic capture, motion panorama, wide angle selfie, "hyperlapse", motion photo Video: 4K, 1080p, 720p Secondary Specs (Sensor, Aperture, Focal Length): 5MP, f/1.7, 22mm I've consistently been impressed by Samsung's camera setups for years now and with the Galaxy S7 this doesn't show any signs of changing. Yes, the sensor has a lower 12MP rating than the Galaxy S6's 16MP setup, but then again so does every major flagship on the market right now because, across the board, OEMs have finally twigged that more MP doesn't mean better image quality all on its own. Thus, plenty of other aspects of the imaging setup have been tweaked instead, including a very large aperture, pixel, and sensor size, resulting in much sharper details and less noise. The Galaxy S6's imaging capabilities were already impressive, but this is even more so.  The dynamic range is very capable as you can see between the shaded roof area and the brightly illuminated street. I also remain very fond of Samsung's approach to photography which is similar to its displays, that is; it is not afraid of punchy colour saturation and contrast. The result of this is really vibrant images, whether that's capturing a really bright blue sky on a sunny day, lush green vegetation, colourful flowers, or the crisp contrast on that statue head pictured below.  As you can see from this coffee bean shot, close-up work still gets plenty of detail and crispness. Capture speed is lightning quick thanks to the dual-pixel phase detection autofocus and this together with the detail-intensive sensor/aperture AND OIS means there's very little chance of picking up any blurriness. The camera interface is nice and simple to use too. Just as with the last few generations of Samsung flagships, here again I am a big fan of the ease-of-use with Samsung's camera hardware and software. Too often there are mobile camera configurations which, while actually sometimes a bit more capable in terms of image fidelity, are frustratingly complex to actually get the best results. I am far happier with Samsung's compromise, it makes me willing to actually use the camera and feel confident I will get good pictures from it, where with rivals, even if I know I can get a decent photo, I also know I will have to faff so much I rarely have the patience to even bother. It must be said, that even these rival cameras which are technically better in terms of image quality (for example, Microsoft's high-end Lumia PureView models) are not very far ahead of the Galaxy S7 at all, while the Galaxy S7 is tons more fun to use and consistently able to produce images you're proud of. For those who do want to fine-tune their photography the Galaxy S7 does include a "Pro" mode for manual control for key features like focus, brightness, ISO, exposure, and more. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Software Of course the Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE runs Android Marshmallow with a new build of TouchWiz over the top of it, but with that said it doesn't seem massively different from the build currently rolling out to the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 EDGE. As with that build, there are enhancements to the EDGE display functions, which now allow for gesture controls and a wider selection of apps to be used - there's also more room on the edge for more apps, shortcuts and info to be displayed. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Price & Availability Major UK networks have pricing plan details for both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. The following network deals are for 24 month contracts for the 32GB Galaxy S7 edge and on all mentioned networks it can be purchased in either Black Onyx or Gold Platinum colour options. EE - £9.99 Up-front and £54.99 per month O2 - £9.99 Up-front and £51 per month Vodafone - £9 Up-front and £56 per month Three - £49 Up-front and £47 per month - Pre-order by March 6 to receive handset by March 8; three days earlier than general release on March 11. Samsung Galaxy S7 EDGE Review: Conclusion A tremendously pleasing smartphone to use. It's been a while since I test-drove something I didn't want to give back, but the Galaxy S7 EDGE fits into that category quite comfortably. It looks sharp, feels reassuringly expensive and robust in the hand, the camera experience is an absolute joy. Performance is what you hope for from a flagship; it's fast, smooth and responsive, while the battery life is amongst the best available. The software is as close to stock Android as Samsung has ever come and as a result is one of the most hassle-free Samsung Galaxy devices I've used to date. Fancy picking yourself up a bargain?

As per hallowed internet tradition, we’re already awash with rumors and leaked images about what to expect, and when. Don't Miss: The NES Classic Edition was in stock at Best Buy for just 20 minutes mobilefun-olixar-ultra-thin-samsung-galaxy-s8-case-clearMore Flat screen or edge? One of the biggest questions remaining about the Galaxy S8 is whether we’re going to see one phone or two. Last year, Samsung released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge — basically, the same phones, but the Edge has a curved bezel that lets you do something with the side of the screen when the phone is on your bedside table, or something. So far, rumors are split on whether Samsung is going to go all-out on the edge with the Galaxy S8, or if we’re going to get a flat version as well. The edge version of the Galaxy S6 and S7 proved to be reasonably popular, so it’s not clear how many people Samsung would be annoying if it goes with an edge-only approach. One this is fairly clear: we are getting a version with a curved edge. Numerous design renderings and leaked photos have shown a curved-screen version, and given that the edge display is one thing that strongly differentiates Samsung from Apple (and the rest of the Android crowd), Samsung is unlikely to do away with the curve. Headphone jack is here to stay One rumor that looks likely is that Samsung will buck the trend and release a flagship smartphone with a headphone jack. This is a no-brainer move for Samsung: Apple has suffered a backlash from loyal fans over its decision to remove the headphone jack, and Samsung has proven itself capable of making a waterproof phone that keeps the headphone jack. This is good news for most of the human race, as a disturbing number of other Android manufacturers have decided to follow Apple’s lead and remove the headphone jack. HTC and Motorola are both pushing higher-end phones that are 3.5mm-jack-free, so Samsung should be able to get easy money selling to the small market of people who have normal headphones. Watch for two sizes Even though Samsung might stick solely with curved screens for the Galaxy S8, that doesn’t mean we’ll only get one phone. Leaks and rumors from insiders suggest we’ll see two Galaxy S8 models this year: a Galaxy S8, with a 5.7-inch screen, and a Galaxy S8 Plus with a 6.2-inch screen. Insert jokes about copying Apple here. If those screen sizes seem big, that’s because they are. Apple’s two iPhone models have 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, by comparison. If Samsung’s phones had the same-sized bezels, they would be objectively huge. But the saving grace here is that screen size does not equal phone size. By shrinking the bezel and using a curved screen, Samsung may well be able to fit a huge screen into a phone the same size as Apple’s iPhone, which would be a big advantage when it comes to usability. ghostek-galaxy-s8-renderMore Read More All the power you’d expect Between a combination of spec leaks and just accepting the obvious, we have a decent idea about what will be powering teh Galaxy S8. You can expect Samsung to use a combination of its own Exynos chip and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, depending on which carrier and region a phone is sold for. That chipset will be backed up by 4GB or 6GB of RAM, and 64GB of onboard storage would give Samsung back the edge, as Apple raised the base storage to 32GB on the new iPhones. One detail that has consistently come up is the existence of a “Game Mode,” a software setting that would fully unlock the phone’s processing power. In addition to boosting gaming power, it would also let Samsung win the battle of benchmarks. This is kind of amusing, as Samsung has been caught out before using software settings to try and game the benchmarks. A “Game Mode” would just make the power-mode software available to everyone, thereby making it OK to use on benchmarking apps.

Budget 2017: Why a post-Budget fall won't mean achhe din are over for markets. Read about it in our Budget 2017 coverage NEW DELHI: A team of senior Apple Inc. executives will fly down to India from the US next week to present to government officials the company's case for seeking tax benefits and other exemptions to set up manufacturing facilities in the country. Officials from various departments and ministries are likely to be present for the meeting in New Delhi, a government official said. The Cupertino-based company has sought a host of incentives and concessions, including a 15-year holiday on customs duty and relaxed labelling norms, to start manufacturing in the country. Departments of industry, revenue and information technology will discuss Apple's demands, the official said. Apple earlier sought permission to open fully owned retail outlets in India, but sought waiver of compulsory 30 per cent local sourcing norm on the grounds it was bringing cutting-edge technology to India. The finance ministry did not allow the exemption. Government officials, while open to discussing the tech major's wish list, said it is difficult to make exception for one company when none of its rivals have demanded any such concession. "No company is special for us… We will have to see what can be offered within the current framework of rules," said a senior official at the department of industrial policy and promotion. Apple plans to set up a manufacturing unit in Bengaluru this year where it will assemble its products. The company, according to people in the know, does not want to source locally and has sought duty to be reduced on components for iPhone. Several mobile handset makers, including Huawei and Xiaomi from China, manufacture products in India. Apple CEO Tim Cook during his visit to India last year had said the country was the next big market for the company. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories in the country. Electronic manufacturing is one of the focus areas of the government's Make in India campaign and companies receive benefits under Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (MSIPS). The government also provides incentives for investments in special economic zones. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

A new patent application has revealed Microsoft is developing a phone that can simply unfold to become a tablet. It comes just days after it was revealed by The Korea Herald that Samsung and LG are planning to launch similar bendable phones later this year. Scroll down for video  Microsoft's patent shows off a hinged device that can be unfolded to double its screen size. Microsoft's patent describes a a device that is flexible supported by a flexible hinge, according to MSpoweruser. This could build on the work done for the firm's Surface Book laptop, which relies on a smart hinge to operate.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Moon Express is closer to mining the lunar surface for...

HOW WILL IT WORK?  Last year Samsung was awarded a patent for a radical design that allows a phones to fold in two. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it.    The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge.    It also says LG will unveil a similar product, and believes it can sell 100,000 foldable devices in the fourth quarter.  Last year Samsung was awarded a patent for a radical design that allows a phones to fold in two. It could lead to a handset that can easily transform into a tablet - simply by unfolding it.    Samsung is expected to release a new handset that folds in two like a notebook as early as January next year. A screenshot from a conceptual video showing what the device may look like is pictured The document shows a narrow Samsung device with a screen that bends and folds like an old-school flip phone handset, with a large hinge.  The device is described as something that can be 'folded or unfolded semi automatically.'  The patent also referred to both a 'flexible' and 'secondary' display, which is supposed to activate when you fold the device, according to International Business Times. According to previous claims from Korean news site ETNews, the product is known internally as a 'smartlet' and has a 7inch screen when unfolded, which becomes a 5inch device when folded. Samsung will apparently start mass producing the 'smartlet' this year for a 2017 release, and has spent three years developing the technology. Dubbed 'Foldable Valley', the device is expected to take advantage of bendy plastic screens being developed by Samsung's display division. The patent drawings reveal a folding design similar to a concept Samsung is known to be developing. In a call with investors in January, director of Samsung's Display division Lee Chang-hoon said 'Development of Foldable OLED is taking place according to our plan...We are planning on mass-production and release this product by discussing with out partners.'  The design can be folded and placed on a table, depending on how much of the screen is needed. The South Korean tech giant previously said it will launch foldable devices in 2016 and trusted rumour blog SamMobile reported earlier this year that anonymous sources claim the device is already being tested in China. The source, who claims to have in-depth knowledge of the device, said it is being developed under the codename Project Valley.  And they added that two versions of the phone are being tested - one with a Snapdragon 620 processor and another with a Snapdragon 820. When folded, the handset looks almost like a wallet. Elsewhere, the device is rumoured to have 3GB of RAM, a microSD card slot and a non-removable battery. Samsung told MailOnline it doesn't comment on rumour or speculation.   Samsung has been teasing bendable screens for years and at CES in 2013 revealed a flexible Oled screen called Youm. The firm said at the time it could make high-resolution screens on extremely thin plastic, instead of glass, so it could be bent without shattering. The patents have led to rumours that manufacturers could be taking inspiration from 'clamshell' design phones that were popular in the 1990s. Pictured is the Motorola StarTAC handset, which was first released in 1996 However, a notebook style phone would need to bend at a very sharp angle and would need to withstand considerable wear and tear, leading some commentators to suggest the rumour should be taken with a pinch of salt. LG is similarly developing incredibly bendy screens. In 2014, it showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing. Samsung is not the only firm working on highly flexible screens. In 2014, LG showed off a working 18-inch Ultra HD screen (pictured) that uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. At the time, it said it could make its debut in 2017 This allowed the screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport.  At the time, the company said it could make its debut in 2017. In May, it debuted a a concept ultra thin 'wallpaper TV' less than 1mm thick, and at four lbs (1.9kg) it is so light it can be attached to the wall using just magnets. At IFA, a demonstration showed an LG employee pulling the screen away from the wall and bending it, to prove it carries on working. In May LG debuted a a concept ultrathin 'wallpaper TV' (pictured) less than 1mm thick, and at 1.9kg (4lbs) it is so light it can be attached to the wall using just magnets Read more: Samsung¿s first smartphone with a foldable display might launch in January - SamMobile ¿¿¿¿ IT¿¿¿ ¿¿! ¿¿¿¿ Samsung Galaxy X: New patent sheds light on foldable 'Project Valley' smartphone Microsoft patents a foldable phone-to-tablet mobile device - MSPoweruser Share or comment on this article e-mail 22 shares Most watched News videos Serena Williams awkwardly neglects her fiancé after Aus Open win Many Clouds dies after beating Thistlecrack in the Cotswold Chase 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Incredible moment truck crashes through middle of bus Grandma accused of killing son-in-law celebrated during testimony Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border George and Laura Bush welcome the Obamas to the White House 2009 Harriet was rescued from a South Korean meat farm Look what the cat dragged 'OUT'!

This lets you type in multiple languages simultaneously and take advantage of the auto-correct function to receive appropriate suggestions without having to switch between different keyboards manually. This tutorial explains how to set up multilingual typing on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. System requirements for multilingual typing Multilingual typing requires the following: iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10.0 or later Appropriate Dictionary files downloaded through the Settings app QuickType keyboards in selected languages Multilingual typing is currently supported in the following languages: English (U.S.) English (Australia) English (Canada) English (India) English (Singapore) English (UK) French (France) French (Belgium) French (Canada) French (Switzerland) German (Germany) German (Austria) German (Switzerland) Italian Portuguese (Brazil) Portuguese (Portugal) Spanish (Spain) Spanish (Latin America) Spanish (Mexico) Chinese (Simplified) Chinese (Traditional) Chinese (English on the Chinese keyboard) Apple typically refreshes its iOS Feature Availability webpage with an up-to-date list of new languages supported by iOS 10’s multilingual typing as they’re added. How to set up multilingual typing on iPhone 1) On your iPhone, go to Settings → General → Dictionary. 2) Select any languages you’d like to use with the QuickType keyboard. Don’t go back until the dictionary file for the selected language has finished downloading. You can select multiple languages to use for multilingual typing. 3) Now head over to Settings → General → Keyboards → Keyboards. 4) Tap Add New Keyboard and add keyboards in the languages you just downloaded. For example, if you downloaded French and German dictionaries you would add both French and German keyboards to your list of active keyboards in the system. Tip: Reorder your keyboards here to customize how they appear in the popup menu. 5) Close out the Settings app. How to use multilingual typing on iPhone Once you’ve added keyboards and download dictionaries you wish to use with them, use the QuickType keyboard as you normally would. The system will analyze what you’re typing and intelligently provide next-word suggestions in an appropriate language. No longer will auto-correct kick in, trying to correct words typed in another language. Want to change the order of next-word suggestions? No problem, go to Settings → General → Language & Region → Preferred Language Order and rearrange the list. If you, say, reorder your preferred languages so that French comes before English, the first QuickType suggestion should be in French rather than in English. Multilingual typing not working as expected? You probably need to adjust your iPhone’s regional settings in Settings → General → Language & Region → iPhone Language. For example, if device language is set to English (US) and you’re using that keyboard rather than French, you might only be allowed to type in English. But as you switch to another keyboard, like German, you should be able to write in both English and German. As mentioned, multilingual typing is limited to the supported languages that have both the dictionary and the keyboard in iOS. Not a fan of Apple’s predictive QuickType keyboard? Try a third-party one which allows multilingual typing, such as SwiftKey. Do you use multilingual typing on your iPhone?

As far as I know (experience) you only need to have the languages you want to type in the list of “Preferred Language Order” Tom M Das funktioniert bei mir nicht. Martynet For this I use SwiftKey, because Czech language is not supported by Apple yet. But I have to say, I’m very happy with SwiftKey. Yes, occasionally there is hiccups, but I assume Apple will never allow any 3rd party keyboard work as good as the original one. It definitely got better since the beginning of iOS 8, but sometimes it still lags and takes a second or two to appear and sometimes you have to restart iMessage app, when swiftkey doesn’t launch at all.

It seems the two tech giants are heading back to court again after the US Appeals Court reopened the patent case. The case originated over the claims that Samsung copied the original design for the iPhone, along with various features including the home screen and bezels. Apple originally had won its claims of patent infringement and was awarded $1 billion in damages. However, that ruling was overturned and the amount was drastically lowered to a paltry $399 million. Samsung is hoping that the results of the reopening of this case will either reduce or remove the need to pay Apple in damages. The history of court cases between Apple and Samsung has been exhaustive, but we’re hoping everything can finally be put to bed sooner rather than later.

Big Apple Circus Assets Going Up For Sale In Bankruptcy Auction Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Big Apple Circus Assets Going Up For Sale In Bankruptcy Auction Image courtesy of saeru January 16, 2017 1:07 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk send in the clowns big apple circus circuses circus bankruptcy auctions If you’re the kind of person who’s always dreamed of putting on your very own performance under the Big Top, your fantasy could become real: after filing for bankruptcy last year, Big Apple Circus is putting its assets on the auction block. Bidding is open now and will remain open until February, with the company selling off things like 24 cases of juggling balls, two branded tents, food stands, supplies, toys, and even the Big Apple trademark. Showing you’re a true circus fan won’t come cheap, however: items are available in bulk lots only, and there’s a $50,000 minimum deposit on any lots. The circus was founded in 1977 and declared bankruptcy in November after a failed “Save the Circus” fundraising campaign, PIX-11 points out. It hasn’t been a great year for circuses so far, as Ringling Bros. announced this weekend that it would be closing down its circus for good come May.

More: Join the Apple club with our complete guide to switching from Android to iOS Our comprehensive guide to iOS will help you get started, and provide you with advice on how to set it up your device, navigate around, and come to grips with some of operating system’s most useful functions. Setting up your new iPhone or iPad The first thing you will do when you get your new iOS device is, of course, turn it on. Step 1: You will be greeted with a screen that says, “Hello,” and a message at the bottom asking you to “Press home to open.” Step 2:  Select your language, and then your country or region. Step 3: At this point, you’ll need to activate your device. You can select a Wi-Fi network and log in as you normally would, or you can tap Use Cellular Connection to utilize your data. Step 4: You will then be asked to enable or disable Location Services. You can disable this later if you wish. If you enable it now, however, then your device will be able to automatically set the correct time. Step 5: If you purchased an iPhone 5s or later — or an iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or iPad mini 3 or later — then your device comes equipped with Touch ID. You will be asked to set it up at this point, which can be done by following the on-screen instructions. You will be able to set up more fingerprints later. Once done, you will be asked to set up a six-digit passcode. We recommend that you do so. You can tap Set Up Touch ID Later or Passcode Options, but, either way, you will eventually need to set up a passcode. Take a minute to get this out of the way. Step 6: If you’re reading this guide, then you probably don’t have anything to restore from a backup. If you do, however, then you can select it here. If not, tap Set Up as New iPhone or iPad. If you’re moving from an Android device, then choose Move Data From Android. You will be asked to tap Continue. On your Android device, you will then have to download an app called Move to iOS. Launch the app on your Android device and tap Continue when prompted, then follow the on-screen instructions. Step 7: If you already have an Apple ID, log in and tap Next in the top-right corner. If not, select Don’t have an Apple ID. Step 8: You can set up Siri on the following screen. If you want to set it up now, tap Set Up Siri and follow the on-screen instructions. Step 9: If you have an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you will also see a screen titled, “Choose Your Click.” Press 1, 2, or 3 to adjust the feel of the taptic engine, which activates when you press the home button. Whereas the first option will feel like a gentle tap on your hand, the second and third will feel a bit firmer. Select your desired feedback and press the Home button to test the feature, and once chosen, tap Next in the top-right corner to continue. Step 10: The last screen will ask you to choose your desired view. You can select either Standard or Zoomed, the latter of which uses larger text and controls. Once chosen, tap Next in the top-right corner. At this point, you can tap Get Started to begin using your iOS device.

Others, like HTC, LG, Huawei and Lenovo made great phones too, but what's around the corner in 2017? It's worth knowing before you commit yourself to that 24 month contract. Everything is going to become a lot more clear soon. Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017 is kicking off at the end of February, and historically big players like Samsung, LG, Sony and HTC have used the show to reveal their upcoming cellular beauties. You can stay on top of everything MWC 2017 here.  See related  Best UK smartphones of 2017: These are the best mobile phones to buy right now Best smartphone deals in the UK 2017: The best Galaxy S7, iPhone 6s and Nexus 6P deals in the UK Where possible, the list below will contain official release dates, but if we're using guesswork or internet rumours then the date/month will be marked TBC – and we'll be keeping the list up to date with the latest information we can get our hands on. Upcoming smartphones 2017: The release dates you NEED to know Samsung Galaxy S8 – March/April 2017 TBC HTC 2011 – March/April 2017 TBC LG G6 – April 2017 TBC OnePlus 4 – June-July 2017 TBC Lenovo Moto Z 2017 – mid 2017 TBC iPhone 7s – September 2017 TBC Upcoming smartphones 2017 Samsung Galaxy S8 First out of the blocks will likely be Samsung, fresh off the back of having to cease production of one of the most anticipated smartphones of all time: the Galaxy Note 7.  Assuming the Galaxy name lives on, we're likely looking at the Samsung Galaxy S8 as early as March or April. Alongside the usual cutting-edge speed boost, rumours abound about an iPhone-style home button, a rear fingerprint sensor and a 4K screen to really make the Gear VR pop. We should know more about this handset sooner, rather than later. That said, given the issues Samsung has had with batteries and embarassing product recalls, it's likely that Samsung will be inclined to delay release for extremely thorough testing. So even if the S8 is announced at MWC 2017, you probably won't be able to buy one until April at the earliest.  You can keep an eye on the latest Samsung Galaxy S8 rumours here. HTC U Ultra Surprise! After ditching the "One" and "M" from last year's flagship (the HTC 10), HTC has switched to another naming convention: 2017's flagships will be the HTC U Ultra and U Ultra Play handsets. What do we know about them? Quite a lot, in fact. You can find our full hands-on review here, but the main headline is it has not one but two screens. The second screen is a bar that sits along the top of the main screen to display notifications and shortcuts to frequently used apps. Handy. Elsewhere, it's a 5.7in 2,560x1,440 handset packing a quad-core 2.15GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB RAM. The 5.2in 1080p Play version is considerably weaker, with an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor. Oh, and both phones are following Apple's lead and ditching the headphone jack. The phone is likely to go on sale in mid February, so keep your eyes on Alphr for our full review then.  LG G6 LG made the most interesting handset of 2016 hands-down, with its interesting modular design that allowed you to upgrade elements. We wouldn't count on the firm doing that again, judging by the way extra modules have been thin on the ground and hastily bundled free of charge, but in an industry that's stagnating, it's hard not to admire this kind of new thinking. Video of Wish list for the ideal smartphone The teaser above suggests the wait may be over and a new phone from LG could be with us as soon as next month. You can read all the latest LG G6 rumours here, but the TL;DR version is that you can expect a waterproof 5.7in 1,440 x 2,880 handset with typically beefy specs. OnePlus 4 The OnePlus 3 and 3T have shaken up the whole industry. It's our favourite handset of 2016 by far, managing to shake up not just the high-end market by undercutting the big boys, but also eclipsing the midrangers its price suggests it is. The OnePlus 4 is very likely to continue this trend, but we likely won't see a new one until June 2017 at the earliest. Early rumours point to a glass body, 8GB RAM and a QuadHD screen. You can read more about the latest OnePlus 4 rumours here.  Lenovo Moto Z (2017) Not a great deal is known about the future of Lenovo's top-end Moto range, but the Moto Z was the first hard proof we've seen that modular handsets have a future. The MotoMods just clip on and work: whether they're an extended battery, or an external speaker. The good news is that it looks like Lenovo are sticking to their guns. The company says they're looking to make at least 12 mods per year. And they're supposed to be forwards compatible too: “Moto Mods developed today are designed to work with future generations of Moto Z phones,” the company wrote in June, so feel free to buy now if you're happy to commit to the Lenovo ecosystem. Apple iPhone 7s Finally, there's Apple. The iPhone 7 was a quality smartphone, but it was overshadowed by the deliberate omission of the headphone jack for the first time. We're hoping that the 's' version of the iPhone puts things right, but it's very early to tell at the moment. There are rumours of wireless charging and an OLED screen for the first time, but so far it looks like anyone wishing for the headphone jack to return will be disappointed. We likely won't see it until September 2017 though, so you've got a long wait ahead of you if your handset simply must have an Apple logo on it. You can read about the latest iPhone 7s rumours here.

Comments Submitted by MarkT_42 on Sat, 2015-07-18 02:43. The OnePlus 2 is surely worth a mention. Submitted by ZacH on Fri, 2015-08-07 01:06. Im stuck between that and the Moto X.... Haven't heard much about the Lumia but I've always wanted one of those. The slim factor of the OnePlus 2 beat everything in my book but the camera & screen & fast charging on the Moto X has me stuck between the two. Currently have the iPhone 5 due for an upgrade for the past year but I'm uninterested in the past phones released. Submitted by MarkT_42 on Fri, 2015-08-07 05:55. I'm discounting anything without a USB type C port as I don't have much luck with the current-style connectors - I've two devices that have started to become really finicky about exactly which charging cable to use. What's really made me stop and think is the £99 tablet that's much more pleasurable to use than the £300 - £600 phones I'm looking at. I also spent some time without a PC and got frustrated by limitations of android applications - may well move over to WIndows 10, though perhaps the second generation of devices. My current tech makes sitting on the fence quite pleasant. Submitted by Yasir Gulzar on Wed, 2015-10-14 13:57. You may want to take into account OxygenOS which is in its infancy and has a number of problems. Take a look at the OnePlus forums. However on the plus side these issues can be fixed via software updates... Submitted by JohnW on Thu, 2015-10-15 19:07. How about the Lumia 950 or even better the 750/850? Submitted by Richard Hayes on Thu, 2015-10-15 20:22. Lumia 950XL is the one I'm most looking forward to, but you seem to have missed it from your list. Submitted by Seth Setiadha on Fri, 2015-10-16 12:38. Looking forward for Microsoft surface phone Submitted by Richard Hayes on Sat, 2015-10-17 09:34. Sadly for a journalist who is supposed to know about new phones, they seem unaware that the new Lumia's were never branded '940' and '940XL', that might have been a possible name mooted a few months ago, but it was never selected. If you're in the business of reviewing phones, please at least make sure you take you subject at least slightly seriously... Submitted by Sebastian Bartlett on Thu, 2015-10-22 09:57. HTC are still going? Submitted by Forine on Fri, 2015-11-06 16:45. oneplus x being released yesterday was surely a major excitement. i for one am hoping to get one Submitted by qpw3141 on Tue, 2015-11-24 14:27. So the only thing you know about the iphone is that it will follow Motorola in making it's offering somewhat waterproof. (Nothing is completely waterproof - calm down and think before you write.) It 'might' have an OLED display (but then again, it might not) - which has certainly been done before. So, even based on the rumours, all you have is that Apple will be playing catch up in a couple of areas, and yet you manage to derive from this that: 'it should be more revolutionary than evolutionary'? Sorry, you still fail the Turing test. Submitted by brandi on Wed, 2015-12-02 03:21. who ever wrote this is not the brightest.. There already is a NEXUS 6! Its made by Motorola and was released October 15, 2014! Submitted by TweetleBeetle on Thu, 2015-12-24 22:19. Because that's not one the MAJORITY of people are looking forward to - which is the intent of this article. Lumia is and has always been second tier. Submitted by TweetleBeetle on Thu, 2015-12-24 22:19. These articles always overblow the iPhones. They haven't been leading or revolutionary in over 5 years. Submitted by TweetleBeetle on Thu, 2015-12-24 22:20. They've had one of the best selling smartphones for 3 years now. Submitted by Haxortech on Sat, 2016-01-02 18:40. I was confused by this at first too Brandi, but I believe they meant the nexus 6 2016 edition, since we aren't sure what it will be called. Could be the nexus 6PX, who knows lol. Submitted by duncan on Fri, 2016-01-08 23:12. The new Xiaomi mi5 should be released in a couple of weeks. Rocking usb-c connectors, super fast processing , 4gb ram, and 5.2" screen. Or go for the 64 GB mi pad 2, also with usb-c and windows 10 OS option. Submitted by TV John on Wed, 2016-02-24 08:46. Nope, not wishing to wait for any of those.

The move would enable Apple to reduce costs in order to price the iPhone more competitively, as well as expand market share in the country. According to a report by India’s New Delhi Television (NDTV), senior executives from Apple are expected to arrive on Jan. 25 to discuss production of the iPhone and the opening of Apple Store retail outlets in India, in addition to other matters. During the course of Apple’s discussions with the Indian government to date, Apple has requested that the Indian government provides long-term preferential tax breaks in addition to other incentives. However, Indian officials recently told the media that giving Apple exclusive preferential tax breaks would constitute unfair treatment for businesses with existing manufacturing operations in India.

[Poll of the Week] Apps & Games Features Newsby Jimmy Westenberg2 weeks ago 50 223 15 Last week’s poll summary: Out of over 1,800 total votes, 32.3% of our readers said their favorite announcement from CES 2017 was the new ASUS ZenFone AR. 13.3% said they were most excited for Samsung’s Chromebook Plus & Pro, while 11.7% said their favorite announcement was the Faraday Future FF91. Mobile payments have been around for a pretty long time now, but they didn’t start catching on until the release of Apple Pay and Android Pay a few years ago. While Google, of course, wants all Android users to use Android Pay, Samsung wants its users to use Samsung Pay, and the same goes for Apple with Apple Pay. And if for some reason you aren’t fully satisfied with those three options, we have access to plenty more mobile payment services to round out the already crowded landscape. Chase Bank and even Walmart have their own proprietary services, for example. Android Pay: what is it, how does it work and who supports it? Samsung Pay: what is it, how does it work and how do I use it? Whichever service you decide to use, though, mobile payments are designed to make your life easier and save you time. So tell us – do you use mobile payments, or are you still not convinced they save time and effort? Be sure to cast your vote in the poll attached below, and speak up in the comments if you have anything else to add. We look forward to hearing what you have to say!

Alphabet’s smart home brand Nest expands to Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain Posted Jan 16, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Autopilot for Tesla HW2 vehicles rolling out now to all compatible cars As Amazon, Apple and others tee up smart home strategies with apps, hubs and new devices, Google is also turning up the temperature, so to speak, on its own ambitions. Today, Nest — the smart home business that Google acquired for $3.2 billion a few years ago — announced at DLD in Munich that it would be expanding sales of its thermostat, camera and smoke alarm products in four more countries in Europe — Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain. Nest Learning Thermostat’s will retail for €249. The Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm will see for €119. The Nest Cam Indoor will cost €199; and the Nest Cam Outdoor will sell for €199, all including taxes. Pre-orders start today with a targeted delivery date of mid-February, the company said. The expansion is a long time coming for Nest, whose smart thermostats, cameras and smoke alarms are used in some 190 countries, but (up to now) have been only sold and supported officially in seven. (And even that rollout has been slow: the last country expansion, also in Europe, happened in September 2014.) Lionel Paillet, Nest’s GM for Europe, explained that the delay was deliberate — not the result of any clouds or controversy related to Google’s ownership. (There is some backstory here: Nest has been the subject of some controversy over what, exactly, its future would be as part of the search and Android giant as it also looked to make its own-branded moves into the area of the connected home, specifically via its Google Home hub that competes with the Echo from Amazon. More immediately, in Germany, after the Google acquisition, Nest was targeted by German activists who created a spoof site that acted as a criticism of Google’s privacy policies. The site was taken down after legal threats.) “The main reason for waiting to launch is that we’ve been busy to bring scale to business,” Paillet said in an interview. “Contrary to some launching everything everywhere and hoping for the best, we had a specific strategy. Several years into our UK and Netherlands businesses, for example, we’ve been selling extremely well and are now in millions of homes globally, growing 50% year-on-year. The smart home is still a new concept, and we really wanted to get that base before going to our next countries.” Despite this, Paillet does not have details on what the roadmap will be for future launches, including when we can expect to see Nest’s first official launches in Asia. Matt Rogers, the co-founder of Nest who is the company’s head of product, said that he thinks the smart home market is still “three to five years” away from being more ubiquitous and unified. Part of the challenge in adding the most recent four countries was to make sure that the products could be localised correctly. In the case of Germany, for example, there was not only making sure that voice recognition worked correctly in German, but that the hardware itself would be usable in the country. The screws for the smoke detectors, he noted, had to be tested and adjusted to work on the materials typically used in ceilings in the country, since these devices cannot be mounted on walls in the country. Although a group of Nest employees migrated out of Nest to work on Google’s bigger IoT platform last year, and co-founder Tony Fadell notably parted ways with the company, Paillet says that Nest will continue to develop as a business. He said that the Nest API has picked up 26,000 developers in the last two years and that there is no plans to retire Nest. “I think it’s looking great for Nest as a brand,” he said. One key point is that while Google has been building Nest as an extension that will interoperate with whatever home hub you might have in place, be it Google’s own or the Echo from Amazon. “It’s about giving a choice to consumers,” Paillet said. Rogers added that Amazon Echo is actually the most popular integration for Nest today — no surprise considering that Echo has far and away been the most popular home hub to date. As with previous launches, there are several local partners being named at the same time as the new market expansions. In Germany and Austria, Nest Protect smoke + carbon monoxide alarm, Nest Cam Indoor, and Nest Cam Outdoor will be sold through Amazon, Media Markt and Conrad. The Nest Learning Thermostat will be available later this year. In Italy, Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Cam Indoor, and Nest Cam Outdoor is available from Amazon, Media World and ePrice for pre-order. In Spain, Nest Learning Thermostat, Nest Cam Indoor, and Nest Cam Outdoor is available from Amazon, Media Markt and El Corte Inglés for pre-order from today. Other partners that will help with installations include Baxi in Spain; Engie Italy and Wind Tre in Italy; and the Generali Group via CosmosDirekt in Germany.

Should you buy one? Read More inside it. SSDs are much faster than their hard disc drive predecessors, but the speed has come at a cost: storage capacity. This can lead to a reliance on external drives, and the constant need to juggle your available space. Even if you have terabytes of storage on your desktop iMac or Mac Pro, it’s still handy to know how that space is being used. Today we’ll look at the best tools to analyze, visualize, and ultimately help clean up your drives and create more free space. Apps That Didn’t Make the Cut First we’ll take a look at what was left out and why, particularly considering we included a few of these the last time we covered this topic. Disk Inventory X was once the go-to app for storage management, as it creates a visual “map” of your drives. Unfortunately it’s not had an update since 2005, and though it still technically works, there are a few weird quirks that show up in macOS Sierra. WhatSize ($30) is premium tool that looks great, but comes with a premium price tag. Even though it’s powerful and designed for macOS Sierra, we think $30 is a steep price to pay considering what you can get for free. You can download a free trial to find out if it’s really worth your money. We also left free app JDiskReport off the list, which requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed. The JRE isn’t necessarily a bad thing (it’s the leaky Java Browser Extension that gave the technology a bad name 5 Easy Ways to Infect Your Mac With Malware 5 Easy Ways to Infect Your Mac With Malware You might think it's pretty difficult to infect your Mac with malware, but there are always exceptions. Here are five ways you can get your computer dirty. Read More ), but you can get similar results without installing Java from one of these other apps. Advertisement macOS Sierra’s Storage Management Apple has always provided a simple way to visualize used disk space under the Apple > About This Mac > Storage tab. While limited, it splits your usage up by Documents, Apps, Photos, Mail, and so on. In macOS Sierra you can click the Manage button on this screen to dig a little deeper. The Storage Management tool can also be accessed like any other app using Spotlight, or under the Applications > Utilities folder. This is where you can access a few of Sierra’s big new features, including Optimized Storage which automatically tidies up your old media, and Store in iCloud. The latter option places rarely-used files and folders into iCloud storage, purging available space on your local machine. There’s good reason to avoid it Upgraded to macOS Sierra? Stay Away From These 2 Features Upgraded to macOS Sierra? Stay Away From These 2 Features One is supposed to keep certain folders on all your Macs in sync, the other is supposed to intelligently free up space by deleting files you don’t need. Neither work as advertised. Read More , especially if you use a professional-level app like Logic or Final Cut. You can however use the Storage Management tool to list files that fall under Applications, Documents, and core apps like Photos, Mail and GarageBand. It’s not a great way to visualize free space, but you can hover a file and click on the X to delete it right away. Click on the magnifying glass icon to reveal it in Finder. You can also enable Empty Trash Automatically and Reduce Clutter under Recommendations to maximize available space. If you’re feeling more adventurous, consider using Automator to move rarely-used files via FTP or to a local network drive Clean Your Mac's Storage With Sierra or Just Use Automator Clean Your Mac's Storage With Sierra or Just Use Automator Whether you want to increase available storage using the cloud or take matters into your own hands, here's how macOS Sierra can help lighten the load. Read More . Grand Perspective You can either download Grand Perspective for free from the project’s SourceForge page, or pay $1.99 and get it from the Mac App Store. According to the developer “you’ll get the same app either way,” though if you buy it you’ll be actively supporting development. The project is still under active development, and works great with modern Mac operating systems including macOS Sierra. Grand Perspective basically takes the place of Disk Inventory X, and displays your files as color-coded blocks. These blocks are grouped by folder and size, so you can quickly see which files and folders are taking up the most space. Click on a file and hit Reveal to be taken to that directory to tidy things up. You can also use the Zoom controls to navigate the map. The app allows you to scan your whole drive, or just a directory of your choice. A whole-drive scan can take a while, and you’ll need to wait for the entire scan to complete before you can see any results. Summary: A great way to visualize used space, with handy menu options for repeating previous scans. OmniDiskSweeper OmniDiskSweeper was last updated in 2013 but fortunately it still works well in macOS Sierra. It allows you to list files and folders by size using a simple and lightweight interface. You can size your whole disk, external drives, or just a folder of your choice. There’s no visual map of your drive, just a list view. The interfae may be simple, but still allows you to delete files right there from within the app. You also don’t have to wait for the entire scan to complete, as OmniDiskSweeper starts showing you what it’s found from the second you hit Scan. Summary: A simple tool for finding big files and the folders that contain them. It works as well as could be expected, and it’s free. DiskWave Last updaed for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, DiskWave hasn’t had any work done on it since 2012. But just like OmniDiskSweeper, it works just fine in macOS Sierra, even if the interface feels a little outdated at this stage. The app uses a Finder-like tabulated interface to isolate big files and folders, which can be listed by name or size. You’ll find all of your drives and attached devices on the left-hand side, along with a few common locations like the Home directory and your Documents. The app begins scanning as soon as you start it up, and you can then filter by drive or location. Hit the Trash button you clean things up, Reval (which should read “Reveal”) to show the folder in Finder, and Quick Look to preview media. Summary: Not a bad free app, though personally I prefer OmniDiskSweeper’s lightweight approach to listing files by size. Premium Option: DaisyDisk ($10) This might be a “free” list, but it’s worth mentioning one additional premium option. In that case, DaisyDisk is worth a mention. At $10 it won’t break the bank, and the app manages to look stunning while performing one very simple task. DaisyDisk uses a bright and colorful interface to display your used space as a pie chart. You can choose to analyze your internal drive, external USB storage, or a folder of your choice. Being a premium app, it’s actively maintained and has been optimized for use with macOS Sierra. Summary: DaisyDisk might be just what you’re looking for if the rest of these apps don’t cut it. Grab a free trial from the homepage before you buy.

 Analysts worry that Apple’s rumoured push into movies is totally incompatible with its culture Hannah Roberts Jan. 16, 2017, 10:44 AM 2,486 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook, left, appearing on "Carpool Karaoke."Carpool Karaoke Apple's reported push into original video content is "not compatible with its business model or culture," Apple analyst Horace Dediu told Business Insider. The Wall Street Journal report, which was published last week, said that the California-based technology giant has been talking to "veteran producers" about both original TV shows and movies, but Dediu doesn't think this move into content is voluntary. Instead, Apple is reacting to the fact that it's unable to license proprietary content from the likes of Amazon and Netflix on acceptable terms, Dediu said. It's not the first time the analyst has argued that Apple is not well-suited to being a content producer, and he attributes it to the fact that Apple wants to have global solutions but content is regional. Speaking at a UBS Tech Conference in November as a member of a panel of Apple experts, Dediu said: "Content is a huge problem to attack on a global scale. Take Netflix for example, what would they do in China? ... Each region has a certain taste. A lot of things in content are local ... Content is culture. Apple wants to create its own culture. The Apple brand is universal by their definition of it. When you're dealing with content, it gets messy." Dediu isn't the only one to respond negatively to the report. Andreessen Horowitz partner Benedict Evans said in his newsletter that Apple's exploration into making original TV content "feels like a lack of self-confidence in the core product, if true." Here's Dediu's full comment to Business Insider: "Content is neither an attractive business nor one which is compatible with Apple's business model or culture. The reasons for becoming a producer may have more to do with an impatience with existing sources of content to license on acceptable terms and with the rise of proprietary content from alternative distributors (Amazon, Netflix). I would therefore read this as reactive move rather than something Apple would do voluntarily. It's table stakes for being in the game, unfortunately. Furthermore, there is a glut of new programming and talent and resources for production are fully allocated so their entry will be doubly difficult. They're having to buy in at a high price. Having said that, we know that they've been testing the waters and making some bids for content. I would guess this has been a contingency plan for some time."

Alphabet’s smart home brand Nest expands to Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain Posted Jan 16, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Autopilot for Tesla HW2 vehicles rolling out now to all compatible cars As Amazon, Apple and others tee up smart home strategies with apps, hubs and new devices, Google is also turning up the temperature, so to speak, on its own ambitions. Today, Nest — the smart home business that Google acquired for $3.2 billion a few years ago — announced at DLD in Munich that it would be expanding sales of its thermostat, camera and smoke alarm products in four more countries in Europe — Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain. Nest Learning Thermostat’s will retail for €249. The Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide alarm will see for €119. The Nest Cam Indoor will cost €199; and the Nest Cam Outdoor will sell for €199, all including taxes. Pre-orders start today with a targeted delivery date of mid-February, the company said. The expansion is a long time coming for Nest, whose smart thermostats, cameras and smoke alarms are used in some 190 countries, but (up to now) have been only sold and supported officially in seven.

This is a walkthrough of what’s new in macOS Sierra and how it compares to OS X 10.11 in important areas. Advertisement This new upgrade may sound like OS X 10.12, and in some cases it looks very much like OS X, but Apple announced a name change to macOS to bring it in line with iOS 10 and the other operating systems that the company is shipping to users. Here are a list of reasons to install macOS Sierra and reasons not to, which can help you decide if these features are worthwhile. Keep in mind macOS Sierra 10.12.1 is likely coming in the next week. Many of the new macOS Sierra features deliver on user convenience with faster login, an easier way to clean up your storage and sync your files to iCloud so that you always have the most important files with you. Learn what’s new in mac OS Sierra and how macOS 10.12 vs OS X El Capitan stacks up. One of the most prominent new macOS 10.12 features is Siri for Mac. Just like on your iPhone and iPad, you can now use Siri to complete many tasks and there are new integrations. Advertisement There iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch users will see the biggest benefits of upgrading with new connectivity options that make things as simple as copy and paste better. Buying items on the web is also simplified with Apple Pay for the web. The macOS update is compatible with many devices, but not every model that runs OS X El Capitan can handle the upgrade. You’ll need a late 2009 or newer MacBook or iMac and a 2010 or later MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini or Mac Pro to use this software. This is a look at what’s new in macOS Sierra and how it compares to OS X El Capitan in key areas. Siri on Mac   1 / 10 With macOS Sierra you now get access to Siri for Mac.

Advertisement You can use Siri to send a message while you are working on something important, but that's not all.

When you find a Siri result that you need to keep handy, you can pin it to the Notification Center so you can quickly access it again.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechCompanies Microsoft boss doesn’t want AI to ‘replace’ people 2017-01-16 16:15 - Aaron Ricadela Post a comment 0 share: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at an event demonstrating the new features of Windows 10 at the company's headquarters in Redmond. (Elaine Thompson, AP) RELATED ARTICLES Here come 'smart stores' with robots, interactive shelves Amazon sold 'millions' of AI speakers for holiday SA's first human-AI app aims to do what Siri can't New York - Microsoft and its competitors should eschew artificial intelligence systems that replace people instead of maximising their time, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in an interview Monday. "The fundamental need of every person is to be able to use their time more effectively, not to say, ‘let us replace you’," Nadella said in an interview at the DLD conference in Munich. "This year and the next will be the key to democratising AI. The most exciting thing to me is not just our own promise of AI as exhibited by these products, but to take that capability and put it in the hands of every developer and every organisation." Nadella is pushing Microsoft into consumer and industrial applications of software that can make inferences about its environment. He cautioned his own company and competitors about "parlor tricks" that show AI’s power without preserving workers’ dignity. The 49-year-old who’s entering his fourth year as Microsoft’s CEO after succeeding Steve Ballmer in 2014, has presided over a 73% run-up in Microsoft’s shares and Azure cloud-computing revenue that’s been doubling year over year. He’s compelled Microsoft’s product groups to cooperate to ship products faster and has greatly expanded Microsoft software available on platforms other than Windows, including those from Apple and Google. Microsoft last month closed its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn. "There’s a thin line between hubris and confidence," Nadella said. "Always there is risk of hubris coming back, missing trends. The only long-term indicator of success is, ‘how good is your internal culture?’" "What I’ve learned if anything in three years as CEO is, it’s not about celebrating one product," he said. "That, to me, is the sign of a company that’s built to last. In tech it’s even more harsh." Tablets, Watches Microsoft suffered for a decade from a tendency to make stabs at technology it failed to propagate widely that ended up benefiting other companies - mainly Apple. It developed tablet PCs, pocket computers and smartwatches in the early 2000s, and was selling software for cars in the 1990s. "Because of Microsoft’s technical orientation, engineers have always wanted to stuff more and more features and tricks into the products," said Michael Cusumano, a professor of management at MIT Sloan School of Management who’s written three books about Microsoft and its leaders. "The products ended up becoming huge. That’s what slowed them down." On the AI frontier, Japan Airlines is using Microsoft-developed holographic capabilities to simulate aircraft engines for training of repair technicians and to avoid costs of sending full repair crews to each broken plane. McDonald’s used Microsoft technology to develop an automated order-taking system that compensates for noise encountered during orders at a drive-through. Microsoft has also designed software that can protect staff who work in environments surrounded by robots. Microsoft last Friday said it acquired Maluuba, a Montreal-based AI startup specializing in analysing written content, for example sifting through businesses’ documents to find experts in given fields. Yet Amazon.com’s Web Services division has been rapidly releasing AI services for businesses including the ability for developers to build spoken conversation support and speech translation. Alphabet’s Google last year rebuilt its Translate service using neural networks to improve accuracy and produce language that sounds more like what a native speaker would say, and has made strides in image recognition, music and art. "They’re all great advances," said Nadella, who’s reorganised the company’s research arm around AI and shipped products including Azure cloud-computing services and tools for developers to build applications for artificial intelligence applications. "We should be competitive there and we should be pushing there and we will be doing that," he said. "But what’s Microsoft’s unique contribution beyond doing that is democratising the access to the same tools that we use for ourselves so that every developer can use them to create their own intelligence," he said. Cloud Concerns As Nadella and other tech leaders head to the Davos elite gathering in Switzerland this week, cloud-computing’s relationship with data privacy in Europe is also top of mind for Microsoft and its competitors. European businesses and governments could be reluctant to store data in clouds operated by American tech companies if the US government can order access to it, and Microsoft has sued the US Department of Justice in two cases over the issue. Nadella said having data centers in Germany operated by Deutsche Telekom AG has "helped build trust with the German customers." The incoming Trump administration, European Union and China together need to weigh issues including the balance between security and data privacy, the CEO said. "We have business in each one of these countries," Nadella said. "These countries are going to have to work together and there are rightful concerns each one of these constituents has."

Really? U.S. Appeals Court says group can sue Apple over App Store "monopoly" By Joseph Keller Thursday, Jan 12, 2017 at 5:21 pm EST 13 Comments Revived lawsuit says Apple's app "monopoly" has kept prices high. A U.S Appeals Court has revived a 2012 lawsuit brought by number iPhone owners against Apple. The suit alleges that Apple has created an illegal monopoly by only allowing customers to install software purchased from the company's own App Store on their iPhones. Apple had argued that users did not have standing to sue it because they purchased apps from developers, with Apple simply renting out space to those developers. Developers pay a cut of their revenues to Apple in exchange for the right to sell in the App Store. A lower court sided with Apple, but Judge William A. Fletcher ruled that iPhone users purchase apps directly from Apple, which gives iPhone users the right to bring a legal challenge against Apple. It seems odd to claim that the App Store has kept prices too high when many apps, if not most, are available for free, or for the low price of $0.99. The case, Pepper et al v. Apple Inc., is for the U.S. District Court for Northern California. Should the case succeed, the plaintiff's aim either to compel Apple to pay damages or to allow customers to purchase and download apps from outside of the App Store, with the latter option requiring work on Apple's part to allow iOS to run non-App Store third-party software out of the box.

Apps have never been cheaper, so much so that I often wish good apps cost more so the authors could make a sustainable business out of it and support it with bug fixes and updates. Apps have been is a race to the bottom for years now and in my opinion many good apps just never get written because there isn't enough upside for the authors. 1 2 weeks ago Reply DanRJones91 I have a strong feeling that (entertaining the illusion that this has legs and Apple is compelled to let users install from other sources) those same people would then ***** and moan to Apple that their iPhone/Pad is screwed up because they installed something dodgy.... What's the angle here? What are these people standing gain from this lawsuit? Posted via the iMore App for Android 1 2 weeks ago Reply khobia2 Exactly, this sounds like a load of crap. Sent from the iMore App 1 2 weeks ago Reply OldAndBusted "What are these people standing gain from this lawsuit? " They probably want the ability to sell apps that don't meet Apple's guidelines. ****, for instance. 0 2 weeks ago Reply stewm What is really at the core of the case is that it is backed by a group that believe that they should have their own app store and be able to get 30% from developers for 'renting' space to them on a server and handling the payments. We just have to look at the confusion having more than one app store with Android and of course purchasing direct from vendors from their own website causes when it comes to reinstalling applications. In fact if you look multiple app stores and purchasing outside the app store on Android and it is very rare for a person that buys an Android device to use any other store than Google's. It also brings the question, if the person(s) behind this suit were anything other than users upset at the prices they were paying for app's on the app store the simple answer is that they can purchase a device running Android and be able to load apps from anywhere that takes their fancy. In fact Tech Pundit Leo Laporte is always telling the world how much better Android is simply because of this ability. I personal prefer to have the secure environment with the app store controlled. It means that if something happens to my device I know it will reinstall the apps that I have and get pretty close to how it was before the crap hit the fan and I don't have to go the multiple app stores and guess whether it was that app store or this app store or downloaded direct from a website. I'm sure I'm not the only dolt that has managed to pay for the same app on two different app stores on an Android device. 0 2 weeks ago Reply cuttheredwire This would undermine security. Period. Android is proof. Also, I know of no company that sells Android apps *directly*; only alternative stores. 1 2 weeks ago Reply kimmibear40 I agree. Not allowing third party apps is what has kept iPhones safe. Sent from the iMore App 1 2 weeks ago Reply Tech198 haha.. renting space. I like that.. Apple will do anything to tighten up the gap. There is noting to say u can't download apps from websites outside of the app store and install one legit phone.. In fact many people do that because developers don't like the 30% cut Apple takes from them -2 2 weeks ago Reply dragontology Want app store choices? Get Android. The Play Store and App Store are about comparable, but the Amazon Appstore is a straight up cesspool of garbage. Yes, they offer a lot of paid apps for free. Most notably and recently the Go games (Deus Ex, Tomb Raider, and Hitman). Those are $5 each. So it's not all bad. But you have people uploading free apps and charging $1 for it, and Amazon doesn't care. Maybe iPhone could have proper side loading like Android, but I think most people know going in that Apple maintains a 'walled garden' and if you pick an iPhone anyway, you don't get to complain that Apple did that since you knew it going in. Like me, I came from Android and I did a ton of things on Android that iOS can't do. And I knew I wouldn't be able to. But I chose my iPhone 6s for a whole lot of advantages that outweighed those cons. And I stand by my decision. But, my wife has a Droid Turbo 2 and we have a Nexus 7 tablet, so I get the best of both worlds anyway. And that's really the best way to be. Open to both. And one of Apple's advantages is the security (or perceived security) of its App Store. -1 2 weeks ago Reply DannyJJK "And one of Apple's advantages is the security (or perceived security) of its App Store." The App Store only handles a small section of the security on iOS, which is only allowing confirmed apps. However if you did manage to get an App from somewhere else without jailbreaking, the OS is what handles the main part of the security. Apps are sandboxed with limited permissions, for example an application can't add anything to the iPhone screen outside of the application unless it goes through Apple's defined widgets. Apps don't have access to the OS files, and things like photo access, location access, or general information access has to be confirmed by the user as defined by the OS and its restrictions. Whereas on Android, apps have access to all files except ones owned by root permissions (and if you root your phone, they can have access to that as well). Apps can add things to the screen which means if you download a malware app, expect to have things popping up on your screen all the time. Android offers freedom but to do this, security has to be decreased. There's something quite amazing about giving your grandparent an iPhone and knowing that they can't really do much harm to their phone, whereas a lot of people with Android phones have come to me with malware infected devices. A big problem with Android is the fragmented updates, which includes security updates as well. If an exploit comes into play on iOS and Apple releases an update to fix it, everyone can get it at the same time and then everyone is safe again, whereas with Android if Google release an update, some people will end up having it fixed, some people won't until much later 1 2 weeks ago Reply bobbob1016 "Whereas on Android, apps have access to all files except ones owned by root permissions (and if you root your phone, they can have access to that as well).

Apparently you haven't used an updated Android device. Unless you root it, you can not access anything without permissions. Android allows me to tweak things. For example, on iOS my "Taco Bell" app wants my location all the time, or never, there isn't a "while using" option. On Android I could fix that. You can get just as much malware from Cydia or sideloading on iOS as well. Even the multitude of ways to get Kodi on iOS by compiling and loading through XCode could give you malware either way. Imho, if you install pirated apps, you deserve the malware you get. "A big problem with Android is the fragmented updates, which includes security updates as well. If an exploit comes into play on iOS and Apple releases an update to fix it, everyone can get it at the same time and then everyone is safe again, whereas with Android if Google release an update, some people will end up having it fixed, some people won't until much later" This I will give you. This is at Google's cost, but they've tried to fix it with the security updates that happen independent of the OS updates. As in, I can have 6.0 and the "January patch" and be up to 7.1.1 and the "January patch" as far as security. 0 2 weeks ago Reply bobbob1016 This person is stupid. Apple controlling the App Store doesn't really control prices. Maybe 30% of the prices since Apple gets 30%, but Apple does not set prices. Someone could create a $99.99 app, and a $.09 app, and Apple wouldn't care. Now, you can say Apple controls what apps are approved, and what apps can and can't do. *That* would be a valid argument against their control of the app store, but not pricing. 0 2 weeks ago Reply radcapitalist Absolutely ridiculous and further evidence that the antitrust laws need to be repealed. 1 2 weeks ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Now, both are struggling to live another year. Phones by Jessica Dolcourt January 16, 2017 5:00 AM PST @jdolcourt Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) When Steve Jobs launched the original iPhone in 2007, its revolutionary all-touchscreen design blew away the then-dominant keyboard phones of the day: the Moto Q, Palm Treo, Nokia E62 and BlackBerry Pearl. Enlarge Image BlackBerry's new phone channels its QWERTY soul. James Martin/CNET Back then, Nokia and BlackBerry were the smartphone standard-bearers and Apple was the daring upstart. Now, as the iPhone celebrates its 10th anniversary with strong sales and growing global marketshare, the erstwhile kings of mobile are faced with a rare, slim shot at keeping their names alive after years of irrelevance and obscurity. BlackBerry with a phone rumored to be named "Mercury" (the latest to sport their flagship physical keyboard) and "Nokia" with the 6 (a midranger recently released for China). We expect both to launch globally at Mobile World Congress, the annual phone-focused trade show that kicks off in Barcelona next month. How well they succeed depends entirely on their price and positioning to the people who will care enough to buy them. Leaning on licensees The funny thing is that neither Nokia nor BlackBerry will actually make the phones that bear their names. The Nokia brand is licensed by HMD (and manufactured by Foxconn FIH Mobile). BlackBerry still owns proprietary software like BlackBerry Hub, but a company called TCL has licensed the rights to make the phone. (TCL, a Chinese company that's had recent success with Roku TVs in the US, also makes devices like 2016's Alcatel Idol 4.) It's up to these companies to help the Nokia and BlackBerry names sink or swim. Betting big on Android Before the iPhone changed everything, Nokia and BlackBerry were status symbols, but their third-party software fell behind. A struggling Nokia sided with Microsoft to create the doomed Lumia line (Microsoft bought a 10-year license to the Nokia name, which it abandoned after 5). Meanwhile, BlackBerry faltered with its own BlackBerry OS before turning to Android, which it padded with its own security software. The Mercury will keep this combo. Psst! We saw BlackBerry's next keyboard phone Hint: It's big, metal and grippy. by Jessica Dolcourt 0:56 Close Drag The Nokia 6 is the brand's first Android phone, but Google Play services are disabled in China, the 6's first market. Its MWC launch will be the first time we get to see the handset in full-on Googly action, and see how an Android Nokia phone really works. You take the high road, I'll take the low road "Nokia" and BlackBerry have similar ambitions, but different ways of getting there. BlackBerry's "Mercury" aims for the high end (we don't know how high, but they tell us "premium"), while the Nokia 6 is firmly planted in the midrange, with a sale price in China that converts to about $250, £200 and AU$330. Although we don't know much about HMD's plans for its roster of Nokia phones, we do know it plans to dole out $500 million over the next three years on global marketing. We'll soon see the Nokia 6 in person. HMD BlackBerry-licenser TCL may shoot for the high end now, but it plans to build a complete portfolio of devices that span the cost spectrum, Alcatel's head of North America, Steve Cistulli, told CNET. Before 2017 ends, expect the Mercury to have a low-cost counterpart. Who will care enough to buy? But will all the cash matter? Will the best-laid plans stall "Nokia" and BlackBerry's downward spirals long enough to see them gain new buyers? It's hard to say. During the dark Microsoft Lumia days, the family of phones did best as a low-cost brand with solid hardware, especially in cost-conscious and emerging markets. The "Lumia" name became a value buy. With Android at its side, there's a chance that HMD's Nokia brand could fight in the mid-tier. The Nokia name has a history of built-in wireless charging and metal construction, but it's been so long since the its designers were allowed to really branch out from candy-colored plastic, it's hard to imagine a super premium Android Nokia phone. BlackBerry, meanwhile, will continue to struggle with an identity crises so long as it holds on to the notion that its security software is the thing that sets it apart -- software that primes it as a business device rather than one that the everyday consumer would want. Still, its signature hard QWERTY keyboard does appeal to anyone who likes the thought of physical, rather than virtual, typing. Once upon a time, you could expect stalwart fans to prop up sales of the latest Nokia and BlackBerry phones, at least initially. But with all but the die-hard fanboys having given up and moved on to Android or iPhone alternatives, it remains to be seen if these legacy brands can even carve out a niche in the middle or low end.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 09:52, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 | UPDATED: 09:52, Wed, Jan 18, 2017 GETTYApple customers are being emailed about a promotion that offers iPhone 7 for £2 iPhone fans are being sent promotional emails about an awesome Apple deal. The email claims customers are able to get their hands on the new iPhone 7 for just £2. Apple currently sells the entry-level iPhone 7 model for £599 in the UK. That's a killer saving – and as a result, it's easy to see why customers would be tempted to click on the email offer. However, those who get the email should not click the link. Although it looks convincing enough, the email is not actually sent by Apple. Instead the correspondence is from a third-party who may not have your best interests at heart. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSThe email uses a very similar style to Apple emails Clicking on the link should send your anti-virus or spam detector into a fit, since the website appears to be designed to siphon your personal details. The news comes as fraudulent iTunes receipts were circulated online, attempting to trick Apple customers into inputing their Apple Account details online. This was not the first time cybercriminals have tried to trick users into providing sensitive information with a scam iTunes receipt. Last November, Apple users were hit by a similar scam which claimed they had purchased a £42.99 TomTom sat nav app. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 11 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button The fake email then tried to tempt users into clicking a fake cancellation form at the bottom of the email. Apple has advice for customers on its website. It reads, "Phishing refers to an email that attempts to fraudulently acquire personal information from you, such as your Apple ID, password and/or credit card information. "On the surface, the email may appear to be from a legitimate company or individual, but it's not. EXPRESS NEWSPAPERSPhishing emails targeting Apple customers are nothing new "As a general rule, never send credit card information, account passwords, or extensive personal information in an email unless you verify that the recipient is who they claim to be. "Many companies have policies that state they will never solicit such information from customers by email." As a rule, never enter your Apple account information on any non-Apple website. You should never use the same email and password combination across different websites and services.

Today’s designer in question first produced a mock-up for a future iPhone last spring. Now his concept iPhone 8 has received an update based on the latest rumors, leaks, and trends. This is not the first concept design we’ve seen for the iPhone 8 and it most certainly will not be the last. The original idea from Andrew Fox was focused on a modular almost indestructible design that might last as long as ten years plus. While that was interesting, it’s even better to look at the designer’s latest update. Here we’ve shown two versions of his concept iPhone 8 design. One of the images shows the device with a physical Home button beneath the display. The other shows it with a virtual Home button, and it would be interesting to hear which one you like best. The design shows a handset with plenty of curve appeal including curved bezels and rounded edges. While this idea does not come from Apple, we imagine that plenty of people would like to see the iPhone 8 look something like this. The designer has also included a list of features to go with this iPhone vision. Some of these have been leaked and rumored recently, and while some are certainly within the realms of possibility others are not (replaceable storage please stand up). Fox imagines this iPhone in three sizes 4-inches, 4.7-inches and 5-inches with OLED displays. It would have a dual-lens camera, be fully waterproof, and feature wireless charging. Furthermore it has the idea of being able to replace the battery, storage, processor, and camera. If you want more detail about the ideas behind this iPhone 8 concept check out the source below. You’ll also be able to see the original version before this latest update, which the designer acknowledges might be a better fit for a modular approach. We’d really like to know what you think of this updated iPhone 8 design, and your Home button preference?

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Rumor: iPhone 8 to see improved waterproofing features worthy of “IP68” rating Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, January 16th, 2017, 05:13 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Rumor, Samsung It arrives sometime this fall and may be the iPhone upgrade you’re waiting for. The iPhone 8 is presently rumored to feature a glass chassis redesign, bezel-less screen and might also best the iPhone 7 with even higher resistance to water and dust. The Korea Herald reports that the iPhone 8 will tout an IP68 rating for water resistance and dust. This means it can withstand submersion for up to 30 minutes in about a metre deep water. As of now, the iPhone 7 features an IP67 rating, meaning it is technically resistant to splashes and short periods of underwater exposure. IP68 is a substantial improvement but would still mean that swimming is off limits for the iPhone unlike the Apple Watch Series 2; Apple’s wearable far exceeds the IP68 standards. The iPhone 7, through testing, has been found to exceed its waterproofing rating in most synthetic tests, although an officially-rated higher standard will only improve upon the waterproofing feature. Whilst the ‘8’ signifies improved water resistance, the ‘6’ denotes the phone’s resistance to dust; like with the existing iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 will continue to tout the same levels of dustproofness. Apple’s closest rival in the smartphone space, Samsung, already sells the Galaxy S7 which has an IP68 rating. The iPhone 8 is expected to sport an all-new glass and stainless steel design along with an OLED display that wraps around the side of the iPhone. It’s been rumored that the Touch ID Home Button will be integrated into the display and the unit will feature a form of wireless charging. The new OLED flagship iPhone is expected to debut in the fall of this year. Apple is also readying minor ‘iPhone 7s’ updates to be sold at cheaper price points, according to recent reports. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

However, there are several reasons you might want to explore other options, like Android phones and Windows computers. Whatever your reason might be, leaving the Apple ecosystem can be a tough thing to do, and you might not find some of the useful features from the Apple ecosystem anywhere else. To make the transition easier, though, here are a few tips to start with:   1. First, you'll need new, non-Apple devices. The computer. © Provided by Business Insider Inc YouTube/HP If you use software that isn't your web browser, your best bet is going to be a Windows 10 laptop. There are several Windows 10 laptops out there you might like at different price ranges. Here are five Windows 10 laptops that outprice the new MacBooks Pros, as well as out-speccing them.  Those laptops I suggest in the link above are pretty powerful, but while they're also pricey, they're still less expensive than the new MacBook Pros. There are a bunch of great Windows 10 laptops in the $700 range that aren't as powerful; those could fit your needs, too.  If 99% of the things you do on your Mac are based in a web browser, you could consider Chromebooks. They run Chrome OS, which is essentially the Chrome web browser, and they can cost a lot less than a Windows 10 laptop. The phone. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Hollis Johnson/Business Insider There are a bunch of great Android phones, but if I had to pick one, it would be Google's own Pixel or Pixel XL. It's the purest expression of what Google thinks a smartphone should be, and you'll get the latest Android and security updates directly from Google as they're released, not several months later like the majority of Android smartphones. The smartwatch. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider If you have an Apple Watch, the bad news is that it's not compatible with anything else apart from Apple products. If you must have a smartwatch, go for Samsung's Gear S3 Classic or Frontier. They work with most recent Android smartphones, and they're very good as far as smartwatches go. And if you get a Samsung smartphone, you can use Samsung Pay with the Gear S3, too, which works in pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. Unfortunately, however, you won't find the useful Auto Unlock feature from the Apple ecosystem, which unlocks your Mac computer when you're wearing your Apple Watch.  2. Now, you'll need a new account to transfer contacts, photos, videos, and calendars from the iPhone you're trying to escape from. To move away from the Apple ecosystem means you'll need to adopt a new ecosystem: In this case, it's almost certainly going to be Google. Even if you're using a Microsoft device, you'll still probably going to want to use many of Google's useful services on that Microsoft Windows machine. If you don't already have a Google account, get one. It's the best way to transfer your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars, in my opinion. Download Google Drive on your iPhone to sync your contacts, photos, videos, and calendars. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Google/Business Insider All your data in your iPhone can be easily transferred over to a new Android phone. Follow these three simple instructions on how.  Basically, it's download Google Drive, sign in or sign up, and backup in the app. Then, on your new Android phone, just sign in with your Google account during setup or in Android's settings. Don't worry about your photos taking up all the space, Google Photos offers unlimited and free storage for photos taken with cameras using 16 megapixels or less, and videos filmed in 1080p. If your photos and videos exceed those specs, Google Photos will automatically reduce their resolution. Don't worry, they'll still look great.  3. Now, transfer stuff from your Mac to your new computer. You can use a good ol' fashioned hard drive. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Amazon/Seagate Just plug the hard drive in to your old Mac, transfer your files and folders, and unload them into your new machine. This only works for Windows PCs, though; for Chromebook owners, your best bet will be to use Google Drive (more on that in a bit). If you have a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, you get a ton of free OneDrive cloud storage to transfer your files and folders from your Mac to your Windows machine. You get a free terabyte (1,000 GB) of storage in Microsoft's OneDrive if you subscribe to Office 365 for things like Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. That should be plenty of storage for all your files and folders on your Mac. To transfer everything, go to OneDrive and log in with your Office 365 login details. Then, start clicking and dragging your files and folders into OneDrive on your Mac's web browser. If you're switching to a Chromebook, or you want to move stuff to your new Windows PC without Office 365, use Google Drive, which has 15GB of free storage. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Tech Insider/Flickr/Horia Varlan On your Mac's web browser, go to Google Drive and sign in with your Google account.  Then, you can click and drag files and folders from your Mac to Google Drive in your web browser. You can buy more storage if you need more than the free included 15 GB. It's not very expensive at $2 per month for 100 GB. 4. Switch from Apple's Messages to a universal messaging service, like Google Hangouts. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Antonio Villas-Boas Having Messages on the Mac to send and receive texts you're also getting on your phone is a pretty tough feature to leave behind if you're ditching the Apple ecosystem, especially since you could get standard SMS messages on your Mac – not just iMessages between Apple devices – after OS X Yosemite was released. Unfortunately, Windows 10 doesn't have an equivalent native app that will work with Android phones to send and receive text messages. There are some third-party apps, like mySMS, which received decent reviews, but they're not ideal or as good as Messages on Macs. To send quick messages to your contacts from both your computer and your phone, the best solution is to use a messenger app that's cross-platform (available on both computers and phones, just like iMessages) rather than using text messages at all. It helps to use a service where many of your contacts are likely to have accounts, like Facebook or Google. Google Hangouts is a great messenger app that also has video and voice chat. It's not quite the same thing as getting your actual phone calls on your Mac based on your actual phone number, but it's a pretty good alternative. You can use Hangouts from your Gmail account online, the Android app, or from the Hangouts web app.   Facebook's Messenger also works across all your devices, and it features video and voice-calling, too. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Antonio Villas-Boas Use Android Pay instead of Apple Pay. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Screenshot Most new Android devices support Android Pay, which is pretty much the same thing as Apple Pay. Android Pay is often accepted in the same places as Apple Pay due to the fact that both use NFC technology to make mobile payments. If you get a Samsung smartphone that comes with Samsung Pay, it's even better than Apple Pay and Android Pay, as it's accepted pretty much any store that has a credit card reader. The technology used for Samsung Pay, called MST (magnetic secure transmission), mimics a credit card's magnetic stripe, so there's no need for stores to upgrade credit card readers that support NFC for mobile payments.  Unlike Apple Pay, however, which you can use on from your Mac, you can only use Android Pay with your smartphone.  5. Use Spotify instead of iTunes and Apple Music. © Provided by Business Insider Inc Reuters Spotify is a great, if not better, alternative to Apple Music as a music streaming service. However, many of you out there have probably amassed vast libraries of music through iTunes, and it's understandable why you wouldn't want to ditch it.  The good news is that you can upload your iTunes music that's locally stored on your computer and iPhone onto Spotify on your Mac — or, if you've already made the switch to a Windows machine or Android phone, you can do it there, too.  To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Mac, just download Spotify and get a Premium account. Then, go into Preferences, and make sure your iTunes Music library is selected as a Local File Source. Once you've done that, just grab any tracks that pop up in your Local Files tab and drag them over to My Music. That way, you can stream them from any device, including whatever non-Apple device you happen to buy in the future. To get your iTunes music onto Spotify via Windows, you'll need to download and install iTunes on your PC, which seems counter-intuitive, but it'll make sense soon. Then, the easiest option to get your purchased iTunes music onto your new Windows Machine is to download it again from iTunes. You can find all your purchased music from your account in iTunes. Note that this only works for music you bought from iTunes. If you have local music files from elsewhere, you'll need to transfer it from your Mac to Windows machine with a hard drive, Google Drive, or OneDrive. Once you have all your iTunes music on your Windows machine, download and install the Spotify app for Windows. From there, you simply need to go to Spotify's settings > scroll down until you find the Local Files menu, and turn on the "source" where your local  iTunes music is stored on your Windows machine. Now, Spotify will be your new music player complete with playlists, even for music from your iTunes library.  To get your iTunes music onto an Android phone, the best way is to start from your Windows machine. From your Windows machine, put all your local iTunes music files into a playlist in Spotify. Then, you'll need Spotify's paid Premium service to get them onto your Android phone. Get the Android app, sign up for a Premium account, and make sure your Windows machine and Android phone are on the same WiFi network. Then, in the Spotify Android app, go to Your Library > Playlists > then select the playlist with all your iTunes music, and switch the Download button to the green "On" position.  If everything goes well, that's all there is to it! It's not the most convenient or effortless thing to do, but that's the price for sticking with local music files!  WARNING: There is one thing you can't do, which is transfer Mac apps and documents that use that software. Unfortunately, you won't be able to transfer over your Mac apps and software like you can your files and folders. You'll have to download and install the software you want onto your new Windows machine. In some cases, you might have to buy them again to download the Windows version. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

 The 'Google of China' wants to plot the world with a mapping company owned by Audi, BMW, and Daimler Sam Shead Jan. 16, 2017, 5:43 AM 2,020 facebook linkedin twitter email print One of Here's mapping cars. HERE Mapping company Here — owned by BMW, Audi and Daimler — is going to help Chinese tech giant Baidu expand its mapping service to Europe and the rest of the world, possibly taking on Google and Apple in the process. Here, which already powers Baidu Maps' desktop and mobile services in South East Asia outside of China, will now support Baidu Maps in more than 150 countries worldwide. The financial terms of the deal, which was announced on Monday, were not disclosed. The announcement comes three months after Baidu announced significant expansion plans for Baidu Maps. At the time of the announcement, Li Dongmin, general manager of Baidu Maps, reportedly said: "This signals that we will finally transform from a Chinese map provider to a world map provider and become the Chinese brand that provides global services for mobile travel applications." Baidu, sometimes referred to as the "Google of China," has a market cap of $61 billion (£51 billion). Its mapping operation, Baidu Maps, competes with Google Maps and Apple Maps and has more than 350 million active users globally, according to Here. Here uses data collected from vehicles, cartographers, and tens of thousands of other sources to map countries worldwide. So far it has mapped around 200 countries, according to Here. "People rely on Here to travel to new places and explore the world," said Bruno Bourguet, SVP and head of sales and business development at Here. "We are excited that this extended agreement with Baidu will help a growing number of travellers and tourists, particularly from China, plan their trips and find their way to more countries and places than ever before."

Some certainly think so. Sure, players don’t usually pay attention to the passionate ramblings of fans, or overblown statements by the media. But in this case, it is Charley Rosen – a longtime friend of Knicks president Phil Jackson – who is speaking his mind. A sports column written by Rosen last Jan. 12 indicate that Anthony’s presence with the New York Knicks is no longer welcome. Considering how close Jackson and Rosen are, Anthony has simply made the connection. He’s assuming, the words are Jackson’s, not just Rosen’s. Carmelo Anthony’s Legs: Going, Going, Gone “Carmelo Anthony’s legs are going, going, gone,” Rosen’s column reads. He goes on to criticize Anthony’s unwillingness to spend energy on defense so that he can expend more on his isolation plays. According to Rosen’s observations, player movement and game plans grind to a halt for the Knicks because of him. The conclusion? “The only sure thing is that Carmelo Anthony has outlived his usefulness in New York.” Those comments, coupled with the Knicks’ collapsing Playoff hopes, have put pressure on the 32-year-old forward. Carmelo felt compelled to respond to the media a few days later: “If that’s the case… I guess it’s a conversation we should have,” he said according to CBS Sports. Carmelo is in the middle of a 5-year contract with a no-trade clause. Until now, he claims he’d never even thought about leaving New York. But now it seems like he’d be willing to waive that clause, given the extent of the rhetoric going around. “If they feel like my time in New York is over, I guess that’s a conversation we should have.” In fairness to Anthony, he has largely been committed to playing for the Knicks. He came to New York for the 2010-11 season, ready to step up as the franchise’s new face. He’s an 8-time All-Star and remains a scoring threat to this day. But failing to make the playoffs for the last three years does tend to bring up a lot of scrutiny. “That seems to be the trend when you start losing, people want to start searching,” he said. TOR 69 NYK 54 Halftime #NYKvsTOR A photo posted by New York Knicks 🏀 (@nyknicks) on Jan 15, 2017 at 1:11pm PST The Future for New York Knicks What does the future hold for the New York Knicks, in that case? Well, general sentiment is that Kristaps Porzingis is the franchise’s future. Charley Rosen’s article agrees with that: “The young man has the attitude, the work ethic, and the talent to become a perennial All-Star.” Anthony, along with Derrick Rose, started out the season as the Knicks’ two most important players. Now they look like afterthoughts, sitting on the backburner while KP racks up more and more fans in New York. The cries to rebuild around him are getting louder and louder. Sports blogs online are alive with suggestions on where he should head to, next. LA? Oklahoma City? Toronto? Carmelo Anthony says there’s a conversation he and Phil Jackson should have. Perhaps, he should be knocking on the New York Knicks president’s door soon.

A Q&A with Rana Foroohar View related content: Economics, Pethokoukis Throughout the recent election, politicians painted Wall Street banks as the reigning lords of the American economy, such that Bernie Sanders urged we break up the banks in order to protect the little guy. Save Main Street! In her 2016 book, Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business (shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey & Co Book of the Year prize), journalist Rana Foroohar argues that this trend of “financialization” has incentivized companies to engineer their balance sheets and their bottom lines – corporate short-termism — to the detriment of real job creation, business investmen, and long term growth. Hillary Clinton would agree. We discusse. Foroohar was an assistant managing editor at Time and the magazine’s economics columnist, and starts soon at the Financial Times as chief business columnist and associate editor. She is also a global economic analyst for CNN. Lightly condensed bits of our conversation are below; check out the whole thing on my Ricochet podcast. The New York Stock Exchange in Manhattan, New York City, December 21, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly. PETHOKOUKIS:  Let me just start out by reading just a bit from one review of your book, and you can say if this review pretty much captured it or what they missed, and you can go on from there. Traditionally, finance served the needs of business by providing capital and investing in long-term growth. But starting in the postwar decades and ramping up from the Reagan era onward, finance began to take care of themselves first. The banks’ primary activity became moving debt around, a risky strategy that hurts the ability of businesses to grow. As proof, you cite the fate of companies such as General Motors, General Electric and Xerox, whose myopic thinking led to a decline in innovation and their place at the pinnacle of global business. Instead of serving business, financialization became an end in and of itself, a closed system, unmoored, intangible economic activity. OK. My summary of the summary is tht we spend way too much on moving around money and adjusting balance sheets, not enough actually innovating and developing and making things. Is that about right? FOROOHAR: That is about right. That’s a great intro actually. And, you know, I’ll throw out just one statistic which kind of sums things up for me. Sometimes you get a metric that just really makes your eyes pop. And when I was reporting and researching this book, I came across an academic study that found that, today, only about 15% of all the money flowing out of the big US financial institutions actually ends up in business investment. So if you step back and you think about it, 15% of the money in finance going to business investment, well, what’s the rest of it doing? It’s being used for trading, the buying and selling of existing assets, issuance of debt, bidding up of housing bubbles – all the things that Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, would not necessary have wanted it to be doing. I mean, if we go back to the roots of the capitalist system, a healthy financial sector that is a helpmate to business is a really crucial part of that. Finance is supposed to allocate all of our savings, all of our capital as workers in a society properly, productively. And I would argue, and I think statistics have shown and any number of examples that I’ve hopefully illustrated in my book have shown that we’ve moved far, far away from that system. What was the catalyst that turned this into what it is now or what it has become? So when we think about the rise of Wall Street, often that gets correlated with Reagan economics, with trickledown economics, you know, with a kind of a shift in the ’80s towards the age of greed. And, sure, that’s part of it. But I’m actually saying – I’m going back further, and I’m pinning this shift to the ’70s and actually to a period in US history where the economy began to grow more slowly. You know, starting really in the early ’70s, US trend growth, economic growth began to slow down. And that was happening for certain good reasons. You know, post-World War II, Europe back was back on its feet, the emerging markets were starting to emerge. There was just, you know, what Fareed Zakaria would call the rise of the rest. There was more global competition and the US growth as it became, you know, a developed rich nation was slowing. So we were then at a turning point. Policymakers – by the way, on both sides of the aisle. I would say this is very much a bipartisan thing – could have taken some hard decisions to say, all right. Here we are. We are a fully developed economy; we have new global competition. How do we want to grow as a society? What kinds of businesses, what kinds of investments do we want to make to really sustain equitable growth in our economy? Policymakers passed the buck, both Democratic and Republican policymakers. Actually, I would argue that, in some ways, the shift in interest rate policy even under the Carter administration was one of the pegs for the shift that I’m talking about. But policymakers passed the buck and they passed the buck to Wall Street. And they said, you know what? We don’t want to upset any of our voting blocs. We don’t want to make tough decisions about, you know, who’s going to get what in society, so we’re going to let the markets decide. And I would argue that that then began to be part of this cult of efficient markets, the idea that the market always knows best, that the market is always efficient. Well, you know, certainly if we’ve learned one thing in the last eight years, it’s that the market is not always efficient. And that’s not to say government always knows best. I mean, one of the things I’m clearly trying to say in my book is that, actually, finance is what we make of it. It is a system of rules, and we make the rules, and we can change them. We can make finance more productive and really shift our system back to what it was, I would argue, prior to the early 1970s. It doesn’t sound like there was a government policy or set of policies that encouraged it. Are you more saying that this was happening and then government should have done something differently in the late ’70s? You know, I think that one of the things that’s very difficult to understand and communicate about this debate is there’s not one silver bullet problem, not one silver bullet fix. You know, some people would say, when we began to deregulate interest rates, that really unleashed Wall Street. Other people would say that when we began to change the ways in which corporate compensation could be awarded – you know, allowing buybacks, for example, stock buybacks to become legal, they were market manipulation ack in 1982, allowing more corporate comp to be paid out in tax deferred stock options, tax deductible debt. Some people would say that that was the turning point. The truth of the matter is there were a lot of small legislative shifts basically over the last 40 years that coincided with a rising bull market which was happening for reasons that I think actually have nothing to do with that deregulation but were more a matter of macro shifts in the economy that are now played out, the rise of the emerging markets, the entrance of women into the workplace, you know, various demographic things that are now tapped out. Markets were rising, deregulation was happening. So there was a lot of change taking place. Things seemed to be going along very well for a certain period of time, but what you can see is as finance grew from the 1980s onwards as a percentage of our economy, it’s now about 7% roughly of US GDP, creates only 4% of all US jobs, by the way, but takes a quarter of US corporate profits. So if you need any sense of monopoly power, there’s another statistic for you. As it was rising during that time, a number of metrics of business health were actually falling. So the percentage of R&D that companies spent – sorry – percentage of revenue that companies spent on research and development was falling; the number of startups per capita was falling. Any number of measures of entrepreneurial zeal and risk-taking in our economy was falling. And I would argue that that was because we took our eye off of business and put it on finance. And really, we need to switch those two things. We need to change that pyramid. So are you saying that all the tumult in the ’80s – we should have avoided that, that was bad? Well, you know, again, it’s a very nuanced process. And I think that even before the 1980s, there were shifts occurring. But, yeah. I think that what happened in the’80s is we sort of threw kerosene on some issues. I mean, definitely I think certain ways in which anti-trust was handled back then was an issue. But I would maybe once again kind of point your attention to this shift – rule shift in 1982 around stock buybacks because this is sort of a timely example and a good way to understand the process of financialization. Stock buybacks, obviously, are when firms go back – you know, go into the open markets and buy back their shares. And that artificially jacks the share price up. It always does that. You can look just at, for example, Apple, which is the lead chapter of my book. Over the last several years has spent tremendous amounts of money buying back its own stock and then jacking the price up. That tends to enrich the wealthiest Americans, the investor class, but oftentimes it’s enriching people that had nothing to do with the founding of that company. So we’re not talking about investors that are entrepreneurs and job creators. We’re talking about in many cases a speculative group of shareholders, activists, investors. You know, they used to be called barbarians at the gate but who were benefiting from this huge influx of capital into the markets. Well, at the same time, research and development in these companies, not just Apple but in many companies in America is going down as a percentage of revenue so that investment, that seed corn is actually falling. Now, this whole process was illegal before 1982. That rule then changed under the Reagan administration. But if you jump to the 1990s, under the Clinton administration, you got more kerosene poured onto this sort of financialization process when there was a conversation about the compensation – you know, how corporate executives would be paid. Even back then there was a discussion, as you know, about the growing wealth divide and certain members of the Clinton administration, like Joe Stiglitz, for example, thought that there should be caps on corporate compensation; others argued, you know, more the Rubin-Summers camp argued that, well, certain kinds of pay should be performance based, perhaps tax deductible. And so you have this burgeoning of share options – by the way, that was something that was pushed by Silicon Valley, a lot of liberals lobbied for that to happen. So, again, you get this kind of kerosene thrown on this process of corporate governance where managers, people that are running the largest companies in the country have every incentive to jack up share price for two or three quarters, but not necessarily look 10, 20, 30 years down the road and see what’s really going to benefit this company, what’s really going to benefit society over the long haul. And, by the way, that’s a real issue. When our major competition globally tends to be at this point state-run economies, you know, countries like China where you can take the long view. You know, family-run companies in emerging markets, where people are looking at a 10, 20, 30-year horizon. And I hear from a lot of CEOs in this country that it hamstrings them so much to have to think just about share price quarter on quarter rather than the longer-term best interest of a company. Now I’m going to push back a little because I sort of buy your premise on even days. On an odd day, I’m a little bit more skeptical. We happen to be doing this podcast on an odd day. It’s probably better for the podcast that I’m a skeptical mode. I guess I would say first and talking about sort of this transition. In the early ’80s, you know, the Dow was like 800. And it basically had gone nowhere since the late ’60s. And if you adjust it for inflation, it was probably down by two-thirds. Now, we’re right around 20,000. And if I had told someone back then that the Dow was going to go from roughly 1,000 to 20,000, I think they would say that the book to write would be a book called The Rise of American Business, not The Fall of American Business.  So just that one statistic would make me think that somehow we’ve done something right over the past 35, 40 years, and it hasn’t quite been the catastrophe for the American private sector. Well, it certainly – you know, if you want to pull that metric, absolutely you can make that argument. But I would say that, in some ways, that’s predicated on the notion that the share price is the best indicator of the health not only of business but of the overall economy. I would actually point to another metric. I would say that US trend economic growth, US average wages have actually been falling and stagnating depending, you know, in terms of wages what class of worker you’re talking about. It’s been falling for some time. Most working class people haven’t gotten a raise in real terms since 1968. A lot of middle-class people haven’t gotten one since the early 1990s. Now, there are a lot of factors in that – globalization, the rise of technology, which has dislocated a lot of jobs higher and higher up the food chain. But I would argue again that if you think about business investment and productive capital allocation as the real seed corn of our growth, I would argue that that has been changing and that you can see a lot of companies as they have moved away from really focusing on their core business, really focusing on not just moving money around, but creating the new, new thing, creating real investment, that their competitiveness globally has fallen, that market share has fallen. I’ve got a number of examples about this in the book. And also, the amount of debt out there in the economy has risen. This is an issue. I think, you know, we haven’t heard a lot about debt. Interestingly, in the last presidential cycle, Rand Paul was the only one that was, you know, early on kind of banging on about it. But I actually think that debt is a real issue. The rise of debt in our economy, unproductive debt is a real issue. You’re talking mainly private sector debt here or do you mean private sector and public? Well, you talk about – I’m talking about both kinds of debt actually, but, you know, it’s interesting because the rise in debt, the pace in rise of debt is the biggest predictor of financial crises, globally. And if you look just at the private sector right now, the amount of corporate debt out there is actually very high. And we’ve already had some hiccups in the junk bond market because of that. Now, a lot of people say, you know, hey, the market’s almost at – you know, it’s at 20,000. You know, what are you worried about? Well, that’s kind of exactly what I’m worried about because if you look at economic fundamentals, nothing on Main Street has really changed. There’s nothing different in the growth story than there was eight years ago when the economy was really struggling. What’s different? Well, the Fed dumped $4 trillion into the economy over the last eight years, which, you know, yeah, that will jack share prices up, you know. And interest rates are still historically low even though they’re probably going to start rising at some point. They probably won’t rise as fast as they have in the past. I think that there is a real disconnection between Wall Street and Main Street. And, by the way, I think most intelligent investors out there would agree with that. Most people think there will be a correction in the market. It’s just a matter of when and how. Are there countries out there you think that are getting it right? So, again, I don’t think there’s one perfect example of a financial system that we should emulate, but I’ll point to two or three examples of certain aspects of other systems that we might want to think about. And one would be Canada. So if you go back actually, you know, to the roots of our financial system, one of the reasons that there is risk in our system is because of the square off in the days of the founding fathers between Hamilton and Jefferson. You know, Hamilton wanted a big integrated nationalized financial system. Jefferson was more in favor of this sort of small agrarian interest, didn’t want a lot of concentration of power. What we ended up with is kind of a hash up where you had national banks but a lot of commercial banks were not allowed to gain scale early on. Later, arguably with the repeal of Glass-Steagall, which was the Depression-era banking legislation that, you know, separated trading and investment, you got maybe too much concentration and too many business lines being combined. In Canada, you had a different system. You had a system where trading and commercial lending were separated, but commercial lending was actually allowed to achieve scale nationally. Canada’s never really had a major financial crisis. So that’s one thing to think about. The other example I might point to is Singapore. There you have a system where you actually pay government workers and regulators salaries that are high enough to attract real talent into the system, you know, so that you get a balance between risk-taking on Wall Street and policing in government. And, you know, I think that those are just two examples I might point to. There are many others. Just before we went on, I went on to the Forbes website and I looked up the Forbes list, and they do a list of the most innovative of companies. And I looked on that list and I looked at the top 10 and I see nine American companies. And one of my favorite charts looks at which economy is able to produce very wealthy entrepreneurs. So these are people who got rich by creating value, not by manipulating money. Absolutely. Yeah. And no other large advanced economy produces as many, based off of the size of the population. So looking at that, everything you say may be right that we would be better if we were not as so financially heavy, but yet we still seem to be a pretty dynamic economy. I know that productivity statistics may not say it and I know there’s a very active debate whether they’re missing things in this digital economy, but I think there’s a plausible argument that despite all this financialization – and some people then might say maybe because of it – with venture capital — when people ask the question, gee, why is the US able to produce so many fast-growing, high-impact tech companies versus Europe, they always say, well, we have these great capital markets here, venture capital. So isn’t there a plausible argument that we’re doing something right? Well, you can certainly argue that there are a lot of things that are great about the American economy. I would not argue otherwise. I was actually a foreign correspondent working and living in continental Europe for 10 years. And, believe me, there are many aspects of business there that I would not want to emulate. So don’t get me wrong about that. But I would argue that actually we could unleash much higher trend growth. I mean, it’s interesting. That’s of course been a part of the debate. Donald Trump, you know, becoming the president-elect by arguing that we could be at 4% growth rather than 3 if we just unleashed the economy. Now, I may not agree with all of his policies about how to do that, but I agree that the US trend growth could be higher if we actually took some steps to change parts of our process that are hindering us. And, you know, I would say that financialization in recent years has become part of the problem. You know, if you look – there are any number of large-scale, long-term international studies by the BIS or the IMF or the World Bank that show that when finance becomes even half the size as a percentage of the economy that it is in the US, it starts to have a growth-hindering effect. And I would go back again to that statistic I gave you earlier. Finance is 7% of the economy, creates 4% of all jobs, but takes a quarter of all corporate profits. Does that sound fair to you, because it doesn’t to me? That sounds like monopoly power of a kind that you don’t have in any other industry. And to answer your question, I actually didn’t count venture capital as part of financial sector in this book. It is a tiny – if you look at it as a percentage of the overall capital flows in America, its tiny, tiny. So I agree with you. We actually have, you know, in many parts of the country a very active, viable, productive venture capital sector but it’s such a tiny part of our overall financial system that it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. And, as you mentioned earlier, tying this into the idea of short-term thinking, there is one statistics that kind of jumps out at me. I look at R&D spending and I think last year it was at the highest share ever as a share of GDP. If this was as big a problem, wouldn’t that number be very, very low? And why would it be going up if companies were actually thinking short-term? It’s funny because I actually love that you’re – Persuade me. Yeah. I will persuade you. And I love that you’re pointing this out because in some ways this is actually really illustrative. It shows you, you know, lies, lies and statistics, right? We can each of us pull a statistic to show our point. The one that I would pull would be to look not as a percentage of US GDP, but rather as a percentage of the overall revenue of the companies themselves. As companies get bigger and more powerful – and, by the way, they are bigger and more powerful than ever before – the corporate share of the overall economic pie is at record levels, whereas the labor share is at postwar lows. That has been falling. So you can look at it in many ways. But, actually, let me pivot – I’ll do a pivot – journalistic pivot and shift to something else which I think may be more convincing to you. One of the statistics that I found very interesting in researching this book and in particular thinking about the issue of short-termism was to look at the behavioral differences between public companies and private companies, right? Family-owned private companies, really, any kind of private company versus publicly owned companies that are under all this Wall Street pressure to keep their share prices high. How do they behave differently? Well, here’s how they behave differently. Private companies over the last 20 years or so in America have spent twice the amount of money as a percentage of their overall revenue on really productive investments in the economy, things like building new factories, investing in new technologies, research and development, worker training – twice as much as public companies, apples for apples. And to me, I look at that and I say, well, what’s the difference? Well, the difference is Wall Street. And you ask any – I challenge you. Go ask anybody who runs a family-owned business in this country, they will agree with that. They will say, yeah. I don’t want to be under the market pressure because, you know what? The market pressure is to do whatever it takes to bolster the share price quarter by quarter and not really think about what’s going to keep my business competitive in five or 10 years, let alone what’s good for the community that I live in or the national economy as a whole. But do we want to return to that pre-mid-’70s kind of capitalism if we could? Again, I think you had a lot of sleepy US corporations that were not under very tough competitive threat, sort of fat and happy companies that were eventually just really steamrolled by very aggressive countries, Japan being one example. There had to be a change in corporate America. Those companies had to become more efficient. If you were going to remain an open economy, corporate America was going to change. So how would have things looked differently? How would the economy look different? So I’m absolutely not arguing for a return to the ’70s. You can’t return to the ’70s, just like, you know, when people talk about, well, if we only had Glass-Steagall, the banking regulation again, we’d never have another financial crisis. Well, that’s not true either. You know, sure, it would be interesting to think of some modernized Glass-Steagall that might help us to reduce banks’ ability to do risky trading, but that’s not going to prevent the S&L crisis, for example. And neither am I arguing that we should try and hope to return to the 1970s in terms of the business economy. But what I am saying is this: when you look at where wealth and capital are going in our society, they are, I would argue, not going anymore to productive investments that will push the overall national economy forward. You know, we have a system now in which corporate America is holding about $2 trillion of cash abroad. There’s a big debate – and this was, again, part of the reason that Donald Trump got elected – big debate over how to get that cash back. That’s crucial to really fomenting a sustainable recovery because, frankly, the public sector just doesn’t have the mojo to do it. You know, I mean, I think, great, if we can get an infrastructure through; great if we can get more fiscal spending, but the public sector has more debt than it did before the financial crisis. If we look out there globally, the consumer has, you know, recovered, but we don’t want to get into a consumer debt bubble of the kind that we did pre-2008. So we really need to look to the corporate sector and corporate investment as a way of generating economic growth and job growth. Well, when corporations are under pressure from Wall Street to channel their capital to the wealthiest investors rather than to think about what is going to be good overall for their own growth, what is going to be good for innovation, what is going to be good for creating a group of consumers that can actually buy products – I mean, you know, just to go back to the old, you know, Fordism argument, when you have an economy like ours, it is 70% consumer spending and people haven’t gotten a raise in 40 years in real terms, well, eventually the math doesn’t work, you know. You have to think about putting capital somewhere aside from at the very top of the pyramid. And I would argue that that’s what we need to be thinking about when we think about what’s growth going to be in two years, four years, five years. Right. So you mentioned companies having all those cash. So you’re confident that that there are productive uses for that money that are not happening because they’re under pressure from activists and investors to boost the stock price, return capital to investors — that if not for that, there are all manner of productive uses for that money in either investments they could be making, other maybe smaller companies they could be buying, all kinds of uses. They’re just not because of that pressure. That’s a somewhat simplistic way of putting it. It’s not just activist pressure. It’s an entire system of financialization, but, yes. And, you know, it’s not just me that thinks this. I mean, ask Warren Buffett, you know. He thinks there’s plenty of productive uses of capital for American companies right here at home. Carl Icahn thinks that. I mean, there are plenty of smart investors, much smarter people than me, who say the same thing. And I also, you know, I travel around, I’m from the rural Midwest. I look out. I see those productive uses. I see that there are parts of this country that could be just as competitive in terms of labor as many less expensive labor markets when you think about things like energy costs and just-in-time supply chains. I think that there is a lot that we could do in this country. And I think that there are also ways of thinking about corporate – (audio break). I mean, I’ll give you one example. You know, a few years ago, because of some very complex outsourcing of supply chains amongst retail companies like Walmart and H&M, both U.S. and European companies, there was a big disaster in Bangladesh, a factory that had very poor safety standards collapsed and killed about 2,000 workers. Well, a lot of these companies didn’t even know they were doing work – outsourcing work to those countries in those faulty factories because they had such complex supply chains. That something that gets taught in business schools. You know, business schools, you know, that have very financially oriented training programs for MBAs say, put your workers where it’s cheapest, marshal your capital, treat human labor as a cost rather than an asset. I actually think the smartest businesses are beginning to realize, you know what? The world is awash in capital. There’s plenty of money rolling around but really great labor, really productive workers, robust local economies – that’s in shorter supply. And if you can tap into that, that’s a great way to grow. I think that’s actually a good point that capital being so cheap – Clayton Christensen has written about this, that businesses have been very slow to figure that out, and maybe that’s playing a role in some of this short-term thinking. I also wonder, maybe we already are seeing a market solution to this. I was just reading a story about the decline of public companies. They call it the de-equitization of the American market. Yeah. I read that story. Where companies are staying private longer. Maybe it’s already happening, where markets are adjusting. If companies don’t think that being in this public market is good because of all this pressure, they’re just staying private. Well, I think you’ve made a great point and I think that that is already happening. The thing that worries me, though, is that, you know, when companies stay private, the actually limits the amount of – the percentage of the population that can take part in that kind of wealth creation. So I would love to see public companies as well be able to function in a way that would be healthier for society. I mean, kind of all of our 401ks depend on it, right? So just one more thing. I work at a think tank. I like public policy. Is there a big idea, a big public policy idea that would lead to the de-financialization of the economy? Well, let me put forward two ideas. It doesn’t sound like it’s Glass-Steagall from what you said. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. And I actually – I mean, I’m a liberal, but, to be honest, unlike most liberals, I really don’t believe that, you know, post-facto regulation of everything is the way forward. For starters, you know, Wall Street is always smarter than the regulators. They’re always one step ahead. You’re always fighting the last war. That’s not to say we don’t need certain kinds of smart regulation and protections, but I don’t think that that is the solution. What I would say is two things. One practical solution I think we should be thinking about is shifting away across all types of policy away from subsidizing debt and towards incentivizing equity. Now, I’m not saying that that’s not a complicated change but I think if you start to really through the tax code and think about all the ways in which we subsidize really stupid kinds of debt at both the consumer and the corporate level and just shift it, just say, you know what? We’re not going to incentivize debtors. We’re going to incentivize savers, both at the consumer and the corporate level. I think that you could really see some powerful shifts there. The other thing I would say is more of kind of an existential thing is just think about the fact that – go back to Adam Smith. Finance is supposed to help business. Finance is not the end game. When finance becomes the end game, you know you usually have a problem in your economy.   Corporate america Corporate behavior Glass-steagall International finance Wall Street Discussion: (1 comment) America's Favorite Country Doc January 13th, 2017 Thanks for the discussion. And we agree with Ms. Foroohar’s proposals. Evolution, and all of us, follow two paths: survival and diversity–or profits and innovation. We discuss these more in our book, The Boids and the Bees, if you are interested. But if you want to measure the health of a system look at its diversity and not at the longevity, or the wealth, of its members.

After all, if you’re paying premium price for such a sophisticated device, you’d expect it to survive a few, hopefully minor, mishaps. Until the iPhone 7, however, Apple’s smartphones haven’t exactly joined that trend. But now that it has, it seems to be going full out. According to multiple sources, the iPhone 8 will feature an ingress protection (IP) rating of IP68, obtaining the highest dust and water proofing score that few smartphones so far enjoy. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, Apple’s first smartphones to have a higher than usual score, only has an IP67 rating. That means that, in the worst case scenario, it can survive for 30 minutes underwater at a depth of 1 meter. While already high, that is only second to the highest IP68. That mark is enjoyed by only a few smartphones, with the Galaxy S7 leading the way. With the iPhone 8, however, Apple is taking things up a notch, all the way to that IP68. In practical terms, that means the iPhone will survive underwater at a depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. In practice, however, it’s still not recommended to tempt fate that way. In fact, Apple’s warranty doesn’t even cover water damages, making it a bit moot. All that the numbers really give is peace of mind that your iPhone will survive being drenched in the rain for a bit or dropped on the sand accidentally. Salt water and highly abrasive liquids like Coke are still a big no-no. While an IP68 upgrading by itself might not be such a big deal, it will be interesting to see its place in the grander scheme of things. The iPhone 8, in contrast to the iPhone 6 all the way to the iPhone 7, is now rumored to sport the glass-metal frame-glass sandwich last seen in the iPhone 4, which may be responsible for this new water proof score.

Rubin sold Android Inc to Google in 2005 and then was the chief of Android inside Google till 2013, before eventually leaving the company in 2014. Rubin has been working on his tech incubator called Playground Global, which is speculated to release an Android smartphone soon. Playground Global backs projects involving AI, robotics and augmented reality. According to a Bloomberg report, Rubin is working on creating a new company called Essential and serves as its CEO. This will have a 40-member team made of former Apple and Alphabet Inc employees, who will be working on consumer hardware such as smartphones, smart home accessories and more. Essential, will be a platform company that will tie up multiple devices together. The showstopper product is expected to be a high end smartphone, which will have an edge-to-edge bezel-less display. According to Bloomberg, Rubin discussed this smartphone with mobile carrier executives. Rubin has listed Essential with the US Patents and Trademark Office, with product such as smartphones, tablets, accessories and ‘computer operating software for mobile phones’ as some of the goods and services on offer. So it is not known if Rubin’s upcoming smartphone will have Android or a complete new OS. Playground Global has investors including HP, Google and Foxconn among others. In fact, Foxconn is alleged to be talks to manufacture Rubin’s upcoming smartphone which will be competing with Apple, Samsung and Google’s Pixel at the high end of the market. According to people familiar with the matter quoted by Bloomberg, the smartphone Rubin is working on has a larger display size than the iPhone 7 Plus’ 5.5-inch. But due to the bezel-less display, it has less of a footprint. The phone will also support pressure sensitive display, like the iPhone. Also, Rubin’s team is working on an industrial design which has metal edges and a ceramic back, people aware with the developments said. Essential is also working on a proprietary connector, which will not only let you charge the device, but could be used for expanding the phone’s future functionality. This would be done in the form of hardware accessories, or modules, which will add additional features to the phone. For instance, Rubin’s engineers are working on a spherical camera module which can shoot high resolution 360 degree photographs. This high end phone is expected to be selling in the retail market by the middle of 2017. It would be priced around $649 (approx Rs 44,500). News of Rubin working on a venture to make a new smartphone started appearing online as far back as December 2015. Considering this is the founder of Android himself working on a new phone, consumers and competitors will be eagerly tracking the development of this phone.

We preview the game in this report.  Key Information  DePaul Blue Demons (8-10, 1-4) vs. St. John’s Red Storm (8-11, 2-4) – Monday, January 16th, 3:30 p.m. Central – Carnesecca Arena, Queens, New York    Television – Fox Sports 1  Radio – WSCR AM 670 Follow WeAreDePaul on Twitter Gametracker BlueTube Audio Streaming Video St. John’s Basketball Game Preview DePaul is on the road again, and this time head coach Dave Leitao and the Blue Demons will be looking for revenge After getting crushed at Marquette, 83-58, Saturday, DePaul now heads to Queens to take on the same St. John's Red Storm team that beat them, 79-73, almost two weeks ago at Allstate Arena. The game will be part of the Big East's annual marathon, which will also celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. John's, who also played on Saturday and lost to Villanova, 70-57, will at least have the comfort of playing at home. After beating DePaul on New Year's Day, St. John's has now dropped four conference games in a row, so they will be viewing this game as a way to get back on track. St. John's is undoubtedly led by its freshman backcourt of Marcus LoVett and Shamorie Ponds. Both guards, who were recruited by DePaul, possess a scintillating set of skills. LoVett leads the team (actually, tied with Ponds) in scoring (17.3) and assists (3.6). He also shoots a nifty 42.7 percent from three-point range. If you recall, it was LoVett who did most of the damage in the second half of the win over the Blue Demons when they first played. In that game, LoVett went for 22 points (7-13 from the field), while dishing out six assists. Ponds, who is one of the early candidates for Big East Freshman of the Year, is also living up to his early press clippings. He averages 17.3 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game, the latter two statistics rank second on the team. This lefty duo is hard to stop from getting into the lane. So DePaul will have to come prepared to stop these players from getting in their comfort zone. Junior college transfer Bashir Ahmed is St. John's third double-digit scorer. The versatile wing averages 12.2 points, while chipping in 5.5 rebounds per game. Figuring out St. John's is difficult, because it can be a different team depending on when you play them. This is a team that has beaten Butler, and Syracuse, yet have also lost to Delaware State and LIU-Brooklyn. With St. John's now on the aforementioned four-game losing streak, and DePaul only possessing one Big East win, each team will try to use this as game to get back on the winning track. The Blue Demons will draw the short stick in this matchup, though, as they will have had to go from Milwaukee back to Chicago on Saturday and then shortly after that head to New York City for the quick turnaround on Monday. Meanwhile, St. John's will have had been at home for nearly a week. Anyway, when you measure in revenge and the need to compile some wins to gain some confidence, adrenaline can carry you a long way. That said, DePaul has to be careful with shot selection, as the Blue Demons have shot less than 40 percent in two of their last three games. Plus, the Demons need their stars Billy Garrett Jr. and Eli Cain to step up, as they combined for just 19 points on 4-18 shooting from the field on Saturday.  Whoever plays smarter basketball will have the edge in this one. The Last Time  On January 1st, 2017, the Blue Demons started off the new year with a competitive battle with the Red Storm, but didn’t have quite enough to keep up with the St. John’s offensive onslaught in the second half in a 79-73 loss in Rosemont.  After leading by seven points at the half, DePaul gradually saw St. John’s chip away at the lead. Second half turnovers were also costly for the Blue Demons. DePaul turned the ball over 11 times in the second half. After shooting 40.6 percent overall in the first half, the Red Storm shot at a 56 percent clip in the second stanza. The Blue Demons also contended with foul trouble in the second half.  Joe Hanel fouled out of the game while Levi Cook and Tre McCallum were hampered with foul fouls apiece. DePaul had four players finish in double-figures.   Eli Cain led the way for the Blue Demons with 18 points, but was hampered by a calf strain in the game’s final minutes. Junior college transfer Tre’Darius McCallum recorded a near double-double of 14 points and nine rebounds. Garrett contributed 13 points and Chris Harrison-Docks came off the bench to chip in with 12 points including three 3-pointers. The backcourt duo of Marcus Lovett and Shamorie Ponds combined for 37 points.  LoVett led all scorers with 22 points on seven of 13 shooting.  Ponds scored 15 points and was five of 12 from the field.   Darien Williams came off the bench for the Red Storm to add 12 points.   St. John’s Roster No. Name Yr.

But Apple is also addressing an important practical shortcoming of the iPhone 7. According to a report from the usually reliable Korea Herald, “multiple sources” can “confirm” the 2017 iPhones (currently both iPhone 7S and iPhone 8 models are expected) will have upgraded IP68 water and dust resistance ratings. This means the phones could withstand full submersion in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to 30 minutes. This is a step up from the current IP67 rating on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which can survive for the same time but only in one metre of water. This change sounds useful, but I’d argue it is actually essential. Why? Because Apple’s big justification for removing the headphone jack is it freed up space for a larger battery and was “essential” to make the phones IP67 water resistant. Except this doesn’t (if you’ll pardon the pun) wash. As it turned out, the iPhone 7 has a battery barely bigger than the iPhone 6 and the Galaxy S7 already has IP68 water resistance despite keeping the headphone jack. So no, this won’t stop me calling out Apple on what the “courageous” removal of the headphone jack really was “essential” for (self serving at best, deliberately misinformative at worst), but at least there is tangible progress now. Furthermore, given all the headline upgrades the iPhone 8 is expected to have (and it will need them with Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S8 reinvention) that’s a win.         LATEST STORIES (10) Syria in Last 24 Hours: ISIL's Offensives on T4 Airbase Repulsed by Syrian Army in Homs Province Bahrainis Stage Demo in Solidarity with Sheikh Qassim Syrian Armed Forces Launch Fresh Anti-ISIL Operation in Deir Ezzur Army Repels ISIL's Attack on Khanasser, South-East of Aleppo Province ISIL Using , Wooden Jeeps, Military Vehicles Historical Chaldean Catholic Church Recaptured by Iraqi Forces from ISIL Bahrain: Regime Troops Continues Clashes with Demonstrators Iraq's Nujaba Hunting ISIL Terrorists with Kornet Anti-Tank Missiles Battle for Syria New Photo from Hiroshima Atomic Bombing Discovered Syrian Navy Conducting Drills to Enhance Capabilities May’s Distress Signal: Who Is Making the Internal Problems of the Region Unmanageable?

They didn't get their debut at this year's CES, but we still managed to get some listening time with Bragi's imaginatively-named Headphones. You'll know Bragi of Dash fame. Those truly wireless buds were only half-aimed at music lovers - the other half had a real fitness focus. Not everyone leads an active lifestyle, though; that's where the Headphone come in. By ditching the activity-tracking smarts of the Dash, the headphone is aimed at everyone gearing up for a headphone jack-free future. Here's how we got on with a pre-release pair. HOW DO THEY FIT AND SOUND? I had serious doubts I would actually get a pair of Headphones into my ears, but despite how big they look, they actually sat in my ears quite snugly. They feel comfortable and light enough, but I'd need to use them for a lot longer than my short demo session to see if they'll leave you with aching ears. You get three different ear tips in the box - small and medium rubber ones, and large foam ones. You're bound to find the right size in a few tries (unless you have abnormally-sized lugholes). The foam tips give a bit of passive noise cancellation, sealing out any outside distractions as soon as you pop them in your ears. They sounded more balanced and robust than the Apple AirPods I've been using, but we'll have to wait for a full review to see how well they hold up outside of a quiet hotel suite.  Even without the Dash's focus on training, the Headphones are still water-resistant, so you don't have to let the train stop you from taking them out on a run. They don't have any onboard storage, though, so you'll have to take your phone along with you. From what I heard, there weren't any dropouts or disconnects, either between the Headphone and paired smartphone, or between the two earbuds. Hopefully that will be true of the final retail version - dropouts and disconnects are the one thing most truly wireless in-ears have yet to conquer. HOW DO THEY WORK? Unlike Apple’s AirPods, the Headphones have tiny physical controls on the right bud - you won’t have to reach for your phone to change up the volume or worse, speak to yourself in public.  Just remember, when we say tiny, we really mean pinhead tiny. You have to feel for the right control with your fingertip then press it using your fingernail. When you have the right angle, they click quite effortlessly. They’ll definitely take some getting used to, but once you do, it’s really quite easy. The “+” and “-” controls do the usual double duties of volume adjustment and track changing with a double or triple press. A third button plays and pauses your music. Holding in the volume button turns on audio transparency, letting you tune into the outside world without having to pull the buds from your ears. Perfect for when people start talking to you, oblivious to the fact that you're avoiding them. It was surreal when they first switched on, and I could hear Bragi's PR guy snapping his fingers around my head. It's like you don't even have headphones in at all. HOW LONG DO THEY LAST? The Headphone has a carry case, so you don't lose your buds when they're not in your ears, but unlike the Dash, it doesn't have a built-in battery. When you snap them magnetically back in the case, they won’t automatically be juiced up - you’ll have to plug in over micro-USB to get the power flowing. On a single charge, they should last about six hours, which is longer than most other truly wireless in-ears, but once you're out, you're out. It's a pity Bragi weren't able to include in-case charging. It's nice to have that battery security. READ NEXT: Sennheiser’s Ambeo headphones put directional surround sound in your ears At least is means the case is that little bit more compact and portable than the Dash, but other companies have managed to do both - why not Bragi? HOW DO I GET ONE? The good news is you can sign up for a pair of Headphones right now on Bragi’s site, and they’ll start shipping soon. Price is a real advantage for the Headphone: at US$149, they’re cheaper than most other truly wireless Bluetooth earbuds; a steal if you don’t mind the lack of charging within the case. If you're in the market for a no-frills pair of cable-free earbuds, the Bragi Headphone sounds like a worthy contender for your ears with its fiercely focused features.  Related Articles One Minute Review: Corsair's Wireless Void may fill yours Review: BenQ Zowie Vital boosts your PC's headphones Review: Sennheiser's PC 373D 7.1 headphones deliver amazing sound Review: Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless Review: AKG K92 headphones get the job done and don't cost the earth Source: Copyright © Stuff.tv See more about:  audio  |  bragi  |  bragi headphone  |  headphones  |  review   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   More in Audio (1 of 10 articles) FEATURE Buyers' Guide: Get the right headphones for you << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Drag your guitar into the digital age with iRig Acoustic Stage and Pro I/O << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (3 of 10 articles) NEWS BeoPlay M5 is a big, beautiful cylinder of bass << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (4 of 10 articles) FEATURE Hands-on Preview: Bragi Headphone << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (5 of 10 articles) NEWS Roland's on-the-go mixer gives your smartphone videos stereo sound << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (6 of 10 articles) NEWS Sennheiser’s Ambeo headphones put directional surround sound in your ears << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (7 of 10 articles) FEATURE Which 2017 smartphones will ditch the headphone jack for good? << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (8 of 10 articles) NEWS Vinci headphones listen to you as you listen to them << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (9 of 10 articles) NEWS On-ear and up there: SoundMagic scales new heights << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> More in Audio (10 of 10 articles) NEWS The Beoplay H9 headphones cancel out all the bad noises << Prev Next >> View all Audio articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Audio News Drag your guitar into the digital age with iRig Acoustic Stage and Pro I/O Review Review: Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless Feature Buyers' Guide: Get the right headphones for you Group Test Labs: MP3 Player Roundup: Introduction Gallery Gallery: BitFenix Flo headphones From our Partners     See more offers from the PC & Tech Authority Software Store     Sponsored Links Most popular tech stories 7 accounting packages for Australian small businesses compared: including MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Reckon, Xero 16 top tips for optimising Windows 10 How long will a UPS keep your computers on if the lights go out?

A concept rendering of what the Samsung Galaxy S8 could look like. Image: Steel drake/behance By Raymond Wong2017-01-16 04:09:10 UTC Samsung's next flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, will be arriving very soon. The pressure is on for the Korean electronics giant to deliver a flagship phone that not only improves on the specs of last year's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, but also kicks the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus' butt. SEE ALSO: Samsung's foldable phone could transform into a 7-inch tablet Adding more features has always been Samsung's approach with new flagships, but as the company is no doubt aware after the Galaxy Note7 literally burned out, everyone will be watching closely to see what new safety measures it includes on the S8. What exactly can we expect from the S8? Here's what we're hearing from the rumor mill. 4K upgrade? The Samsung Galaxy S7 has a Quad HD screen. Will the S8 be Samsung's first phone with a 4K display? Image: Keith hopkin/mashable Samsung's gone with Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) displays for a while now and has yet to launch a phone with a 4K screen. While rumors suggest the Galaxy S8 will finally make the leap to a larger (5.7-inch) and higher resolution 4K Super AMOLED display (3,840 x 2,160) — if only because the increased resolution and pixel density will make mobile VR look crisper — it's by no means a lock-in. Another possibility is Samsung will release two S8 phones, a "regular" model and an "Edge" model with Quad HD and 4K resolutions, respectively. According to unverifiable case schematics leaked to GSMArena, Samsung might even drop the "Edge" model and release a "Plus" model with a 6.3-inch display instead. Conversely, another report claims Samsung might ditch flat displays altogether and only launch the S8 with curved edges. (Not a terrible idea since the whole dual curved screen look has become a signature Samsung aesthetic.) It also wouldn't be a stretch if the S8's screen is HDR-ready, like the Note7 was. No home button A concept rendering of the Galaxy S8 without a home button. Image: steel drake Speaking of the display, Samsung is reportedly planning to embed the fingerprint sensor underneath it as opposed to putting it inside the home button. By doing this, Samsung will be able to either increase the screen size and keep the S8's phone dimensions the same (or roughly the same) as the S7, or shrink the device's dimensions (specifically, the height, for better pocketing and one-handed use). A recent Samsung Display TV ad showed off a mock-up for a phone with no home button. It's unlikely Samsung leaked the S8 and was just showing a reference design, but even if the phone shown in the ad isn't the S8, it at least shows Samsung is thinking of getting rid of the home button. These renders from case makers also seem to support the curved screen and no home button design. More performance Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chip is based on a 10-nanometer process and will be in most flagship phones in 2017. Image: qualcomm If history is any indication, Samsung might release the S8 with two different processors — one powered by its own Exynos chip and another by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. Last we heard, Samsung might go with an Exynos 8895 chip and a Mali-G71 graphics chip that is said to provide up to 1.8x more graphics performance than the S7.  The other model is expected to come with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor, which will — surprise, surprise — be produced by Samsung using its 10-nanonmeter process for greater power efficiency. With the 835 chip, the S8 would gain a 27 percent boost in performance over the S7. As for how much RAM, we're hearing some sources say 6GB of RAM and others claim 8GB. Either way, it'll be more than the S7's 4GB. Goodbye headphone jack? Will the S8 have a headphone jack or join the iPhone 7 and remove it? Image: Brittany herbert/mashable Apple caused quite a ruckus when it removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7/7 Plus. And this year, Android phone makers appear to be ready to join the #noheadphonejack club. There are conflicting reports saying Samsung will and won't ditch the headphone jack. If the S8 has a headphone jack, Samsung will be able to rub it in Apple's face. But if it doesn't — then it's time to accept it and go wireless. 'Bixby' AI assistant The iPhone has Siri, Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile phones have Cortana and Google's Pixel phones have the Assistant. Now Samsung is said to be launching its own AI digital assistant. Rumor has it that the S8 will come with its own assistant, possibly called "Bixby" and powered by Viv, the artificial intelligence assistant Samsung acquired in October. Interestingly, the creators of Viv are the same people who created Siri before selling it to Apple.  Assuming Samsung doesn't dumb Viv down, it could stomp all over Siri. Weatherproof The Galaxy S7 is IP68-rated water and dust-resistant. Image: Brittany Herbert/Mashable Samsung's been waterproofing its phones for years. With the S7 and S7 Edge, the company stepped up its Ingress Protection rating to IP68, meaning the phones can be submerged in up to 4.9 feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Additionally, the IP68 rating means they're dust, dirt and sand resistant without needing any caps or covers. With that level of protection, it seems unlikely Samsung would take a step back with the S8 and nix the weatherproofing. According to The Investor, the S8 will sport the same IP68 rating, making it just as weatherproof as its predecessor. One or two cameras? Will the S8 have one or two rear cameras? That is the question. Image: Brittany Herbert/Mashable So far, we've heard almost nothing about what kind of improvements will be made to the S8's cameras.  The logical thing would be for the company to copy Apple's iPhone 7 Plus dual-camera setup. After all, any phone that uses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 835 chip will be able to support dual cameras without any complex wizardry. The closest clue to Samsung pursuing dual cameras for the S8 is a patent Samsung filed previously. But like all patents, it may never end up in any real product. As for the front-facing camera, Pocketnow claims Samsung will give the S8 and 8-megapixel camera with autofocus (up from 5 megapixels on the S7/S7 Edge). Sharper selfies than the iPhone 7 (7 megapixels)? Yes, please! Release date Traditionally, Samsung has used the annual Mobile World Congress as the stage to announce its new flagship phones. However, this year might be different. Word on the street is the company might skip MWC this year and hold its own own "Unpacked" event in April. It'll be later than usual, but given the disastrous Note7 launch, Samsung probably isn't taking any chances. Everything else As much as we think we know about the S8, there's still a lot that we don't know. For example, how big will the battery be, and what will the software will look like? Will the front-facing camera get an upgrade? Will the S8 include the Note7's iris scanner? Will there be wireless charging? How about expandable storage? Heck, we don't even know if Samsung will continue with the "glass sandwich" design it has used for the last two years. Rumors can only tell you so much, and while most of them usually end up being true, there's still plenty of room for Samsung to surprise us.

The Korea Herald > Business > Technology Naver’s Line ranks No. 2 in global app sales   Published : 2017-01-16 12:20 Updated : 2017-01-16 22:44 Line, the mobile messenger established by South Korean internet giant Naver, was the second-most profitable app in the world in 2016, a new year-end report from Sensor Tower showed Monday. According to the mobile app marketing intelligence firm, global music streaming app Spotify generated the highest revenue in the nongame app category for the Apple App Store and the Google Play app store combined. Line came in second, followed by US-based movie and television show streaming service Netflix, online dating app Tinder and internet radio app Pandora, Sensor Tower said. (123RF) On the Apple App Store, Spotify ranked first in terms of revenue, followed by Netflix and Line. On Google Play, however, Line ranked first thanks to the “sales of its stickers and other purchasable items,” followed by Tinder and Pandora. The US market research company also highlighted the rise of Line Manga, the online comic reader and sales platform operated by Line, which ranked No. 7 in overall revenue for both app stores combined. “The real standout we saw across all three rankings (overall, Apple App Store and Google Play), however, was Line Manga, the eponymous chat platform’s comic reader/storefront, which launched in late 2015 and has been a growing source of revenue for the company ever since,” Sensor Tower said. The most-downloaded app of 2016 overall on both Apple and Google’s app stores was Facebook, followed by Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram and Snapchat. With the exception of Snapchat, all of the top five apps are owned by US social networking giant Facebook.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues How to browse privately and avoid persistent tracking on a Mac, iPhone and iPad Glenn Fleishman 16 January, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Security Say you find yourself using the web on a strange computer – maybe one owned by a relative or friend, or in a library or school. When using a computer or other device that you don’t control, you can enable a private-browsing mode to prevent leaving traces of your activities. That’s good for accidental security, as it keeps the next user of the device from visiting a site with your credentials, set in a cookie or via a login, when they didn’t intend to. This an even better idea for shared computers where the subsequent user is someone you don’t know. Likewise, you can set someone else up with private browsing on your Mac, so that they don’t have access to your settings (guest mode in Chrome) or can’t change your settings (all modes), although browsers don’t let you ‘lock’ a browser into that mode. You get better protection by setting up a different user account on a desktop Mac or using the guest account option described next. Each browser’s privacy mode is a little different, so I’ll go through what kinds of data each destroys after a session and how to drop into the mode in each browser. As a general rule, while browsers in a private mode don’t keep a list of downloaded files, those files do persist on your drive after a browsing session is over. Private browsing doesn’t precisely help with anonymity, or keeping your identity difficult to determine for a website on the other end or another party able to snoop your actions at some distant end point. It can, however, prevent sites from effectively depositing tracking cookies and other nasty elements, because when the private browsing session is over, everything associated that’s cached is supposed to be dumped. Guest user account In macOS, the best path of action is to log in as a guest user before using a web browser. This special kind of account let someone hand their computer over to you (or vice versa) without needing providing any access to their own stuff. When you log in as guest, macOS creates a temporary account with its own settings. When the guest logs out, the entire account’s data get destroyed, which is an effective way to ensure privacy. Visit the Users & Groups system preference pane, click the lock, enter credentials for an administrative account, and click Guest User in the list on the left. Then make sure Allow Guests to Log in to This Computer is checked. You can apply restrictions to the guest account by checking the box for Parental Controls, but only if FileVault is turned off. With FileVault full-disk encryption enabled, a guest user can only access Safari. (A bug in macOS lets you check the Enable Parental Controls box even with FileVault turned on.) To get more access, the Mac’s owner could set up an account managed with Parental Controls. Parental Controls can be configured for another account from any administrative account via its preference pane. A managed account can be limited to running specific apps and either allowed to browse any website, barred from those deemed to be ‘adult’, or restricted to a limited set. If you’re concerned about leaving a managed account set up after its use, macOS lets you delete the account’s files via Users & Groups. Click the lock icon and enter an administrative password, and then select an account and click the minus (-) sign. When prompted with “Are you sure…” opt for Delete the Home Folder and click Delete User. Private Browsing in Safari for macOS and iOS Apple isolates what it calls Private Browsing tabs from your regular browsing and from each other. Each tab can’t read information from other tabs. Apple doesn’t record autofill information entered or the pages you visit in a private browsing window. It prevents information leakage within the browser and through sync, too. It doesn’t pass pages through iCloud, so they don’t appear on other devices’ lists of open tabs, and Handoff doesn’t pass the open tab. Searches aren’t retained, and downloads in macOS aren’t shown in the Downloads list. Safari for macOS also blocks reading browser cookies from your regular session and doesn’t store new ones after you close all private windows. Private browsing also blocks websites from using local storage options available via HTML5. Apple’s detail about what happens in iOS is surprisingly thin. On its support site, the company notes, “Private Browsing protects your private information and blocks some websites from tracking your search behaviour. Safari won’t remember the pages you visit, your search history, or your AutoFill information.” It would be nice for iOS details to have the same specificity as those provided for macOS, although in testing, they appear to be effectively the same. In macOS, you create a Private Browsing window in Safari via File > New Private Window (Command-Shift-N). The new window and any subsequent private tabs you create have a dark background in the URL/search field at the top. Exiting private browser mode is a tab-by-tab operation; you can close an individual tab or a window full of private tabs. In iOS, you tap the windows view button (which looks like two overlapping square) or, in some views, like iPhone landscape mode, you can pinch to get that view to appear. Tap the Private button, and it engages Private Browsing Mode. All tabs you open while in this mode are subject to the same privacy rules. Tap the Private button again to exit that browsing mode. With iOS, you can’t merely exit the mode to destroy private browsing tabs. Instead, you have to bring up the windows view and close each tab one at a time. Otherwise, when you resume private browsing, the same tabs appear that you left open in your last private session. Incognito in Chrome for macOS Chrome offers both a guest mode and a private-browsing mode it calls Incognito. From the standpoint of the person who owns the Mac and is loaning it, guest mode is better, because it keeps your bookmarks and other data private. For both kinds of private browsing, Chrome doesn’t store browser history information, which includes URLs, text on the page, and the IP address of pages that are linked from websites you visit – Chrome engages in some look-ahead prefetching and other behaviour in normal operation to speed up browsing. It also omits snaphots of pages you visit, doesn’t share existing cookies, and it deletes any cookies it receives when you close all guest windows or Incognito windows. To start a guest or Incognito session: To browse as a guest, click the name in the upper-right corner of a Chrome window, and then choose Guest from the list. Guest windows don’t pull in any information from existing Chrome profiles, like autofill or bookmark data. To browse Incognito, select New > New Incognito Window (Command-Shift-N). Saved passwords and suggestions based on browsing history will still appear. Close all tabs or the entire Incognito or guest window to exit and dump data that’s temporarily retained. Private Browsing in Firefox for macOS Firefox’s Private Browsing has the best disclosures about precisely what it does and doesn’t retain. It omits adding visited pages anywhere, doesn’t store values entered in form fields, ignores newly entered passwords, won’t update file-download lists, and only retains cookies for the duration of the session. It also doesn’t store cached files or other data after the session ends. This mode does let the user create new bookmarks, however. To create a Private Browsing window, select New > New Private Window (Command-Shift-P). Keep it secret, keep it partially safe Using guest accounts and private browsing helps you prevent your surfing and your settings from commingling with others’ on computers or iPads you might use in passing, while also helping to ensure that someone else can’t scan back to see what you were up to later or access your accounts.

A home automation system can include a plethora of products, systems and technologies. Before you get information overload, let's simplify the definition. Danny Vena (TMFLifeIsGood) Jan 15, 2017 at 3:07PM A home automation system is any series of devices -- such as home appliances, lights and even security cameras -- wirelessly connected to a central hub that can be remotely accessed, controlled and monitored. The technology controls these products using voice activation or input from a smartphone or notebook. Automated functions might include lighting, heating, air conditioning, and appliances. Home automation is no longer the preserve of science fiction and the sector is enjoying something of a renaissance. While historically these systems were an inclusion in high-end homes -- with similarly high-end price tags -- recent advances have put this technology within reach of most consumers. Home automation systems have become much more cost effective, and are now available as entire systems or a la carte for the do-it-yourself (DIY) market. Home automation is a growing trend. Image source: Pixabay. The home automation industry falls into three very broad categories. Let's look at these: Professionally installed systems. Managed service systems. Do-it-yourself (DIY).  Professionally installed systems These are traditional systems that include lighting and environment controls, entertainment, security systems and networks to monitor them all. These systems can cost anywhere between a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars for the equipment and installation, and may contain dozens, if not hundreds of connected devices.  Lighting and environment automation can take a number of forms, such as turning lights on and off automatically when you enter or leave a room. They may have voice controls, can include colored lights for mood lighting, and they can also be used to achieve a level of energy efficiency. Home automation can allow homeowners to control blinds or thermostats in person, automatically, or remotely. Entertainment systems include TV, video games, and streaming videos and music. These systems will typically integrate with streaming services such as Netflix, Roku, Apple's AppleTV, Amazon's Prime video, etc. and may be controlled from a single remote, manually, or through voice controls. Home automation can connect many devices. Image source: Pixabay. Security systems may be a bit of an over-simplification. While these systems include the stereotypical alarm, control pads, and police notification, they do much more. Users can be alerted for such diverse things as when the alarm is activated, if the garage door is left open, if someone opens a door, or the system detects leaking pipes. They can include smoke detectors and CO2 monitors, that will automatically notify the fire department in the event of an alarm. The systems can be controlled remotely via a smartphone to do things like turn the lights on and off, or open and close blinds to give the illusion that you are home -- even when you are not. Users can also access live video monitoring of their homes.  Networks are the fiber connecting these systems. Many of the aforementioned components may be wireless, while things like lighting and security may be hardwired. Wireless connections require sophisticated home networks and broadband optimization, to ensure that these devices and others have the necessary bandwidth to provide optimum functionality. Managed service systems This category encompasses any service that provides monthly monitoring for a fee. Examples include Comcast's Xfinity Home, ADT and AT&T's Digital Home Life. These systems are usually security based, but may include other features such as door controls and video monitoring. Such services might mean paying an installation fee and can cost from $500 to $1,000 per year and contain 5-10 devices.  Do-It-Yourself This is the fastest growing segment of home automation.  According to Statista, the home automation segment in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17% between 2017 and 2021. The most visible participants in the category include voice activated assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Alphabet's Google Assistant and Apple's Siri. You can use any of these services to control any number of separately purchased individual components, such as lights, thermostats, locks and smoke/CO2 detectors. These components can be used without the benefit of a built-in system (so no installation cost), and provide consumers with a vast array of devices to choose from. Most consumers in this category spend between $100 and $500 per device and have an average of between 1 and 3 devices. Foolish final word The evolution of the concept and practice of home automation gives consumers many choices. Recent innovations provide an array of options at almost every price point, and the composition of these systems is limited only by the imagination and budget of the buyer. These systems, especially in the DIY category, will increasingly become part of everyday life with the introduction of popular virtual assistants like Alexa. The home automation segment will only become more significant in years to come. Now, if I could only get a system that would do my laundry for me!    Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

When they were rebuffed, they started Apple Computer. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint For many, the New Year is a chance for a new beginning, perhaps best represented by the baby and the old man, symbols of the new and old years since the time of the ancient Greeks. The fresh-faced cherub connotes so much promise. But so often, a few weeks into the new calendar, the good intentions and hopeful resolutions start to fade. Change is hard and old habits are stubborn. The future starts to look much more like the old man. Could this year be different? Yes. But only if you resolve to make the effort. Consider the case of Gary Boone. As a young engineer at Texas Instruments in 1972, Boone came up with the idea for a full computer on a chip, later to be called a microprocessor. He patented his invention, and eventually made enough noise to get a meeting with the top computer guru at TI. He explained his idea, only to be met with this response: "Young man, don't you realize that computers are getting bigger, not smaller?" Resistance to change like that can destroy companies. Gary Boone's big dream changed the world. Or how about the tale of two Steves: Jobs and Wozniak, that is. They tried to sell the idea of personal computers to their bosses at Atari and Hewlett-Packard. But their bosses weren't interested. So, they started Apple Computer. Whether it's a new job, a new business or a new whatever, you must be committed to making changes that will bring about your desired outcome. But if you don't want this year to look like last year, the time to start is right now. Start by taking charge of your life. It's not easy, but it is necessary if you want to make this year your best year. You don't have to do what you've always done or what everyone else expects from you. Think about what you really want to achieve and why. Then determine how to make it happen. Maybe it's learning some new skills that translate to a new job. Maybe it's formulating a business plan so you can finally be your own boss. Maybe it's working with a mentor to get inspiration or practical advice. Maybe it's just giving yourself permission to take a risk. Motivate yourself by identifying the benefits of change. Money is always a motivator, but there are other factors that are equally important: job satisfaction, personal growth, marketability, pride of ownership and peace of mind. Once you decide what you want to do and why, the next logical step is to get started. Focus on one area at a time. Allow enough time to make real, sustainable progress. Change will not happen overnight. But as the pieces start to fit together and you see actual progress, staying motivated will be much easier. I mentioned working with a mentor, and I cannot overemphasize how important that relationship is. Find industry organizations that match your goals and seek advice. Identify people in your network who can help you connect with their contacts. Share your dreams with people who will not only support you, but also challenge you and encourage you to keep working toward your heart's desire. Big changes often mean big risks. What if what you thought you wanted doesn't work out the way you thought it would? What if it works out even better? No risk, no reward. Open yourself up to the possibilities. You might discover that you weren't dreaming big enough. Keep track of your progress. Note every little accomplishment and take stock of how far you've come. If a journal or chart would make it more tangible, go for it. As the saying goes, a journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step. Do one thing every day that will get you closer to your goal. Even if it's just reading an article or signing up for a class, be persistent. Developing habits like this are central to making changes that stick. It keeps you focused on the prize. It also sets you up to succeed beyond your goals, because you know what is required for the next big thing. Jan. 1 may have come and gone, but don't wait another year to get going on your dream. A happy new year can start today! Mackay's Moral: You don't have to uproot the whole tree to turn over a new leaf. Harvey Mackay is a Minneapolis businessman.

This morning Samsung revealed two brand new “class leading” extremely thin and lightweight Galaxy Tab S2 tablets aimed directly at the iPad and iPad Mini. Advertisement Over the course of the past month or so we’ve seen a few different leaks tease these tablets, but today they’re official and we now have all the details. Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S2 is thinner, lighter, more powerful, has an improved fingerprint scanner like the Galaxy S6 and promises to deliver the best Android tablet experience to date. Read: Samsung Galaxy Tab S2: What We Know So Far The Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup can be a bit confusing with all the different options, names and sizes, but the company’s latest Galaxy Tab S2 looks to be the best Android tablet released in all of 2015 so far, and is coming early next month. Below is everything buyers need to know. Advertisement Advertisement In June of last year Samsung introduced the all new Samsung Galaxy Tab S, a premium Android tablet with high-end specs the company hoped could take on the Nexus 7, the iPad, and anything else from the competition. The 8.4-inch Galaxy Tab S was our favorite tablet to date, and now two more are coming soon that are absolutely worth considering. Here in 2015 Samsung’s brand new Galaxy Tab S2 takes an entirely different approach to Android tablets. Just like the iPad and Google’s recent Nexus 9, these tablets no longer have a long and skinny design — known as a 16:9 aspect ratio — and instead are not quite as tall and instead are a little wider like the iPad. Now that both tabs have been announced, here’s everything you need to know. Galaxy Tab S2 Design The new Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 is considerably different from previous tablets from Samsung, and that’s due to a demand to change things up, not to mention follow Google’s lead. They’ve ditched the long and skinny 16:9 aspect ratio that was only good for viewing video, and switched these new tablets to a 4:3 aspect ratio that isn’t as long, and slightly wider. This makes them resemble print media, perfect for browsing the web, reading, and everything else. As you can see from the image above, the shape is similar to the Nexus 9 and iPad, rather than traditional Android tablets. While users won’t have as much screen real-estate for viewing movies, everything else will benefit from the change. Advertisement That isn’t all either. Samsung claims the new Tab S2 has a class-leading design and is the thinnest and lightest tablet in this size category and class. These tablets are wafer-thin, coming in at only 5.6mm thin (that’s 0.2-inches) and extremely lightweight. Thinner, lighter and more powerful than the iPad Air or Mini. Read: Android 5.0 vs Android 4.4 KitKat: What’s New in Lollipop Just like the Galaxy Tab S from last year these new tablets come in Black or White plastic, but are wrapped in a lightweight and durable aluminum frame that protects the edges. Along with the new design and completely redesigned internals with powerful specifications, the Galaxy Tab S2 now employs the same accurate and easy to use fingerprint sensor in the home button found on the Galaxy S6 and the upcoming Galaxy Note 5. The original S had a fingerprint sensor, but it wasn’t very easy to use, and was no where as good as Apple’s TouchID. This will work with Android M later this year, and will be used to unlocking the device, PayPal purchases, signing into your Samsung account and much more for added security and peace of mind. Galaxy Tab S2 Display With the change to a shorter 4:3 aspect ratio both of these tablets now have a slightly different screen size and resolution. They still feature Samsung’s impressive S-AMOLED display with true to life accurate colors, but received a slight drop in resolution. They no longer have a 2560 x 1600 Quad-HD display, but still come in with a resolution of 2048 x 1536. The Galaxy Tab S2 comes in an 8-inch variant, as well as an iPad-like 9.7-inch size. Last year they were 8.4 and 10.5-inches, respectfully. Advertisement According to Samsung the slightly smaller screen will still deliver true colors, crisp text, and one of the best viewing experiences of any tablet around. Here’s what Samsung had to say. The tablet also presents deeper contrast and more precise detail to provide a best-in-class reading experience with the Super AMOLED display delivering 94% of natural tones to show true-to-life colors (Adobe RGB color standard). Users can now enjoy galleries of vividly detailed photos and effortlessly shop online while viewing the most accurate images on the Galaxy Tab S2. In addition, the Galaxy Tab S2 continually offers its advanced screen technology to display bright and natural content for a more comfortable visual experience. Adaptive Display intelligently adjusts gamma, saturation, and sharpness based on the application, the color temperature of the viewing environment and ambient lighting. Also, Reading Mode modifies the screen’s brightness level to help users to read content for longer periods of time without straining their eyes.” The screen is slightly smaller and received a little dip in resolution, but will still be some of the best available for Android users. I for one, welcome the change, but everyone has different wants or needs. Galaxy Tab S2 Specs Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S2 comes with enough horsepower to make them some of the best tablets on the market, and will rival anything else available today. They’ve integrated the same powerful internals as the Galaxy S6, which means users can expect smooth fast performance, great multi-tasking with multi-window mode, having two apps open at the same time, and much much more. Here’s the hard numbers for those curious. Advertisement Galaxy Tab S2 Specs 8 and 9.7-inch 2048 x 1536 Resolution Full HD AMOLED Display 8-core Samsung Exynos processor with 3GB of RAM 32 and 64GB of storage with a micro-SD slot for expansion up to 128GB Android 5.0 Lollipop with Samsung TouchWiz UX (promise to Android M soon) WiFi and 4G LTE options 8 Megapixel rear and 2.1 megapixel front cameras Fingerprint scanner and sensor for security Dual bottom facing speakers Aluminum design 5,870 mAh and 4,000 mAh battery 5.6mm thin As you can see from the impressive list of details above these new tablets are amazingly thin being only 5.6mm thick. They’re also the lightest tablets in each respective size category being lighter than the iPad Mini 3 and the new Air. That being 265g for the 8-inch model and 389g for the 9.7-inch variant. Samsung kept the same aluminum design, added a better fingerprint scanner, and tossed in the powerful 8-core Samsung Exynos processor. Galaxy Tab S2 Price Today Samsung finally unveiled these tablets, which many expected to debut in June just like last year, but along with the announcement were no details regarding the price, or a release date. That being said, last year Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S range matched the iPad Mini and iPad Air in terms of pricing all while delivering more features, not to mention a micro-SD slot to expand storage. The WiFi Galaxy Tab S 8.40inch was $399, and Samsung offered the 10.5-inch Tab S for $499. The same entry-level pricing as the iPad. This year we’re expecting the same $399 and $499 price for the WiFi models, but that gets you 32GB of RAM instead of only 16GB. Then the price should increase if buyers choose a 4G LTE model. That said, carriers will likely bundle these for $199 with a new 2-year contract, like AT&T and Verizon did last year. Galaxy Tab S2 Release Date In 2014 the Galaxy Tab S 8.4 and 10.5-inch tablets were both announced in June and released three weeks later in mid July. Today Samsung confirmed its new Galaxy Tab S2 will be available “around the globe from August” which means we can expect the same similar release. Look for the all-new and improved Galaxy Tab S2 to be available around the middle of August for the prices mentioned above, if not sooner. We’ll update as soon as Samsung announces formal pricing and actual release dates. 2 Responses 07/20/2015 SGreen2K Reply TabletBlue . com is one site worth reviewing and has some really nice deals on Android tablets, including the Pipo P8 8-inch model for $159 – which matches most of the specs of the iPad Mini 3, including a Retina display plus includes GPS and Dual Band Wifi — TabletBlue also has two new Dual Boot tablets which is the newest trend in tablets and makes it easy to use both Windows 8.1 and Android OS Apps on the same device — with tablets that launched this month that include an 8″ model for $164 and a 10″ model for $229 — both which are powered by an Intel processor, offer HD screens and have long battery life.

S2, S3, S4 were smartphones, S is for smartphones, T is for Tablet, hence Tab T2, then we might get T3, T4, etc.. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The ads, which began appearing on TV this weekend, feature the dancer Lil Buck using the AirPods as he walks down the street, making use of Siri and pairing them with an iPhone 7. In the first clip, titled “Pairing,” Lil Buck takes out the AirPods charging case to show off the headphone’s coolest trick: they instantly pair with the iPhone as he opens the lid. The dancer then goes on to do what he does best, even dancing on walls and the side of a car, leading into Apple’s “Practically Magic” slogan. This video also does a great job of pointing out how resistant AirPods are to gravity, and that they won’t easily fall out, even when you’re walking on walls. READ NEXT: SlashGear’s Apple AirPods review Next up is the “Siri” ad, which, as you’d guess, focuses on the AirPods integration with the voice assistant. In the clip, Lil Buck double taps on one of the headphones to activate Siri, and then asks her to play Marian Hill’s “Down.” This, of course, leads to more dancing on walls. Another clip titled “Notes” uses the AirPods as notes on a music staff, ending with a quick shot of the charging case and an iPhone 7. While all the commercials seem to promote using the headphones with the latest model of Apple’s smartphone, they are compatible with the iPhone 5 and up, as long as the device is running iOS 10.

(Evan Vucci/AP) BY Adam Edelman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Sunday, January 15, 2017, 12:47 PM President-elect Donald Trump, the mogul showman who as a businessman attached his name to myriad real estate properties, golf courses and even steaks, is opting for an understated inauguration ceremony. But many of the week's events — set to get underway Thursday — still appear to feature at least a smidge of the outspoken billionaire's flair, including a “Big Apple Ball” and a party called the "Deploraball.” Thomas Barrack, Jr., the chief of Trump's Inaugural Committee, told reporters Tuesday that his team had sought to “surround” Trump “with the soft sensuality of” the nation's capital, rather than “with what people consider A-listers.” And while Trump's minimal list of well-known celebrity entertainment corroborates that theory, other elements of the festivities certainly appear to include some of the panache the President-to-be employed during his campaign. Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down will perform at Trump’s inauguration On Thursday, following a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor U.S. veterans, Trump and vice president-elect Mike Pence will hold a "Make America Great Again" welcome party at the Lincoln Memorial where a “diverse group” of entertainers will perform. They’ll include alt-rock band 3 Doors Down and country star Toby Keith. Later Thursday, the Inaugural Gala, hosted by the Great America Alliance, a pro-Trump Super PAC, will kick off with country music band Big & Rich. The “yuge” events, however are Friday — Inauguration Day. Women's March on Washington could outdraw Trump's inauguration Entertainment will kick off around 9:30 a.m., with the best-known acts being the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, 16-year-old former “America's Got Talent” contestant Jackie Evancho and New York dance group The Rockettes. Trump's inaugural planning group struggled to attract entertainment for the event, with more than a dozen acts — including Elton John, Celine Dion, Andrea Bocelli and Garth Brooks — having declined invitations to perform. 16-year-old former “America's Got Talent” contestant Jackie Evancho will perform on Inauguration Day. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Capital Concert) Meanwhile, Trump will join President Obama at the White House and the two men will then ride together, along with outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama and incoming First Lady Melania Trump, to the Capitol for the event. Following remarks from religious leaders, including Timothy Cardinal Dolan, the leader of the New York Archdiocese, the Rev. Franklin Graham and Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Trump and Pence will be sworn in on the west front of the U.S. Capitol, with the First and Second families, President Obama, members of Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, George W. and Laura Bush and Bill and Hillary Clinton looking on. Jennifer Holliday backs out of inauguration for LGBT fans At least 500,000 more are expected to watch the ceremony from the National Mall. Afterward, Trump and Pence will travel down Pennsylvania Avenue, to the White House, as part of a parade that includes high school and college bands, police motorcycle and cavalry units and veterans and active members of the military. Then the fun starts. Three official inaugural balls have been planned, including a New York-themed fest dubbed the "Big Apple Ball." N.Y. pols to boycott Trump inauguration over Rep. John Lewis spat The city-scented soirée will feature cut-outs of iconic Manhattan landmarks like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, TMZ reported last week and the fete's theme will be entirely based on the line "If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere," from "Theme from New York, New York" popularized by Frank Sinatra in a 1979 recording. Other groups are hosting additional parties, including the "Deploraball" on Friday night. The $250-a-plate fiesta, whose name is a play on the infamous word Hillary Clinton used during campaign to insult Trump supporters, will be hosted by a social media group calling itself "MAGA-3X" at an event hall in Potomac, Md.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images) The Garden State Inaugural Gala, slated for Thursday night, will feature a performance by the B Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover band that's been in action since 1980. The Boss himself, meanwhile, has been an outspoken Trump critic. At least another 14 unofficial balls are scheduled for Thursday and Friday evenings, including a "Salute to Heroes/Veterans Inaugural Ball" hosted by the American Legion, a "Bluegrass Ball" centered on promoting Kentucky bourbons and a South Carolina Presidential Inaugural Ball, whose main draw will be famous South Carolinians. Saturday will see a national interfaith prayer service at Washington's National Cathedral, marking the official end of festivities. But anti-Trumpers will just be getting started. The "Women's March on Washington," billed as a protest against Trump and his feared crackdown on issues important to women, could draw between 50,000 and 1 million people and will include among its biggest-name marchers Cher, Julianne Moore, Katy Perry, Amy Schumer and Scarlett Johansson. More than 1,200 buses transporting participants have applied for permits to park at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. for the event. By comparison, only 200 have applied for parking at the stadium on Friday, the day of the inauguration, The Washington Post reported. But according to Barrack, Trump's inauguration committee chief, the mogul himself prefers it that way. "The focus will be for this president, since he is a celebrity, is really on the place, on the people," Barrack said. "It's a much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration that's a coronation."

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish How To Unjailbreak The iPhone By Ankush Das on 01/15/2017 08:00 PST Jailbreaking your iPhone lets you utilize Cydia and do other things (Jailbreaking = unlocking Apple’s controls on user permission to install any apps and change any settings). Also, there are other benefits to it. However, at some point in time, you may want to undo what you have done i.e unjailbreak your device. For instance, taking your device to Apple’s service center would require you to unjailbreak iPhone because if they found out it’s jailbroken, they will not possibly cover the repair charges (you will have to pay!). In either case, if you want the data on your device to stay secure by installing the latest iOS update, you will again need to unjailbreak your iPhone. So, whatever be your case, you definitely need to know how to unjailbreak iPhone. Steps To Unjailbreak the iPhone Jailbreaking might require someone geeky enough with the courage to potentially ruin (or “brick”) the device. However unjailbreaking is not as risky. Follow the steps mentioned below in order to unjailbreak your iPhone: Make sure you have downloaded and installed iTunes successfully on your Mac or Windows system. Connect your iPhone to the computer and launch iTunes. As soon as you are connected, you will be prompted to “Trust” or “Do Not Trust” the computer. Of course, you need to tap on “Trust” to allow the computer successfully connect with the device. After successfully connecting the device, you need to click on the device icon as shown in the image below. When you click on the device icon, you will get a window which summarizes the information of your device (storage, updates, etc.,) If it’s the first time with iTunes, it will possibly start backing up your device by now.If the backup process starts, wait for it to complete because you may need the backup later.Do note that if you already had your iPhone backed up before jailbreaking, you can still perform the backup successfully and use it later. Fret not, Cydia apps do not get backed up, only the default data gets backed up. So, even if you do not have a previous backup you can still generate the same after jailbreaking. Now, to undo what you did (i.e., jailbreak), we need to restore the device back to its original state. You can use any of your previous backup files to restore (as per your requirement). However, before proceeding to restore the device, make sure you turned off  “Find My iPhone” service. It needs to be disabled in order to perform the restoration. While on the device summary window, scroll down to find backup and restore option as shown in the image below. Now, simply click on it to start restoring your iPhone. The device will restart and you will be asked whether you would like to restore it from your backup or not, proceed with confirmation to successfully restore the device that includes only the system applications and data you backed up excluding jailbreak applications from Cydia. And, it is done! You have successfully restored your iPhone to the original state that is much more secure than a jailbroken device. Were you able to successfully unjailbreak your iPhone?

By John Solinap on January 15 2017 06:12 PM Share Tweet Share Share Email Apple’s iPad product line has branched out to several exciting products over the past years. Certainly one of the most popular models of the iPad though is the iPad Air. The thin and light tablet has been one of the hottest selling iPads in the market. Now, many tech fans are excited about the upcoming iPad Air 3 which is releasing soon. If the iPad Air 3 rumors are to be believed, a thinner iPad Air 3 could be coming as early as March of this year. The iPad Air product line boasts of being lightweight and portable, hence its name. This year though, Apple may very well make the device slightly larger without compromising on its weight and portability. iPad Air 3 Expected to Be Thinner Than iPad Air 2 According to MacWorld UK, the upcoming iPad Air 3 is rumored to be thinner than the iPad Air 2. This is certainly not a big surprise as Apple is constantly trying to outdo itself when it comes to releasing the latest gadgets. The iPad Air 2 was thinner than the original iPad Air so the upcoming iPad Air 3 will likely continue the trend. What is surprising though is that Apple intends to do this while reportedly increasing the screen size of the tablet. The same MacWorld UK report mentions that there could be a version of the iPad Air 3 which will have a 10.9-inch display. This certainly makes the iPad Air 3 slightly bigger but without adding too much weight and thickness to the device. iPad Air 3 Release Happening in March? These iPad Air 3 rumors are surely getting Apple fans very excited for the release of the tablet. Well, the wait is not going to be that much long now as a March 2017 launch is currently being predicted. Apple surely is going to have another media event this March and the iPad Air 3 could be the star of the show. Be sure to check back here soon to find out more news and updates on the iPad Air 3 as well as on the other great gadgets releasing soon.

As that tide of money receded from money managers, Marc Chaikin, a trader, broker and analyst with over 30 years of market experience, identified an opportunity to help those individual investors effectively manage their money using the same methods as those used by the big brokerage firms. That is when he started Chaikin Analytics. Chaikin visited Benzinga's PreMarket Prep morning show on Wednesday to talk about the genesis of Chaikin Analytics as well as the factors and developments that have made the application a success for everyone from hedge fund managers, like John Paulson and George Soros, to retirees managing their 401(k)s. The Chaikin Power Gauge One of the essential components of Chaikin Analytics' success has been the Chaikin Power Gauge, a 20-factor alpha model that determines a stock's long- and short-side potential over a three- to six-month period. On the show, Chaikin elaborated on some of the quantitative aspects that underlie the gauge's success in forecasting a stock. "We break them down into four components," Chaikin began. "The financial metrics are value metrics that a Warren Buffett would look at, and there the two key metrics are free cash flow and price to sale. Then we look at earnings because earnings are critical, in that component earnings surprise is very important." Chaikin emphasized that, on the eve of earnings season, the pattern of these reports from quarter to quarter can persist, and the gauge allows investors to understand these earnings trends through back-tested and real time data. Chaikin continued explaining the elemental makeup of the Power Gauge and how each metric is equally weighted to provide an eclectic model of a stock's potential performance, saying, "We also look at sentiment type indicators, whether the insiders are buying, what the shorts are doing. Finally, we look at whether the analysts are raising or lowering their estimates and whether they're changing their opinions about a stock. Only about 15 percent of the model is technical, 85 percent fundamental, and we do this for 5,000 U.S. equities and we update it nightly." Technical Supplements In addition to the Chaikin Power Gauge, the program also offers additional tools to help refine the information and guidance offered by the gauge such as technical indicators and a stock screener. "We encourage people to combine [the gauge] with two technical indicators," said Chaikin. "Chaikin Money Flow measures institutional buying and selling and relative strength is a reality check. Because no matter how good your model is, your fundamental research, if the market doesn't agree with you, at best it's dead money at worst it's a disaster in the making." When discussing his program's stock screener, Chaikin pointed out that, while it functions similarly to other options in winnowing stocks down by style, market cap and technical indicators, his allows users to screen on quantitative factors that are part of a proven investment model. Discovering The Right Stock One of Chaikin Analytics newest additions was added just three weeks prior to Chaikin's appearance on PreMarket Prep. The Stock Discovery Engine offers tailored stock picks based on the qualities of other securities. "The Discovery Engine uses the kind of technology an logic Spotify uses to find music that you like and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) uses to find film. You basically seed it with a stock and then it finds similar stocks." Chaikin provided examples on the versatility of the engine in providing traders a variety of picks to diversify their portfolio or shift their capital away from a falling stock or sector. "If you type JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) into our stock discovery engine, you're going to get five stocks, typically large-cap banking stocks with similar credentials and similar characteristics to JPMorgan. On the other hand, if you type in a bearish stock like The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), you're going to find other bearish stocks, typically in the beverage sector, but then you'll also find swaps — stocks that you can use to get out of Coca-Cola if you're unfortunate enough to be in it." According to Chaikin, the response to the Discovery Engine has been phenomenal, and he emphasized that the tool is offering the same type of curation that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) provide to their customers. Parting advice Before leaving, Chaikin gave some thoughtful advice to Benzinga's audience. He stressed that, when managing their own portfolios, traders need a specific strategy to help determine the potential value of a stock and maximize the efficacy of their trades, and he feels Chaikin Analytics and its various products can provide that. "That's the most powerful message I can leave with your listeners," Chaikin stated. "You need a disciplined methodology to cut through the clutter and focus on a core group of stocks for your long and short trading, where you have confidence based on some disciplined methodology that you have a directional edge." Listen to the full discussion with Chaikin at the 35-minute mark in the clip below to hear how Sandy Chaikin rebounded from the 2008 crash using the Chaikin Analytics model.

With the iPhone SE being the perfect small phone, Android users are looking for something similar. That said, buyers still have plenty to choose from. Below is a list of some excellent small screen Android phones worth buying right now. Advertisement Samsung started it all with the original Galaxy Note, the first “phablet” and now every company offers a huge phone, including Apple. Of course, not all users want a big screen. Some want a phone that’s small and portable, easy to hold, and doesn’t look massive next to their face. Read: 10 Best Cheap Android Smartphones Lately most small devices don’t come with high-end specs or the features we want from a premium device. Either buy a gigantic phone, or compromise in order to get something smaller. Getting a small screen without sacrificing performance and quality is hard to come by, but there are still some rather good options available to buyers. Best Small Screen Android Phones Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Moto G (2015) Samsung Galaxy A3 Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini BLU Studio Energy 2 Buyers looking for a device with the latest cutting edge features, powerful processors and great cameras, will be looking at a device over 5-inches in size and likely $400-$700. Additionally, you do have other choices. One’s we’ve gathered for you. The iPhone SE is a unique phone with a small 4-inch screen like old iPhone options, but upgraded internals to match 2016 devices. Other manufacturers offer something similar, too. Advertisement The Galaxy S7 is nearly 5.2-inches, Google’s Nexus 6P is 5.7-inches, and the most recent Moto X is a whopping 5.7-inch device. Small phones are disappearing. That said, HTC, Sony, Samsung, Motorola, and a few others still have phones that are small without sacrificing too much. Or smaller, at least. In closing, we’ve gathered a few premium high-end small screen phones for you. Budget devices that aren’t huge, and even one that can last nearly four days. These are all “small” in today’s world, but none have a tiny 4-inch screen like Apple’s latest device. Some even have a 5-inch screen, because that’s becoming the norm. With that out of the way, below is a list of 5 small screen Android smartphones worth buying. We’ll update throughout 2017 as more phones are released. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact   1 / 5 The Sony Xperia lineup isn't very popular in the United States, but Sony makes some pretty great smartphones. The best of them all, is the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact announced back in September of 2015. Which was released in February. Sony released three Xperia Z5 devices. One with a 4k screen, a regular flagship model, and the popular Z5 Compact. It has everything flagship phones have, including a fingerprint scanner, but it's small enough to still use easily with one hand. The Z5 Compact features a 4.6-inch 720p HD display, a powerful Snapdragon 810 8-core processor with 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, a micro-SD slot, Android 5.1 Lollipop, a 23 megapixel rear and 5mp front camera setup. There's a fingerprint scanner built into the side of the phone, which doubles as the power button, and the phone is water-resistant. Sounds good right? The US version doesn't have the fingerprint scanner. So keep that in mind if this is a phone on your radar. Advertisement It can be found for as low as $349 at Best Buy. We'd also recommend users consider the Sony Xperia X Compact which was just announced in September (2016) and released in October. It has the same 4.6-inch small screen, but top-teir specs along with 3GB of RAM and a bigger 2,700 mAh battery. That said, the Z5 will be cheaper.   1 / 5 57 Responses 11/06/2015 Vivanflusk Reply 0=17my step dad recently bought a 6 month old Volvo C30 just by some part-time working online with a laptop… hop over to this web-site… See More 12/31/2015 Diggie Reply Started good with z3 compact, and stopped looking when the moto g 2015 was mentioned. Anything over 4.5-4.7 is not compact, and the 2015 moto g is a bulky behemoth 05/18/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply Completely agree. 4.7 inches must be the absolute top when it comes to compact phones, anything over 4.7 is definitely not small. 4.7 isn’t that small either but it still works… There are way too few small phones, but the compact series work (Z1C-Z5C), then there’s Galaxy S5 mini, Galaxy A3 (2015) and even Galaxy A3 (2016). Beyond that…maybe a few Xiaomi phones, but sadly not much else. 05/18/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply And yeah…Galaxy Alpha too. 08/22/2016 Blarghest Reply Galaxy Alpha really is let down by a very weak battery. Had Xperia 3 compact before it and it was like night and day. Battery lasted 2-3 times as long as the weak Samsung model. 01/28/2016 Katherine Reply According to me, Note 5 deserve number 1 spot with features like fast wireless charging and adaptive fast charging that I could measure through this cable bought from Amazon: http://amzn.to/1PdysgD 07/09/2016 Daniel Cloud Reply Your answer indicates you’ve missed the point of this article. 01/28/2016 Bryankbeard Reply 0=2228my buddy’s mother makes $89 /hr on the internet .

I guess the truth is small Android phones with decent specs no longer exist. Last truly small Android phone that had halfway decent specs (for its time) was the Motorola Droid Mini. Guess I will be sticking with mine till it’s hopelessly obsolete or jumping ship to iPhone. 04/13/2016 Ed VanDyke Reply AMEN!!! I just traded in my Droid-Mini for a screen-unlock problem I’ve been enduring for over a year. The guy at the Verizon store talked me into the shatter-proof screen and wireless charger of the Droid Turbo 2. But between hemiplegism and this little Dutch paw, I can only reach about half the screen (and that shatterproof screen will pay for itself many time over, based on how many times I’ve dropped it reaching for the num/alpha or shift button, in the day that I’ve had it). Being able to answer incoming calls again, and using my phone without turning it off&on a half dozen times first is certainly an improvement… But I’m scouring the internet to find a better option while I still have a couple weeks to change my mind….. I’ve had a Motorola Android since the ORIGINAL Motorola Droid (slide-out keyboard and all).. But I’m thinking it may be time to get indoctrinated into the i-Niverse…. :/ 05/18/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply There are some Xiaomi phones that are both relatively small and still have good specs, so you might want to check out those. 03/08/2016 Daryl Lindsey Reply You mentioned a 5″MotoG?..There are plenty of that size out there.The HTC M8,M9,A9 all match that size and outperform it in a curb stomp(You didn’t mention on in a budget).Furthermore if your going 5″ why not 5.1″GalaxyS6 active.Most of these phones cpu is comparable to HTC M7.I Do dig the Sony however.And the dust proof Samsung 03/08/2016 Daryl Lindsey Reply Most importantly “Compact” should be 4.5″ or less IMHO…maybe 4.6 03/14/2016 kcw Reply There no more real practical size android phone. The smallest new phone with decent specs out there has a real indecent price. 04/11/2016 Bott Reply They forgot to put Galaxy view or Nexus 9 here… Good list of compact phone 04/12/2016 Jennifer Reply wonderful job now…!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 52512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

Wish the Xperia Z5 compact worked on Verizon. It looks like a fantastic phone. 04/13/2016 Mel Reply Literally none of these are available through Verizon, its like they don’t even want to keep their customers. Please do a review on anything remotely small that is actually available through the provider most used. 07/31/2016 Jim Wilcox Reply I just picked up a Lumia 735 as my first smart phone for $120. Sure, Windows phones may be on a slow death spiral, but this phone will be good for 2-3 years. By that time the phone world will be different, with dropping prices and more features. 04/22/2016 Larry Lewyn Reply PLEASE STOP SHILLING YOUR CRAPPY ADS HERE! This is a place for discussing small phones not selling your garbage! Totally agree 5″ is way too big to be considered compact. 5 years ago a 5″ screen would have been considered giant. I still use my galaxy s4 mini which I think is about 135 grams. I do not want to lug around 160 gram or heavier phone. That is why I have a laptop / tablet. 05/18/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply Completely agree with you on all points, although the S4 Mini had a reaaally crappy battery, but the form factor was really good. Maybe a little too light, though…it almost blew out of my hands a few times when the winds were quite strong. Really sad that they don’t make small phones because there’s definitely a market for it. I went from S4 Mini to S5 Mini, which works okay. Reasonably compact. I really can’t find any better alternative today, so I’m sticking with the S5 Mini for now. 05/04/2016 Z.Y.ZHANG Reply One stuff that i cant understand why u as hole feed us no more than bullsht could be found on any incompatible sites whatever home or abroad[COLD SWEAT] Although as a living sample stocking in an insanely exclusive nation[ no idea u guys will know how hard it could be to access playstore, fb, even skype sometimes while youre born in a double stalin-parent family and trade it like worshipping a God] ive found several smartphones in other countries would help with my dragging like sony so05d, lg bl90, iPhone4s and many other seriously powerful but still not enough cabinet to… put into it[FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY] such as sharp 303sh, shl24, sh02f, sony m51w and many other amazing devices made in China easy to carry and probably a little easier to one’s uknowhat of an elder man like xiaomi 2s or iuni u2.

You’re kidding me, thats not even near small. 05/09/2016 Erik Reply You must be kidding – none of these are small. I have a Motorola Droid RAZR M and these are all bigger. Why are there no options for small smartphones!!!? My daughter got a Moto G and it is a huge brick. I want something to fit in my pocket, not something I’m going to watch movies on all day. I’ll use my tablet or laptop for that. 05/10/2016 Derek Reply I use an Apple SE 4 inch phone. It is just as fast as the Apple 6s. I only care about size. I do not want to look like an idiot you know someone with an Apple 6s plus or a huge samsung on their belt. My wife says those people look stupid. First and foremost it is a phone. My SE fits nicely in my pocket. No other phone has better specs I mean no other 4 inch phone. If you want small go Apple. If you hate Apple still go Apple but wait for some other company to go small then buy that phone. I only care about size not specs. Dont say the samsung phone is better yes it is but not better in size. 05/18/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply I’m so with you on this. Phones should be small, or at least there should be small phones…but these days, all phones are unreasonably big. 05/18/2016 simka Reply I still use Xperia active. It is ~9,5cm in size and I understand this phone as small phone. All those 12cm+ phones are giants… I want my phone to fit in pocket and I call that as compact or mini phone. I dont want to carry that huge TV with me. 05/18/2016 NoMorePhablets Reply NONE. OF. THESE. ARE. SMALL!!!!!!! When is the mobile industry going to LEARN??? Unbelievable. This article is a TOTAL WASTE OF STORAGE SPACE. 07/03/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply I agree with you but just out of curiosity, what would you consider small? What size limits would you like, both on the screen and on the outer dimensions? 05/30/2016 baitisj Reply Dimensions? Nowhere to be seen. Goodbye. 07/03/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply So true! Although, you can easily look it up, but I still agree with you. Dimensions should always be present in every article about phones. 06/04/2016 larry l Reply I with many here. The article is extremely misleading and deceptive as to what a small size is. I had a Samsung Captivate (i927/i897) that I really liked. One of the reasons I like it was the screen size or should I say “Display Size” which was, diagonally actually 4 inches. The entire phone was 5 inches. The phones mentioned here are at minimum “Display Size about 5 inches which in turn makes the entire phone closer to 6 inches; which I would say is a larger phone; but certainly, I wouldn’t put a label on it as having a “small screen”. 06/12/2016 henry1941 Reply 4 inches – 10 cm maximum dimension. Otherwise it is not mobile. 07/03/2016 Skuggvarg (@skuggvarg77) Reply It’s not like I recommend it, but did you check the dimensions of the S4 Mini? That’s the last decent phone that was quite small. 06/17/2016 comment Reply I would like a new phone the size of my existing Nokia C7. The Nokia C7 is a great size phone. 06/18/2016 AD12 Reply Alcatel Idol 3 4.7 has to be #1 on this list 06/23/2016 MadGabZ Reply I still carry my Sony Ericsson Arc S from 2011. It’s tweaked and modded to hell, just to run a few apps, but the design and form factor is UNBEATABLE! If only someone would update the hardware innards of that design, it would be killer.. for me, at least! :) It’s the PERFECT size for a pocket phone, good for sneak pr0n in bed, decent for the occasional google search, etc. 06/30/2016 M Reply Not a fan of smartphones but I love SoundCloud. Will SC run on this device?thanks 07/05/2016 likesitfast Reply The Xperia mini was the best compact phone if only it had buttons instead of touch screen for the home, back or file which over heated and rendered the phone useless until it had cooled. Surely not everyone wants a phablet which seems to be the trend at the moment. Even my current Xperia M1 is too big. Now manufacturers insist on glass screens! Why? They’re only going to crack and need replacing. it’s a compromise that I’d happily take and the quality doesn’t suffer that much. Wake me up when we have some choice of small phones…… zzzzzZZZZZ zzzzzzZZZZZZ zzzzzzzZZZZZ 07/10/2016 Jan Bartnik Reply How about LG Wine Smart? It’s sub 4″ I think. The specs are… well 2010-ish… but it’s new. 08/17/2016 Abhar Reply xperia z5 compact is fuсking сrар! The worst smartphone I’ve ever had! Or STUPIDPHONE, rather.

Surly the important thing about this article is the size. The size if the divice is not stated. 10/03/2016 dave99stang Reply It’s very frustrating, it seems like all the phones out there are either big or huge. I would like to move from apple to andriod because I hate how everything apple is so proprietary and they force their updates on you. Unfortunately with no small (sub 4.5 inch, preferably 4 inch) android phones with awesome hardware out there I will probably go back to apple with the SE. 10/12/2016 iguest77sdf Reply You people dont know what is SMALL phone. Let me show you what I have been using for years. It is small , one hand operated and displays as much information as a 4inches phone. I goes in my hand unnoticed. In any pocket. This is small – its height is 88mm!!!!! xperia mini http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_xperia_mini-3947.php 10/21/2016 Andis Reply 5 inches is already a superbig screen. 3.7 is the maximum for small screens. Sony Xperia Mini was actually the last one. 01/15/2017 GSM Reply Is this a joke or clickbait title? Since when 4.7 inches is considered “compact”?? I was expecting something like a list of phones similar to Posh Mobile Micro X S240 (2.4 inch Android phone).

Anime Strike offers U.S. Prime members access to over 1,000 anime TV shows and movies for an extra $4.99 per month on top of the $99 Prime subscription. Amazon says the adult-themed channel will serve up seinen classics as well as weekly anime exclusives from Japan. A seven-day free trial lets Prime members check out the channel, which features "The Great Passage", "Scum's Wish", and "Blue Exorcist: Kyoto Saga", as well as anime classics like "Paprika" and "Tokyo Godfathers". Amazon's existing add-on video subscription services include channels such as HBO, Comedy Central’s Stand-Up Plus, and Cinemax, but Anime Strike is the company's first own-branded, curated offering. Speaking to Variety, Amazon said it plans to launch additional branded subscription VOD channels in the coming months. The move indicates intensifying competition among streaming services, with a wider range of exclusive content becoming increasingly necessary if companies are to fend off rival offerings. Back in November, sources claimed Apple was considering a price drop for Apple Music in time for the holiday period, with Amazon cited as the "biggest motivation" for the discussions over monthly pricing. However, the service's $9.99 price tag remains in place, and with reports this week that Apple is planning to create its own original TV shows for Apple Music, more content rather than lower cost appears to be the overriding strategy. Amazon already serves up original TV content to Prime members through Instant Video, while the company's Amazon Music Unlimited service costs $7.99 per month (or $9.99 per month for non-Prime members). According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon has held talks with a number of sports leagues including the NFL and NBA about obtaining live game rights, with a view to either including a sports package as part of its Prime membership or offering it as a paid add-on. In July of last year, Amazon U.S. was estimated to have 63 million Prime members – more than half the online retailer's customer base.

If I didn't take advantage of the shipping perk regularly, there is no way I'd continue my Prime subscription. And on topic, this news is particularly ironic because Amazon censors its anime offerings on Prime. They think I'll pay them extra for more butchered content? No thanks. It's practically insulting. Rating: 9 Votes invalidname 2 weeks ago Many anime fans are actually pretty livid about this, since Amazon has locked up one of the Winter season's few good shows, Scum's Wish, and the price is pretty hefty if you're not already a Prime subscriber. Even if you are, $5/month is arguably not worth a small number of exclusives and a bunch of stuff available elsewhere. Anime fans had been counting on the consolidation of the streaming market with last year's tie-up between leading services Crunchyroll and Funimation (which are now both available as part of the $10/mo Vrv bundle… EDIT: and are also available free-with-commercials), and the thought of needing to pay for four or five separate subscriptions has more than a few fans publicly proclaiming that they're just going to go back to the piracy tactics that were mainstream prior to the emergence of Crunchyroll.

Well anime fans are going to be at the front of a long line of livid fans of multiple genres. This is what it's going to be going forward. Tons of mini subscriptions to get the full compliment of what you want. That a la carte pipe dream a lot of people want is unsustainable. Always has been, always will be. So people will have to pony up for a load of mini subscriptions or pirate. Good times.

But if they start nickel-and-diming us for content, or keep raising the price for the shipping to subsidize video content, screw that, I'm out.

Mantel More On: Food Eat more mushrooms if you want to avoid dementia Watch this model devour a giant dessert in under 7 minutes This gold 'Trump Pizza' will make thousands for shelter Study finds that 47% of LA sushi is not the fish it claims to be A small, salt-water pest could cause a big crisis for Big Apple lox-aholics. The half-inch-long sea louse — Lepeophtheirus salmonis — is killing off huge numbers of juvenile wild salmon in Europe and Canada, which means the price of the city’s favorite brunch treat could jump higher than a spawning sockeye. The parasite, which clearly enjoys dining on the fish as much as New Yorkers do, caused global salmon supplies to dip by 9 percent last year. Meanwhile, algae blooms last year at Chilean fish farms caused yet another juvenile salmon die-off, which experts say will drop supply still further this winter. As a result, wholesale prices have climbed by 40 percent to 50 percent in recent months, according to experts in the United States and Britain, the Guardian reported last week. “They’re only a couple of inches long, and the lice basically eat them alive,” British Columbia, Canada-based marine biologist Alexandra Morton told The Post on Saturday of the juvenile wild salmon that are catching lice from farmed fish throughout eastern Canada, Norway, Scotland and Ireland. Farmed Salmon with the parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis.Alexandra Morton The wild and farmed salmon come into contact because the farmers build their fisheries along rivers to save money, she said. “The worst case scenario? Extinction of wild fish in the areas where there are these farms,” she said. For now, wholesalers and resellers are absorbing much of the cost increase. “It’s gone up 50 cents to a dollar a pound just in the past couple weeks,” griped Lewis Spada, co-owner of Shelsky’s Appetizing and Delicatessen in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, describing his spiraling wholesale costs to The Post on Saturday. But uncertainty abounds. Will lox stocks barrel downward? Will delis start scaling back? “It’s delicious, but 50 percent more — holy smokes!” Nova-lover Chris Hartland, 28, told The Post while noshing at Russ & Daughters on Houston Street. Farmed Salmon with parasite Lepeophtheirus salmonis.Alexandra Morton “We paid $30 for two bagels [with lox and cream cheese], and we’re still hungry!” “Oh man, my daughter would die without her lox and cream cheese on a bagel most mornings,” Jonathan Walsh, 40, of the Upper East Side, said at Zabar’s Eli’s Market. But the country’s biggest supplier of smoked fish, Greenpoint-based Acme Smoked Fish, said dire predictions of a lox lockout are just a schmear campaign. “There will still be as much lox as people want,” insisted David Caslow, co-CEO of Acme. “My personal expectation is we are somewhere in the peak of losses and high prices now.” Acme — which supplies Shelsky’s and other iconic emporiums, including Russ & Daughters, Zabar’s, Kossar’s and Barney Greengrass — has a major plant in Chile that “puts us in a very adventageous mode with Chilean farms,” said the company’s sales head, Buzz Billik. “No one else in the US is in a better position to satisfy the market,” according to Billik.

The Elago W3 stand looks like a miniature Macintosh and works with Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watches (both 38mm and 42mm versions). The simple device was designed to support Apple’s nightstand mode, allowing you to use it as an alarm clock on your bedside table by just slipping the watch bands into the dedicated slot. It looks like a legitimate (albeit tiny) Macintosh, and even comes equipped with the floppy drive cutout. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us.

(AFP - Image Courtesy) Shares116 Sun, 15 Jan 2017-10:44am , AFP Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft are all vying to develop the most sophisticated connected assistant. Microsoft announced Friday a deal to buy Maluuba, a Montreal startup focused on making machines able to think the way people do. Bringing on board Maluuba co-founders Kaheer Suleman and Sam Pasupalak, along with their team from the startup, was intended to accelerate Microsoft's "ability to develop software so computers can read, write and converse naturally," the company said. Microsoft did not disclose financial terms of the acquisition. "Maluuba's vision is to advance toward a more general artificial intelligence by creating literate machines that can think, reason and communicate like humans -- a vision exactly in line with ours," Microsoft artificial intelligence and research group executive vice president Harry Shum said in a blog post. "I'm incredibly excited about the scenarios that this acquisition could make possible in conversational AI." Tech giants Apple, Samsung, Google and Microsoft are all vying to develop the most sophisticated connected assistant -- working to give software the ability to understand what people say and even anticipate desires or needs. Amazon virtual assistant Alexa was a star at the Consumer Electronics Show gadget gala last week in Las Vegas. Amazon and Alexa face fierce competition. At CES, computer chipmaker Nvidia said it would use Google Assistant for its interactive streaming devices. Microsoft's Cortana will power a voice-assistant speaker for kids and families being introduced by Mattel, and will also be in Renault-Nissan's connected car hub. Samsung's smart refrigerator, which acts as a connected hub -- with a voice activation system unveiled at CES -- uses the South Korean giant's Tizen operating system. Many smart devices for the home also integrate with Apple Home Kit, which uses the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence and voice assistant Siri. At CES, Chinese giant Baidu showcased its own virtual assistant "Little Fish" which will debut in China this year.

Many employees at these tech giants enjoy large paychecks and a host of perks ranging from free dry cleaning to free food to gyms on site. But there are thousands of other people working alongside them who don’t make enough money to afford housing near their jobs so many sleep in their cars between shifts. Some sleep in their cars because they are homeless. Terrence Rollins is a 51-year-old bus driver who drives the shuttles that ferry tech employees across Silicon Valley to company campuses. He only has a few hours a night at home before he has to be back at work. “I love my job,” Rollins said. “I get up at 3 [a.m.], I make it home about 11, 10 o’clock at night, and I’m constantly traveling. I mean, I have to take care of my family.” The bus drivers who spoke with ABC News starting in 2015 work for independent contractors hired by tech companies. When we first met these drivers, they said their jobs provided few benefits and didn't offer paid company holidays. Some drivers are contracted to work what’s called a “split shift,” meaning they arrive for work at 6 a.m. to take tech employees to their offices, then have to wait around for a number of hours, unpaid, until it’s time to take the employees back home at the end of the day. These drivers work and are paid for a total of eight hours but over a 16-hour period. They said the houses they can afford on their wages are too far away for them to get home between shifts, so many of them stay in their cars or nap at the bus depot. In the bus depot where he is based, Rollins said there was one room with two beds for female drivers and another room with two beds for male drivers. But it wasn't enough to accommodate the 35 to 40 drivers there on any given day. “It’s just awful when you park inside and you have drivers covering their cars’ [windows] with blankets and towels,” said another driver named Jimmy. Since ABC News began this report a year and a half ago, some service workers have unionized and their employers have worked with tech companies to raise wages and offer better benefits to many contract workers who lived at the edge of poverty. These workers are an example of a growing trend in the U.S., in which large corporations contract out service jobs from other companies. Scott Peebles, another driver ABC News spoke to in 2015, said he had been sleeping on an air mattress in his car for months. Peebles used a windshield reflector to help block out the light from the parking lot streetlamps while he slept. “This is foreign to me,” he said, gesturing to his car. “It’s not the way you’re supposed to live. No, it’s just a mirror of society that we’re in right now and that’s -- I’m probably part of millions of people that are doing this.” “It’s sad that it comes down to this,” Peebles continued. “I mean, if people would know this, if corporations of businesses they work for, they would probably be aghast that their employees were living in a car or a van.” At night, if they needed a restroom, the drivers would get out of their cars and walk into the bus depot. Under union pressures and publicity about drivers receiving few benefits, Facebook now requires contractors to pay contract employees a minimum of $15 an hour, 15 days of paid time off, and a $4,000 stipend for new parents if their contractors don’t provide parental leave. Apple and Google followed suit with announcing 25 percent wage increases for all drivers. Many security jobs are also now contracted out. Michael Johnson, who worked as a security guard for several companies, told ABC News the job has changed over the years. “When I first started there were paid vacation, paid holidays, lots of times we got bonuses,” Johnson said. “It was like a regular job, it’s just that you were contract-working. You were treated like one of the gang.” Eventually, Johnson said at the time he stopped receiving paid vacation time or paid sick leave and the hourly rate dropped. “It was incredible what was happening,” he said. “It seemed like it just happened overnight.” In Silicon Valley, amidst the luxury homes, the streets are lined with service workers who live in RVs and trailers. “The folks that are living in these RVs, they are part of the low-wage economy that’s created around the tech industry,” said activist Derecka Mehrens. “There’s a real connection between these families and what happens in the industry.” Some experts on contract workers say some of the jobs provide opportunities that didn’t exist before. Arthur Brooks of the Conservative American Enterprise Institute said,many workers "say that it gives them flexibility. Many of them are immigrants.” But Tamara Draut, Vice President of Demos, a progressive think tank, disagreed that contracting and subcontracting helps workers, arguing that “in each link down that chain, the pressures grow to lower labor costs.” Irma Alvarado is 72 years old and says she spent her life cleaning the offices at Visa, working the night shift from 6 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. She shares a small house with her children and grandchildren. She is a legal immigrant who says she has lived and worked in the U.S. nearly 30 years. When ABC News spoke to her in 2015, Alvarado said it was hard to watch Visa employees throw away food she would love to have and to see them take vacations. She said she once saw a $7,000 check lying on a desk, and was surprised at the gap between her pay and theirs. In a statement to ABC News, Visa said their janitorial staff is contracted through a third party vendor. “All wages, bonuses and benefits are handled directly by the service vendors,” the statement said. “We greatly appreciate their work and dedication to our facilities.” Her grandchildren say they still believe in the American dream. Her grandson Danny said he would like to be an astronaut one day. But for now, he said he just wants a drawer to himself. “It’s hard living in the house because you don’t have that much room, gets crowded,” he said. “I would have a drawer to put all my clothes in.” About half of American adults lived in middle-income households in 2014, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of government data. Pew Research offers an income calculator feature on their website that allows you to see whether you are part of the American middle class. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Bus Drivers Ferrying Silicon Valley Tech Elite Struggle to Afford Rent +Why Thousands of Low-Income Americans 'Donate' Their Blood Plasma +When Working 2 Fast Food Jobs, 16 Hours a Day Still Isn't Enough " US Judge Grants Stay on Deportations Under Trump Immigration Order, But Overall Ban Remains " Kremlin: Trump and Putin Talk Syria Coordination, 'Economic Connections' In Phone Call " Police Hunt for Suspect Who Kidnapped Georgetown Student " How Trump's Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " New Lawsuit Against Baylor Alleges 52 Rapes in 4 Years " Phoenix Police Release Body Camera Videos of Man's Death After Taken Into Custody " 'Far Too Much Planning' Went Into Florida Mass Shooting Plot: Police " Utah Woman Struggles to Cuddle With Foster Dog and Her 11 Puppies Got a Gift Card?
