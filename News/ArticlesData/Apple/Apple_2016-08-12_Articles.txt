Rumor has it Apple is getting ready to launch a new Apple Watch line while Samsung, it's main rival in all things mobile, has sent out invitations to members of the press for what it strongly hints will be a smartwatch announcement. The invitation doesn't actually mention a smartwatch, but unless it's planning to release a clock, there's little else it could be. Samsung's press conference is scheduled to take place on Thursday, September 1, at IFA 2016. The invitation has clock hands, which we presume to mean the launch of the Gear S3. The rumored Gear S3 will allegedly feature the same round design as its predecessor, along with the rotary bezel found on the Gear S2. There will also be three variants of the Gear S3, including the Gear S3 Classic, Gear S3 Frontier, and Gear S3 Explorer. This time around there will be a bigger focus on fitness, as seems to be popular among wearable devices. The watches will sport an altimeter, barometer, speedometer, and an integrated GPS as found in the Gear Fit 2. Barring a major surprise, the Gear S3 will again use Samsung's own home brewed Tizen OS, not Android Wear. Samsung initially had big plans for Tizen, at one point hoping it could compete with Android in the smartphone space, but that didn't happen. However, Tizen seems to have found its niche in the smartwatch market, as Samsung's Gear line has been fairly well received. One interesting side note—there's been talk of there also being a luxury version of the Gear S3. It's worked for Apple and rumor has it Samsung will give the luxury market a try as well, though not at IFA 2016. If such a model is in the works, it would debut next month at the World Watch and Jewelry Show.

Saturday, August 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Learning From Apple’s Failures Rick Tetzeli (via John Gruber): Under Cook’s leadership, Apple has come to seem quite fallible to many people. Its recent products have seemed far less than perfect, at least compared to the collective memory of its astonishing iPod–iPhone–iPad run from 2001 to 2010. There are the public embarrassments, like its 2012 introduction of Maps, or those 2014 videos of reviewers bending, and breaking, an iPhone 6 Plus. Apple Pay hasn’t become the standard for a cashless society, and the Apple Watch “is not the watch we expect from Apple,” according to John Gruber, editor of Daring Fireball, the preeminent Apple-centric website. Then there are the design flaws: Apple Music has been saddled with too many features, as if it were something designed by, God forbid, Microsoft; the lens on the back of the iPhone 6 extrudes; the new Apple TV has an illogical interface and confusing remote control. Perhaps, say the worriers, Apple is doing too many things at once, cranking out multiple editions of the watch, endless varieties of watchbands, iPhones, and iPads in numerous sizes, proprietary earbuds alongside headphones from Beats. Credible reports that the company is spending billions of dollars in R&D to explore the possibility of designing a car only heighten the fear that Apple is spread too thin. Steve Jobs had been the company’s editor, proud of saying no to features, products, business ideas, and new hires far more often than he said yes. Apple’s seemingly diffuse product line reinforces the argument that Cook is not as rigorous. Eddy Cue on Apple Maps: The advantage of us coming to this later in the game is that, yeah, we have to do some of that, but in order to stay updated we’re trying to use the iPhone itself, and the data it’s giving us. Let me give you a good example: a golf course. How do we know when a new golf course opens up? We’re not exactly driving around looking for golf courses. But we know it’s there, because there are all these golf apps that get used at a golf course. If we see that all these golf apps are being used at a particular location, and we don’t show that as a golf course, we probably have a problem. You can discover that pretty quickly. This is a cute example, but is that really how Apple updates Maps? It doesn’t seem like this technique really scales. Eddy Cue: And look, we made some significant changes to all of our development processes because of it. For example, the reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS is because of Maps. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. So, to all of us living in Cupertino, Maps seemed pretty darn good. Right? The problems weren’t obvious to us. Now we do a lot more betas. Todd Ditchendorf: I lived on a major thoroughfare < 5mi from Apple Campus when Maps was released - it misplaced my address by ~3mi. The “It worked for us near campus. How could we know it was crap elsewhere?” narrative is useful for recounting in interviews but it’s false Jeremiah Lee: And Apple Maps still sucks. It doesn’t have the newer streets in Mission Bay that have been there for over a year. I keep reporting… Craig Federighi: A world where people do not care about the quality of their experience is not a good world for Apple. A world where people care about those details and want to complain about them is the world where our values shine. That is our obsession. He’s saying the right things, but I’m not seeing this consistently come through in the products. Apple seems too unfocused, spread too thin, still in denial of how buggy their software has become. The iOS 9.3.4 update still hasn’t fixed the Camera audio bug, and it made my iPhone stop charging, at a very inconvenient time, so that I thought its Lightning port was damaged. Preview, long a reliable app, now regularly has drawing glitches and hangs. One of my apps hasn’t been up-to-date in the Mac App Store since May, and it is currently removed from sale, because of multiple backend store bugs. True or not, the perception is that the reality TV show and the car are distracting the company from working on the aging Mac lineup. Schiller’s triumphant “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass” line has become a punchline. The removal of the iPhone’s headphone jack seems like a parody of an Apple design decision. I want a new MacBook Pro, but at this point I’m more worried about the new keyboard and that Apple might do something more to make it less Pro, like remove Thunderbolt or the SD slot, than I am excited about what new features it might offer. Benjamin Mayo: What I think is interesting is how much Federighi and Cue play up the benefits of data collection elements, I’ve never seen them emphasise it like this before. Usually, it’s very quaint with endless assurances about privacy and anonymity. In this interview, though, they admit that the data they do collate is enough to accurately pinpoint new sports venues. Mitchel Broussard: Towards the end of the interview, Cue and Federighi mentioned the largely similar work relationship seen with both Tim Cook and former CEO Steve Jobs. Although the approach each took in tackling the job has been “completely different,” Cue said there’s one common factor he’s had with both: “I never wanted to disappoint Steve. I never want to disappoint Tim.” Peter N Lewis: Eddy Cue’s “We want to be there from when you wake up till when you decide to go to sleep” sounds disturbingly like the Microsoft of the 90s. Update (2016-08-13): McCloud: Regarding Todd Ditchendorf’s tweets: I once tried to use Apple Maps to go from One Infinite Loop to a UPS store, took me to Marriott. Update (2016-08-15): Nick Heer: It doesn’t really matter whether there’s a real decline in Apple’s software quality, or if it’s mostly an exaggeration bolstered by a larger user base and increased media coverage. What is concerning is the sentiment I perceive in Cue’s explanation — that a bug affecting 1% of users is comparable in 2016 to one affecting 1% of users in, say, 2006 or 1996. But, as he says, there’s an enormous chasm in the actual number of users affected, and that’s what’s particularly concerning. If Apple is pushing out, to be generous, one-quarter of the number of these bugs as they were ten years ago, that means that they’re still affecting orders of magnitude more users. My perception is that it’s not just the larger user base. I personally encounter a lot more Apple bugs than I used to. Apple Apple Maps Apple Software Quality Craig Federighi Eddy Cue History Interview iOS iOS 9 Mac App Store Maps Preview.app Tim Cook 3 Comments 3 Comments Roy August 17, 2016 1:49 AM Sadly, "still in denial" is a good way of putting it, and accurately describes the takeaway I got from the interview. Lukas August 17, 2016 4:17 AM >"I want a new MacBook Pro, but at this point I’m more worried about the new keyboard and that Apple might do something more to make it less Pro" Yep. It used to be that updates to Apple's products were exciting. Now, all they make me think is "I wonder if *this* is the time that Apple finally forces me to switch to Windows or Linux full-time." Also, related to software quality: a few months ago, both of the MacBook Pros that I use actively (and regularly update to the latest version of macOS) have started throwing up the "Your system has run out of application memory" message about twice a week, at which point I have to try to manually unpause all apps, save any data if apps still unpause for long enough, and restart the computer. Subjectively, at least for me, my Macs are now reaching Mac OS 9 levels of crazy behavior.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     IPhone 7 Will Have Touch Based Home Button Posted: Aug 13 2016, 11:55am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in Rumors | Apple   mobipicker   We can add an iPhone without its signature circular physical home button to our list of all the things we didn’t think were possible but turned out to be otherwise. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals This isn’t the first time that rumors about such a move by Apple have circulated and recent murmurs from industry insiders makes this seem a realistic possibility. So instead of the physical home button we have now we will have a touch sensitive button which will serve as Apple’s fingerprint scanner not to mention additional tap and press detection functionality. All this is dependent on Apple’s wish to maintain the feedback sensation that pressing a button gives. One way Apple might be able to kill two birds with one stone could be to introduce hepatic feedback within the new touch sensitive button. This move serves well with Apple’s over all aim to have a flat iPhone without and curves or bumps. The recent removal of the 3.5 mm jack is a step in this direction. Another reason why this move might be on Apple’s agenda is waterproofing that it wants to guarantee for its iPhones. But most of all this change by Apple will increase the durability of the iPhone itself as physical buttons are subject to damage over the years.

Shepard left the game with a sore groin, while Apple exited with what was called a lower leg strain.  "Sterling, we don't think it's serious. He's a guy that we're going to put through individual drills tomorrow, we're going to wrap him up, and see if he can practice after the individuals," McAdoo said Saturday during a conference call with reporters.  "Eli went to get a scan. I don't have anything new on Eli at this point. ... I haven't heard anything since the scan." How the rookies fared Both Apple and Shepard spoke to reporters after the game, and downplayed their injuries. Apple said he was "feeling fine," while Shepard told fans not to "freak out." Apple's mother, Annie Apple, has tweeted twice since the game that he is OK. McAdoo had said after the game Apple's injury "doesn't look to be anything serious at this point." Apple did have X-rays after the game.  McAdoo also said wide receiver Geremy Davis (hamstring) and fullback/tight end Will Johnson (burner) are unlikely to practice Sunday. "Geremy Davis, it does not look like he's going to practice tomorrow. But he has a mild strain," McAdoo said. "Will Johnson, we're waiting to here more back there, but it looks like he'll be out at this point." James Kratch may be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JamesKratch.

All of the team's draft picks got plenty of action. Here's a review of how they did in their first game: (Hit the share button above to send this to a fellow Giants fan) Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com CB Eli Apple The Giants' first-round pick had an eventful first game. Apple played on the opening drive with the first-team defense, entering in the nickel package and playing left cornerback. Apple immediately gave up a short completion on third down but made the tackle short of the first down marker. Apple played 19 snaps on defense and finished with two tackles. Apple also was active on special teams, playing 10 snaps in the kicking game. Apple alertly recovered a fumble by Giants punt returner Bobby Rainey. Apple left the game with a lower leg strain, which is not considered serious. Rich Schultz | Getty Images We get it, it's preseason, but come on. This catch by the rookie @sterl_shep3 is ridiculous. #MIAvsNYGhttps://t.co/DZgYObgpbe — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) August 13, 2016 WR Sterling Shepard Shepard played with the first-team offense, operating mostly out of the slot. His one catch was a tremendous diving grab for 24 yards along the right sideline on the opening drive of the game. Shepard was open on a few other targets, but quarterback Ryan Nassib was off the mark with his passes. Shepard left the game early with a sore groin, but he said he was fine after the game. FS Darian Thompson As expected, Darian Thompson started at free safety. Thompson led the starters with 28 defensive snaps. It was a relatively quiet night for Thompson, who finished with one tackle. Quiet is not necessary a bad thing for a free safety because it means Thompson didn't allow any big plays. It was a good first step for Thompson, who will play a ton this season. Ed Mulholland | USA TODAY Sports LB B.J. Goodson Stuck behind veterans Jasper Brinkley and Kelvin Sheppard on the depth chart at middle linebacker, Goodson flashed the talent that made him a fourth-round pick out of Clemson. Goodson was flying around the field, making seven tackles with two tackles for loss. He added a tackle on special teams. Goodson won't leapfrog the veterans just yet, but his performance offered some optimism about his potential. James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com RB Paul Perkins As he has throughout camp, Perkins looked sharp carrying the ball on Friday night. The fifth-round pick had seven carries for 36 yards, including a 14-yard burst. But Perkins fumbled what appeared to be a clean handoff from Logan Thomas in the fourth quarter. Poor ball security is a surefire way for the rookie to earn a spot on the bench. Ray Stubblebine | AP Photo TE Jerell Adams Adams was solid on Friday after a shaky start to training camp. The sixth-round pick caught the only pass thrown his way for seven yards. Adams saw action as one of three tight ends in the jumbo package with the first-team offense at the goal line in the first quarter. Adams was also involved in the kicking game, logging 11 snaps on special teams. William Hauser | USA TODAY Sports Offensive undrafted free agents The Giants' offensive undrafted free agents have made some noise in training camp, but they were quiet in the preseason opener. Wide receiver Roger Lewis (pictured) worked with the first-team offense and logged 32 snaps. He had one catch for nine yards. Lewis will need to pick up his production as he battles for a roster spot. Running back Marshaun Coprich had two carries for six yards and one catch for five yards. He is buried on the depth chart in a crowded backfield. Receivers Darius Powe and K.J. Maye failed to catch a pass in limited action.   James Kratch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Defensive undrafted free agents Defensive tackle Greg Milhouse carried over his surprisingly strong camp into the opener. Milhouse was a disruptive presence in the middle, recording four tackles and a sack as he continues his push for a roster spot. Plucky cornerback Donte Deayon (pictured) had three tackles, including one tackle for loss. The odds are stacked against Deayon making the roster, but he continues to make the most of his opportunities. Safety Andrew Adams and defensive end Romeo Okwara each recorded four tackles to round out a solid effort by the defensive undrafted free agents.

Saturday, August 13, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] iPad Unfinished Business Jean-Louis Gassée: On the surface (pun unintended), Apple proffers the iPad Pro as a computer. We don’t begrudge Apple its right to ‘performance bragging’: Witness Apple’s rightfully proud statements about its powerful homegrown Ax line of processors and the impending A10 64-bit processors that easily outperform Seymour Cray’s supercomputers. But simply promoting the iPad to ‘computer’ avoids the real issue: Is the iPad Pro a PC replacement? Can we toss out our laptops and move wholly to our iPads? Dan Counsell: The problem with the iPad is both hardware and software related. Anything work related you can do on an iPad can, in most cases be done faster on a Mac. No question. […] This is still one of the fundamental problems with having the iPad attached to a keyboard — when you need to interact with the screen, you have to raise your arm out in front of you to interact with apps, it’s cumbersome and gets tiring very quickly. iPads are great to use while you’re lounging on the couch. However, they are not so great to use for extended periods of time at a desk. Dean: Remember when @tim_cook talked about android tablet apps being blown up phone apps? Tim Oliver: The new Apple Store app on iPad is just the iPhone version blown up to fit the screen. Come on… iOS iOS 9 iPad iPad Pro Mac 1 Comment 1 Comment Lukas August 17, 2016 4:05 AM > "when you need to interact with the screen, you have to raise your arm out in front of you to interact with apps, it’s cumbersome and gets tiring very quickly." Does it, though? Maybe for some people, but I think a lot of the people complaining about "arm fatigue" have never actually used a setup like this extensively. I'm using a Surface Book regularly, and I never use the mouse to interact with it, and I've never had any kind of problem with it being cumbersome, or tiring. In fact, when I use a MacBook, I have to actively remind myself that I can't touch the screen. "Arm fatigue" seems to be a mostly theoretical problem that doesn't really occur in practice. Now, if your dual 27-inch Mac Pro setup had touch screens, that might be more of an issue, but for something more MacBook-sized? I doubt most people would notice any kind of issue.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Apple Watch 2 release date, specs rumors: more functional features expected for 2nd-gen smartwatch Jude Abastar Aug 15, 2016 7:14 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Robert Galbraith)A lineup of Apple Watch devices are displayed in a San Francisco retail store. With the enormous popularity of practically every product it makes, Apple made it a point to join the emerging smartwatch industry with the introduction of the Apple Watch back in April of last year. And just like the iPhone, MacBook lineup of laptops, and iPad, there was a lot of fanfare and expectation for the smartwatch. And now, the second generation Apple Watch 2 has some big shoes to fill. So what is to expect from this year's Apple Watch 2? Yahoo noted that probably the most important improvement of this second generation watch is the integration of the watchOS 3, which according to the report, is a lot more sophisticated compared to the previous two operating systems. The fact is the first two versions of the watchOS were decent, but it didn't provide the device the kind of real usability. The same report claimed that the user interface of the first watch was "painfully slow" and wasn't really that great. A quite interesting thing about the Apple Watch 2 is that although it is claimed to be finally free of the iPhone pairing in order to do stuff like receiving calls or short messaging, it actually could be released together with the upcoming flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7. Accordingly, the watch could be equipped with Global Positioning System (GPS) for the very first time — a feature that many believe will make it stand out and separate itself from the rest of the competition. Aside from the GPS function, the upcoming smartwatch is also rumored to be waterproof, which actually makes sense because Apple is trying to advertise the product as a smartwatch that is designed for athletes, more like a fitness tracker. Meanwhile, a thinner body and frame should also make it a more interesting competition to various fitness trackers and watches in the market. While there still is no official word from Apple, it is likely that the Apple Watch 2 will be released in the company's big event this fall.

NEWS > Watch Giants vs. Dolphins Highlights > Instant Analysis: Giants fall 27-10 > Giants Postgame Reactions PHOTOS > From the Sidelines: Giants vs. Dolphins VIDEOS > Diving catch by Sterling Shepard Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard contributed as reserves, posted modest numbers – and put a scare into the team’s hierarchy by sustaining injuries that proved to be minor in the Giants’ 27-10 preseason loss to the Miami Dolphins in MetLife Stadium. Apple strained his lower left leg, and Shepard had a sore groin. >> WATCH GIANTS VS. DOLPHINS HIGHLIGHTS “I kind of just tweaked it a little bit on special teams, punt return,” said Apple, the cornerback from Ohio State who had two solo tackles. “Just got a little bit off balance and I was trying to hold up the guy that was blocking and kind of just tweaked it. But I’m feeling fine. It’s just a lower leg strain, it’s gonna be fine.” Apple, who said it was “throbbing” on the outside of his knee, wasn’t sure if he will work when the Giants next practice on Sunday. He said the injury gave him a scare. “Initially it did, because I’ve never had that feeling before,” he said. “I never had like knee problems but just after a while, just thinking and dealing with the trainers and getting a little treatment on it and getting the X-Rays and all that, it was fine.” Shepard – who had one reception for 24 yards on the Giants’ game-opening touchdown drive – seemed even less concerned about his injury. >> INSTANT POSTGAME ANALYSIS “I feel good,” he said. “It’s just sore from practice, but it’s all good now.” Shepard was asked if he was aware that “everyone kind of freaked out” because he and Apple left the game at about the same time. “I can see that happening, especially when Eli and (me) both (are being tended to),” he said. “But it’s nothing too serious, so don’t freak out.” Okay, we won’t. •  The start of the game was delayed for an hour because of a severe weather threat that prompted officials to clear the MetLife Stadium seating bowl. The fans were permitted to return to their seats after a 46-minute wait. The teams took the field at the same time, and had a second, abbreviated warmup period. “We changed a couple of things,” coach Ben McAdoo said. “We adjusted and improvised with the delay.” Perhaps the most notable decision was to not play Odell Beckham Jr. “He came out, we had intentions of playing him in a handful of plays,” McAdoo said. “We got back in, we had the delay and I decided not to play him.” •  Andre Williams led the Giants with 41 rushing yards on nine carries. But Shane Vereen had the ground game highlight of the night when he used a nifty spin move to pick up 19 yards on the first series. •  Second-year defensive end Owa Odighizuwa had 2.0 sacks among his three solo tackles. He had three quarterback hits and was the most prominent contributor on an active defensive line. •  Linebacker Mark Herzlich led the Giants with eight tackles (six solo)…Brad Wing had a 37.7-yard net average on seven punts. •  Bobby Rainey was the Giants’ primary kickoff and punt returner. He brought back two kickoffs for 36 yards and three punts for 17 yards. But he fumbled twice.   •  The Giants announced Friday morning that Eli Manning would not play. Manning was in uniform on the Giants’ sideline. •  The Giants are 0-7 in preseason games vs. the Dolphins. •  The Giants had five game captains: Ryan Nassib and four former Dolphins (Olivier Vernon, Kelvin Sheppard, John Jerry and Orleans Darkwa).

Apple fans and those who follow the latest trends in gadgets are eager to know what the tech giant has in store for them. The same thing is true for the upcoming iPhone 7 release on September 16.  There is a lot of excitement and anticipation for the latest Apple smartphone, but according to an article on Forbes, analysts are saying that fans should not expect too much or they could face disappointment. The rumored features of the iPhone 7 might seem exciting and all. Rumors about the iPhone 7 came out as early as 2015 when the iPhone 6s was released. Speculations suggest that it would have 3 GB of RAM and that it would probably run on the A10 processor of Apple. Other speculations suggest that it would have dual-lens camera, which is something that got many Apple fans excited. There are also suggestions that the iPhone 7 would be coming out as a waterproof device. Another thing that could be different with the latest iPhone is the fact that it could be available in blue. While none of these features have been officially confirmed, there are those that suggest that the iPhone 7 could disappoint. According to Tech Times, the latest iPhone may not live up to the hype. It looks too similar to iPhone 6s. The popularity of the Apple smartphone is also declining. Analysts also say that Apple could be reserving the big feature changes for the rumored iPhone 8 which is supposed to come out in 2017, the 10th year anniversary of Apple's flagship product. Rumors about the iPhone 8 makes it sound so radical, with an all glass chassis. Who would want to buy an improved iPhone 6s when a glass iPhone will come out after a year?

And no, that's not our veiled attempt at calling Apple the Evil Empire, we're simply noting the return of an all-black handset, at least if a series of a leaked photos from a Chinese-language website prove legit. Or maybe what we're seeing is a darker version of what Apple calls "Space Gray" in its lineup. That's a color SKU that Apple offers in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s lineups, only those handsets are considerably lighter in color than the presumed iPhone 7 Plus that apparently starred in an unsanctioned photo shoot ahead of its official unveiling next month. It might also be an iPhone 7 Pro model. The person who posted the pics refers to the handset as an iPhone 7 Plus, but rumor has it there will be a dual camera array on the iPhone 7 Pro model, one of three iPhone 7 SKUs (iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus being the others). In the shot above you can make out the dual-cameras, which are nestled in a slight hump in the upper left-hand corner of the handset, along with an LED flash that sits flush with the iPhone. One of the other leaked photos shows the bottom of the handset with a Lightning port and speaker arrangement with speaker grills on both sides. Notice there's no 3.5mm headphone jack—it's been rumored that Apple's getting rid of the audio port and using the Lightning port for the included set of earbuds. You also get a glimpse of the Smart Connector, those three little dots that sit on the backside of the chassis right above the Lightning port. This is a feature that already exists on both iPad Pro models as a way to connect a keyboard accessory, something that's not really needed for a smartphone, though it's possible that its inclusion on the iPhone 7 will be for wireless charging and/or third-party accessories. In any event, we'll know more details soon. Word on the web is that Apple will hold an iPhone 7 launch event on September 16.

Credit: AppleMust More like this WWDC 2016: Apple’s 8 key enterprise stories WWDC 2016: Apple’s Swift 3.0, star of the show IBM says: ‘Swift is now ready for the enterprise’ Video 5 Easy Data Visualizations in R Designed solely for the purpose of server-side Swift development, Perfect is a Web application server for OS X and Linux created by a lesser known Canadian startup historically connected to Apple, PerfectlySoft. Swift increase Apple introduced Swift at WWDC 2014, making it open source in December 2015. The language has enjoyed “meteoric” growth since launch, and has also been adopted for enterprise applications by IBM. That historical connection and the company’s deep understanding of Apple’s programming philosophy meant the Canadian firm was able get Swift running on a server marginally before IBM accomplished it. The number of jobs requesting Swift in the last full year versus the previous full year climbed by 600 percent. Apple’s decision to announce Swift Playgrounds will stimulate even more interest when it ships in fall. What is Perfect? So what is Perfect?In simple terms it is a framework for developing Web and other REST services in Swift. It provides a framework and an HTTP/HTTPS server for creating such services for both client-facing and server-side applications. To learn a little more about Perfect’s significance and history I spoke with the company CEO, Sean Stephens, at WWDC. “The history of Perfect is anchored in the history of the Lasso programming language,” he began. In the late 1980s, Claris was formed as an Apple spinoff to provide business users with the software they needed. Those products included the likes of MacPaint, MacDraw, and FileMaker. Claris acquired the rights to Lasso, a still very popular programming language that maintains its own passionate developer community and in which Stephens has extensive experience. He is also CEO of LassoSoft. “Perfect is a Swift-based development framework. Without the Swift programming language, Perfect would not exist,” he said. Lasso Swift The first version of Perfect appeared in December 2015, ten days before Apple officially declared Swift an open source language. “When Apple said it would make the Swift programming language open source, an alarm bell went off in my mind,” he said. “Because much of what is Swift is strikingly similar to Lasso, it was easy for CTO Kyle Jessup to begin building the Perfect framework in and for Swift, so developers can use Swift and Perfect together to write server apps.” Fractionalization He thinks his language matches current developer needs. “There’s a real desire among developers for less fractionalization in programming,” he explains. This is the trend among developers to want development tools to be as easy to use as the applications they develop, and a desire to be able to achieve great results using fewer languages. Perfect lets developers use Swift to build an entire project, including both front- and back-end services, Stephens claims. Developers interested in taking a look at what’s on offer can visit Perfect’s Github repository and explore the company’s clear and extensive resources site. “Most of the programming languages that are widely used today are a decade old or more such as Java – a proprietary language that does not provide developers with a joyful user experience,” Stephens said. Enterprise opportunity The implications of Swift on enterprise IT will be highly significant. “The vast majority of applications (especially business applications) require server-side software to pass data back and forth,” he said. “More often than not, most server apps today run on an old proprietary language like Java. Swift has a lot of potential to change that because it's got that Apple pedigree, it’s open source, and developers love using it for building mobile apps for the iPhone and iPad.” Looking around video chat app, Smirkee might be a nice example of an accessible mobile app built using Perfect and Swift. It uses server side algorithms to identify people’s facial expressions in real time. Perfect 2.0 will ship once Apple introduces Swift 3.0, probably in September. Move over Java, Perfect’s in town With Apple rapidly becoming a key player in the evolution of the digital enterprise, and with key partnerships in place to extend its influence in the space, Stephen’s sees good opportunity for Perfect and Swift in enterprise IT. After all, when every enterprise is a digital enterprise, then a cross platform server side open source developmental language can only become more popular. Google+?

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back. NOW WATCH: How to supercharge your iPhone in 5 minutes Loading video...

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Can banks gain a share of mobile payments market? By Jonathan Duffy (sian@brightbee.co.uk) Shares Mobile payments are gaining momentum in the UK. Apply Pay had the initial monopoly, with Android Pay launching in the UK a year later. A week after Android Pay launched in the UK, 460,000 payments had been accepted. Countries across the globe are increasingly moving towards cashless societies thanks to advances in contactless payments. Instead of carrying a physical wallet with cash and bank cards, mobile wallets are becoming an increasingly popular method of payment. What role will banks play in this new era? The death of the wallet The number of smartphone users worldwide is predicted to grow to 6.1 billion by 2020 according to the 2015 Mobility Report from Ericsson. With the growth of smartphones across the globe and the consequential shifting consumer habits, mobile payments are a natural step beyond plastic cards. Smartphones have become an extension of ourselves; they are always on and we always have them with us. According to payments technology company Adyan, in Q3 2015 47 per cent of UK online transactions were made through mobile devices. Additionally, a report from Mobile Ecosystem Forum tells us that now, an estimated that 69 percent of mobile users globally conduct at least some of their banking using their mobile device. While mobile banking and payments is increasing, on the flip-side the use of cash is dropping. Last year, less than half of consumer payments in the UK were made using cash, according to Payments UK. In 2015, cash made up 45 per cent of payments, compared with 64 per cent in 2005. This number is expected to continue to fall to around 25 per cent by 2025. With millennials being digital-natives and mobile-first, they put online and convenience above physical presence and traditional banking services. Mobile payment apps have added a new and convenient way for people to pay for goods and services. The total value of proximity mobile payments is seeing significant growth in 2016 and has the power to revolutionise the shopping experience, making payments more convenient and faster. It is an attractive option for brands and customers alike as it makes a smoother payment journey for the customer. It is not surprising that major phone-technology players from Apple to Google and Samsung are pushing forward with their mobile wallets, but where does this leave the banks? It is no secret that banks have concerns about the tech giants Apple and Google entering their sectors with mobile wallets and payment solutions. Don’t be the next MVNO The risk of banks losing market share is very real, especially as the likes of Apple build on their consumer relationships to make further progress into mobile payments. Banks need to innovate and explore ways to retain their brand position and their customers’ loyalty or face becoming sidelined. Decreasing revenue and increasing costs are forcing banks, including high-street names, such as Lloyds and Barclays, to lay off employees and automate functions. This tactic of slashing costs can be helpful up to a point, but what about exploiting new markets and technologies to create business and healthier balance sheets? Banks must now compete on technology in order to stay relevant. According to a 2015 survey by software firm Temenos, 27 per cent of senior bankers reported tech companies as the greatest threat to their business. Take Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) as a recent example of a sector overtaken by technology. In the early 2000s they had all the influence over their customers. Fast-forward to 2007 and Apple iPhone is launched. Exclusive contracts with operators were signed (AT&T in the US and O2 in the UK) and the operators’ worst nightmare of becoming ‘dumb pipes’ began turning to reality. Gone are the MVNO heydays; Apple and Google are now the brands most synonymous with mobile innovation. How do banks avoid the same fate? Play tech firms at their own game Banks can ward off tech firms and disrupt the industry if they look at innovative ways to use existing technology quickly. There are a few early movers such as Danske Bank in the Nordic countries which has the MobilePay app using a phone agnostic beacon payment technology, based on Netclearance’s mBeaconPay, to accept payments at retailers. It has over 2.9 million active users and has been installed on an estimated 90 per cent of Denmark’s smartphones. The payment system has also been rolled out to Norway and Finland. Dankse Bank’s mobile wallet is the third most popular app in Denmark and Norway and over 90 million transactions were made through MobilePay in 2015. Cashless societies Denmark is well on its way to becoming the world’s first cashless society and MobilePay shows that frictionless, tech agnostic and highly secure POS systems are winning the hearts and minds of the customer, and delivering real value to merchants. It is enabling banks to retain or even grow their customer base. Tech-savvy consumers, world-leading smartphone penetration and progressive banks have kept the Nordic countries ahead of the game with mobile payments. Mobile payments platforms are providing retailers with an intuitive customer experience via inexpensive technology and remove costly merchant fees as the technology takes transactions direct from bank to retailers, changing the value chain. Without requiring tokenised card details to be held on a database somewhere, the technology is inherently more secure. By directly engaging their customers, banks can also create additional brand loyalty as well as providing a desirable feature to entice new customers. Banks have access to huge, proprietary data about their customers’ spending habits, which some have begun using to offer customers more personalised experiences and recommendations. When combined with partnerships with outside retailers and firms, this data could be used to drive spending and create customer satisfaction on a larger scale than the loyalty program from a single company. Customers want an app that allows them easy access to products they like and so far the big technology firms have all failed to deliver. Frictionless first At its core, mobile payments are about making payments easy and creating a process that is as frictionless and simple as possible whilst also being secure and adding value to the end user. Banks have the ability to provision this through mobile beacon technology and the time is now to start using it in order to stop the tech giants getting there first. Topics Apple Pay.

Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) Aug 13, 2016 at 6:41AM In light of some of the recent staffing changes reported at Project Titan, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) automotive ambitions seem more likely to become reality than ever before. Image source: Getty Images. Apple's purported attempt to disrupt the automotive industry holds out the promise of a torrent of fresh revenue for the company and its suppliers. Considering what we know, Apple's likely automotive entry turns its possible partners into intriguing potential buys ahead of Project Titan becoming a reality -- particularly Magna International (NYSE:MGA). Apple's coming assembly partner? Contract assembly remains far more the exception than the norm across the automotive industry, and that's where Magna comes in for Apple's Project Titan. The global supply chain of automotive-parts manufacturers remains diverse and somewhat fragmented, much like the smartphone component space. However, when it gets down to assembling an automobile into a finished product, almost all of the world's largest carmakers own and operate their own assembly plants -- leaving Apple in need of a partner to help bring Project Titan to market. Though owning their own plants provides certain advantages for automakers, it also requires massive capital investments. With slightly more than $162 billion in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, Apple could easily pay for its own plant, but it would probably also crimp margins and return on capital to an unpalatable degree. That's where Magna International comes in, as one of the only companies to offer contract auto-manufacturing services. Many sources have cited Magna's Streyr unit as the most likely place for Apple to turn to. In fact, Magna Steyr's potential to work with tech companies like Apple prompted on Morgan Stanley analyst to describe the firm as a possible "Foxconn of cars" in a note to investors last May, a tag many in the industry throw around in relation to Steyr. If Project Titan takes off and leads to Apple cars, and if Magna is the chosen manufacturer, ramping up would require Magna to undertake a massive expansion of its assembly scale, but Apple could finance it. If a relationship happens here, Magna's undervalued stock becomes all the more intriguing today. A deal today? Magna appears undervalued on both a relative and absolute basis, as its trading multiples reveal. See for yourself. P/LTM EPS P/LTM Normalized EPS 8.2 10.1 Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. P = price. LTM = last 12 months. EPS = earnings per share. For context, the S&P 500 currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of slightly more than 25. Of course, any discussion of a company's valuation needs to incorporate its business outlook, and Magna's relatively constrained valuation implies some serious headwinds. However, a quick scan of its business shows that the outlook appears pretty favorable, relative to its seemingly gloomy valuation. It's risky to bet on a stock based on what might happen in the future, but Magna isn't solely a play on what might happen with Apple.  What Does Magna Do? Magna International is one of the largest manufacturers of modular auto parts in the world. Per its 10-K filing, Magna's core competencies include "producing body, chassis, exterior, seating, powertrain, electronic, vision, closure and roof systems and modules, as well as complete vehicle engineering and contract manufacturing" to the global auto industry . The company generates over 50% of its revenue from providing the above components to auto giants Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler, making any potential assembly with a would-be competitor like Apple a difficult balancing act for the company. Fully assembling complete automobiles represents less than 10% of Magna's total sales, though reports have already linked Apple and Magna's Steyr unit to discussions presumably tied to Project Titan .  Equally interesting, Magna has repeatedly demonstrated an interest in moving deeper into full-fledged automobile manufacturing, though it has been met with resistance from its powerful automaker customers. A tech company like Apple seems like an ideal fit for a company with Magna's demonstrated ambitions. However, even outside of its upside potential with electric vehicles, even the near-term outlook for Magna appears far rosier than its depressed multiples would have you think. Among the 17 sell-side research analysts covering Magna International stock, their estimates are all varying degrees of bullish. For its current fiscal year, the average of their estimates calls for a sales increase 12.3% to $36.1 billion, and even the lowest estimate calls for the company's sales to grow just over 10% year over year. The same goes for Magna's bottom line, though to a lesser degree. Here, analysts expect Magna's earnings per share to grow slightly more than 4%, and not a single analyst forecasts an EPS decline for the company. Either way, given the apparently healthy outlook for its business, Magna's compressed valuation metrics don't make a lot of sense, and that doesn't even factor in potential meaningful catalysts -- such as Apple's Project Titan -- that could come on line in the medium or longer term. Investors may be concerned that U.S. auto sales might not live up to their record-setting 2015, but if so, analysts' estimates aren't reflecting it. Aside from that potential headwind, Magna could be an interesting investment candidate, especially if its rumored role as a manufacturing partner for Apple comes to fruition.

Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   Apple will finally start paying out cash rewards to researchers who find security problems in their products, the company announced at the BlackHat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas Thursday. But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. AP Photo/Vincent Yu, File)   Andrea Peterson Washington Post WP Bloomberg     Apple will finally start paying out cash rewards to researchers who find security problems in their products, the company announced at the BlackHat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas Thursday. But the news left some experts wondering why Apple was so late to the party. So-called "bug bounty" programs are now standard among most tech giants. They can help keep consumers safe by encouraging independent researchers to help companies fix security flaws. When a researcher finds a legitimate problem, rewards can range all the way up to the six figures. But Apple historically had a different approach -- offering a tip line where people could report security problems, but not handing out any reward other than putting the researcher's name on a thank you page on its website. "It was kind of an insult," said Matthew Green, a computer science professor at Johns Hopkins University who has previously told Apple about security problems in its products and didn't know why it took them so long to launch a bounty program. "Maybe after San Bernardino they felt there was some pressure to acknowledge that it wasn't enough to give people a pat on the back -- even if they can't pay enough to compete with the free market," he said. Apple's lack of a bug bounty program drew criticism earlier this year when the FBI paid an unknown entity more than $1 million for help breaking into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. Without a bug bounty program, some argued, the only way researchers could make money from finding bugs in Apple's products was selling them off to the highest bidder -- in this case, the FBI. But now, Apple has a chance "to compete for the type of exploits available and control how they'll be used," said Jeff Pollard, principal analyst focused on IT security at Forrester Research. Apple's new rewards program will launch in September, but won't be open to anyone. Instead, it will be invite-only -- at least in the beginning. But researchers who approach the company with a major problem also will be invited to join. Most programs are open to all researchers. The program will only reward researchers for finding a few categories of problems at launch. The biggest payouts will be for bugs affecting software built into components that help Apple's devices start up securely: Researchers who find one of those could get up to $200,000. That makes Apple's bug bounty program one of the most lucrative out there. Google's program, which launched in 2010, upped its largest bounty -- for breaking the security of its Chromebooks -- to $100,000 this March. Microsoft's largest per bug payout is also $100,000. Apple's potential big rewards may be aimed at convincing researchers to turn to the company when they find a problem, rather than the open market where vulnerabilities might be bought up for use in criminal or state-sponsored hacks. But even with Apple's hefty new payouts, other places may still pay a better premium for ways to hack into the company's products. Last year, Zerodium, a company that deals in buying zero-day vulnerabilities from researchers and selling them to large corporations and government agencies, said it paid $1 million to researchers who were able to remotely hack into the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS. The company doesn't offer the same massive payouts for problems in other products. "No software other than iOS really deserves such a high bug bounty," Zerodium founder Chaouki Bekrar told The Post last year, citing Apple's strong security built into its products. That internal focus on security may be one reason Apple held out against an official bug bounty program so long while, even as other sectors like the automotive industry, airlines and the Department of Defense started to get in on the game. The rise of Apple Pay may be another factor that pushed the company to be more aggressive about getting help from the larger security community, according to Green. "They really need to know that system is secure" because there's actual money at risk, he said. "I think a lot of researchers would rather hand vulnerabilities over to Apple than to someone who is going to use it to steal people's payment information."

More than just technology news Home Tech Reviews Science Games Culture Video Stay Connected Facebook Twitter RSS Updated Hot Tags Pokemon Go Pokemon Sun And Moon Apple Pokemon Sun And Moon news Pokemon Go Update Apple's September Event To Change The Game For The iPhone 7 And iPhone 8 Adie Pie First Posted: Aug 12, 2016 03:20 AM EDT Customers browse new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus at the Apple Ginza store on September 25, 2015 in Tokyo, Japan. Apple is launching iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in 12 regions including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. (Ken Ishii/Getty Images) No one is expecting the iPhone 7 to smash sales records or even improve much on the current iPhone 6S. The main reason for this is that the iPhone will celebrate its first 10th anniversary in the smartphone industry next year. Part of the expected celebration is undoubtedly a new design. The possible issue with that, as noted by Business Insider, is that 2016 is Apple's scheduled time for a revamped handheld. Since 2008, the Cupertino-based company has been working on a two-year clock that has told the public when exactly to expect a relatively grand redesign. So if the September event does confirm that Apple is holding out a new look for the iPhone 8 instead of the impending iPhone 7, it could indicate an entirely new future for Apple. That is, how and when its dedicated customers will be making purchases. Of course, there is also the possibility that this missed year will be a one-time occurrence only. Apple could very well return to the two-year schedule after the 2017 unit. There is, however, at least one ever-surfacing rumor regarding the iPhone 7. That is, that Apple is ditching the standard 3.5mm audio port. Instead, the iPhone 7 is expected to come with either Bluetooth earphones or one that connects to the Lightning port. Whichever way the tech giant decides to go, it needs to do something soon in order to bounce back from its current slump. As Irish Times notes, Apple's second quarter numbers were about 10 million fewer than the previous year's. And while Q3 2016 figures met the company's expectations, it is still a far cry from when Apple first launched the iPhone in 2007. The road Apple is on is not as smooth as it once was and that is obvious. Samsung, one of Apple's largest competitors, is cashing in on this decline in demand. Samsung's second-quarter sales beat its own expectations.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study Microsoft’s employees more innovative than Apple’s: Study For the study the team analysed the data gained from quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. By: IANS | San Francisco | Updated: August 13, 2016 5:17 pm According to the study Microsoft, which is often perceived as less innovative than its rivals– Facebook, Google, IMB and Apple– has more innovative employees the other tech giants. (File Photo) Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said.

Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

However, leaked schematics reveal that the speaker grills previously seen are purely cosmetic.  ( NowhereElse.fr ) Advertisement Multiple rumors and leaks point to the fact that Apple's upcoming flagship smartphone, the iPhone 7 will have dual speakers. However, leaked schematics reveal that this might not be the case. It has been previously reported that the iPhone 7 will be dropping the 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of Lightning earphones. With the headphone jack out of the way, Apple is expected to fill out the space with a second speaker, with numerous leaked designs of the smartphone showing that there are speaker grills on either side of the Lightning port at the bottom of the iPhone 7. However, according to the documents, which were first spotted by French website NowhereElse.fr, the additional holes at the bottom of the iPhone 7 may be purely cosmetic, with Apple deciding to fill out the bottom of the smartphone with the second set of speaker grills to maintain symmetry. According to the Chinese text of the schematics, the area that is currently occupied by the headphone jack on iPhones will contain only a microphone and microphone mesh on the iPhone 7. There is no mention if there will be a speaker in that area, with most of the holes of the speaker grill seemingly without any function whatsoever. Only the one furthest to the right will have a function, as it will be serving as a microphone. Further adding to the discovery is a pair of images shown by MacRumors on the design of the iPhone 7 casing. The drawings reveal that the holes of the left speaker grill are not cut all the way through, except for one which would serve as the microphone hole. However, as with any other rumor in advance of an official announcement, the report could still turn out to be untrue or simply incomplete. While the second speaker grill could house the microphone, there is still seemingly enough space to fit in a second speaker module. As such, Apple users who have been looking forward to the iPhone 7 having stereo speakers should not lose hope just yet, but still ready themselves to be disappointed if this report turns out to be true. Another recent leak on the iPhone 7 revealed that Apple will be replacing the option of a space gray color with space black, which will be offered in addition to the rose gold and gold options. Market experts have warned that the iPhone 7 might not be able to live up to expectations, with the smartphone to post lower sales compared with its predecessors despite several new features, as it is being seen as a minor upgrade to the iPhone 6s without any new groundbreaking improvements.

The study led by  an Indian-origin entrepreneur further says that Facebook staff are less creative compared to other tech workers. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. "The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple's, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook , or IBM employees," Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. "They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn't require them to personally be innovative," Birwadker said. "They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there's always been this layer of innovation," Birwadker explained adding, "but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees." On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. "But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B," Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft's latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work "fun", the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren't necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. "You can't have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there," Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave.

After two injuries in preseason debut, rookie WR says 'don't freak out' Big Black and Blue again? Giants rookie WR says 'don't freak out' Pat Leonard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 2:47 AM facebook Tweet email While Ben McAdoo sits Eli Manning and Odell Beckham in Week 1 of the preseason (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Pat Leonard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Saturday, August 13, 2016, 2:47 AM The Giants, plagued by injuries in recent seasons under Tom Coughlin, had to be thinking ‘here we go again’ when highly-touted rookies Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard went down with injuries in the first half of their first preseason game. Fans were freaking out. But Shepard said the fans shouldn’t worry. “I mean, I can see that happening, especially with Eli (Apple), us both (being evaluated),” Shepard said with a smile. “But it’s nothing too serious, so don’t freak out.” If training camp and Friday’s game have demonstrated anything about Apple and Shepard, it’s that first-year coach Ben Follow the Daily News Sports on Facebook. "Like" us here. McAdoo intends to feature both rookies. The Giants announced late in the first half of the preseason opening 27-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins at MetLife Stadium that their top two draft picks from April had sustained injuries. Shepard already had made a highlight-reel catch, and Apple had recovered a fumble on special teams and made two tackles, providing evidence of the types of exciting contributions the Giants can expect. The prospect of their absence, though, shows how valuable they could be. Shepard (sore groin) assured he was “just sore from practice” and his injury is “nothing serious at all.” Apple (strained lower left leg) said he had “tweaked” the outside of his left knee holding up a Dolphins blocker on a punt return, and while he thought at first the unfamiliar feeling might be serious, he is “not concerned.” “Initially it did (scare me) because I never got that feeling before; I never had knee problems,” Apple said. “But after a while of being with the trainers and getting a little treatment, getting X-rays, it was fine.” Highly-touted first round pick Eli Apple leaves Friday night's game with an injury. (Rich Schultz/Getty Images) Those words surely made Giants management exhale, especially after Shepard waited not even five minutes into his first NFL game of any kind to make a highlight-reel, 24-yard diving catch of a Ryan Nassib pass toward the right sideline on the game’s opening drive. “That’s what I’m supposed to do,” Shepard said. “That’s what I get paid to do. That’s what I expect of myself.” A few months ago, who would have predicted that a receiver not named Odell Beckham or Victor Cruz would have opened the Giants preseason with a Top-10-worthy reception? Here’s the thing, though: Eli Manning throws to Shepard often in practice. The second-round pick is not just a fallback in the slot for Cruz if the veteran can’t stay healthy. Shepard is a weapon McAdoo intends to unleash. “I know what I see out of (Shepard) in practice. That’s not a surprise,” said top running back Rashad Jennings, who finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run. “That’s a routine kind of catch for him. He’s a really good player. He wants to be good, and I find him trying to be the last guy out kind of guy, understand the playbook inside-out. Put him anywhere.” Neither rookie was perfect, but both players refreshingly were constructively critical of their own errors. Shepard admitted he could have prevented a Nassib interception slightly underthrown in his direction, that he could have “at least disrupt(ed) that ball.” Apple acknowledged he “played a little out of control sometimes” and lost contain on one outside Dolphins run. Giants rookies were making plenty of noticeable plays on Friday, though, including linebacker B.J. Goodson, a fourth-round pick who made six tackles before leaving the game late with minor cramps. Shepard’s big play was the flashiest, the most tempting of bigger things to come, and the best example of why the Giants would be losing so much if any of these players went down. “If you show you’re capable of making those types of plays, they’re not gonna hesitate to feed you the ball,” Shepard said. “It’s just preseason, so we’ve got a lot of work to do. I still have a lot of work to do. We’ll see what happens in the regular season.”  Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories, delivered to your inbox.

While Apple is set to launch its new iPhone 7 devices early on, HTC is preparing to debut its new handsets in the later part of the month.  Earlier today, famous Twitter leakster Evan Blass revealed in a VentureBeat report that someone from HTC has come forward to reveal what the Taiwanese company is planning for its September event. According to the informant, HTC is expanding its HTC 10 line with two new Desire handsets, the Desire Pro Lifestyle and the Desire 10 Pro 10.  The informant revealed the specs and features of the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle, which based on its name will be targeting people with different lifestyles. The handset is revealed to come in different colors, but all variants will come with metallic gold trims on the edges and surrounding the camera lens, flash and antenna cutouts. Unlike the current Desire models, the Desire 10 Lifestyle will have matte, solid color finishes.  Related Stories Android 7.0 Nougat ‘Coming Soon’ To HTC Nexus 9 The HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle, which is a mid-range offering, is expected to sport a 5.5-inch display with 720p resolution. Underneath, the handset will rock a still unknown quad-core processor. There will be two versions based on memory, a 2GB RAM/16GB onboard storage variant and a 32GB RAM/32GB onboard storage variant, according to GSM Arena.  As for its camera system, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle will feature a 13-megapixel back camera with single LED flash and a 5-megapixel front camera. Both have backside-illuminator sensors (BSI) and are capable of taking 1080p videos.  While the informant revealed most of the specs and features of the Android 6.0 Marshmallow-running Desire 10 Lifestyle, the person did not discuss what consumers can expect from the HTC Desire 10 Pro, which is going to be the higher-end offering.  The revelation about HTC’s plan to debut two new Desire 10 smartphones in September comes in the wake of T-Mobile’s decision to remove its flagship HTC 10 from the market. The HTC 10 was apparently removed from T-Mobile’s site back in July, and this is only reported now after a Reddit user took notice of the flagship’s disappearance from the list of smartphones the carrier is offering. This is in spite of the HTC 10 getting the title of “the best Android flagship of 2016” from Ars Technica. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said. “They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there’s always been this layer of innovation,” Birwadker explained adding, “but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees.” Genelia Deshmukh On Being A Mother And Bollywood Career Bigg Boss 10 November 22 Review: Bani Lashes Out At Swami Om, Manoj Punjabi Demonetisation: Supreme Court Refuses To Stay Proceedings Why Is Jammu Kashmir’s Machil Sector Seen As A Safe Passage For Infiltrators Amartya Sen No Longer Part Of Nalanda University Board Government Plans To Bring GST Bills As Money Bills: Here’s Why Demonetisation: Relief For Common Man: Find Out More Salman Khan And Family Celebrate Helen’s Birthday At Galaxy Apartments Demonetisation: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley Defends Government’s Move Aamir Khan’s Dangal Pales In Comparison To Surroundings Of Mahavir Singh Phogat’s Village J&K: 3 Soldiers Killed, Body Of One Mutilated In Machhal Sector PM Narendra Modi Asks People To Rate Demonetisation Ex-Gujarat Energy Minister Has Financial Interest In 8 Onshore Oil Blocks: Find Out More US President-Elect Donald Trump Lays Out Agenda For First 100 Days Modi Keynote Prank App Spurns Several Clones On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. Watch Video: What’s making news “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

Printing from an iPad can be somewhat confusing, as you'll have to use Apple's wireless AirPrint tech in order to cut out the faff of sending a file to your Mac just to get a hard copy. And unless you're familiar with AirPrint, you might struggle, at first, to figure out how to get the job done. What if your printer doesn't support AirPrint? Luckily we're here to help. Here's everything you need to know in order to print directly from your iPad. BUY NOW: Epson Expression Photo XP-860 with AirPrint from Amazon for £142.98 BUY NOW: Canon MAXIFY MB2050 Printer with AirPrint from Amazon for £79.99 How to print from an iPad – Using AirPrint Firstly, you can find out if your printer supports Apple's proprietary wireless printing tech by heading over to the official site, where a full list of compatible devices should tell you all you need to know. AirPrint is available for both iOS and OS X, or MacOS as it's soon to be known. Related: Best Printers If you've got a printer that plays nice with AirPrint, all you have to do is make sure it's connected to the same network as the iPad you want to print from. In iOS, you can simply hit the Print button, which appears in applications that support printing, usually above the Share button or within the Share menu. If you've set your printer up correctly, the iPad should find it automatically, and you can simply follow the on-screen instructions to print out your email, document, or whatever it is you need to transform into a physical version. Related: iPad Mini 4 review Here's the process in its simplest form, as explained on the Apple site: 1. Open the app you want to print from. Find the print option by tapping the app’s share icon or settings icon. If you can’t find the print option, check the app’s User Guide or Help section. Not all apps support AirPrint. 2. Tap the Print symbol or 'Print'. 3. Choose an AirPrint-enabled printer. 4. Choose the number of copies. 5. Tap Print. Anything you choose to print can be viewed by using the App Switcher, enabled by double-tapping the Home button and tapping on Print Centre. If you want to cancel a print job, tap Cancel Printing from within the Print Centre. How to print from an iPad – Using a printer without AirPrint support The above is all well and good, but what if your specific printer doesn't support Apple's wireless technology? All is not lost. An easy way to get around this is to simply use a third-party app to connect to wireless printers. Related: iOS 10 One option when it comes to printing apps is Print n Share, which will allow you to connect your iPad to any wireless printer directly. Plus, it gives you the option to print via your Mac to any wireless, USB-connected, or Bluetooth printer. You've also got the added ability to print via 3G – a nice touch. Another decent offering which comes with all the functionality of Print n Share is PrintCentral, which is slightly cheaper than the former and does all the same stuff. Other top printing apps include Printer Pro, Print Agent PRO for iPad , and, on the more affordable side, Print Utility. Some of these apps will require you to install software on your Mac or PC if you want to use your iPad to print via your computers. Related: Best tablet Of course, there is the option of using dedicated apps from Printer-makers, such as HP ePrint, Xerox Print Portal, and Epson iPrint. Using these manufacturer-specific apps should give you an experience which is closer to using AirPrint than it would be with any of the aforementioned apps. How to print from an iPad – Print servers Another approach, is to use Mac or PC software which functions as a print server – essentially making your Wi-Fi or USB-connected printer discoverable to your iPad. The difference between these programs and some of the apps mentioned in the previous section is that this software is installed directly on the Mac or PC only - allowing your computer to essentially turn a USB or Wi-Fi connected printer into an AirPrint-enabled device. Printopia is one such example of this type of software, and seems to be quite a polished offering, though we're yet to review it ourselves. So there you have it – all you need to know to start churning out hard copies from your iPad. These techniques should also work for iPhones (basically, anything that uses iOS). We'll add more to this piece as new methods for printing from an iPad become available. Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week Got any more tips or solutions?

Photo: Getty Images More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny First-round pick Eli Apple and second-round pick Sterling Shepard played in their first NFL preseason game Friday night, but neither was around at the finish, as both rookies were forced out in the first half of a 27-10 Giants loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium with injuries that neither player believes is serious. Apple got hurt covering a punt and was diagnosed with a left lower leg strain and Shepard came out of the game with a sore groin. Shepard opened eyes with a diving catch for a 24-yard completion and Apple showed plenty of athleticism during his time on defense. “I kind of just tweaked it a little bit, got a little bit off balance and I was trying to hold up the guy I was blocking and kind of just tweaked it,” Apple said. “I’m feeling fine, just a lower leg strain. I’m not concerned.” Initially, though, Apple was concerned, and scared. “Initially it did because I never got that feeling before, I’ve never had like knee problems,” Apple said. “It was just throbbing kind of like outside of my knee. Have to put some ice on it and some good treatment on it.” Shepard said he came out of practice this week with sore groin muscles and it carried over into the game. “It’s just been sore, both of ’em been sore, it’s nothing serious at all,” Shepard said. For the first time in his career, Eli Manning did not play in the preseason opener, as new head coach Ben McAdoo broke with tradition and sat his starting quarterback, sending out backup Ryan Nassib. “I made the decision not to play Eli tonight,” McAdoo said. “We have a pretty good idea of what Eli can do.” This was the seventh preseason game (out of 50) Manning has missed in his career. He missed two games in 2005 with an elbow strain and a game in 2010 after getting 12 stitches in his forehead the previous week. The other three missed games were coaches’ decisions, but none were the first preseason game. Receiver Victor Cruz missed the game with tightness in his groin. McAdoo said “Hopefully Sunday” when asked about a possible return to practice for Cruz. … LB Keenan Robinson (groin) and DE Kerry Wynn (groin) did not play. McAdoo did not call the plays in his first game, as offensive coordinator Mike Sullivan held the large play chart and relayed the plays into Nassib and then Logan Thomas. Bobby Rainey, who arrived with a history of ball-security issues, fumbled a punt in the first quarter that Apple alertly recovered. Late in the second quarter, Rainey fumbled a kickoff return before recovering the ball himself. Putting on the ball on the ground is going to get Rainey cut. Late in the third quarter, Rainey overran the play in punt coverage, leading to a big Dolphins return. LB Ishaq Williams of Brooklyn helped himself with a good hustle play on special teams. … WR Geremy Davis was forced out with a hamstring injury. … Rookie RB Paul Perkins lost the handle on a handoff from Logan Thomas in the fourth quarter for a turnover. … FB/TE Will Johnson came out of the game with a burner. … Stansly Maponga had a sack.

As it stands, the Apple Watchs inventory is running low with little intention of restocking. 9to5Mac compiled a list of Apple Watch models that are currently either out of stock or backordered. Then again, there are so many individual configurations for the Apple Watch, its no wonder they arent keeping up with all of them. There are currently 6 Sport models (out of 22 total) out of stock, 6 stainless steel models (out of 16) either sold out or backordered, and only 2 of the Hermes models are available in a small size, the rest of them (8 total) are sold out. This suggests that the Apple Watch is due for an update quite soon which could be announced alongside the new iPhone to be released in September. So everyone is advised to wait for the next iteration of the Apple Watch before investing into Apples wearable. The latest rumors say that the Apple Watch 2 should feature a faster CPU, improved immersion protection, GPS, and cellular connectivity . Are there any Apple Watch owners out there? What do you want to see with the Apple Watch 2? Source | Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said.

Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. Also Read: Sree Sreenivasan: I look at my job as chief listening officer of New York “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave.

Home Industry Technology Microsoft most innovative place to work: Study Microsoft most innovative place to work: Study Microsoft's employees are more innovative than Apple's, and Facebook's staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. By: IANS | San Francisco | Published: August 12, 2016 5:06 PM Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. (Reuters) Microsoft’s employees are more innovative than Apple’s, and Facebook’s staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. “The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple’s, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees,” Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. “They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn’t require them to personally be innovative,” Birwadker said. “They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there’s always been this layer of innovation,” Birwadker explained adding, “but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees.” On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organised way, the study said. “But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realised that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B,” Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft’s latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work “fun”, the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren’t necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. “You can’t have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there,” Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analysed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analysed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

And the Giants' first round pick had no problem admitting it after the fact - he was scared when it happened.  Odell Beckham puts on pregame catch display "Initially, it did (scare me), because I've never gotten that feeling before. I've never had knee problems," Apple said after the Giants' preseason-opening loss to the Miami Dolphins on Friday night. The rookie cornerback was able to recount the immediate moments after he sprained his lower left leg because that's all it is - a sprain that head coach Ben McAdoo said "it doesn't look to be anything serious at this point." "After meeting with the trainers and getting a little treatment on it and getting X-rays, it was fine," Apple said.  "I just tweaked it a little bit on special teams, punt return. I got a little bit off balance, and was trying to hold up the guy I was blocking. I'm feeling fine. It's going to be fine." The Giants received injury scares with their top two draft picks in the 27-10 loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. Apple's sprained knee, and second-round pick Sterling Shepard's sore groin. But Shepard is fine - he told fans not to "freak out" after the game - and Apple is too. Apple is not sure if he'll practice Sunday after Saturday's off day. But he said all needs to do with the sprain is "put some ice on it and have some good maintenance on it." And that's welcomed news for the Giants. Takeaways from the game Before the injury, Apple was putting together a solid first NFL game. He played outside cornerback with the first-team nickel defense, and had a third down tackle to force a Miami punt. He also was working with the second-team defense, and playing special teams.  "You get into a groove a little bit, playing a lot of plays, playing on special teams and defense, and you want to stay out there a little bit," Apple said. "But I knew I wasn't 100 percent, and I didn't want to cost my team or anything. "I played OK. I played a little out of control sometimes, I can be a little better with my technique, and on special teams as well. Keeping my attention to detail on the little things." Apple finished the game with two tackles and a fumble recovery on special teams. He said he felt he lost leverage playing the run at times, and he may have made a few miscues on special teams.  Apple's first tackle was a big one, though. Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill hit wideout Kenny Stills in the flat on third-and-9, and Apple tackled him two yards short of the first down, forcing a punt.  "I had good initial coverage on him, he kind of pushed off a little bit at the top," Apple recalled. "I thought it was a first down, and I said, 'Oh man. I can't believe it.' But then I looked, and I saw the sticks, and he was about two yards short of it." Just another thing that felt bad at first, but ended up working out quite all right for Apple and the Giants.

Photo: AP More On: new york giants The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed Giants expect best offensive lineman back — in nick of time Politician to Odell Beckham Jr.: The Bronx more than a strip club Giants' 'quiet assassin' is waking up and looks worth every penny The Giants’ defense was so bad last season that any sign the 2016 version can be markedly better is welcomed like a cool breeze cutting through oppressive humidity. And so, when the starting defense took the field Friday night for two series and exited after six plays, 14 total yards and no first downs allowed, it was a most promising signal that all the time, effort and money spent will pay dividends. The strong cameo was the best takeaway for the Giants in their 27-10 preseason-opening loss to the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium. Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. sat this one out, and when the other starters were in the game, the Giants dominated on both sides of the ball and took a 10-0 lead. Once the backups began infiltrating the field, things deteriorated quickly in Ben McAdoo’s first game as head coach. The game was delayed 49 minutes at the start as a summer storm approached, with fans instructed to “leave the Seating Bowl area and take shelter inside MetLife Stadium because of severe weather in the area.’’ McAdoo already had made the decision to sit Manning, and after the delay, the coach opted to give Beckham the night off as well. “[Beckham] came out with the intentions of playing a handful of plays, then we got back in, we had the delay and I decided not to play him,’’ McAdoo said. Ryan Nassib, subbing for Manning, was solid early with the first-team offense, but struggled once he was surrounded by reserves. Nassib threw two first-half interceptions and did not exactly convince anyone he could take over, if needed, for Manning. Nassib played the first three quarters and finished up 7 of 15 for 75 yards, plus a fumble. To be fair, Nassib often was running for his life behind a shaky second-string offensive line. In all, the Giants fumbled six times, losing two of them. “I think overall as an offense, Ryan was right in line with everybody else. It was a sloppy performance, any time you have six balls on the ground and two INTs is not what we’re looking for,’’ McAdoo said. As far as health, the Giants watched their first- and second-round draft picks, cornerback Eli Apple and Sterling Shepard, forced out with injuries not considered to be serious. In a small sample, the Giants’ defense looked light-years better than the shabby 2015 unit. In fact, on the first series it seemed they applied more pressure on the quarterback than they did in a month last season. Free agent addition Olivier Vernon nearly sacked Ryan Tannehill and Owa Odighizuwa, a second-year defensive end coming off an injury-filled rookie year, hit the Dolphins quarterback on the next play. Vernon made his presence felt again on the next defensive series, hounding Tannehill in the end zone — and he might have had a sack if he was not bumped by Jason Pierre-Paul. Linebacker Jonathan Casillas nearly had an interception of Tannehill, but came down out of bounds. “It was very encouraging,’’ Casillas said, who had an interception off Matt Moore late in the first quarter. “I feel like it was a good showing for the first team guys, they didn’t really get anything on us.’’ Asked if he took any positives out of the defensive performance in the first game, Pierre-Paul said, “Somewhat.’’ Newcomer Damon “Snacks’’ Harrison was more effusive. “I saw the defensive ends flying around.,’’ Harrison said. “This one play, I look, [Olivier Vernon] shot out of the stands like lightning and JPP was on the other side, Hank [Johnathan Hankins] was in the backfield.’’ As for getting through his first game as head coach, McAdoo was not happy with the sloppy play, but his starters — minus Manning and Beckham — did not have any problems. “Yeah, I was excited,’’ McAdoo said. “I think everybody in the locker room was excited. It was the first time to get out and go against another team, it always provides some good energy.’’ Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under ben mcadoo ,  eli manning ,  new york giants ,  odell beckham jr. ,  ryan nassib Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Jets' Quincy Enunwa loves Dennis Rodman comparisons Read Next Jets' Quincy Enunwa loves Dennis Rodman comparisons Most Popular This Week 1 Donald Trump's media summit was a 'f−−−ing firing squad' 2 Melania and Barron Trump won’t be moving to the White House 3 College kids are proving Trump's point 4 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 5 Trump may not be able to work in the Oval Office for over a year 6 Bus driver asked kids if they were 'ready to die' before fatal crash: mom Share Selection Columnists Mike Vaccaro Ralph Branca gave Shot Heard ’Round the World its perfect dignity Mark Cannizzaro The secret to Eli Manning's success revealed SEE ALL COLUMNISTS The Post Line NBA NCAAB NHL NCAAF NFL Wednesday Favorite Line Underdog ORLANDO OFF (OFF) Phoenix CLEVELAND 11½ (218½) Portland INDIANA OFF (OFF) Atlanta San Antonio 3½ (199½) CHARLOTTE Memphis 4½ (196½) PHILADELPHIA DETROIT 4½ (190) Miami Boston 7 (214) BROOKLYN HOUSTON 3 (218) Toronto DALLAS OFF (OFF) LA Clippers UTAH OFF (OFF) Denver NEW ORLEANS 1 (210) Minnesota SACRAMENTO 2½ (208) Oklahoma City GOLDEN STATE OFF (OFF) LA Lakers Wednesday Favorite Line Underdog KENTUCKY 28½ Cleveland St Michigan 3½ SOUTH CAROLINA VILLANOVA 20 Coll.

Jonathan Braude Aug 12, 2016 12:55 PM EDT Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride sharing giant that last week drove off with Uber's Chinese cab operations, said on Friday that users across China can now hail rides through their Apple Watches while expensing their fares using automated account management provider Concur Technologies. Didi Enterprise, the Beijing company's travel service, said it had put together a new partnership with Concur, of Bellevue, Wash., allowing Concur clients to connect their accounts with Didi Chuxing, select their trip type and begin booking rides. Once travelers arrive at their destination, an e-receipt will be automatically sent to their linked Concur accounts, where they can directly manage their ride expenses and submit for reimbursements. But if travelers already have an Apple Watch, they can hail rides and get live traffic updates during peak hours to help make their commuting easier. The agreement reached with Apple (AAPL) means they can download or upgrade the latest version of the Didi Chuxing app on the Apple Watch. Users can simply press the "go home" button or the "go to work" button to request a ride on the Apple Watch, once the corresponding addresses are set up through Didi Chuxing's iPhone version, Didi said. Apple's $1 billion investment into Didi earlier this year was thought to have been a factor in the Chinese firm's victory over its U.S. rival Uber. Even after spending $1 billion a year on Chinese expansion, it had become clear that San Francisco-based Uber would not have the firepower necessary to out gun Did chuxing on its home market.

Sell This Quarter? Here's what to expect this quarter from Apple's most-important segment. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Aug 12, 2016 at 9:06PM iPhone 6s. Image source: Apple. In Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) third fiscal quarter of 2016, iPhone units and revenue were down 15% and 23%, respectively. This was an extension of a similar quarter of declines for the segment in the prior quarter. Apple investors are still getting used to this new dilemma, as iPhones sales didn't start to decline until this year. Unfortunately, Q4 will likely deliver more of the same. Here's what to expect from Apple's iPhone segment this quarter. An iPhone sales forecast for Q4 Apple doesn't provide a forecast for quarterly iPhone sales, so the best way to get an idea of what management might expect from the segment is to look at management's guidance for total revenue. Because iPhone sales represent about 57% of revenue, the trajectory of iPhone sales during a quarter strongly drives the trajectory of Apple's total revenue -- so their trajectories should be similar. For Q4, Apple guided for revenue between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, representing a 7.8% to 11.7% decline compared to Apple's revenue of $51.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. If iPhone revenue follows a similar trajectory, Q4 iPhone revenue will be somewhere around $29 billion -- down from $32.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. Where would this put iPhone unit sales? Taking into consideration the fact that iPhone revenue will likely decline at a slightly steeper rate than iPhone units because Apple's lower-cost iPhone SE, which was introduced in March, is driving average selling prices lower, the trajectory of Apple's guidance suggests that iPhone unit sales will likely be somewhere around a range of 43.5 million to 45 million units. This is down from 48 million units in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015. Notably, if Apple's guidance for total revenue does reflect the company's expected trajectory for iPhone revenue during the quarter, Q4 would mark a moderation to Apple's trend of declining iPhone revenue compared to the previous two quarters. Will the quarter get a boost from an early iPhone launch? However, even if Apple expects a smaller year-over-year decline in iPhone sales in Q4, this may not be indicative of improving comparisons for the iPhone 6s cycle. Another potential explanation for a smaller expected decline during the quarter could simply be an earlier launch for its flagship iPhone, which usually launches toward the end of the tech giant's fiscal fourth quarter. Image source: Apple. Industry blogger Evan Blass, which AppleInsider asserts has a solid track record speculating about upcoming smartphone releases, said on Twitter that iPhones will be available in stores, and ship to customers, on Friday, September 16, giving Apple's new flagship phone about one extra week in the quarter to sell. In 2015, for instance, it wasn't until September 25 that the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus began shipping to customers. An extra week for Apple's newest iPhone to ship to customers during the company's fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 could give iPhone sales during the quarter a significant boost. If Blass is right about Apple planning for an early iPhone launch, it's worth wondering just how steep the year-over-year decline in the company's guidance for Q3 would have been without the help of an extra week of sales of the upcoming flagship iPhone. Looking beyond fiscal 2016's fourth quarter, Apple's guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 will likely be even more interesting, as it will help investors get an idea of whether the tech giant expects iPhone sales to continue to decline, even after it launches its newest smartphone.

EAST RUTHERFORD — The Giants' got an encouraging glimpse of their top two draft picks in Friday's preseason opener at MetLife Stadium. And then the other shoe dropped, although it appears the team only received a slight scare. Cornerback Eli Apple, a first-round pick, and wide receiver Sterling Shepard, a second-round pick, left Friday's exhibition game against the Miami Dolphins with injuries. The Giants announced late in the second quarter that Apple was having his left knee examined and Shepard had a sore groin. The Giants announced at the start of the fourth quarter that Apple has a strained lower left leg. Apple returned to the sideline during the third quarter. He was still in uniform and stood with the rest of the cornerbacks on the sideline.  A "sore groin" wouldn't seem to indicate a serious injury for Shepard. He was sitting on the sideline in the fourth quarter with the other wide receivers. Additionally, the Giants announced in the fourth quarter that starting wide receiver Geremy Davis was out with a hamstring injury. Davis was sitting on the bench in the fourth quarter with his left leg heavily wrapped. Shepard played with the first-team offense and immediately showed why he has generated so much buzz this offseason. On the Giants' opening drive, Shepard made an outstanding diving catch along the right sideline on a pass from quarterback Ryan Nassib. It was Shepard's only catch of the game. We get it, it's preseason, but come on. This catch by the rookie @sterl_shep3 is ridiculous. #MIAvsNYGhttps://t.co/DZgYObgpbe — NFL Network (@nflnetwork) August 13, 2016 Apple didn't start, but saw immediate action when the nickel defense took the field on the Dolphins' first drive. Apple was targeted on his first play, making the tackle on a 7-yard completion to Kenny Stills on third-and-9. Apple was the left cornerback with starter Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie moving inside to the slot in the nickel defense. Apple finished the half with two tackles. He also had an alert fumble recovery when Bobby Rained coughed up a punt return in the first quarter. Dan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21.

Apple was just awarded its very first vehicle-related patent from the U.S. patent office. The release of the patent is the first concrete evidence we have that Apple is in fact working on some sort of vehicle program. If this patent will actually be used on a future Apple car, it would go directly against recent claims that the tech-giant is favoring a more software focused approach. Clearly this evidence suggests Apple is set on producing a physical car. The patent filed jointly by Apple and BAE Systems is for a steering device for an articulated vehicle and also covers the invention of an articulated vehicle. An articulated vehicle, for those unfamiliar, is a vehicle that is designed to turn in a sharper radius thanks to a permanent or semi-permanent pivoting join at the center of its construction. The other name on the patent is BAE Systems, known for producing military vehicles such as infantry fighting and armored all-terrain vehicles. We highly doubt Apple is creating a military vehicle, however. It's more than likely simply partnering with BAE in order to use its articulated vehicle expertise. It would be an extremely risky proposition for Apple to release a tracked vehicle as its first foray into the car world, although everyone thought Tesla was crazy when it released its first electric vehicle. Apple has a track record of coming up with interesting designs so we can't wait to see what this patent will mean for the future of the Apple car.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Apple Plans New Heart-monitoring Wearable Device Posted: Aug 12 2016, 8:07pm CDT | by IANS, Updated: Aug 12 2016, 8:12pm CDT, in News | Apple   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Tech giant Apple has filed a patent application for a wearable device that can measure electrocardiographic (ECG) signals to monitor the health of your heart, a media report said on Friday. Don't Miss: The Best Black Friday 4K HDR TV Deals The filing, published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), shows commitment on Apple's part to enter the health care industry, qz.com reported. The device may look like a ring or a bracelet. Apple's design makes the traditional ECG machine redundant. To calibrate the device, users should undergo an “enrollment” process where readings are taken from different parts of the body before using the device. “It can use those measurements to correct abnormalities resulting from the device's location on a person's body,” the report added. Apple last year released ResearchKit, an open source software framework to help doctors gather data from participants using iPhone apps. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he didn't want to “put the [Apple] Watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process,” but he “wouldn't mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it.” You May Like The Author IANS The Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) was established in 1986, initially to serve as an information bridge between India and its thriving Diaspora in North America.

And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark’s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark’s Daily Apple community please contact me here. I’ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading! I have been an avid reader for about three years now. I have struggled with my weight since I was about 13 years old. I suppose drinking six to twelve cokes a day didn’t help. My heaviest known weight was 240 pounds. Most big people don’t go looking for a scale. I know I was that big because that was when I was diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic. Of course, even that didn’t stop the coke habit because I was in denial. It took several more years of losing 30 pounds, and then finding it again, to get really serious. Even then, the path is never a straight line. Three years ago July, I found an online nutrition coaching program—Precision Nutrition, a year long habit based program. At the same time, my wife told me that an ex-colleague of ours, who at 50 was in fantastic shape, was doing CrossFit and Paleo. I had never heard of either one. When I Googled Paleo I found Mark’s website. Even doing the year long coaching program, I still wasn’t where I wanted to be with my health. While I did remove all processed foods, especially Coke, I still was about 190 pounds. I am 5’10”. I have done lots of reading and research. I learned about leptin from Dr. Jack Kruse. I started to understand how chronic inflammation due to insulin resistance was the root cause of my problems. I also found Dr. Jason Fung—a huge advocate of fasting. While I had lots of information, putting it into practice is always the hard part. On February 7 of this year, I had elbow surgery for a repetitive motion injury from 25+ years of IT work. I knew that Naproxin wreaked havoc on my system, but post surgery you need something to get you through. Eight weeks ago I had a physical. My A1c was 6.6, which is high for me. I was up to 197 pounds and was not happy about it. I decided to do a n=1 experiment where I would utilize fasting and real food. I decided to have coffee in the morning and eat one meal a day for eight weeks. I am now down to 175. My blood glucose has normalized. I am in ketosis and feel great. I have plenty of energy to take on whatever sounds good. I move a lot at a slow pace. A year ago I got a Varidesk and ditched my chair. I have been standing while working for a year now. If I can do this—anyone can. I also signed up for the Primal Health Coach Program the first day it was available. I am proud top say I am number 93.

So inspiring to see people eliminate their health issues through a better diet and lifestyle. I generally fast between dinner (around 6pm) and lunch the next day (around 11am). Back in the days when I was eating a lot of grain products, I’d be munching something two hours later. That doesn’t happen with a Paleo/Primal diet. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Ryan 3 months 11 days ago Nice job!

I had a chuckle at your “years of losing 30 pounds, and then finding it again.” It points out how odd the English language is with “losing pounds,” like it’s a simple “Whoops, where did THAT just go?” I speak some German, but not perfectly, so I once translated it literally in a conversation and then got a puzzled silence before I realized my mistake. Their way of saying it is commonly “abnehmen,” which is sort of like “to take (away) or reduce.” I prefer the German because it gives a nod to… Read more » 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Monica 3 months 10 days ago This is a great story.

Check in the big online store for an standing workstation with the words Stand Up Desk and 48 Inch. I think is better for the money. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago This is way of topic guys, but I am really interested in the amount of vegetables you eat and if they have anything to do with all of yours guys success. In the weight loss category I mean. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Elizabeth 3 months 10 days ago Hey Marco, I honestly think veggies help with EVERYTHING. The more (non starchy) vegetable you are eating, the more micronutrients you are getting. Combining them with high quality fat and protein makes for a satisfying meal. I try to eat several servings of veggies with breakfast, lunch and dinner. I’ve never really struggled with my weight or fat loss, but I think the vegetables definitely help me stay on track. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago Thanks, I mean I figured that they are important but you don’t hear enough how vegetables also help. I probably should be eating more veggies anyway since i don’t have access to pastured meat for a variety of reasons so I eat mostly cafo. But thanks again Liz appreciate your feedback. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Dawn 3 months 5 days ago Hi Marco and all, I friend just told me about a grass fed company that will ship clean meats right to you… See: http://grasslandbeef.com Happy cooking with meat and lots o’ veggies! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Patricia 3 months 9 days ago Hi Marco–I think of veggies as the bulk of my lunch and dinner. The key is to give veggies “love” to make them delicious. I like plain steamed broccoli as much as the next girl, but add a balsamic vinaigrette and now you have deliciousness on a plate. The veggies provide plenty of nutrients and lots of fiber, and by eating several different veggies with a protein, I don’t want anything else. I’ve learned to like almost all vegetables; the trick is what you do with them. Even Brussels sprout haters will like them cooked in garlic butter and served… Read more » 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago I really should say fat loss 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ marco 3 months 10 days ago And congrats on everything, it cant seem to be that simple for me. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ wildgrok 3 months 10 days ago Hi Rick Congratulations from another IT person with elbow surgery also! 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Vernon 3 months 9 days ago Great job Rick.

Since then, Apple has been releasing new bands instead of releasing a brand new Watch. However, this fall, we expect Apple to release a brand new Watch. With the new Watch coming so soon, the stock for bands and Apple Watch bundles are going out of stock. On Apple’s website a lot of bands and Watch bundles (Watch + band), are being listed as “Sold Out” though some of them are still available in a few retail locations, though, those are rare. With us being so close, we highly doubt Apple will bring any of these bands back in stock until the new Watch is released. We expect Apple to release the new model during its September iPhone event, so we wouldn’t recommend anyone to purchase the Watch at this point. Here’s the list: Sport: 42mm Silver Aluminum Case with Yellow Sport Band – Sold Out 38mm Silver Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Sport Band – Sold Out 42mm Silver Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Sport Band – Sold Out 38mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Woven Nylon – Sold Out 42mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Royal Blue Woven Nylon – Sold Out 38mm Gold Aluminum Case with Gold/Red Woven Nylon – Sold Out Stainless Steel: 42mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle – 4-6 weeks 42mm White Leather Loop – 4-6 weeks 42mm Milanese – Sold Out 42mm Link Bracelet – Sold Out 42mm Space Black Milanese Loop – Sold Out 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet – Sold Out Hermès: Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Fauve Barenia Leather Band- Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Etain Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Small/Medium Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Double Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Large Bleu Jean Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Single Tour, 38mm Stainless Steel Case with Capucine Leather Band – Sold Out Cuff, 42mm Stainless Steel Case with Fauve Barenia Leather Band – Sold Out Individual bands: 38mm Stone Sport Band 38mm Apricot Sport Band 38mm Lilac Sport Band 38mm Royal Blue Sport Band 38mm Turquoise Sport Band 38mm Vintage Rose Sport Band 38mm Pink Sport Band 42mm Apricot Sport Band 42mm Lavender Sport Band 42mm Lilac Sport Band 42mm Royal Blue Sport Band 42mm Turquoise Sport Band 42mm Vintage Rose Sport Band 42mm Green Sport Band 42mm Gold/Royal Blue Woven Nylon 38mm White Classic Buckle 38mm Marigold Classic Buckle 38mm Blue Jay Classic Buckle 38mm Midnight Blue Classic Buckle 38mm Storm Gray Classic Buckle 38mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle 38mm Black Classic Buckle 38mm Red Classic Buckle 42mm White Classic Buckle 42mm Blue Jay Classic Buckle 42mm Midnight Blue Classic Buckle 42mm Storm Gray Classic Buckle 42mm Marine Blue Classic Buckle 42mm Black Classic Buckle 42mm Red Classic Buckle 42mm Storm Gray Leather Loop – Medium 42mm Storm Gray Leather Loop – Large 42mm Black Leather Loop – Medium 42mm Black Leather Loop – Large Band 38mm Marigold Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Medium 38mm Blue Jay Modern Buckle – Large 38mm Midnight Blue Modern Buckle – Medium 38mm Black Modern Buckle – Small 38mm Soft Pink Modern Buckle – Large 42mm Link Bracelet 42mm Space Black Link Bracelet Hermès – 38mm Feu Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Blanc Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Bleu Paon Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Bleu Saphir Double Tour – Small/Medium Hermès – 38mm Fauve Barenia Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Capucine Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Etain Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Bleu Jean Double Tour – Large Hermès – 38mm Fauve Barenia Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Feu Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Blanc Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Bleu Paon Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Bleu Saphir Single Tour Hermès – 38mm Noir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Fauve Barenia Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Feu Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Bleu Saphir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Noir Single Tour Hermès – 42mm Fauve Barenia Cuff Tags: Apple Watch, Apple Watch 2 About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

By FoxNews.com on Aug 12, 2016 at 7:30 PM Mobile Share This Story Tweet Like Share Submit Shop ▾ Image Source: Apple While the upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to have some welcome improvements, the iPhone that Apple is planning for 2017 could be really different. First, let’s review what’s expected for the iPhone 7. Two recent reports from Bloomberg lay out a lot of the details. It’s expected to debut at an Apple event less than a month from now on September 7, but be physically similar to the iPhone 6/6s, a design first introduced in September of 2014. That means Apple will break from its past practice of doing a physical makeover every two years. The iPhone 7’s improvements and changes are expected to include a dual-camera system (possibly similar to Huawei’s P9 smartphone) on one model, a redesigned pressure-sensitive home button, and no headphone jack. Headphones would be connected via the charging port or Bluetooth. Wait for the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 should be the device that moves Apple into the future. It may not be a coincidence that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, it’s conceivable that Apple is waiting for that date to bring out an overhauled iPhone. So far, speculation points to a 2017 iPhone that could be based on a glass body, according to a report this week from Nikkei, Japan’s largest business newspaper. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Nikkei reported. That glass casing could be made by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, Nikkei said, citing a source with knowledge of Apple component suppliers in Taiwan. “Foxconn has been trying [to develop a] glass chassis since last year,” Nikkei quoted the source as saying. But probably the most stunning part of the redesign would be the rumored move from the current LCD (liquid crystal) display to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which is a rumor repeated by Nikkei. That would theoretically enable Apple to revamp the iPhone’s physical look-and-feel and— as one possibility— offer a curved display with higher resolution and more vibrant colors. A major redesign along those lines is practically necessary for Apple because Samsung already offers the highly-praised Galaxy S7 Edge with an OLED display that’s curved along the two lengthwise edges of the phone. That gives Samsung a clear technological advantage over Apple. “Right now, the Galaxy Note 7 is far more advanced than what Apple offers and, my bet, more advanced than what the iPhone 7 will offer,” Todd Haselton, a writer for tech media site TechoBuffalo, told Foxnews.com in an email. “Several rumors have suggested Apple is moving toward an OLED display next year, which will be a good first step [toward closing the gap],” he added. Apple could also combine hardware improvements with new software and services, Rushabh Doshi, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told FoxNews.com. “We expect Apple to focus strongly on service innovation. Artificial Intelligence would take center stage in the coming years as the smart phone becomes a true ‘assistant’ to the user,” Doshi said. “[The] recent acquisition of Turi continues to underline the importance of AI for Apple,” Doshi said. Neither Apple nor Foxconn would comment on the Nikkei report. Related US Air Force’s plan to improve radio communications?

HP’s Spectre, which the company is touting as the world’s thinnest, is one such example. With its high-quality hardware and refined design, the $999.99 Spectre seriously raises the bar for ultra-thin laptops. Still, there are some important considerations to make before picking one up. Here’s a closer look at what it was like to use the HP Spectre. How it Looks and Feels The HP Spectre looks unlike most other laptops out there. Made of aluminum and carbon fiber, the notebook has a sleek black appearance accented with a shiny gold hinge. HP clearly paid attention to the details here: the keys feature a gold trim to match the notebook’s glossy hinge. Meanwhile, the speakers, located to the left and right of the keyboard, look as if they’ve been etched into the keyboard deck. The gold hinge, however, does have the unfortunate tendency to collect fingerprint smudges. At roughly 0.41 inches thin and 2.45 pounds, the Spectre is supremely slim and light. Apple’s MacBook Air, by comparison, is 0.11 inches thin at its slimmest point but 0.68 inches at its thickest, while Dell’s XPS 13 is between 0.3 and 0.6 inches thin. The Spectre has a 1,920×1,080 resolution 13.3-inch screen, which is sharper than that of the MacBook Air but not as dazzling as those offered on some other ultrabooks. Still, for most people, it’ll be more than adequate for watching Netflix or browsing photos. Using It Keyboard quality is arguably one of the most important characteristics of a laptop. A poor keyboard can make it difficult or just plain frustrating to interact with your computer. Thankfully, the Spectre’s keyboard is among the best I’ve used on a laptop. The key travel is deep, providing rich feedback and making it comfortable to type at a quick pace. It’s exactly what should be expected of a premium notebook. The touchpad, however, could use some improvement. I found it to be sluggish and laggy at times, and I had to tweak a few settings to get an enjoyable experience. If you’re seeking a laptop primarily for work and entertainment, the Spectre should be plenty fast. It runs on Intel’s latest processors, and buyers have the option of choosing between a Core i5 or Core i7. I’ve been using the $1,099 Core i7 variant for a mix of web browsing, casual gaming, light photo editing, and streaming Netflix, and I haven’t come across any stutters or hiccups. However, the Spectre’s fans get noisy fairly often, which can be distracting. Those who typically watch TV shows or blast tunes from their laptop will likely be pleased with the Spectre’s Bang & Olufsen speakers, which offer rich and powerful audio. But the productivity-minded should keep in mind that the Spectre offers only three USB Type-C ports, plus a headphone jack. USB Type-C is certainly the future, but for now you’ll need adapters to connect the Spectre to most equipment — like external monitors. I didn’t get great battery life out of the Spectre, but I believe my testing circumstances were part of the problem. The notebook’s battery depleted after about four hours of use, which is unusually low. That said, the Wi-Fi signal in my office kept dropping in and out over the course of writing this review, and the battery may have been drained while the laptop was searching for a signal. It’s probably safe to expect around six hours of battery life out of the Spectre under normal circumstances. Conclusion With its latest Spectre, HP has proven that there is a way to improve laptop design without compromising the computing experience. The HP Spectre is a marvelously slim, attractive machine that tackles all of the basics, offering a sturdy keyboard and fast performance. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider other options. If you don’t need a Core i7 processor and don’t mind something slightly thicker, the Dell XPS 13 is definitely worth a look, especially since it’s about $100 cheaper than HP’s notebook and provides a similar experience. Chromebooks, meanwhile, are increasingly compelling options for the budget-minded. But in general, the Spectre is priced fairly considering most ultrabooks cost around $1,000. All told, HP’s Spectre is a top contender among today’s Windows 10 laptops. 4 out of 5 stars Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump’s advisors are lying to him Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech A laser pointer from the stands helped the Oakland Raiders beat the Texans BGR News T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network

Related: Apple Watch 2: Everything you need to know Indeed, some of the newer models with nylon straps are also gone despite only being made available this spring. As the report also states, the larger 42mm versions of the standard Apple Watch are on back order, while custom Hermes-branded options are also sold out online. With Apple seemingly no longer replenishing these stocks amid middling sales, it's safe to assume the company is shifting existing inventory ahead of a refresh. See also: watchOS 3.0: The five killer features Most observers are predicting an Apple Watch 2 with improved battery life, GPS technology and faster processing tech.

About Portfolio Photos Blog Pico Facebook Twitter Tumblr Instagram RSS Gruber & I disagree about a few issues about Apple Posted August 12, 2016 by Om Malik My comments (made on Leo LaPorte’s Twit) about Apple, Eddy Cue and the fragile state of iCloud services have struck a nerve, with most disagreeing with me and only a few actually agreeing with the general sensibility of the comments. One of the co-panelists Philip Elmer-Dewitt disagreed vehemently with what I was saying, though he was in agreement about Planet of the Apps as a distraction. This is coming from the so-called celebrity influx into the company, whether it is through the Beats acquisition or Eddy Cue. I mean, look at Eddy Cue. The guy was hanging out at the playoffs when iCloud was burning. For six hours. You know, he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around. I’m sorry, that’s what gets me worked up about this company. They have all these wrong priorities. They want to do entertainment content? Buy damn Netflix and move on from there. Do it properly if you want to do it. Don’t try to do this stupid penny-ante stuff which adds no value to the company. Absolutely none. Today John Gruber (a dear friend and a fellow Yankees fan) and I find ourselves on opposite sides of the spectrum and he disagrees with me as well. He picked up on my argument that Eddy Cue would have struggled to last under Steve Jobs. Here is what John said: I’ll just point out that Eddy Cue started at Apple in 1989, and reported directly to Jobs while creating and running the iTunes Store, App Store, and iLife suite. You’re free to argue that Cue is doing a shitty job, but “he wouldn’t have survived a day if Steve was around” doesn’t hold water. And the whole thing about Cue attending a Golden State Warriors game — game one of the NBA Finals — during an iCloud outage is nonsense. If Cue had skipped the game, the iCloud outage would not have been fixed a minute sooner. Not one minute. I think Gruber is missing the point — attending a game when a division you are responsible for is down for six hours is a clear lack of empathy for the customers, and also is a sign that standards are falling of what used to be an Apple Standard for building products of delight. Sure, things might have taken as much time to fix the iCloud, but the message you would have sent out to rest of the Apple team would have been different. In the wake of Antenna Gate, I distinctly remember reading about the then Apple executive responsible for hardware, Mark Papermaster leaving the company. “From what I’ve heard, its clear he was sacked,” John wrote on his blog. The continuous iCloud and Apple Services challenges are on the same plane as far as I am concerned, as they impact millions of users. If Apple is indeed serious about services and its services business, it needs to own up to the fact that it’s iCloud can’t go down for six hours. This isn’t 1999! And the company’s executive team needs to show with actions and not just words, and that means leader of its services oriented products must prioritize uptime over Steph Curry! Sometimes the game isn’t just a game! *** On another note, Gruber disagrees with my argument that Apple should buy Netflix and writes: … he’s off his rocker on this one. I’m as skeptical as anyone about this Planet of the Apps show and why Apple is producing it. But I highly doubt it’s a distraction for anyone at Apple. It’s not even shooting in the Bay Area; it’s shooting in L.A. Buying Netflix, on the other hand, would be a huge distraction. I’m not saying it could never happen or would certainly be a bad idea, but Apple’s services are built to take advantage of its hardware. Netflix is the opposite — it’s a service designed to be available on any device with a screen. With iTunes, Apple already has a library of movies and TV shows. If Apple wants to produce original content, they could start their own production company for a tiny fraction of Netflix’s $42 billion market cap. A fraction. To me, this reads as Om being bored with Apple, and wanting them to just do something. Actually it not me being bored with Apple, but pointing out what Apple observers constantly miss — Internet services and infrastructure are its Achilles heel. They are in tough competition with services provided by Internet native giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Even Microsoft has decided that desktop is their past. Ask around the cloud-circles, and even the most generous souls give Apple’s infrastructure and its growing army a “B” at best. Whether it is Siri or Music or even the always syncing desktops, Apple’s infrastructure has to work flawlessly – and not go off for hours at length. Like this: Like Loading...

AP Images. Trump, Clinton Agree On One Thing The Trans-Pacific Partnership hasn’t had much love from the candidates during this election cycle. Donald Trump came out swinging against the deal from the start of the campaign, and after getting pressure from Bernie Sanders during the primaries, Hillary Clinton also flip-flopped her stance and opposed the deal. This week in Michigan, both presidential candidates gave economic policy speeches and the 12-nation trade deal. Trump called the agreement a disaster and went as far to say “a vote for Clinton is a vote for TPP.” Clinton, in her speech Thursday, took a tougher stance: “I oppose it now. I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president.” Not everyone, Trump included, seems convinced Clinton won’t flip-flop again if she’s elected. Related 9 Things to Know About FN's Icon of the Year, Iris Apfel Ultimately, the deal is an economic boon for the majority of the footwear industry, and for the U.S., it’s seen as a national security move to check Chinese power in the region.

Fashion Pro-Apple: Design Is Everything The Apple lawsuit against Samsung for patent infringement over its iPhone features has been one of Silicon Valley’s splashiest. Now that the case is headed to the Supreme Court, fashion is taking sides. In an amicus brief filed with the courts last week, designers including Alexander Wang, Calvin Klein and Nicolas Ghesquière filed in support of Apple. Tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft have sided with Samsung. The court will answer whether a company violating another’s patents is required to forfeit all profits, when only parts of an item are in violation. Historically, brands will surrender all profits, even for a partial violation. “If you think about it in terms of the fashion industry and footwear, there are hundreds of design patents on different aspects of the shoe, like the sole,” explained IP attorney Aaron Parker with Finnegan. “Should you be entitled to all profits of the entire shoe if we’re only talking about a specific portion of a shoe?” IP experts say if the courts rule in favor of Samsung it would blow open previous precedents regarding patents, force designers to more seriously seek design protection and raise serious questions about the value of design. Another important thing to note: The law as it reads now acts as a deterrent preventing patent and intellectual property theft. South China Seas Heating Up New photos revealed this week appear to show reefs and islands built by China in the international trade thoroughfare are being militarized. The news comes just weeks after the International Court of Justice declared that China didn’t have the right to build islands in the area, and after China’s President Xi Jinping promised not to militarized the zone last fall while visiting the U.S. For footwear, the all-important Asian sourcing route will most certainly be affected by the increased tensions with the Chinese moves.

Department Stores Turned a Corner After months of missed comps, disappointing consumer traffic, high promotions and static inventory, Q2 looks like department stores might be turning a corner for 2016. Macy’s, Nordstrom, JCPenney’s and Kohl’s reported better-than-expected earnings that showed steps toward improvement. Most notably, Macy’s garnered attention Thursday after reporting it would close 100 stores and distribute more resources to improving profitable stores, in-store experience and digital efforts. The share price soared 17 percent. Losses at Nordstrom and JCPenney were smaller than expected as stores became increasingly proactive on cutting inventory levels. Kohl’s also picked up pace. “We see reason for increased optimism for the second half based on sequentially improving comp momentum, clean-ish inventories and easy comparisons,” wrote Cowen & Co.’s Olivier Chen in a note to investors about Kohl’s and Macy’s. Analysts say while the steps are in the right direction, department stores aren’t out of the woods yet. — Sign up for the FN Newsletter — Business, Retail, North America, Apple, Macy's, South China Sea, TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership Share This Article Email Tumblr WhatsApp LinkedIn Post navigation ← Dr. Scholl’s Introduces ‘Be Energized’ Technology For Spring 2017 Line A Look At Ronnie Fieg’s Next Diadora Collaboration → Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Invasion of the tabtops: The new hybrid tablets reviewed What the Microsoft Surface ‘Hat for Your Cat’ takedown ad really means Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Although Apple has recently implied that its iPad Pro tablet could replace a traditional PC, the nascent ad campaign does not signal an immediate change in the company's strategy, an analyst argued today. "The iPad Pro is not the answer to everything," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, in an interview. "I don't believe [Apple] thinks there is not a place for the Mac." Milanesi was reacting to questions prompted by commentary she wrote after Apple introduced a new TV advertisement Aug. 1. In the ad, Apple labeled the keyboard-equipped iPad Pro a "computer," and deployed a tag line that said, "Imagine what your computer could do ... if your computer was an iPad Pro." It was the most explicit portrayal of the iPad Pro as stand-in for a PC since Apple introduced the tablet 11 months ago, even though CEO Tim Cook has constructed more straightforward comparisons when talking to Wall Street. "iPad Pro is ... the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks," Cook contended last month during the firm's second-quarter earnings call. Like Microsoft before it, Apple has attempted to stretch the definition of "computer" or "personal computer." Microsoft has been on that path since it unveiled the Surface portfolio of 2-in-1 devices in mid-2012, just prior to the debut of Windows 8. "The iPad Pro is, of course, not the first tablet trying to convince you it can do what your PC does and more," Milanesi wrote on Tech.pinions this week. "Microsoft has been trying to do the same with the Surface." Milanesi concluded that while the two companies' approaches are quite different, both worked towards the same goal. "They are now fighting a battle on opposite fronts but with one common interest -- changing how people think of a PC," she wrote. The iPad Pro ad was more an attempt to change perceptions -- a chore that by necessity will be a long-term effort -- and much less a statement that the tablet with a keyboard is now a PC replacement. "The more you live in apps, the more you think you can get away with [using a tablet rather than a PC]," Milanesi said. "But I don't think there's a rush [by Apple] to get there. They don't have a hybrid [like the Surface Pro]. And they're not going to put touch on a Mac." Part of her reasoning is a belief that Microsoft's approach with the Surface is flawed. There was no question that the Surface kicked off a new -- and growing -- device category, but its impact was diluted. The Surface was different, but in reality, not many actually thought of it in a different way, Milanesi said. Because the Surface runs a desktop OS, albeit one enhanced for touch, users continue to envision their Surface as a personal computer, a PC, burdening the device with decades of meaning and definition. In fact, Microsoft does, too: When a Surface reboots, the on-screen message reads "Your PC is restarting," Milanesi noted, not "Your Surface is restarting." "It is not surprising the Surface commercials show people using the Surface in their non-conventional businesses, and end with 'I could not do that with my Mac,'" Milanesi wrote on Tech.pinions of Microsoft's emphasis on comparing the Surface to a PC. Apple's ad is different. Rather than link the iPad Pro to "PC," Apple referenced "computer." That was intentional. "They never say that this is a 'personal computer,'" Milanesi said. Nor does the latter term resonate with younger users, she maintained. Ask an elementary school-aged child what an iPad is, and their answer will be "computer." "A 'computer' is whatever window gets you into the Internet," Milanesi said. "And the new generation is more touch prone, more into apps, and might think about an iPad more as a computer." And there's the rub. Apple and Microsoft can try to change the answer to the question "What is a PC?" all they want with devices like the iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 4, but there is no evidence they've moved the definition. Or that Apple is itself convinced that a turn is imminent. "There's no pressure on Apple to get out of the personal computer business," said Milanesi. What will it take to change the concept of a personal computer, or a computer for that matter? More ads? More hybrids? More keyboards stuck onto tablets? "Lots of kids growing up, that's what," said Milanesi. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

While Apple doesn’t divulge specific revenue figures for how many apps it sells, we can still get a sense of how well the business is doing. Apple includes App Store sales along with other items in its “services” revenue, and during Apple’s last business quarter, Apple reported services sales of $5.98 billion, a 19 percent increase from a year ago, making it the company’s second-largest revenue generator. No. 1, by a wide margin, remains the iPhone. And in four years, there could be more than 5 million apps available on the App Store — double the current number of apps — according to Sensor Tower, a research firm and consultancy that helps app developers get their apps downloaded. Sensor Tower said games dominate on the App Store and are the largest category of new apps that end up in the online shop. How big are games? Sensor Tower said that out of more than 48,000 apps that were added to the App Store in May, almost 21,000, or nearly 44 percent, were games. The category with the next-highest number of new apps added? Education, with almost 2,500 new apps. For historical purposes, think of this: There were just 5,000 apps on the App Store at the end of 2008. That number grew to 1.75 million by the end of 2015. Still, adding almost 2.5 million more apps in four years is a tall order. But the growth rates expected as apps take on more prominence in consumers’ daily lives suggest that such a number is attainable. It would certainly make Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook happy and help the company reach his expectations that services will “be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year.”   Middle Innings: Not to make fun of Silicon Graphics, but, really, when was the last time you really thought about the company that was once one of the kings of the computer server market? (Maybe it was around the last time you thought about Sun Microsystems, another one-time server bigwig that’s been part of Oracle since 2010). Well, enough investors thought about Silicon Graphics to send the company’s shares up by almost 29 percent Friday, to end the week at $7.69. That’s what happens when you’re a company that gets bought by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for $275 million. HPE and SGI announced the deal late Thursday, in which HPE said the acquisition would help it strengthen its place in the high-performance computing market. Maybe HPE will use SGI’s technology for high-end data analytics? In which case, maybe it’ll come to some analysis as to why it bought a company that was last viewed as being on the cutting edge of tech back before Facebook was even a dream in Mark Zuckerberg’s mind. Welcome To The Grotto: Amazon is going to produce a 13-episode docu-series about the history of Playboy and its iconic founder, Hugh Hefner. As the market for original and exclusive programming by online video-streaming companies grows, few brands evoke an immediate feeling of — excitement? sentimentality? — than Playboy, so it can’t hurt to have that name attached to your program lineup. It probably won’t hurt Amazon’s production efforts that the company is said to have gotten access to 17,000 hours of unseen video footage and 2,600 of Hef’s personal scrapbooks. And you know those scrapbooks aren’t just full of articles. Bottom Of The Lineup:  Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday … Movin’ On Up: Gains came from InvenSense, Oclaro, Rocket Fuel, Nvidia and NeoPhotonics. In The Red: Decliners included Genomic Health, Barracuda Networks, Aemetis, ServiceSource International and Impax Laboratories.   The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 percent to 5,232. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped by 0.2 percent to 18,576. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index edged down by 0.1 percent to 2,184. Quote Of The Day: “You never know the feeling until it hits you.” — American gymnast Simone Biles, after winning the women’s all-around gold medal at the Olympics on Thursday.

Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah What still needs to be done for true workforce diversity and equality Compiled by Sarah Anderson For the Deseret News Published: Aug. 12, 2016 3:00 p.m. 6 Comments Apple recently joined other tech giants in announcing it pays employees the same amount for similar jobs and performances, regardless of gender or race, and is also working toward a more diverse workforce by hiring more women and minorities. “We’ve achieved pay equity in the United States for similar roles and performance,” the latest Apple report stated. “Women earn one dollar for every dollar male employees earn. And underrepresented minorities earn one dollar for every dollar white employees earn.” The company reported that it was stepping up its diverse hires, with new women hires up from 31 percent in 2014 to 37 percent today, and “underrepresented” minority new hires up from 21 percent in 2014 to 27 percent, CNN.com noted. Underrepresented minorities do not include Asians, it continued, as they represent 19 percent of Apple’s workforce and 24 percent of new hires. The Huffington Post noted that a previous critic of Apple’s diversity, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, has come out in support of the company’s efforts to increase diversity by recruiting engineers of color from “historically black colleges and universities and scholarship organizations.” “They are clearly setting the pace, making measurable progress for three consecutive years. They’ve acted with intention, not just aspiration,” Jackson said in a statement, according to The Huffington Post. And while welcome, these steps toward diversity are just that — a few steps. As Fortune.com noted, men make up 62 percent of Apple’s leadership, same as last year. And the number of white people in leadership has increased, from 63 percent last year to 67 percent this year. To be fair, Fortune.com noted this may be result of the “undeclared” ethnic category that was eliminated this year. Apple also isn’t the first tech/digital company to announce that it pays its employees equally – Amazon, PayPal and Microsoft made similar announcements earlier this year, Fortune.com noted. But Forbes contributor Tim Worstall argued “even if absolutely every employer in America managed to do this we would still see gender and minority pay gaps.” The issue isn’t solely or mainly about employers discriminating among employees rather a case of “who works where doing what, not how the people doing the same job are treated,” it continued. For example, men and women tend to do different jobs, so pay equality between men and women in the same job may not mean much for overall gender equality. And the pay gap between minorities, such as African-Americans and Hispanics, and whites may be tied to the different educational opportunities each has, Worstall wrote. The numbers of minorities employed by Apple are still small, with 9 percent black employees and 12 percent Hispanic, The Washington Post noted, but it’s still better than others in its industry. As of January, black and Hispanic employees make up 2 and 3 percent of Google’s workforce, it continued. Whereas black and Hispanic employees make up 2 and 4 percent of Facebook’s workforce. It has been suggested by critics that Apple has a more diverse workforce because it employs lower-paid workers in its retail stores, which Facebook and Google lack, The Washington Post said. Still, there was a 1 percent increase for women and blacks in Apple’s technical jobs, it continued.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us CVS Pay mobile payment service added to the CVS Pharmacy app By R Padla - August 12, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter We already knew of the idea that the CVS Pharmacy would be launching its own mobile payment service. We heard it would utilize mainly Apple Pay but this week, the company finally unveiled CVS Pay and no, it won’t be related to anything from Apple or Google. Instead of integration with any existing payment service available, CVS is introducing its own. CVS Pay is yet another mobile payments platform that will be exclusive to payments for CVS Pharmacy transactions much like Walmart Pay is to Walmart. If you may remember not so long ago, CVS once dropped the idea of NFC mobile payments not because they cause problems but because they were part of the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). Back then, the latter was once believed to be developing its own mobile payment system called CurrentC. CurrentC has been on beta for quite a while now but it has seen a number of issues. Meanwhile, the new CVS Pay won’t exactly launch as a standalone app but will be part of the already available CVS Pharmacy app. This payment feature adds up to the prescription pickup tools and loyalty program integrated into the app. CVS Pay works similarly with the same services from Android, Walmart, and Apple. Customers need to add their credit or debits cards to the system. A barcode will be shown and then be used to pay for the items and finally finish transaction after some verification measure which can be a signature or a passcode. The CVS Pharmacy app won’t be changed at all. It will only be updated with the addition of the CVS Pay feature. CVS Pay on the CVS Pharmacy app is now available in only a few markets like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. More states are expected to receive the feature in the coming months or before 2016 ends. What’s good about CVS Pay is that it works on both Android and iOS versions of the CVS Pharmacy app. Credit and debit cards supported include Visa, Discover, MasterCard, and American Express.

Peter Allen Lewis, the Founder and President of Apple Ridge Farm, Inc., is retiring after 40 years of service, and his son, John Russell Faulkner Lewis, has been hired to step into the role of Executive Director. “The Board of Directors is ecstatic to have John transition into the role of Executive Director of Apple Ridge Farm,” said Melinda J. Payne, Board Chair. “With Peter as his mentor, John is sure to blaze new trails.” John Lewis comes to Apple Ridge with more than 17 years of experience working with inner-city youth in the public schools, community, outdoor education and recreational settings. He has served as a Certified Prevention and Health Education Specialist for the Virginia Department of Health in Richmond and Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, where he developed prevention and educational programs for at-risk youth. John is also the founder and former Executive Director of Renew Richmond, a nonprofit organization that promotes sustainable living practices, increased access to fresh, healthy produce and enhanced nutrition education in low-income communities. His work experience has been deeply rooted in organizations that focus on improving conditions for children living at or below the poverty level. John’s proclivity for helping the disadvantaged was established while he worked as a camp counselor and mentor at Apple Ridge Farm from 1999-2004. “I can’t begin to tell you what it means to me to be afforded this opportunity to lead Apple Ridge,” said John Lewis. “The organization would not be where it is today without Peter’s vision, devotion and organizational proficiency…. I learned from and continue to lead by his example.” Peter Lewis, who credits his mother for instilling in him a missionary spirit, moved to the Roanoke area from Washington, DC, in 1975. Soon after moving he purchased a 96-acre apple farm where the camp and conference center now resides. Like both of his parents, Peter was an educator for 34 years. He has worked as a teacher, physical education instructor, coach and was the co-founder, Assistant Principal and Principal of the first alternative education school for troubled students in Roanoke City, present day Noel C. Taylor Academy. He retired from Roanoke City Public Schools in June 2000. It is his belief in adults needing to take responsibility for guiding young people in a positive direction that led him to establish the camp. “Apple Ridge has given me so much joy,” he said. “I will always have a penchant for this place and I’m truly fortunate to have a son who is following in my footsteps.” A retirement party/fundraiser is being planned for Peter in November of this year.

This fall, however, we’re expecting to see a full-on Apple Watch upgrade. Ahead of that expected update, stock of existing models has been depleting gradually over recent weeks. As you’ll notice below, a variety of Apple Watch Sport models are currently listed as “Sold Out” on Apple’s website, though some do list scattered availability in retail locations. Even some nylon band options, which were just introduced earlier this year, are listed as sold out. For the stainless steel tier, all 38mm options are listed as in-stock and shipping on Apple’s website, but a handful of 42mm options are backordered 4-6 weeks, while the Milanese and Link Bracelet options are almost entirely liquidated. Finally, for the Hermès variants, almost all large sized bands are sold out, while a variety of other small/medium options are gone, as well. Hermès availability in-store is scattered, with a few stores here and there showing availability. At this point, it’s unlikely that Apple will go too far out of its way to replenish stock of any Apple Watch variants. Apple Watch 2 rumors have been picking up steam over recent months, with the device expected to feature faster internals, better waterproofing, GPS, and perhaps cellular connectivity. The Apple Watch lineup will likely be updated at a media event in early September, alongside the iPhone. As we told you all the way back in April, it’s not recommended to buy the original Apple Watch at this point, as the refresh is so close.

Although I preferred the minimalism of a wire-free desk, I reluctantly switched back to Apple’s old but still excellent Wired Keyboard to cut “low battery” notices in half, hoping that Apple would leverage 5+ years of Bluetooth and battery improvements to produce better wireless input accessories. Last week, Apple finally released sequels to its three major input devices: the new Magic Keyboard ($99) replaces the $69 Wireless Keyboard, the Magic Mouse 2 ($79) updates the $59 Magic Mouse, and the Magic Trackpad 2 ($129) vaults over the $69 Magic Trackpad. The signature improvement to each is the replacement of AA batteries with integrated Lithium-Ion rechargeable cells, refueled once per month with an included Lightning cable — previously only used for iPad, iPhone, and iPod accessories. Apple also tweaked each of the accessory designs, one more significantly than the others. Having given up mice five years ago (and radically improved a carpal tunnel-damaged wrist in the process), I opted not to test the Magic Mouse 2, but my colleague Dom Esposito discusses it and the other Magic accessories in the video below. My review is focused on the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2, neither of which I’d call “must-have” accessories, though each has a couple of worthwhile assets, and at least one surprising Apple device compatibility limitation. Should you buy Apple’s latest accessories, or go with excellent third-party alternatives such as Logitech’s K811 Keyboard and Rechargeable Trackpad for Mac instead?… (Updated November 2015 and December 2015 with new battery testing results.) Key Details: Long-awaited accessory updates Trackpad 2 adds Force Touch Typically high manufacturing quality, clean designs Each is notably more expensive Rechargeable batteries are late in arriving, use Lightning cables for only decent 1-month power Check out Dom’s video review here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjoHBX7EkJU&feature=youtu.be] Given the growth of Bluetooth keyboards since the Wireless Keyboard debuted in 2007, Apple could have gone in a half-dozen directions with the Magic Keyboard — it could have added multi-device-compatibility and backlit keys like Logitech’s K811, stripped features to go ultra-thin and light, or kept a body as thick as the Wireless Keyboard but with far longer lasting batteries, just to name a few possibilities. Instead, the Magic Keyboard feels like more of a “shrug” of a design, doing just enough to be “better than before” without attempting to push the envelope in any particular way. The Magic Keyboard’s biggest advance over its 2007 predecessor is a built-in battery that can be refueled using an included Lightning cable. Plug the cable into your Mac and the Magic Keyboard into the cable, and the Mac will instantly pair the two together without requiring wireless configuration — a welcome but very minor trick that turns out to be the most “magic” you’ll find with this keyboard. The same trick works with the Magic Trackpad 2 (and the Magic Mouse 2), and all three promise the same one-month battery life on a complete charge, with the ability to run for an extended work session off a two-minute charge. A month of life between charges is short by modern Bluetooth keyboard standards, but based on my early testing, Apple may be understating the Magic Keyboard’s longevity (at least for some Macs).* Update: You can expect around 2.5 months of real-world use on a single charge; long-term testing took my Magic Keyboard from October 19 to December 31 before a “Keyboard Batteries Very Low” warning appeared. Perhaps not surprisingly, Magic Keyboard looks a lot like every Apple keyboard released over the past 8 years: silver aluminum top, matte white keys, glossy white plastic bottom and gray rubber feet. The box and Apple’s web site note that it “requires Bluetooth-enabled Mac with OS X 10.11 or later.” This requirement is fairly specific — note that the language omits “iPad,” “iPhone,” and “Apple TV” — but Apple doesn’t specify either the version of Bluetooth the Magic Keyboard is using, or a mandatory Bluetooth version required by your Mac. During testing, my Bluetooth 2.1 (late 2011) iMac and Bluetooth 4.0 2013 Retina MacBook Pro both paired without complaint; both were running OS X 10.11 El Capitan. If you were expecting the Magic Keyboard to be a lot smaller than the Apple Wireless Keyboard, sorry: they’re very close to one another in size. Still 11″ wide with the same six rows of keys as before — all in the same locations — the Magic Keyboard is now around 4.4″ deep rather than 5.1″ deep, and a hint over 0.3″ tall rather than just over 0.7″ tall, differences attributable to two things: the removal of the prior battery tube, and a noticeable reduction in key depth. Apple has made the F-key row full-height rather than half-height, and updated one icon to match current OS X functionality, but otherwise left the F-keys unchanged from how they’ve been for years. Left and right cursor keys have become full-height as well, mimicking a change some people groaned about in the 12″ Retina MacBook. I personally don’t care much about this change, and was glad that it was the only major modification to the key layout. Keys now hover around 1mm above the aluminum top frame, versus the Wireless Keyboard’s 2mm, a difference in travel that can be felt with every tap of input. If you love the decided “click” of a DAS Keyboard or Apple’s prior classics, Magic Keyboard takes another step away from that sort of pronounced “plunk” in the service of becoming slimmer and quieter. However, the new keys aren’t as soft or low-travel as the controversial ones in the 12″ Retina MacBook, making for a much faster adjustment period and — in my case — typo-free typing within a very short period of adjustment. So far, nothing I’ve mentioned qualifies as “magic,” and unless you think of a rechargeable battery in that way, you’ll struggle to find a justification for either the keyboard’s name or its price. Apple touts the keys, which now use the San Francisco font, as more precise than before, though the average user may well take a few days to reach the same conclusion. I agree with the claim, and have enjoyed typing on the Magic Keyboard 2, though it’s not a night-and-day difference relative to the other Apple and top third-party keyboards I’ve tested. There is one unusual and potentially show-stopping limitation of the Magic Keyboard: its compatibility with devices other than the Mac. How do you pair the Magic Keyboard with an Apple TV? An iPad? Maybe you don’t. The back of the Magic Keyboard has an on-off switch, a Lightning port in the center, and an antenna bar, but there’s no Bluetooth pairing button. Previously, the Wireless Keyboard’s power button could be held down to initiate pairing, but that’s no longer possible. And Apple’s instructions offer no guidance for iPad or Apple TV use: Magic Keyboard’s manual, packaging, and marketing are solely focused on the Mac. (Note: A reader points out that if you don’t pair the Magic Keyboard to a Mac, it will silently sit in a waiting to pair mode that can be seen by the old Apple TV and iOS devices. Apple does not appear to acknowledge this functionality on its own web site.) Logitech’s K811 topped my list of the best Mac and iPad keyboards earlier this year by offering great features such as great backlit keys, the ability to switch instantly between three different Bluetooth devices (say, Mac, iPad, and Apple TV), and a rechargeable cell with up to 1 year of power between charges. The only knock against it was its $100 price, which represented a $31 premium over Apple’s Wireless Keyboard — but with at least three functional advantages that earned that premium. Now that the K811 and Magic Keyboard are peer-priced, there’s little reason save a slightly smaller footprint to prefer Apple’s option. If I was shopping today, I’d almost certainly pick the K811 given its superior features and device compatibility. Manufacturer: Apple Price: $99 Compatibility: Mac with OS X 10.11 (or later) Magic Trackpad 2 With the Magic Keyboard (and Magic Mouse 2), what you see is what you get — there are no subtle frills or happy surprises to match or better options that have been available for years. But the Magic Trackpad 2 is a very different beast. It’s the starkest-looking Apple accessory design to date, taking the prize from the famously button-compromised third-generation iPod shuffle, and yet it’s also the most sophisticated standalone input device Apple has ever designed. I’m not going to tell you that I think it’s a must-have for trackpad fans — yet — but unlike the me-too Magic Keyboard, the Magic Trackpad 2 has a lot to admire under the hood. The biggest visual change from the Magic Trackpad to the Magic Trackpad 2 is the color of its top surface. Apple shifted from the clean all-silver glass and aluminum top of the Magic Trackpad to an edge-to-edge uninterrupted white glass surface for the Magic Trackpad 2. I strongly preferred the prior color, which was mimicked (and improved upon) by the full-glass top of Logitech’s Rechargeable Trackpad for Mac, as white looks increasingly foreign alongside black-and-silver Macs and MacBooks. But given the typical longevity of Apple’s wireless accessories, perhaps the Magic Trackpad 2 is signaling an upcoming trend in Apple industrial design. Measuring 6.3″ long by 4.5″ deep by just over 0.3″ tall, the Magic Trackpad 2 precisely matches the height and depth of the Magic Keyboard, and when they’re put right next to each other, the two Magic accessories are less than an inch wider than the Apple Wired Keyboard without anything else on its side. Like the Magic Keyboard, the Magic Trackpad 2 drops the rear AA battery tube to achieve a shallower profile, instead hiding its rechargeable cell in a glossy white plastic bottom compartment. But it’s actually 1.2″ wider than the original Magic Trackpad, which was already larger than the trackpad surface on any MacBook computer Apple has sold. My first reaction to the Magic Trackpad 2’s gigantic touch surface was that I didn’t need something so big — bigger than the iPhone 6 Plus — for cursor movement or gestures. Several days later, I still feel like it’s unnecessarily large, enough that my whole hand tends to rest on it rather than only the fingers needed for movement and gestures. But “unnecessary” doesn’t mean “unreasonably,” nor “uncomfortably,” as OS X’s touch recognition is sophisticated enough to recognize that a thumb or pinky now lingering on the trackpad’s edge is not there for pinch or other gestures. There’s a lot more going on with the Magic Trackpad 2 than meets the eye. For instance: the Magic Trackpad’s clickable buttons, hidden in the bottom two rubber feet, are gone. Instead, the “click” is mimicked perfectly using basic haptic feedback. Turn off the Magic Trackpad 2 and you cannot click it at all; turn it on and you can not only “click” normally with the anticipated feedback, but press harder to Force Click to a more pronounced level with deeper feedback. The mind-blowing moment is when you open System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click and choose “Silent Clicking.” Treble disappears from the click, leaving you with nothing more than the bass and a subtle vibration or two to signal input. After a not-too-extended period of time with the Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad 2, you’ll notice that your Mac is now even quieter than it was before (a goal of mine, as noted in my recent Make Your Mac Run Silent article). The Magic Trackpad 2 will be great for people who enjoy working quietly. I’ll be the first person to admit that paying $129 for a quieter, bigger version of the Magic Trackpad doesn’t make a lot of financial sense, as the last one wasn’t super loud or too small. Similarly, the current state of Force Touch/Force Click on the Mac is pretty underwhelming: deeply pressing the trackpad on a web link lets you open a preview version of the page in a floating window; selecting a word lets you check its definition in the dictionary; in some cases, hitting it on a fast forward/reverse button changes the rate from 2x to 60x based on the pressure you’re applying. OS X Preview’s signature feature can sense differences and using them to make ‘ink’ look thick or thin, as shown here, but like most of the Force features, this is a hidden trick that you need to hunt to discover. Even as someone who has looked forward to using Force Click features on the Mac, I can only describe them as forgettable at this point. One other oddity with the Magic Trackpad 2 is its Mac support. Unlike the Magic Keyboard, which one would reasonably have expected to use on non-Mac devices (only to be disappointed), the Magic Trackpad 2’s stated Mac-only compatibility isn’t a huge shock. But here, the requirement is for a “Bluetooth 4.0-enabled Mac with OS X 10.11 or later,” seemingly denying compatibility to most Macs sold before late 2012, even if they’re running OS X 10.11 El Capitan. I’m honestly not sure why Apple says this, as I was actually able to get a Magic Trackpad 2 to pair with my late 2011 Bluetooth 2.1 iMac without complaint, though I’m not sure whether battery life or pressure sensitivity data transmission work the same on older and newer Macs. Apple promises only a month of battery life between Trackpad 2 charges, but it’s already clear from the battery percentage indicators on my iMac that the Keyboard will last longer than the Trackpad 2 on a charge.* Updated November 2, 2015: After two full weeks of use with my mid-2011, non-Bluetooth 4 iMac, the Magic Keyboard shows 76% remaining battery, while the Magic Trackpad 2 shows 21%. I expect the Trackpad 2 will be out of juice after only three weeks, versus well over the promised month for the Magic Keyboard. Second Update: On November 5, the Magic Trackpad 2’s battery died mid-day, while the Magic Keyboard was at 71%. In other words, expect less than three weeks of Trackpad 2 battery life when not using Bluetooth 4, and easily two months of Keyboard run time. Third Update: On December 31, the Magic Keyboard displayed its first-ever “Keyboard Batteries Very Low” notification, hitting 2%. That’s nearly 2.5 months of battery life on a single charge. Who is the Magic Trackpad 2 really made for? The answer, as I discovered during testing and discussions with Dom Esposito, is “anyone looking for greater input precision.” Unlike the Magic Trackpad, where top-of-surface clicks rarely registered properly, every input from edge to edge registers properly on the Magic Trackpad 2. Having a larger surface can really help during video editing today, and there will unquestionably come a point (say, OS X 10.12) where many apps will take advantage of the added depth and pressure sensitivity of a surface like this. Calling the Magic Trackpad 2 a solution in search of problems isn’t quite right, but it’s certainly a tool that isn’t being properly exploited quite yet. The Magic Trackpad’s $129 price point isn’t really mainstream for an input device, and the Force Click/Force Touch hardware functionality it offers really needs more software support to be truly worthwhile. But unlike the Magic Keyboard, which could easily be replaced with (and bettered by) Logitech’s K811, the Magic Trackpad 2’s technology and design give it additional value — particularly the prospect of greater future value — that I wouldn’t write off. Even if you don’t want to buy it for yourself because of the price, consider putting it on your holiday wish list, because over time, you’re probably going to want to have access to the next generation of Mac input devices, and if history’s any indication, this may be the only accessory to offer it for the next 5 years.

I do think they need to redesign the mouse as the edges are a little on the sharp side and become uncomfortable, and they should have put the connector at the butt of the mouse so we can still use it even while it’s being charged. I think they should figure out a way where spilling liquid on the keyboard won’t mess it up. I have resorted to using one of those silicone skins for my keyboards, which work pretty well if they are made precisely.

Smith - 1 year ago Reply the charge port is on the centre back – it is not underneath – that would be plain silly design – and it can still be used while charging but it is expensive LikeLike Scott (@ScooterComputer) - 1 year ago Reply Good review, @Horwitz! I’m especially glad you pointed out and dinged Apple on the multi-device issue, and then specially mentioned the Logitech K811. This was the single feature I felt most compelling for Apple to add, and the biggest disappointment not to see. I mean, by using the name “Magic”, the ad copy could have written itself! “A keyboard that works with your iMac, AppleTV, AND iPad. All. Seamlessly. Like Magic!” And I also agree with your take on the Trackpad. I think it is definitely the evolutionary improvement that was expected…but the price jump is just a bit boo much to handle. I’m already having issues getting users to consider using a trackpad over a mouse; the added cost of “just try it” will definitely kill it for Windows switchers. And they seem to hate the Apple mouse too, and the new Mouse 2 won’t do anything to change that. I’d like to see some information about what Boot Camp features Apple has worked on with these devices, too, if any. With Win 10 going “all in” on gestures, how Apple’s devices work in Windows becomes a consideration (I have many clients who are running Mac hardware but booting Windows). The previous generation was wonky at best, the Mouse worst of all with its bizarre touch responses and complete lack of software control in Windows. The trackpad wasn’t Windows aware either, so it became nothing more than a basic input device. LikeLiked by 2 people griffinjar - 1 year ago Reply eject button? Eject what? No DVD drive!!!

I wish they would pick up the rate of innovation that they used to possess. The competition seem to be speeding ahead. With the exception of the iPad Pro (which I really like!) I’ve been more impressed by Microsofts recent hardware introductions than Apple’s. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago Reply You don’t know what innovation is. 3D Touch? Apple Pencil?

Don’t go with superior easy of use. LikeLike telecastle - 1 year ago Reply I disagree with a lot of conclusions made in this review. 1. Magic Trackpad 1st generation can be completely silent. It’s like most folks don’t even learn the new features that Apple comes out with. There is absolutely no reason to click on trackpads. Ever since I started using MackBooks in 2008, all gestures, including moving objects, selecting blocks of text, etc. can be performed without any clicks. Apple even went back and added this feature to 2007 MacBook Pros, which had a previous generation trackpads (with two physical buttons underneath the trackpad). So, when the reviews say that Magic Trackpad gen. 2 is much more quiet, I really don’t understand how anything can be more quiet than silent because my Magic Trackpad gen. 1 is completely silent. 2. I own two Logitech K811 keyboards. The Logitech keyboard has some issues. First, it does not last for a year on one charge. That’s a ridiculous statement. I used to use it in my daily work (with backlighting on), and I had to recharge it every two weeks. Secondly, the backlighting on it is dumb – it’s either always on or alway off. It does not have an ambient light sensor, which is annoying. Additionally, the quality of the key mechanism on the Logitech K811 is not as good as on the Apple’s wireless keyboard. The keys do feel differently and one could argue that the Logitech keys feel more solid, but I noticed that the Logitech K811 keyboard slows down my typing. It seems that the keys travel down and up slower on the Logitech K811 than they do on the Apple’s wireless keyboard. This would only be noticeable by very fast touch typists, so I guess I graduated into the higher league because I definitely notice it, and the difference for me is significant – I can type about 20% faster and more accurately on the Apple keyboard. That’s the reason I switched from the Logitech K811 to the Apple wireless keyboard after using the Logiteck keyboard for 2 years. 3. The author claims that he used to see the “low battery” notification for his Aplle’s Bluetooth Magic Trackpad and Apple wireless keyboard every other day. If this is not an exaggeration, I would recommend getting new rechargeable batteries. I have been using Apple’s rechargeable batteries that come with the Apple’s charger for years now. I use the Magic trackpad and Apple wireless (Bluetooth) keyboard every day, and I am a very heavy user. I have to replace batteries in the Magic Trackpad once every 2-3 weeks, and in the Apple’s wireless keyboard once every two months or so. The Apple’s charger comes with enough batteries to be able to rotate them among the keyboard, trackpad, and charger to always have two fully charged batteries on hand. The replacement of batteries is tool-less, and takes less than 30 seconds. LikeLiked by 2 people Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply 1. “I really don’t understand how anything can be more quiet than silent…” A lot of people hate “tap to click.” It doesn’t provide feedback and, depending on how one uses a trackpad, can be less precise because lighter input is registered as a click. That’s why Magic Trackpad 2 provides options that feel like deliberate clicks but are close to silent. That’s also why Apple calls this “silent clicking” and differentiates it from “tap to click.” 2. Logitech markets the K811 as having up to a year of battery life. That said, it notes that the battery life drops dramatically if you keep the keys illuminated, hence your higher rate of depletion. And obviously, every wireless keyboard’s battery life depends on the number of hours of usage. 3. It’s not an exaggeration. Even with completely fresh batteries, the notification would come on after a week or so of use and then persist for 2-3 weeks before the power actually gave out. Once the batteries had been used for a while, I’d get the notification after a few days of use, and it would persist for 2 weeks before the batteries gave out. Using two Apple peripherals at the same time (Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad), the low battery notification for one or the other would be on screen virtually every day. LikeLike o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago What?! Hahah um no. Apple’s new trackpad has haptic for clicks primarily for Force Touch input. I have always just tapped the trackpad too, which in my opinion is far and away superior, and I’d only click the new trackpad for force touch gestures. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago It’s great that you have an opinion that something is “far and away superior,” but a lot of people feel otherwise, which is why “Tap to click” is turned off by default. LikeLike telecastle - 1 year ago Jeremy, I use both the Apple Magic Trackpad and the Aple Wireless Keyboard every day for at least 8 hours a day 5’days a week in my line of work. If you are truly having these notifications every other day, something is wrong with your setup. I actually have two sets of these devices connected to two Macs right now, and the experience is very similar on both of them, with the second set being used by my wife (not as extensively as my setup). We’ve used these Apple devices with 2009 15″ MacBook Pro, late 2012 Mac Mini, mid 2014 15″ retina MacBook Pro, and late 2014 retina iMac. We have never had anything close to what you are describing. Magic Trackpad gen. 1 lasts for 2-6 weeks based on the intensity of its use, and Apple wireless keyboard lasts for 1-3 months. The low-battery notifications show up just a few days before the batteries die. As for the Logitech K811, I really think it’s a good product, but have you personally confirmed Logitech’s claim that it could be used for a year without a charge? There’s no way it’s possible. Finally, I love the device switching feature of the K811, but switching to OS X from the Logitech K811 is pretty slow – much slower than switching to Windows. Unless you work on two different computers side by side, this feature cannot really be utilized for anything noteworthy. People used to say they could text on an iPad using this keyboard and then switch to Mac on the same keyboard to do work. However, at this point you can text, iMessage, Facebook, and tweet from OS X, so using an iPad side by side with a Mac makes much more sense as a second monitor, via the Duet app, than as an autonomous computing device. Programming an Apple TV as one of the there devices into the Logitech is convenient, but unless you watch your TV in your office or live in a studio apartment, chances are you will use the traditional input method, using a remote (or a dedicated keyboard that you keep in your living room), rather than go to your office to get the Logitech K811 keyboard off your desk to use it with the Apple TV in the living room. LikeLiked by 1 person Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago @telecastle Up until I stopped using the Wireless Keyboard (approx. 6 months ago), I was using them both for around 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, plus some time on weekends. I’ve had a late 2011 iMac since late 2011 and previously used a 2009 or 2010 iMac. Not exactly an unusual setup. The low battery notifications have been persistent and annoying despite routine OS X upgrades, different batteries, etc. It was bad before the Apple Battery Charger was released, and continued after switching to the rechargeables in a predictable fashion (performance declining subtly after X recharges, with X being “way less than 50”). Is it possible that Apple revved the products after initial release? Yes. I bought the Trackpad the day it came out, have had the Wireless Keyboard a long time as well. They’ve both been on the market for what seems like ages compared with most Apple products. Re: the K811, I use it in a very different way with multiple devices than I did with the Apple Wireless Keyboard. If you’re asking whether I personally did a 1-year battery stress test on it, the answer is obviously no. No one does that. But I’ve used the K811 with three different devices at a time and typically found myself wanting to connect it to a micro-USB charging cable every four or five months, just out of habit. The value of the K811 as a switchable keyboard will obviously depend a lot on one’s personal setup. I keep it in a room where I have an Apple TV, a Mac mini, and an iPad that might at various times benefit from it. Switching the K811 between them is a matter of pressing one button and waiting 1-2 seconds. I wouldn’t call it slow, but maybe your setup is different from mine. It works wonderfully here, and the rechargeable battery has made it far easier to deal with than the Wireless Keyboard. LikeLiked by 1 person Steve Lawrence - 1 year ago I’m with Jeremy on point 3.

The mouse, I would prefer the old one. The idiotic charging outlet placement, the 1 month of battery time and completely the same design…I would say the previous one is a better product by far! The keyboard has no particular innovation, even if Apple say they do. I can understand the keys they added on the Macbook, with the short travel distance…It was made this way to get the laptop thin enough, but in a regular size desktop keyboard, I assume the experience is just different, not better in any particular way. And thats all the difference there is after all these years?!? Still eject button – even not a single new Mac has a cd drive and no lit keys or anything inventive or cool/useful new features at all… I also agree, the trackpad is the only new peripheral that is actually particularly better than the last one. the larger surface, the haptic feedback and look is an improvement. But the price on the other hand is pretty crazy in my opinion. And that is coming from a person who buys pretty much anything from apple – but Im not buying that one.

As a fellow Wireless Keyboard and Magic Trackpad user, I know for a fact that rechargable Duracell batteries used in each last an average of 2 months, for the keyboard sometimes up to 3 months, as usage is obviously far less than it is for the Trackpad, which is where most computer interaction is done these days. Even a set of cheaper 2100 mAh AA batteries offers 6 weeks – 2 months of energy. As for the popup reminders about low battery power, these only start when the device has 15% charge left. The reminders only increase to “daily” when the charge is closing in on the 5% mark. If a user has 6 batteries, ie. 3 sets of 2, he can easily recharge one set at his leisure and when battery energy in one of his devices becomes low, simply swap those out for the pre-charged ones. No big deal. As for these new, far more expensive devices, you have to use a cable and charge only lasts a month.

But for those that sees the price points as a big investment for computer peripherals then I will say that I just got the k380 keyboard and m535 mouse (with this free third party software called smooth mouse) from logitech and those are both also great, except for less than half the price. The keyboard pairs with 3 devices and both devices go for about 40 dollars retail (i got both for about 60 thanks to a coupon and sale at best buy) which is a big difference than 100 and 129 dollars.

But the numbers are improving every year, and a new report from Park Associates finds that more than 25 percent of U.S. smartphone owners use payment apps at least once a month. One of the biggest obstacles to more widespread adoption is that the market has been so fragmented that neither consumers nor retailers have been willing to commit to a single provider. However, it seems that leaders finally may be starting to emerge. More than three-quarters of retailers said last in a new National Retail Federation survey that they would start accepting Apple Pay by the end of next year, and nearly 60 percent said that they’d accept PayPal. Related: Are Apple's Glory Days Over? While Apple may be winning the hearts and minds of retailers, PayPal is the most popular mobile payment app among consumers. More than three times as many consumers use PayPal as use Apple, according Park Associates. It has gotten easier this year for retailers to start accepting mobile payments, since the terminals required to accept the new credit card chips generally can also take payment via near-field communication, the technology used by most mobile payment systems. Among the retailers surveyed by the NRF, 72 percent said that they would have the capability of accepting near-field communication payments next year, but just over two-thirds said they’d only accept one or very few types. Still, just 17 percent said that accepting e-payments was a top priority in 2017, and consumers have not yet demanded that they do so. As security becomes a greater priority, however, both consumers and merchants may take another look at the cards. Near-field communication technology is far more secure than traditional credit cards, and it’s quicker and easier than EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa) cards.  Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next U.S. retailers push deals early as Black Friday loses focus Reuters Home Depot wants to grab a bigger chunk of Black Friday shoppers' spending CNBC.com When should you do your holiday shopping?

It is slated for a major redevelopment project that includes 2 million square feet of office space. August 8, 2016. Photo by Natalia Nazarova. / free articles read. Subscribe for unlimited access Read FAQ Like other North County communities, Cupertino is a city at a crossroads. Carried for years by explosive tech-sector growth, the city's employers have created about twice as many jobs as the city's housing inventory can support, meaning Cupertino is effectively outsourcing much of its residential needs to other areas. The imbalance is unlikely to end any time soon. Later this year, Apple's new "spaceship" headquarters will open for business, adding an estimated 14,500 new workers. And there's plenty more in the pipeline. A short walk from Apple's campus, the cavernous Vallco Shopping Mall is being pitched for a metamorphosis into a mixed-use district with shops, restaurants, housing, and a massive new office development. Up to 2 million square feet of office space has been provisionally approved by the city, which is expected to create 7,000 to 10,000 more jobs, depending on how you calculate it. Sitting inside a coffee shop on a recent morning, Cupertino resident Liang Chao sipped a cappuccino as she watched a logjam of traffic inching along Stevens Creek Boulevard, one block from Vallco. A former software engineer who is now a full-time political activist, she was sitting with a group of like-minded residents who are waging a campaign to slow down Cupertino's momentum for tech-fueled development, calling themselves Cupertino Residents for Sensible Zoning. While office expansion is providing a windfall for Cupertino's tax revenues, Chao and others described those gains as being outweighed by the long-term costs to the area's services, roads and quality of life. Unlike surrounding cities, Cupertino has no mass transit other than buses, so nearly all of the office workers streaming into town are being funneled into the same overcrowded roads. Saying yes to more offices is simply "crazy," Chao said. "Property taxes simply aren't enough to pay for all these costs," she said. "With every new office project we end up borrowing money from our future." Unlike the typical debates that swirl around development, this controversy is one that will be decided by voters in November. Chao's group has drafted a ballot measure that would force the Vallco project back to the drawing board and restrict what its members see as a City Council too eager to appease developers. Meanwhile, officials at Sand Hill Property, the firm behind the Vallco project, are taking their own countermeasure to the ballot, asking voters to approve the Vallco project as submitted. Cupertino is just one example of how the regional challenges and pressures of tech development, job growth and housing shortfalls are influencing a wave of local ballot measures across Silicon Valley cities. In Milpitas, voters will decide on an urban growth boundary to prevent housing development in the local hills. Farther south in Morgan Hill, residents are wary of being a bedroom community and are looking into a population cap that would last through 2035. And in Mountain View and several other cities across the Bay Area, residents are throwing support behind rent control as a way to prevent tenants from being priced out of town. Part 1 of the Voice's series "Out of Balance" examined the widening gap between job growth and housing construction in Santa Clara County and the impact on Silicon Valley's economy. Part 2 looked into the failure of nearly all cities to meet targets for low- and moderate-income housing development. The frustration caused by those two thorny issues is coming to fruition in the upcoming election. Leslye Corsiglia, executive director of the housing advocacy group SV@Home, said there's a clear groundswell of support by residents throughout the county to do something about the lack of available housing in the region. Local elected officials are following suit, approving higher housing impact fees for developers and finding new ways to finance affordable residential development projects. "People are becoming more aware of the need to act," she said. Spurring housing growth at the ballot box The November ballot is going to be packed this year, but housing advocates are zeroing in on one measure in particular -- Santa Clara County's proposed $950 million affordable housing bond -- as the big-ticket item that could provide relief in an overheated rental market. County officials say the money would go a long way toward easing demand for affordable housing in the region. A vast majority of the bond revenue -- over 80 percent -- would fund residential projects for extremely low- and low-income families, which is exactly the kind of development cities have failed to provide over the last decade, according to reports from the Association of Bay Area Governments. The spending plan for the bond measure, which the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors devised two months ago, is heavily weighted toward the most needy county residents. Of the $950 million, $700 million would help build homes for "extremely low-income" families (households of four people making less than $33,500 a year, for example), as well as permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing projects that would accommodate some of the estimated 6,500 homeless people in the county. Of the remaining revenue, $200 million would be split evenly for homes for low- and middle-income households, and $50 million to help first-time home buyers. If passed, the housing bond would be an absolute boon for boosting affordable housing funds in the county, Corsiglia said, providing much-needed money for residential development for the county's homeless and low-income families. The bond proposal is coming from an unusual source -- it wasn't too long ago, Corsiglia said, that county officials said publicly that housing was not a core part of their vision. In recent years, the Board of Supervisors has doubled down on affordable housing and homelessness prevention efforts. "It would be a game-changer, particularly for homeless people," Corsiglia said. "There's no way that we're going to respond to our affordable housing needs without money -- it just won't happen." Estimates from the California Housing Partnership show that over 67,000 new homes would need to be built in order to meet the demand for low-income families renting in Santa Clara County. The need for more housing also coincides with rising home prices that reached a median level of $900,000 across the county over the past year, according to real estate analytics used by the county. At the same time, the county's Community Plan to End Homelessness found that it would need to build 3,600 supportive housing units to meet the needs of chronically homeless residents, as well as 2,400 rapid rehousing units aimed at providing short-term housing for people coming out of the foster care system and victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. County Supervisor Joe Simitian told the Voice that the housing would go a long way toward solving the county's homeless problem, and finally help the county make significant progress toward a "Housing First" solution to end homelessness. Projects to be funded, Simitian said, aren't geared toward workforce housing; instead, they could help as many as 4,000 of the most needy county residents. "This bond is essentially focused on the folks who really are at the lowest end of the ladder in terms of their income," Simitian said. "We were very explicit that those funds will be available to dedicate towards tackling homelessness." Simitian noted that there's a clear financial incentive to approve the bond measure. Homelessness costs an estimated $521 million each year in countywide services including criminal justice, health care and social services, which could be greatly reduced by housing and helping the county's neediest become self-sufficient, he said. "It's a little hard for folks to get squared away when they're worried about where they're going to put their head down at night," he said. The housing bond isn't the only thing on the ballot designed to address the region's growing pains. The Valley Transportation Authority is pitching a half-cent sales tax initiative to provide about $6.5 billion for transit improvements. Grassroots efforts for rent control While some ballot measures aim to increase housing, others are intended to stabilize the cost of living in existing homes. In response to skyrocketing rents and high levels of tenant displacement, residents in several Bay Area cities have put rent control measures on the ballot this November. Mountain View, San Mateo, Alameda, Burlingame and Richmond have measures on the ballot that propose some form of rent control. Community organizers have said there's a clear popular sentiment that more needs to be done to protect renters. Jennifer Martinez is the executive director of Faith in Action, formerly Peninsula Interfaith Action, and has helped spearhead the rent control measure in San Mateo. She said faith-based communities have traditionally been involved in efforts to support affordable housing and get out the vote in low-income and minority neighborhoods, but heading a campaign for rent control is a change of pace for Faith in Action. The rent control measure in San Mateo, which glided through the signature-gathering process, comes after four years and thousands of conversations with local residents about evictions and rent increases, Martinez said. In one instance, a family had totally paid off a building they were renting out to tenants, but decided to raise the rent by $1,200 a month in one fell swoop. Tenant advocacy quickly became the No. 1 issue, prompting a real change for Faith in Action. "It's not an isolated incident, it's not one building, it keeps happening again and again," Martinez said. "It became very clear that, though our organization has always supported building affordable housing, it isn't happening quickly enough to address the need." A poll conducted by Faith in Action earlier this year found that 72 percent of San Mateo residents and 68 percent of Mountain View residents support some kind of rent control measure, Martinez said. "I was surprised to see how many people said 'thank you, thank you for doing this,' and told us their stories about how they were evicted, or how they were afraid of being evicted," she said. A statewide override for affordable housing? Perhaps the most radical attempt to increase affordable housing in California is a bill proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown that would streamline the approval process of housing developments, making it much easier for developers to get the green light for new residential construction -- as long as affordable units are included. Proponents of this "by-right" housing bill say it will spur affordable housing development in cities that have traditionally blocked or delayed dense housing projects by allowing developers to sidestep the local approval process. The projects still have to be consistent with the general plan and local zoning and design review ordinances. The by-right housing proposal began as a trailer bill attached to this year's state budget, with an incentive of $400 million in affordable housing subsidies that were contingent on the bill passing. The budget has since been signed and adopted without the by-right housing bill, but Brown has continued to push hard for the policy in the current legislative session. The language of the trailer bill remains virtually unchanged. Brown's proposal comes after a report by the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded that the high cost of housing is caused, first and foremost, by the lack of housing to meet the demand. As of 2015, the average home in California cost $440,000 -- about two and a half times the average national home price -- and average monthly rent is 50 percent higher than the rest of the country, at $1,240, according to the report. Corsiglia said that SV@Home supports Brown's proposal, with a few amendments asking for greater affordability requirements and assurance that there would be community outreach. She said many cities in the Bay Area have zoned for housing and could support residential growth, but it isn't happening because of hurdles at the local level -- something that by-right housing seeks to fix. "If your housing element and your general plan says you can build housing in an area, you should be able to build it." Corsiglia said. The League of California Cities has come out strongly against the by-right housing bill, calling the governor's plan a misguided attempt to revitalize affordable housing development following Brown's own decision to dissolve redevelopment agencies in late 2011. Redevelopment agencies routed roughly $1 billion annually to affordable housing projects across the state prior to dissolution; that amounted to $65 million in Santa Clara County. City agencies aren't the only ones with a bone to pick. A statewide coalition of more than 60 organizations, including community development groups, tenant advocacy groups, faith-based organizations and unions, released a statement earlier this month slamming the governor's proposal. The coalition asserts that the bill will do nothing to truly address the housing crisis in California. Under the proposal, it says, a mostly market-rate development could avoid local review by having a small number of units reserved for affordable housing, and city governments would be unable to control a potential influx of high-cost units that could push out existing residents and further gentrify cities. "Policies that deregulate market-rate housing development have proven in all of California's major urban areas to cause displacement of lower-income communities," according to the coalition's statement. "High-priced housing developments are already destroying existing diverse neighborhoods, displacing residents, small businesses, and jobs." Concerns over initiative overuse In some cases, local elected officials have expressed concerns that making decisions on complex issues by popular vote is a poor way to craft policy. Mountain View officials have criticized the citizen rent-control initiative for being drafted as a charter amendment, which requires another ballot initiative to make any major policy changes. In the case of Cupertino, Councilman Rod Sinks said he was dismayed that both local activists and developers were using ballot initiatives to circumvent the normal government process on the Vallco project. He predicted both measures would fail. "Doing land-use planning at the ballot box is not smart, it's not wise. If anything needs to change with the Vallco process, then we have to go back to voters," he said. "I don't like this process -- you have a small group of people fiercely in favor or fiercely opposed, and then you have a huge pool in the middle." But many opponents of the Vallco project are well past the point of politely laying out their grievances at public meetings. Already, the citizens' group has filed a lawsuit against the city for allegedly mischaracterizing its initiative in the brief write-up that would appear on the ballot. Many members of the same group are also working to recall Cupertino Mayor Barry Chang, who is perceived as having too cozy a relationship with Sand Hill Property and other office developers.

First of all one must be able to do basic math. There is no such thing as "affordable housing" only subsidized housing. With the cost of an average rental unit in Silicon Valley of around 700k (very high land prices) there won't be much "affordable housing" built. Because of the very high educational level and high incomes of Silicon Valley's residents prices have been bid up. Silicon Valley which now includes most of Bay Area is the Manhattan of the west coast. Government is the problem. Cynical politicians go along with what amounts to the mob rule of the renters who want "affordable housing (below market rents)." The key is to dense pack develop building more units per acre like what's happened in cities around the world throughout history. The problem is that Silicon Valley is the scientific capitol of the world attracting avid students of economics. Government is the problem when the politicians fail to even pass high school economics a required subject.

After all, who do you think is going to build new houses if they are going to be saddled with ever higher taxes and infrastructure costs, an inability to charge market rates for their rentals, and a political climate in which cities can impose costly restrictions on housing at any time? People voting for such measures don't have the interests of the community at heart, they simply want others to pay more so that they have to pay less. Of course. These initiatives will raise the cost of housing and make the housing shortage worse and perpetuate it. We shouldn't let these "advocates" or "coalitions" get away with pretending that they are doing this for "diversity" or the good of society; they are simply greedy and selfish. It is, of course, perfectly legal for people to pursue greedy and selfish goals at the ballot box, but we shouldn't let them get away with misrepresenting what they actually want.

Single family homes/condos/town homes are also exempt. I'm ok with a rent control measure, because it only applies to older construction apartments, who benefit hugely from Prop 13 while charging bleeding edge rents for dilapidated units. They hike rents aggressively and don't contribute to school funding, etc. Now, combine this with reduced regulations/permitting overhead, allow taller housing to be built IF it includes ground floor commercial units/grocery. We'll tackle the housing supply issues easily. If you really want to reduce long term rental prices, build lots of condos. Individuals dont have front desks that can hike rents and keep a steady flow of tenants renting. Real people will buy and live in the condo and eventually move in to something bigger. They'll either sell it to a new owner, or rent it out to someone at a more reasonable rate, hoping for long term occupancy.

Ms. Liang Chao has a good point about lack of transportation, but her group has not put forth a credible alternative to the proposed office development. They don't want to build more housing or more transit. Instead, their ballot measure mandates that Vallco remain a shopping center. A successful shopping center creates a lot of traffic. A shopping center that doesn't create a lot of traffic is a vacant white elephant like they already have. At that point, might as well just level the whole place and turn it into a park.

Those being built at 1101 El Camino are projected to be starting at 1.2 for a 2 bdrm & 1.1 for a 1 bdrm. The 4 or 5 "affordable units" are projected to be about 100K less, which still is a million dollars for 1 bdrm! And when the real prices are revealed upon completion, even the so-called affordable units will be much, much more than a million. No one is getting a condo for just over a million dollars. Case in point: "s9uQoMadera," nearby, was projected to be going to rent for $2500/mo. for a 2 bdrm, which actually started renting for $8000/mo. instead!

Charley Locke Culture Date of Publication: 08.12.16. 08.12.16 Time of Publication: 2:26 pm. 2:26 pm Hillary Clinton’s New Podcast Is All About Being Chill Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Hillary Clinton, Democratic presidential nominee, former Secretary of State, and renowned BlackBerry enthusiast, now has one more job to add to her resume: podcast host. Today, Clinton launched With Her, an official campaign podcast co-hosted by Max Linsky. In addition to Clinton and the Longform co-founder, the show will feature VP nominee Tim Kaine, Clinton supporters, and staff along the campaign trail. It will be released irregularly until election day. (The campaign has not responded to a request for comment from WIRED.) For Clinton, the intimacy of the podcast format provides a much-needed opportunity to be personable and casual with American voters. She is often criticized as being stilted and rehearsed. The podcast format encourages the opposite: off-the-cuff chattiness. And Clinton’s thrived in the intimate format before. In October 2015, Clinton appeared on BuzzFeed’s Another Round podcast, and on that episode the candidate often maligned for her lack of likability came across as at-ease, even funny. It’s clear from the first episode of With Her that the campaign hopes it will help portray the candidate as someone who an average American could commiserate with about waking up early or brag to about family photos. In it, Clinton and Linsky chat about her most emotional moments on the campaign trail and how she manages to be “on” all the time. The first thing she says is, “You can call me whatever you want, you can call me ‘Hillary,’ ‘Madam Secretary,’ you can call me ‘Hey You,’ you can call me whatever you want.” She shares that the last thing she thinks about her grandkids before she goes to sleep at night. The podcast also provides Clinton with a platform to have substantive conversations with the electorate about nuanced issues in a thoughtful, uninterrupted way. On Another Round, hosts Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton asked her tough questions about Black Lives Matter, reparations, and her experiences with sexism. Clinton fielded them honestly, and she came across as likable and authentic for it. Linsky is a pioneer of the sponsored content podcast: he hosted Brownscast, the insider podcast of the Cleveland Browns, and co-founded Pineapple Street Media in May to develop shows in partnership with organizations including The New York Times, Lena Dunham’s Lennyletter, and now the Clinton campaign. In the first episode of With Her, Linsky self-identifies as a Hillary supporter and a small business owner rather than a journalist, which informs the chatty, complimentary tone of their exchange. If it works, it will provide Clinton with something she sorely needs: a way to showcase her real personality—a thing her Republican counterpart has done so successfully on Twitter. Go Back to Top.

Bill Clinton is now officially the first man to enter a recipe into everyone’s favorite compulsory political bake-off, following in the footsteps of brave fictional hero Ben Wyatt from Parks and Recreation. Today, Bill submitted the Clinton Family Chocolate Chip Cookies into the Family Circle First Lady Cookie Contest, which for his sake, has been re-branded as the Presidential Cookie Poll. Bill’s cookies will go head-to-head with Melania Trump’s Star Cookies in a Facebook poll. You have until October 4 to cast your vote. As saccharine political theater goes, the cookie contest might make you even queasier than usual. Because holy retrograde gender roles, Batman. But in Bill Clinton’s case, it’s also scrumptiously ironic. The whole thing was cooked up as a way to make Hillary Clinton literally spend some time in the kitchen. Here’s the background: During Bill’s run for office in 1992, a reporter asked Hillary about her career choices and she said, “You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that’s all that I can tell you.” Cue the outrage, from stay at home moms and pundits and, well, everyone. Family Circle Magazine responded by challenging Hillary to a bake-off, and she could hardly say no. And thus a weirdly compulsory cookie contest was born. For some people, having the likely First Dude strap on an apron seems like a victory. OMG BILL CLINTON SUBMITTED A COOKIE RECIPE TO FAMILY CIRCLE THIS IS IT THE PATRIARCHY IS COMING DOWN — Kate Stayman-London (@_ksl) August 18, 2016 Bill’s submission is being met with some outrage, too, though mostly not over the fact that the recipe isn’t Bill’s. (It’s the same recipe Hillary submitted in 1992 and 1996.) No, it’s because Bill is a noted vegan and many people apparently expected him to enter some butter-free, egg-free concoction. Although, honestly, Bill may be a vegan now, but he wasn’t always, and he knows vegan cookies do not a winning bake-off make. Would Bill Clinton's inevitably awful vegan southern fusion cookies trump Melania Trump’s? @jenwgilmore https://t.co/82gL3URezb — Room for Debate (@roomfordebate) July 28, 2016 Cookies for the First Gentleman: A Vegan Chickpea Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe for Bill Clinton https://t.co/IWTv0ZMyEw — Maximum Middle Age (@MaxMiddleAge) August 17, 2016 Clintons camp submitted a "Clinton family recipe" to Family Circles presidential cookie contest. I was hoping for Bill Clinton vegan cookies — Michelle Hackman (@MHackman) August 18, 2016 If you’re having deja-vu, it may because you watched this episode on NBC a few years ago. In the Pie-Mary episode, Parks and Rec writers fan-fictioned a better ending for the 1992 Clinton cookie kerfuffle. What they came up with looked a lot like today. In that episode, while Leslie Knope’s husband Ben Wyatt is running for office, Knope (sounding very Clinton-ish indeed) refuses to join the traditional pie-baking contest. NBC People get mad, and Wyatt ends up competing in Leslie’s place. Bill could have taken a few lessons from Ben—at least he found a way to make the Pie-Mary his own. NBC And to all the people out there saying it’s absurd for dudely Bill Clinton to have to participate in this pageant of domesticity (and they exist), we’ll let Knope take this one: NBC Go Back to Top.

The keyboard comes fully equipped with Blackberry and sunglasses Hillary and Pantsuit Hillary; it even has GIFs and stickers. But no, says, Snaps founder Vivian Rosenthal, this is not an official campaign product. “The Clinton campaign is not officially involved in the keyboard,” says Rosenthal, adding that she spoke with Clinton’s team about it in advance. “As a female tech founder who’s a supporter of Hillary, I wanted to leverage our messaging platform to support her campaign.” Clinton’s attempt to start a conversation on student debt via emoji may have backfired, but that doesn’t necessarily make the HillMoji keyboard a bad idea.

Trump linked early childhood vaccinations with high rates of autism in the U.S., and told the story of an employee of his, whose child was recently diagnosed after getting vaccinated with, what Trump so delicately referred to as a needle that’s “meant for a horse, not for a child.” Trump says he has nothing against vaccines, but believes they should be administered in small doses over long periods of time. The only problem is: Science says Trump is flat-out wrong about the link between vaccinations and autism. Dr. Ben Carson tried in his own quiet way to assure the Republican frontrunner of this, saying, “The fact of the matter is we have extremely well documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations.” He also suggested Trump do some reading up on the subject. So, we made him a reading list. Happy reading, Donald: – Here’s a short history of vaccine panic. Quick read, we know you’re a busy man. – But if you happen to find yourself with some time on your hands, check out this 2009 story on how panicked parents skipping shots endangers us all. – There’s also a piece about the sickeningly low rates of vaccination at Silicon Valley day cares—and why that’s a problem. – What’s that you say? Hungry for more? Well, be sure not to miss this story, in which WIRED contributor and author of the book Neurotribes Steve Silberman discusses the increase in autism diagnoses, often referred to as the autism epidemic. In reality, Silberman says, the increase had to due with a broadening of the definition of autism, which led to a flood of new diagnoses. Hope that clears some things up. Go Back to Top.

Today, the activist investor said he has some strong opinions he’d like to share with the 2016 Presidential candidates—but of course he does. “I’m going to be doing a whole presentation about what I think about the debt and about the market,” Icahn told a group of reporters gathered at a press conference for Icahn’s portfolio company Lyft. The billionaire was light on details about his proposals, but he did admit to having a soft spot for Donald Trump. “I do think a lot of the things he says has to be done in this country or we’re going to have real problems,” he said. “We may have them anyway.” Icahn added that Trump “hit a very important nerve in this country.” “The argument he’s not a politician is in his favor, not against his favor,” Icahn said. But when asked whether he would accept the role of Secretary of Treasury, as Trump has suggested in the past, Icahn said he would decline: “I have my day job.” Go Back to Top.

Now, with a lot of help from interim CEO Jack Dorsey’s other company Square, it’s about to be worth a lot more. This morning, Twitter announced it’s teaming up with Square to allow Twitter users to make a donation directly through Twitter. The goal is to remove some of the friction would-be donors face, by putting a big blue “Contribute” button right in their Twitter feed. To sign up, campaigns must first create a Square Cash business account and email Square. This creates a so-called $Cashtag (essentially a username for Square Cash) that campaigns can Tweet out, automatically generating a Contribute button in user feeds. Twitter users who click the button will be able to input their donation amount, as well as personal information required by the FEC, like their names and addresses. Twitter For campaigns, constantly looking for more lightweight ways to attract new donors, this new tool could be powerful. Sure, users could always click a link and be redirected to the campaign’s donation page on their website, but containing the action within the app removes one additional barrier for people, particularly people who are accessing Twitter on mobile. Figuring out a way to make mobile donations more seamless has been a challenge for campaigns, ever since the FEC approved mobile donations via text back in 2012. That’s because the wireless carriers that enable these transactions often charge campaigns a percentage of the donation. By soliciting donations through Twitter, campaigns can circumvent the fees carriers charge, while still reaching donors where they’re increasingly spending their time: on their phones. As Jenna Golden, Twitter’s head of political advertising sales wrote in a blog post announcing the news, this is an effective way “for campaigns to execute tailored digital fundraising, in real time, on the platform where Americans are already talking about the 2016 election and the issues they are passionate about.” This move is not just significant for campaigns, but also of course for Square and Twitter, which Dorsey has been running side by side since taking over as interim-CEO of Twitter earlier this year. Despite recent calls for him to be chosen as the permanent CEO of Twitter, in June Twitter’s board made it fairly clear that they would allow that to happen if, and only if, he stepped down at Square.

In a lengthy post detailing his plans today, the former governor advocated for increased government surveillance, writing, “The National Security Agency and Cyber Command are on the front lines of defending the United States against cyberthreats. We must stop demonizing these quiet intelligence professionals and start giving them the tools they need.” But Bush is light on details as to what those tools would be. Insert much gnashing of teeth by American tech companies and privacy advocates here. In the post-Edward Snowden era, tech giants like Apple and Microsoft have become increasingly vocal about the need to protect user data from the prying eyes of the government. Meanwhile, privacy experts have panned proposed legislation like the CISA Security Bill, insisting that it creates too many surveillance loopholes for the government. Bush, on the other hand, argues in his new proposal that the President should push Senate Democrats who oppose the bill “to allow this bill to come to the Senate floor for a vote.” Bush is likely all too aware of the reaction these suggestions might receive from the tech world. That may explain why he also included a promise that seems out of place in a plan about cybersecurity: to “remove barriers to innovation in the tech industry.” This appears to be Bush’s way of softening the blow from the rest of his platform. Bush is far from alone in this approach to cybersecurity. During last month’s Republican debates, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina emphasized the importance of tearing down the so-called “cyberwalls” that tech companies put up to protect themselves from government requests for data. And new Jersey governor Chris Christie and Florida Senator Marco Rubio have also called for increased intelligence capabilities. For privacy concerned technologists in search of a conservative candidate, at least there’s always Rand Paul. Go Back to Top.

John McAfee Brian Finke Update: 9:19 am ET 09/09/2015 Several hours after this story was published, John McAfee filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for President. He also launched an official campaign website. If you didn’t think the 2016 election season could get any more batshit crazy than it already is, now, John McAfee—the self-described “eccentric millionaire,” who founded the anti-virus software company McAfee, and who once played Russian roulette with a loaded gun while WIRED writer Joshua Davis stood by—says he is considering joining the 2016 presidential race. But first, he says he’s hoping to persuade someone who is “smarter and more charismatic” than he is to run with his backing. “I personally am still in a quandary about whether to run myself or find someone else for my party,” McAfee tells WIRED. “My advisors are pressing me to run.” McAfee, who won’t name his advisors or his prospects for stand-ins, says he’s been mulling a run for some time at the urging of his online followers. “I have many thousands of emails saying please run for President,” he says. “It’s not something I would just choose to do on my own.” But McAfee says he does believe the government is broken, largely because its leaders don’t understand technology as well as, well, he does. He points to the recent hacks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security as proof. “Things like this cannot happen or should not happen,” he says. “It’s clear that the leadership of our country is illiterate on the fundamental technology that supports everything in life for us now, that is cyber science, our smartphones, our military hardware, our communications.” McAfee argues that the fact that the government is urging tech companies like Apple to create so-called “backdoors” into their systems that would allow the government to collect information on users is another sign that public servants just don’t get it. “That means allowing hackers easy access to anybody’s data,” he says. The prospect of a President John McAfee may sound absurd to you. If it doesn’t, please recall that McAfee was once arrested in Guatemala after fleeing Belize, where he was wanted for questioning by local police for the murder of his neighbor. No charges were brought against him in the murder case, but McAfee’s backstory is still a tad colorful for politics, even in the age of Trump. Yet the privacy arguments he’s making aren’t altogether unlike the ones that Apple and other tech companies have been lobbying for in Congress. Like Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who is running for president to push an agenda for campaign finance reform, McAfee seems far more concerned with having his voice heard on one particular issue than with taking a seat in the Oval Office. Which may explain why McAfee is seeking a stand-in for his presidential run. He also said he didn’t want to discuss other elements of his platform until he, er, knows whether he or someone else is going to be candidate. That announcement should come within the next 48 hours, according to McAfee. As for whether Donald Trump’s surprising popularity had anything to do with his presidential ambitions, McAfee said, “I have great respect for the man but he has nothing to do with my decision to run.” Go Back to Top.

But it is pretty generic and, as far as logomarks go, not that adaptable. How on Earth will he ever get that banner on an app button for mobile? Here’s an idea, from astute design observer Matthew Gordon in Boulder, Colo.: why not just co-opt Obama’s campaign logo and make it his own? The Obama logo, designed before the 2008 campaign by Sol Sender, depicts a new sun rising over rolling hills—a symbol of new beginnings and American optimism. If you just flip it upside down and paint it orange, though, you have a symbol of Trump himself—wispy golden mane and all. Sure, it’s a narcissistic logo for a presidential campaign. And yes, the idea is rife with copyright protection issues. But unconventional antics haven’t bothered Trump before. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Hillary for America Today, there will be no throwback photos of Bill or selfies with Kim Kardashian gracing Hillary Clinton’s Instagram account. Instead, the presidential hopeful’s 238,000 followers will get a glimpse inside a day in the life of Texan native Rusean Pieternelle, who will be taking over Clinton’s Instagram account throughout the day. The Insta-stunt is meant to highlight the importance of Clinton’s so-called New College Compact, which aims to drive down the cost of higher education through, among other things, federal and state investment. According to a Clinton aide, “Pieternelle was chosen to operate the account because his experience coincides with Clinton’s focus on college affordability as a key part of her economic agenda.” Pieternelle is a father of two, who went back to school at the age of 30 to expand his career options. “It’s always a choice between getting the experience to move forward but taking a pay cut, or staying put to try to make enough and pay off debt,” Pieternelle writes in a post that will go up later today. Clinton’s college affordability plan includes a call for scholarships and child care for student parents like Pieternelle. This is just one of many examples of candidates experimenting with using Instagram in what is sure to be the most photographed election season in history. Earlier this week, Bobby Jindal began running political ads on the platform, and Instagram reports there are ads running from prospective candidates from both sides of the aisle, though it did not disclose who. But while this is Clinton’s first Instagram takeover, her campaign has handed over the keys to one of her social media account’s before. In May, a business owner named Mary Jo Brown took over Clinton’s Twitter feed for the day, as a way of highlighting Clinton’s small business platform. Hi there! I’m Mary Jo—a mom, small business owner, and Granite Stater—and I’m taking over this Twitter account today. Welcome to Portsmouth! — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 21, 2015 Go Back to Top.

But a new report from a group that tracks ad spending shows that digital ads may soon play just as important a role for political campaigns. In 2016, political ad spending will reach a record high of $11.4 billion, 20 percent more than was spent back in 2012, according to Borrell Associates, a research firm. It’s a huge jump, but what’s more notable is just how that money will be spent. About $1 billion will be spent on digital media, a nearly 5,000 percent increase from the measly $22.25 million spent on digital ads back in 2008. And that’s only the beginning. According to the report, spending on digital media by the time of the 2020 presidential election cycle will explode to nearly $3.3 billion dollars. That will still trail the current $8.5 billion spent on broadcast television but not by nearly as much. More than half of the $1 billion budget in 2016 will be spent targeting social media sites, the report predicts. But even with such huge growth, these figures show just how far behind the political world is compared to the private sector. As the report notes, $1 billion is still roughly 9.5 percent of campaigns’ overall advertising budgets. In other industries, digital media often accounts for 30 to 50 percent of the money spent on ads. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 online advertising Skip Social.

Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has agreed to hand over her private email server to the FBI for examination after government investigators claim that two emails that passed through it contained classified information. That info referenced satellite images and electronic communications, according to the Washington Post, and was reportedly found in emails originating from the CIA. Although the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency says the information was classified, a State Department spokesman disputed this, saying that the top-secret designation was merely a recommendation and that the CIA information had not been marked classified at the time the emails were distributed. What’s more, the official said, State Department staffers had “circulated these e-mails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011″ before some of them were forwarded to Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. The public learned in March that Clinton had maintained a private email server from her New York home during her tenure as secretary of state throughout President Obama’s first term in office. “I saw it as a matter of convenience,” she said at the time. Because she couldn’t send personal emails on her government-issued phone, she set up the server using clintonemail.com as the domain to conduct personal correspondence. Clinton has been accused by Republican lawmakers of using the server to hide her activity as secretary and bypass public records requests. She resisted handing over the server in March saying that it contained personal correspondence with her husband, former President Bill Clinton. “I believe I have met all of my responsibilities, and the server will remain private,” she told reporters in March. She did, however, turn over two thumb drives to the State Department containing about 30,000 emails that she said held work-related information. It was among a sampling of about 40 of these emails that investigators say they found the two emails containing classified information. The two thumb drives will now be turned over to the FBI for examination, along with the email server. Go Back to Top.

Jimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Sipa USA/AP Harvard Law School professor Larry Lessig has announced a pretty bonkers plan to extract big money from politics, and it might involve him running for president. You know, if no one better comes along. I've launched the committee to explore a run to be a referendum president. Read all about it: http://t.co/iXiScrVSpJ — Lessig (@lessig) August 11, 2015 By “referendum president,” Lessig means a president that runs on one issue and one issue only. In this case, the issue is campaign finance reform. Last year, Lessig launched a Super PAC called Mayday PAC that backed candidates who supported these reforms. Now, he’s taking that idea one step further. It’ll work like this: Lessig is asking the public to contribute to a crowdfunding campaign to end what Lessig calls a “rigged system.” If the campaign raises $1 million by Labor Day, and if none of the Democratic candidates agree to make campaign finance reform a core issue in their campaigns, then Lessig will run for president. If he wins, he promises to serve for as long as it takes to pass reforms, before handing the reigns over to his vice president. “No doubt, there should be someone better than me,” he says in the video—a phrase that has most certainly never been uttered in a presidential campaign announcement video. “This campaign is not about a person. It’s about a principle—an American principle that we must reclaim.” This campaign isn’t really about winning the presidency, either. Instead, it’s about bringing the issue of corporate involvement in government to the forefront. “Until it is fixed,” Lessig says, “no sensible reform is even possible.” Check out Lessig’s full video below: Go Back to Top.

But during the first Republican debate in Cleveland tonight, the candidates fought not about increasing the number of troops and tanks on the ground, but about how to enhance the country’s cyber security. It started off with Carly Fiorina—widely considered the winner of the night’s earlier debate for the lower-polling GOP contenders—calling for companies to tear down the so-called “cyberwalls” that prevent the government from accessing data from companies like Google and Apple. Fiorina argued that these barriers make it difficult for security agencies to “connect the dots” around potential risks. “I certainly support that we need to tear down cyberwalls,” Fiorina said, “not on a mass basis but on a targeted basis.” And while ISIS was certainly positioned as enemy No. 1 throughout the debate, candidates also discussed recent hacks allegedly carried out by Russia and China as a key threats to national security. During the second debate for the top ten contenders, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said these attacks amounted to acts of cyberwar. Meanwhile, the most talked-about moment of the night, according to Facebook’s data, was when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul faced off over the issue of government surveillance. MUST WATCH! @RandPaul and @ChrisChristie get into a HEATED debate over the collection people’s records #GOPdebate https://t.co/doLjSdUKLH — FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) August 7, 2015 While Paul stood his ground as a diehard opponent of government collection of public records, Christie said his experience as US Attorney of New Jersey in the aftermath of September 11th convinced him of the importance of surveillance. As president, Christie said he would push to provide even more tools to these agencies. No matter where the candidates stood, one thing was clear: cyber security is the new national security.

Black Friday 2016 TV Deals Frequent Flier Miles Are Kaput—The Game's About Credit Cards Now 9 Tonight’s GOP presidential debate was heavy on incendiary comments from Donald Trump but low on memes. There was, however, one glimmer of hope: the forthcoming fake Chris Christie smooth jazz album. During an exchange with Sen. Rand Paul about bulk collection of phone records under the Patriot Act, the New Jersey governor defended himself against Paul’s comment that he gave President Obama “a big hug” by saying, “You know, Sen. Paul, the hugs that I remember are the ones I gave to the families who lost their people on Sept. 11.” Soon after the exchange, comedian Patton Oswalt asked the Internet to turn The Hugs that I Remember into a smooth jazz album. Naturally, the Internet delivered. Check out the best offerings above.

There will be liveblogs. There will be thinkpieces. It’s the GOP debate tonight—and everyone on the Internet will have a whole lot to say. One more way to weigh in: The Washington Post is inviting anyone on the Internet to annotate the numbers, the zingers, the truths, and the lies that make their way onto the permanent record. The Post is working with Genius (formerly Rap Genius) to let readers annotate the running transcript of the debate published on the venerable newspaper’s site. Genius will provide the tech overlay that will allow anyone to highlight, annotate, and comment on the words of Trump, Bush, Cruz, and the debate’s seven other participants. “We’re hoping for a civil, constructive discussion,” Cory Haik, the Post’s executive director of emerging news products, says. The Post’s reporters will be adding their own fact-checking and commentary to the transcript, as well. Real Genius This isn’t the first time the Post has run transcripts alongside major political events. “They do really well for us, particularly on social and search traffic,” Haik says. But while in the past the Post has spent the night post-debate poring over the record, tonight they’ll do it in near real-time with the help of the crowd. “It’s cool to read the primary source with the added level of information,” says Ilan Zechory, Genius’ co-founder and president. As with the lyrics that Genius was first launched to annotate, commentators will be able to pull out the “hidden messages, meanings, lies, and exaggerations” that will saturate the debate, Zechory says. To be sure, the Post will be moderating annotations to ensure that they meet the site’s standards of decency. However, it’s up to Genius’ system to determine, which comments get shown and how. Zechory says Genius offers a kind of “upvote” system to highlight the best content when possibly thousands of users will be weighing in at wants. Genius also prioritizes verified users, such as Post reporters or politicians who might chime in. “As a political junkie,” Zechory says, “I’m excited to watch the carnival.” Go Back to Top.

But its latest political ad, which launched today, is just plain bizarre. It’s also completely genius … in an evil kind of way. Sponsored by an organization called Secure America Now, a conservative foreign policy nonprofit, the ad appears to users not as a video, but as a filter—the decals Snapchat users can slap on a photo or video before sending it. Framed by that filter, users are supposed to take a picture that reflects how they feel “about the bad Iran deal.” @PeterKoltak pic.twitter.com/rdfJop2Y4o — Mike (@thekevkoltak) August 6, 2015 Weird, right? Snapchat is full of kids and isn’t known as a hub of discussion on international relations. But the genius here is that the filter gives all those fresh-faced young ‘uns a reason to become the ad—and to spread it by broadcasting the message to their friends. Snapchat has been running other video campaign ads this election season, but the Iran deal ad is the first in filter form. It’s only available to users in Ohio in advance of tonight’s debate in Cleveland. And, according to Vincent Harris, the consultant who designed the campaign for Secure America Now, it’s already being used “more heavily than I even expected it to be.” “Snapchat is the primary source of information for a lot of younger voters,” Harris says. “So it’s the best way to actually educate younger voters about large issues like this.” Of course, not everyone is happy with Snapchat over what they perceive as the platform taking sides. That, or, you know, they just don’t care all that much about Iran. Hey snapchat, idgaf about the Bad Iran Deal — B-rad (@bradkeener82) August 6, 2015 (Translation.) Go Back to Top.

So Should the GOP If Facebook users—which is to say, most of us—had their way, the GOP candidates taking the stage during the debate tonight would have an honest and open conversation about race. And also, they’d all ride into Cleveland on winged unicorns. That type of discussion is, of course, unlikely, but according to new data released by Facebook today, race relations were the most talked-about political issue on the site during the period between May 29th and July 28th of this year. In second place was Mexico, followed by the economy, LGBT issues, and immigration. The rankings are based on how many posts, likes, shares, and comments these topics have received. Facebook, which is co-sponsoring the debates with Fox, provides the network with this data, but that doesn’t mean the moderators will adjust their questions accordingly. Still, they might be wise to. With hundreds of millions of daily active users in the US, Facebook has become a new barometer of public sentiment. And while the Republican candidates have been more than willing to share their thoughts on marriage equality, the economy, and immigration, race is one topic that—with a few exceptions—they’ve skirted almost entirely. It’s no wonder, then, that a discussion on race is precisely what the public craves. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. election 2016 race Republican debate Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images Airbnb pushed into Cuba back in April, shortly after President Obama announced the start of normalized relations with the Latin American country. And now, Hillary Clinton wants other tech companies to follow. Today, during a speech at Miami’s Florida International University, the former Secretary of State made a case for ending the long-standing embargo with Cuba, arguing that by isolating the country, America is “strengthening the Castro’s grip on power, rather than weakening it.” And she made it clear that the Internet, and tech companies at large, have an important role to play in ending that isolation. As Clinton noted, only about 5 percent of Cubans have access to the open Internet. “We should make it clear, as I did as Secretary of State, that the freedom to connect is a basic human right, and therefore do more to extend that freedom to more and more Cubans,” Clinton said. She called on businesses to build joint ventures with Cuban companies and find ways to expand operations there. “I’m told that Airbnb is already getting started,” Clinton said, noting that Google and Twitter “are exploring opportunities, as well.” Go Back to Top.

Illegal. No ifs, ands, or buts about it,” he said. In New Hampshire, this stance was met with a round of applause. But fear not, tokers. Given the growing support of recreational and medical marijuana throughout the U.S., these threats aren’t likely to give the New Jersey Governor’s already weak polling numbers a boost.

Needed a quick explainer on this #Sharknado3 thing @mcuban http://t.co/MfXqQBelbw — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) July 24, 2015 In a new video, released by his campaign as part of a series called #JebNoFilter, the Republican candidate describes turning on the TV in his hotel to find a shark-infested world in which Ann Coulter plays Vice President to Mark Cuban’s President. “And then I find out, this is the third version of this,” Bush says in a video that appears to have been recorded on a smartphone. “Please help me. Give me some information on what’s going on. I’m culturally illiterate, apparently.” We know just how you feel, Jeb. And that’s the point. This clever campaign move is what we like to call the Mitt effect. It’s pretty widely agreed that Mitt Romney was never more likable than he was in the post-election Netflix documentary Mitt, which captured the Republican candidate when he wasn’t just shaking hands and kissing babies. For Romney, though, it was too late. Now, the Republican party is loading up on the #nofilter moments early. A bit corny, yes, but bless their little hearts for trying. Go Back to Top.

In a Facebook Q&A later in the day, the Democratic candidate responded to McConnell’s comment, arguing, “There is a gender card being played in this campaign. It’s played every time Republicans vote against giving women equal pay, deny families access to affordable child care or family leave, refuse to let women make decisions about their health or have access to free contraception. These aren’t just women’s issues, they are economic issues that drive growth and affect all Americans.” Clinton’s savvy social media team then took that idea one step further, tweeting out a picture of a card that delineates all of those policy changes, accompanied by a new hashtag: #gendercard. If Sen. McConnell thinks fighting for women and families is playing the "gender card"—okay.

That unemployment rate is especially high among young black and Hispanic people. Training plays a role in helping people secure those jobs, but Clinton said we must also ensure that even as technology eliminates the need for some jobs, there are enough new ones to take their place. “The best antipoverty program is a job, but that’s hard to say if there aren’t enough jobs for people to help lift themselves out of poverty,” Clinton said. To increase the number of available jobs, the former Secretary of State laid out a plan to offer businesses $1,500 in tax credits for every employee they hire and train. Go Back to Top.

That was Hillary Clinton’s message to supporters in a speech on economic policy today in New York City. Clinton described a movement of women into the workforce that has effectively stalled in recent years. In the past, she noted, the United States ranked 7th among 24 country in terms of the number of women in the workforce. By 2014, however, the U.S. had dropped to 19th. “We can’t afford to leave talent on the sidelines, but thats exactly what we’re doing today,” she said. “We not only shortchange [women] and their dreams, but we shortchange our country and our future.” Clinton attributed this decline to the fact that other countries have adopted policies to support working mothers, like affordable child care and paid family leave. This was not the first time Clinton has argued for these family friendly policies as economic drivers, and as her campaign continues, you can be fairly confident it won’t be the last. Clinton also decried the “outrage” of women, particularly women of color, making substantially less than their male counterparts in the same jobs. “For far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women’s issues,” Clinton said. “Well, those days are over.” Go Back to Top.

Andrew Burton/Getty Images Add Hillary Clinton to the list of labor advocates coming after the gig economy. In her first major speech outlining her economic platform today at New York City’s New School, the Democratic presidential candidate vowed to crack down on “bosses misclassifying workers as contractors.” The promise follows a wave of legal action that’s been taken against companies like Uber recently, which argue that drivers should be compensated as employees. Clinton, who emphasized the need to raise wages throughout her speech, said that businesses that allow people to make extra money by renting a spare room or driving their own car can often threaten solid labor practices. “This on demand or so-called gig economy is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation,” she said, “but it’s also raising hard questions about workplace protection and what a good job will look like in the future.” Go Back to Top.

By Brooke Crothers Published August 12, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Customers stand in line at the Apple store in Berlin, as they wait to buy the newly released iPhone 6 September 19, 2014.  (REUTERS/Hannibal ) While the upcoming iPhone 7 is expected to have some welcome improvements, the iPhone that Apple is planning for 2017 could be really different. First, let’s review what’s expected for the iPhone 7. Two recent reports from Bloomberg lay out a lot of the details. It’s expected to debut at an Apple event less than a month from now on September 7, but be physically similar to the iPhone 6/6s, a design first introduced in September of 2014. That means Apple will break from its past practice of doing a physical makeover every two years. The iPhone 7’s improvements and changes are expected to include a dual-camera system (possibly similar to Huawei’s P9 smartphone) on one model, a redesigned pressure-sensitive home button, and no headphone jack. Headphones would be connected via the charging port or Bluetooth. Wait for the iPhone 8? The iPhone 8 should be the device that moves Apple into the future. It may not be a coincidence that 2017 will be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. So, it's conceivable that Apple is waiting for that date to bring out an overhauled iPhone. So far, speculation points to a 2017 iPhone that could be based on a glass body, according to a report this week from Nikkei, Japan’s largest business newspaper. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Nikkei reported. That glass casing could be made by Apple manufacturing partner Foxconn, Nikkei said, citing a source with knowledge of Apple component suppliers in Taiwan. "Foxconn has been trying [to develop a] glass chassis since last year," Nikkei quoted the source as saying. Related: Is the iPad Pro the future of laptops? Apple thinks so 'iPhone 7' rumor roundup: Better camera, no headphone jack? I've used Apple Watch for one year. Here's what I think But probably the most stunning part of the redesign would be the rumored move from the current LCD (liquid crystal) display to an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, which is a rumor repeated by Nikkei. That would theoretically enable Apple to revamp the iPhone’s physical look-and-feel and— as one possibility— offer a curved display with higher resolution and more vibrant colors. A major redesign along those lines is practically necessary for Apple because Samsung already offers the highly-praised Galaxy S7 Edge with an OLED display that's curved along the two lengthwise edges of the phone. That gives Samsung a clear technological advantage over Apple. “Right now, the Galaxy Note 7 is far more advanced than what Apple offers and, my bet, more advanced than what the iPhone 7 will offer,” Todd Haselton, a writer for tech media site TechoBuffalo, told Foxnews.com in an email. “Several rumors have suggested Apple is moving toward an OLED display next year, which will be a good first step [toward closing the gap],” he added. Apple could also combine hardware improvements with new software and services, Rushabh Doshi, an analyst with market researcher Canalys, told FoxNews.com. "We expect Apple to focus strongly on service innovation. Artificial Intelligence would take center stage in the coming years as the smart phone becomes a true ‘assistant’ to the user," Doshi said. "[The] recent acquisition of Turi continues to underline the importance of AI for Apple," Doshi said. Neither Apple nor Foxconn would comment on the Nikkei report.

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back.

But why now? Credit Photograph by Robin Beckham / BEEPstock / Alamy Ads can seem like the bane of the Internet. They take up real estate and slow Web pages while they load; at worst, they splash across the screen for interminable seconds, shout loudly and unexpectedly from an invisible corner, or surreptitiously infest the host computer with malware. Around two hundred million users worldwide have tools to block these ads and prevent them from loading, according to reports from the ad-blocking-circumvention startup PageFair. Blocking ads, however, also keeps the Web sites you read from making money. And so, typically, sites try to earn back this business with appeals to visitors’ empathy: they ask you to please “white-list” the site and let it stay in business. Other sites go so far as to block their content entirely when they detect that an ad-blocking tool has been enabled. Sites including Wired, GQ, and Forbes have used one or more of these strategies to re-monetize readers who were blocking ads. (If you use an ad blocker while visiting newyorker.com, the slots usually filled by ads will contain messages encouraging you to subscribe, which my editors suggest you should do.) It should be noted that ad blockers do nothing to guard against—and perhaps even encourage—other forms of advertising, such as “sponsored content”—articles, photos, or videos that look similar to a given Web site’s content, but are commissioned by advertisers. On Tuesday, Facebook, which has 1.7 billion users, announced that it’s taking this battle even further, in a way that only it can: with the latest version of its Web site, at least on desktop computers, Facebook cheekily defangs blockers entirely and serves its ads exactly where they would have been blocked. The Times claims that Facebook’s site changes will make it much more difficult for ad-blocking tools to identify ads, and that re-blocking them after they’ve been re-served would require a resource-intensive analysis of the ads themselves. Wired noted that makers of the ad-blocking tools are already at work on a counterattack. (Facebook reported that it rolled out the changes on Tuesday, but at the time of this writing, Adblock Plus was still able to eliminate both sidebar ads and sponsored posts in the news feed. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the new version of its site has fully rolled out yet.) Facebook has a strong incentive to end ad blocking; it makes money on ad revenue. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company noted that ad blockers posed a significant threat to its business. Neutering the blockers would mean protecting its top line. But ad-blocking software has been available for quite some time. The question remains: Why has the backlash cropped up now? To understand Facebook’s motivation, it helps to revisit Apple’s mobile ad blockers, which the company introduced last year. Apple’s mobile ad blockers, which have earned a lot of attention, work only on Safari’s mobile browser. But Apple’s entire mobile platform is built on closed-system apps, not Web-based sites. Ads served within these apps cannot be blocked by anything, not even Apple’s own ad blockers. So, by blocking Web-based ads, Apple’s move would, in theory, drive businesses away from the open mobile Web, where the future of advertising is shaky, and toward apps, where there are fewer business variables. It’s not a coincidence, either, that Apple makes money from apps through both sales and advertising, while it earns nothing from its mobile browser. What was true of Apple then is even more true of Facebook now. Over the last few years, Facebook has seen rapid growth within its mobile app, where blockers don’t work and it can easily control the ad experience in the same way that Apple can control the app experience. This means that features of advertising that frustrate readers are gone (malware, surprise screen takeovers, unexpected noise), but some of it is still very much there (tracking, data collection). Facebook has now shut down ad blockers on nearly all of its domain—first on mobile apps and now on desktops. (Blocking still works on the mobile Web.) This suggests to publishers that Facebook is a safe space where the business of content can be more effectively protected, on the condition that they submit to being Facebook’s vassals. Individual publications, and even some publishers, lack the resources to mount an all-out arms race against ad blockers, not least because they’re unlikely to attract engineering talent when there are so many startups and established tech companies plying potential hires with equity—or at least free meals. Facebook’s ability to protect its revenue stream on the desktop version of its site only strengthens its position as a closed platform, a place where the user is powerless against its technical domination and will be gently served ads, whether they like it or not. This makes it an extremely safe bet as a place for brands to publish content. Instant Articles, while not yet a success, got a deluge of publishers on board because the model seemed straightforward, reliable, and immune to ad-block tampering. It helps that Facebook gives a good home to sponsored placements within its news feed. Publishers are safe there, sort of, for now, although they are also subject to Facebook’s semi-yearly whims, which vacillate between favoring the latest Facebook product (embedded links, videos, news, live streams) and the posts of users’ closest friends and family, as determined by its algorithms. Facebook is still only one platform, but its cavalier attitude suggests the détente between ad blockers and Web properties is coming to an end.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Editorials Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Editorials Sat, Aug 13, 2016 - Page 9　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Once taunted by Jobs, companies are now big Apple customers Apple’s former rival IBM has become one of its biggest boosters, developing more than 100 business-oriented apps using Apple’s iOS that it has sold to about 2,000 companies By Vindu Goel  /  NY Times News Service, SAN FRANCISCO Illustration: Kevin Sheu In the primordial days of computing, IBM machines were so common inside corporations that there was a running joke in the industry: Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM. These days, the same could be said about Apple. Even IBM is promoting Apple gear. Apple’s iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets. For Apple, which is struggling to reverse declining sales of its iPhones and Macs and has seen overall revenues drop for two quarters in a row, the corporate market is a surprising bright spot. Sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong. About half of all iPads are now bought by corporations and governments, according to the research firm Forrester. “Apple is stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers,” said Frank Gillett, an industry analyst at Forrester. It is a long way from the days when Steve Jobs, Apple’s cofounder and longtime chief executive, derided corporate technology buyers as “orifices” and preferred to focus on building great products that would sell themselves. Pinpointing exact figures for Apple’s corporate sales is difficult. Apple said growth was strong, but declined to disclose recent numbers. During its last fiscal year, which ended in September last year, Apple said it sold US$25 billion in products and services to companies and other large customers. While that was only about 11 percent of the company’s overall revenue, those business sales were up 40 percent from the previous year. That is compared with 28 percent growth for the entire business. Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces. Aiding Apple’s corporate sales has been a concern that phones and tablets running Google’s Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want. For British Airways, which has built more than 40 custom iPad apps for its workforce, switching to tablets has eliminated reams of paper used for flight plans, passenger manifests and maintenance records. Another app allows anyone at the airline to grab an iPad and quickly rebook passengers when a flight is canceled or weather wreaks havoc on schedules. “We can get to customers wherever they are,” said Abigail Comber, who is in charge of the customer experience at the airline. “It’s technology that’s very intuitive. What the team has managed to do brilliantly is take away everything that happens on the back end.” The carrier has so far deployed its apps across 17,000 iPads, and is looking to digitize even more of its business. Apple said it is focused on creating great devices — for all customers. “We’re dedicated to building products that make people’s lives better, often in ways that we couldn’t have even imagined, enabling them to do things that they have never done before,” Susan Prescott, vice president of worldwide product marketing, markets and applications, said in a statement. “Our goal with business customers is the same — to enable them to do something great with mobile and truly modernize and transform their business.” 1 2 3 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2203 times.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Aug 13, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Quanta forecasts better 2H on new product launches By Lauly Li  /  Staff reporter Quanta Computer chairman Barry Lam, left, speaks at an investors’ conference in Taoyuan yesterday. Photo: CNA Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) expects its business in the second half of this year to outpace the first half, supported by the upcoming launch of new wearable devices and notebook computers for a major US client, company executives said yesterday. “The client is ready to launch their new products... Performance in the second half is expected to grow from the first half,” Quanta chairman Barry Lam (林百里) told a news conference ahead of an investors’ conference. Quanta, the world’s largest contract notebook maker, is the main supplier for Apple Inc’s MacBooks and the sole supplier for its Apple Watch. It is widely speculated that Apple will introduce its new smartwatch and notebook devices this fall. Quanta vice chairman C.C. Leung (梁次震) said seasonal demand would also help boost shipments of Quanta products in the second half, despite uncertainties in the global economy, with notebook shipments likely to expand 10 percent from 19 million units in the first half. Xiaomi Corp (小米) has also joined the notebook market, adding more pressure on existing players, but Leung said he expects a limited impact on Quanta as Xiaomi mainly focuses on the Chinese market. However, the sharp appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the US dollar this quarter pressured the company’s operations, Leung said, adding that the firm will do its best to hedge foreign exchange risks. Quanta’s net income rose 3.8 percent from NT$3.37 billion (US$107.31 million) a year ago to NT$3.5 billion last quarter. The figure indicates a quarterly decline of 3.2 percent due to seasonal factors, the company said. Gross margin reached 5.24 percent, up from last year’s 4.37 percent and the prior quarter’s 4.98 percent, marking the company’s highest gross margin since the third quarter of 2009, according to Quanta’s filings with the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Operating margin improved by 0.22 percentage points both annually and quarterly to 2 percent last quarter, company data showed. In the first half of this year, Quanta’s combined net income totaled NT$7.11 billion, up slightly by 1 percent from last year’s NT$7.04 billion. This story has been viewed 1422 times.

The unit is Apple MFi Approved and has a slot that takes standard Micro SD Memory cards. Traditionally Apple MFi approved iFlashDrives have only had internal memory, with an Apple Lightning adapter on one side and a standard USB adapter on the other. The i-FlashDrive CR8600, has an Apple Lightning adapter and a standard Micro SD Card can slide into it. Gigastone President Michel Hassan says one big advantage is that data residing on a Micro SD Card can easily be accessed from an iPhone or iPad without having to copy the data onto the iPhone. Photos, videos and music files, usually too large to store on an iDevice, can easily be viewed or accessed using the Gigastone CR8600 iPhone Flash Drive Micro SD Card Reader, he adds.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Microsoft Is Most Innovative Place To Work Says Study Posted: Aug 12 2016, 9:58am CDT | by IANS, in News | Latest Business News   Photo Credit: Getty Images   Microsoft's employees are more innovative than Apple's, and Facebook's staff are less creative than most tech workers, says a study led by Indian-origin entrepreneur. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals The findings showed that Facebook lags behind the others in cultivating a culture of creativity. Microsoft employees are more innovative than those at Apple. "The study data tell us that in terms of adventurousness, Microsoft employees tend to be neck-and-neck with Apple's, and much more adventurous than Google, Facebook, or IBM employees," Samar Birwadker, Founder and CEO of Good&CO, was quoted as saying to fastcompany.com on Friday. As a result of being among the first social media platforms on the Internet, Facebook may be considered among the most innovative companies in the world. However, its early successes have resulted in a more conservative effort to sustain them. "They have (Facebook) always had that reputation [of being innovative], and I think that now becomes a subconscious thing, that Facebook is innovative, but the current place they are in as a business doesn't require them to personally be innovative," Birwadker said. "They (Facebook) invented social networks, and there's always been this layer of innovation," Birwadker explained adding, "but with more pressure on revenue, and especially on mobile and advertisements, I think we are seeing a lot less risk taking and adventurousness by their employees." On the other hand, Microsoft is often perceived as less innovative, because the more established tech giant has lagged behind the growth of its competitors. Microsoft has always made a lot of money doing things the right, traditional, organized way, the study said. "But with the success of social platforms and companies like Google Microsoft realized that they need to focus on consumer first, whereas they have always been B2B," Birwadker stated, pointing out that with the arrival of Microsoft's latest CEO, Satya Nadella in 2014, this wave of innovative energy started. Although the giants of the technology industry have a lock on employer branding by their quirky hiring practices, free food, and other perks that make work "fun", the analysis of the personalities of their staffs presents a different picture. Companies like IBM, Facebook and Google aren't necessarily providing the working atmosphere that is reflected in their recruiting materials, the study showed. "You can't have 10 people in a boardroom deciding what the culture of the company is. It is defined by the people who already work there," Birwadker noted, revealing that employees who discover that their company culture is different than advertised are more likely to leave. In the study, published by Good&Co, the team analyzed the psychometric data gained from anonymous personality quizzes completed by 4,364 tech employees of what they believe are perceived as the five most innovative companies in Silicon Valley: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and IBM. In total, the two-year-long study also analyzed 10 million responses from 2,50,000 users. Questions ranged from thoughts and feelings about networking to how they handle problems at work.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 7:45 am Fri Aug 12, 2016 How a digital-only smartphone opens the door to DRM (and how to close the door) From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Fast Company's Mark Sullivan asked me to explain what could happen if Apple went through with its rumored plans to ship a phone with no analog sound outputs, only digital ones -- what kind of DRM badness might we expect to emerge? report this ad Start by understanding this: copyright lets you do a lot of stuff without permission (and even against the wishes) of rightsholders. For example, it let Apple launch the Ipod and Itunes, both of which were bitterly denounced by the record industry at their launch -- as far as they were concerned, "Rip, Mix, Burn" was an invitation to piracy, and Apple was wrong to encourage this behavior. But because copyright has limits -- fair use, and the limits on copyrightability itself -- Apple was able to revolutionize music. Enter the DMCA: in 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Section 1201 of which says that breaking DRM, even to accomplish those legal activities that lead to so much improvement and innovation in the entertainment industry (like Itunes and Ipods and Iphones) is illegal. This matters a lot. The Supreme Court told us that the only way copyright -- a government-issued monopoly over the utterance of certain words, sounds and images -- can square up with the First Amendment is through those limits on copyright: fair use and copyrightabaility's limitations. Then the Supreme Court repeated this. That's part of the basis of EFF's lawsuit to invalidate Section 1201 of the DMCA. Until we win that case, though, any digital interface with a thin scrim of DRM on it becomes a copyright no-go zone. Bypassing the DRM opens you up to felony prosecution and punishing civil penalties. That's why, if you have a CD you want to play on your Iphone, Apple provides software that automatically rips the music and seamlessly moves it to your device. But if you have a DVD -- the same kind of disc, but with a creaking DRM that was broken more than a decade ago -- Apple will invite you to buy that movie again on Itunes. The DRM on DVDs has kept them stuck in the 1990s, while the music on CDs has roared into the 21st century. Once all the audio coming out of an Iphone is digital -- once there's no analog output -- Apple gets a lot more options about how it can relate to its competitors, and they're all good for Apple and bad for Apple's customers. Just by wrapping that audio in DRM, Apple gets a veto over which of your devices can connect to your phone. They can arbitrarily withhold permission to headphone manufacturers, insist that mixers be designed with no analog outputs, or even demand that any company that makes an Apple-compatible device must not make that device compatible with Apple's competitors, so home theater components that receive Apple signals could be pressured to lock out Samsung's signals, or Amazon's. What's more, once Apple gets the ability to add DRM, the record industry gets the ability to insist that Apple use it ("A phaser on the mantelpiece in Act One must go off by Act 3" - Pavel Chekov, Star Trek: TOS). In 2007, Steve Jobs published his Thoughts on Music, in which he said, basically, that the record industry had forced Apple to put DRM in its ecosystem and he didn't like it. The record industry is still made up of the same companies, and they still love DRM. Right now, an insistence on DRM would simply invite the people who wanted to bypass it for legal reasons to use that 3.5mm headphone jack to get at it. Once that jack is gone, there's no legal way to get around the DRM. Perhaps worst of all is the impact on security research: because the DMCA has been used to attack researchers who disclosed defects in DRM-restricted technologies, they are often unable or unwilling to come forward when they discover serious vulnerabilities in technologies that we rely on. The Iphone audio interface is two-way: it supports both input and output. A bug in that interface turns the phone to carry with you at all times, to all places, into a covert listening device. A DRM system on that interface makes that bug all-but-unreportable, guaranteeing that it will last longer and hurt more people before it finally becomes public. All these bad outcomes are drawn from the real, ongoing history of DRM: limiting competitors' access to audio to ratchet up prices; limiting users' access to legal features; freezing out competition; cartel-like consortia who conspire with the entertainment companies to prevent new competitors from entering the market with desirable, legal features that they have agreed to eschew, and long-lived, dangerous bugs. So does this mean that Apple -- and every other device company -- should not make digital audio outputs for its devices? No. It means that if they do, they have to take steps now to prevent the bad outcomes in the future. Merely by asserting that the the digital audio output on an Iphone is not "an effective means of access control" under Section 1201 of the DMCA (and the laws just like it, all around the world), Apple could vaccinate itself against future pathological outcomes -- pressure from the record industry, lapses in its own judgment, wariness by security researchers. But unless it does, then going digital-only for the Iphone is a greased slippery slope that leads straight to the hottest fires of DRM hell. Doctorow says record-industry consortia could gather to make "standards" for DRM-locked audio, as the movie and TV companies have done (with Apple's cooperation) at the W3C. Such standards would let big tech companies (like Apple) interoperate with the music catalogs of the big record industry players. But it might prevent smaller upstart tech companies from doing so. "It would prevent upstarts making new, revolutionary technology from entering the market, because all the audio would be locked with DRM," Doctorow says, "so entering the fold would mean toeing the line, or risking DMCA prosecution." He adds: "I believe that Apple will not be the last company to come up with cool ways to experience, organize, and acquire music. It's natural that Apple would go along with initiatives that would stop the next Apple from launching the next iTunes, because every pirate wants to be an admiral." iPhone's Disappearing Headphone Jack Could Be Cause For Concern [Mark Sullian/Fast Company] (Image: Headphone jack 3.5mm, Jud McCranie, CC-BY-SA) SHARE / TWEET / 36 COMMENTS 1201 / apollo / apple / chekov's law / Copyfight / dmca / drm / music / war on general purpose computing report this ad GET THE BOING BOING NEWSLETTER Car Wars: a dystopian science fiction story about the nightmare of self-driving cars Melbourne’s Deakin University commissioned me to write a science fiction story about the design and regulation of self-driving cars, inspired by my essay about the misapplication of the “Trolley Problem” to autonomous vehicles.

The facility will support Apple’s online services for customers in Europe, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri. “The planning body said the data centre will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centres that need to be connected to the national grid,” reads the report. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall and support buildings. The company wants to build eight data halls on the site over the next 10-15 years but will need to apply for planning permission for each new hall. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data centre. Like Apple’s other facilities, this upcoming data center will be powered by renewable energy. The construction site is located in the town of Athenry in County Galway, in the vicinity of the Athenry Golf Club. Photo: Apple’s official rendering of the facility.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search VW’s SEAT gets first automaker app into Apple’s CarPlay Chris Davies - Aug 12, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit CarPlay may be Apple’s attempt to redress the dashboard in an iOS outfit, but Spanish automaker SEAT has managed to squeeze a little of its own tech into the iPhone-powered infotainment. The company has launched a CarPlay compatible version of its SEAT DriveApp, which allows vehicle data and servicing information to be checked while still within Apple’s interface. That may not sound like a big deal, but so far Apple has proved fairly restrictive about just what third-party apps and content it’ll allow in CarPlay, something which has extended even as far as the manufacturers of the cars themselves. CarPlay lacks a specific App Store of its own, and there is just a small handful of non-Apple software – like Spotify and Pandora – which gets to put an icon on the big-button display. Even automakers, even as they’ve increasingly moved to support CarPlay, have been kept out of the loop. Until now, the most you’d see of the actual vehicle’s systems was a button to exit Apple’s system and jump back into the native infotainment UI. SEAT’s app, though, can be loaded while you’re still within CarPlay, though right now the uses are fairly basic. From DriveApp owners can see their historical usage of the car, distance traveled per month, and current status of things like the fuel tank level, wipers and battery, and when the next service is due. The automaker, which is part of the Volkswagen group, says that the app is already available in Spain and will roll out in due course to all countries where SEAT cars are sold. While that doesn’t mean much for the US specifically, it does represent a turning point for CarPlay in general. While some car companies, like Volvo, have used workarounds to show both CarPlay and their own systems simultaneously – in Volvo’s case, by splitting the large, portrait-aspect touchscreen in cars like the XC90 and S90 into two, one half showing Apple’s system and the other its own – it now looks like we’ll see much smoother integration moving forward. That’s good news for automakers and, presumably, good news for Apple too: the more you can do within CarPlay’s walls, of course, the more time you spend interacting with your iPhone and, so the research theory goes, the safer you are versus using a smartphone in your hand. Back in May, at Google I/O 2016, Hyundai demonstrated how it would put its own apps into Android Auto, Google’s rival system to CarPlay for those with recent Android smartphones.

So when a Danish company realized my weakness for wood, and sent me the Enveo Chestnut Dock, I switched out the FŪZDock to give it a try … Like many of the charging docks on the market, the Enveo one doesn’t include the charging puck itself – you have to provide your own. What you get is a three-piece assembly. The base is metal, painted either white or black. Despite my general fondness for black, the white version is a better match for the white charger you get with the Apple Watch Sport. The front element is chestnut. To anyone who likes the look of wood as much as I do, this was an instant win, aesthetically pleasing and beautifully finished. The combination of wood and white base gives it a simple, modern feel. The final element is a black silicone surround. This makes it easier to insert the charging puck, but it also has a second purpose: it’s replaceable. That means that if you ever change smartwatch, you’d just need to buy a new silicone ring. The company currently offers these for the Pebble Time and the Apple Watch. I can’t personally see myself ever switching out from the Apple Watch, but it’s good to have the option. Regular readers will know that my love of wood is matched only by my distaste for wires, and that’s where the Enveo dock scores another win: the built-in cable management. There’s enough room in the hollow inner to curl up any excess cable length to keep things neat. It has to be said that persuading the curled wire to stay put as you close the casing is a little fiddly, but it shouldn’t be something you need to do often. Once the wooden front is back in place, it is completely solid. Which is the final thing I like about the dock. The metal base gives it enough weight to stay put, without being excessively heavy (the company previously sent me a prototype model which was much heavier). The one thing that may prove a drawback for some is that the dock is quite steeply angled, sitting back about 30 degrees from the vertical. That works fine in nightstand mode given the relative heights of our bed and bedside table, but if your table is significantly higher than your bed, you may find yourself struggling to see the watch face in nightstand mode. The other issue? It’s pretty pricey, at $69. Considering that a genuine Apple charging puck will cost you around forty bucks more, that means the all-in price is a little north of $100 – a fairly stiff addition to the cost of the Watch if you have the Sport model. If you don’t want to spend this kind of money, the FŪZDock is a solid alternative, and there are even a surprising number of charging stands out there for less than $5! But if you like wood and a contemporary design, and are prepared to pay for it, the Enveo gets a thumbs-up from me. The Enveo Chestnut Dock is available for $69 from the company’s website.

Glorious. Training camp is in full swing and we're underway with the preseason. Hope is in the air and preseason heroes and villains are already taking shape. Sterling Shepard is the belle of the ball and Andre Williams is this year's Markus Kuhn. Before we get into the matchup against Miami, I wanted to share some of my thoughts on how training camp has gone so far. I haven't had a chance to visit training camp this year. It's usually an annual occurrence for me, so that's sad. My information comes from the myriad of reporters there, whether it be Jordan Raanan at ESPN, the fellas over at NJ.com, and of course, our very own Ed Valentine and Chris Pflum over at BBV (which I still read EVERY article, by the way). One quick shoutout as well to Emory Hunt, who has been covering the Giants at Football Gameplan. His videos have a TON of highlights/practice plays from every practice, so you can take a good look for yourself at how some of our players are doing. Given this information, here's 20 or so odd thoughts that have been running through my head: 1) I expect Eli Manning to record franchise shattering numbers this year. Typically, these things come in threes, and it's the third year for Manning in Ben McAdoo's system. Combine that with his performances in practice and he looks totally locked in. A goofy exterior that hides a cold-blooded assassin, Eli is coming. 2) The rookie that I'm most impressed by is not Sterling Shepard or Darian Thompson. It's Eli Apple. Is he a starter? No. Who would be when your top two corners are Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie? All Apple has done is come in and held his own at the toughest non-QB position in the league for rookies. Sure, we see highlights of Odell Beckham torching Apple, but c'mon.... who doesn't Odell torch? Eli, in every clip I've seen has shown good technique, good strength, and good athleticism. His grabbiness has decreased and he's looking like a more nuanced player than in college. 3) The rookie that I'm most disappointed in is Jerell Adams. Let me say that it's way too early (duh), but this is a position that was wide open coming in and he was one that I had personally been looking for as early as the fifth round. He has all the makings of a very good two-way tight end, but perhaps he needs a year or two on the practice squad to try and fulfill that. 4) Much like Rueben Randle (who is killing it apparently in Philly's training camp), Larry Donnell always puts on a show in August. I want to see how he does when the lights come on. Too many mistakes during the regular season, but if he comes in and fixes those mental mistakes, a combo of Donnell-Tye is another explosive weapon for Manning. 5) My vote for biggest surprise/biggest impact is Owamagbe Odighizuwa. He's simply too explosive and too powerful not to make a splash if he stays healthy. A year under his belt and without any health restrictions and he can perhaps show us exactly what made him such a hyped up prospect. If not as a defensive end, he can certainly make waves as a DT in that "Four Aces" package that Spags likes. 6) Odell Beckham is the best player in the NFC East. 7) Every time I hear Andre Willliams' name mentioned, it is how he gets stopped in the backfield. He's the tenuous No. 2 right now, but in year 3 there's going to be more than a critical eye towards him. Pat Traina's article a few days back had Jonathan Casillas mention that the most surprising player in training camp was Paul Perkins. Watch out, Andre. 8) Iron sharpens iron. Nothing has gotten me more excited than looking at some of these matchups: Odell Beckham vs. Janoris Jenkins. Damon Harrison vs. Weston Richburg. Eli Apple vs. Sterling Shepard. This is fun. 9) Olivier Vernon is the worst type of defensive end for Ereck Flowers. and that's a good thing. Vernon is a pure leverage player. He's shorter than your average defensive end at 6-foot-2, and he's got tremendous burst. If you have technique lapses, you're going to get whipped. This should hopefully serve as some kind of motivation/teaching tool. 10) Speaking of Flowers, I will be watching him a lot. Everybody speaks to his athleticism, but it's completely wasted if you don't use it right. Markus Kuhn is a 300-pounder who has a 35-inch vertical, clearly showed that athleticism while he was here (/sarcasm). What good is Flowers' 80 bazillion bench press reps if he can't time or land his punch consistently? What good is his wide body and lower body power if he negates that by lunging at speed rushers? What good is his foot speed if his base is too wide or too narrow for him to move properly? The grace period he's had as a rookie is over. It's time to show something. 11) I want to see teams try and rush against the New York Giants this year. A lineup of Johnathan Hankins and Snacks Harrison inside with Jason Pierre-Paul and Vernon outside should make it easy for the linebacking corps to come up and handle the run game. I am not scared of that Cowboys OL after seeing Hankins and Snacks together in practice. 12) Speaking of the linebacking corps, you hope and pray that Devon Kennard and Keenan Robinson, both oft-injured, stay healthy. They are the lynchpins of that group, with Kennard providing the pass rush and Robinson with the coverage. Jasper Brinkley and Kelvin Sheppard are capable of banging inside against the run in the middle spot. I don't see any room for Mark Herzlich on this team as of right now. 13) I think at some point this season, if not to start the season, Geremy Davis will start opposite Odell Beckham. He's got size and he's shown that he's got the ability to create separation at the catch point, if not anywhere else on the route. And that's okay. The common thread between Beckham, Sterling Shepard, and Davis? They don't have drops. Davis especially has shown the ability to be a big target down the field. 14) Donte Deayon has to make this team. He doesn't look as dimunitive as his measurements suggest and he's just got a knack for the ball like his teammate at Boise State and current Giant starting free safety Darian Thompson. He's quick and he's aggressive. The Giants need more of that. 15) Deayon should be joined by two other undrafted free agents, one of them being Greg Milhouse. The Giants need a penetrator on that defensive front. They've got their two hogs and Jay Bromley has been middling in his attempts to single gap rush. Milhouse can be that stressor along the defensive front, especially if Big Hank or Snacks take up two blockers. 16) The third UDFA should be either Roger Lewis or Darius Powe. I'm honestly not sure who. If the Giants prefer size, Powe would be the answer. Lewis has apparently been slightly more impressive in practice. The preseason games will determine this and it's one of the fiercest battles on this roster. 17) Victor Cruz. Is this the end? After seeing what happened to Hakeem Nicks, I don't think my heart could take it. 18) I don't know if it's Ben McAdoo or if it's this new strength and conditioning coach or if it's just the Football Gods having some form of mercy, but that issue that we will not mention that has crushed this team over the past few years hasn't reared it's ugly head...yet. Let's hope and pray. 19) Speaking of Ben McAdoo, all reports are that the players have bought in. That's all you can hope for at this point. It remains to be seen if he'll FUBAR this thing during the regular season, but the stage doesn't look too big for him and that's reassuring. 20) Lastly, when the Giants go up against Miami, give me one solid opening touchdown drive by the offense and a three-and-out on defense and get the starters the hell out of there. Invictus XI's 53 Man Roster (Starters in italics) This is who I'd pick as my top 53 players. Not necessarily a prediction.

Quick Specs And Features Comparison 12 August 2016, 6:51 am EDT By Aaron Mamiit Tech Times Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Top 5 Features We LoveNow Playing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - What The Experts Are SayingNow Playing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Top 5 AlternativesNow Playing ADVERTISEMENT Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 is set to go head-to-head with Apple's iPhone 7 in the cutthroat smartphone market. Should customers purchase the Galaxy Note 7 when it launches this month, or wait for the release of the iPhone 7?  ( Samsung ) Advertisement The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is set to be launched on all major carriers in the United States on Aug. 19. The upcoming flagship smartphone for the South Korean electronics conglomerate is surrounded by a lot of hype, pushed forward by its top-end features and specifications and an aggressive marketing campaign by Samsung. It should be remembered, however, that the Galaxy Note 7 is actually the successor to the Galaxy Note 5. Samsung decided to skip a number in the series to eliminate inconsistencies in its product line, as it released the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge earlier this year. However, the bigger reason is that Samsung thought naming the device as the Galaxy Note 6 will make customers think that it is inferior to Apple's upcoming flagship smartphones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be released by September or October, with the larger model expected to go head-to-head with the Galaxy Note 7 in the cutthroat smartphone market. For customers looking to purchase a high-end, large-display smartphone, should they grab the Galaxy Note 7 this month, or wait a month or two for the iPhone 7 Plus? A quick comparison of the specifications and features of the two smartphones should give customers a better idea on which device they should purchase. It should be noted, however, that with no official announcement yet for the iPhone 7, the details presented below are only rumored ones, though coming from reliable sources. Display The Galaxy Note 7 packs a 5.7-inch dual-curved Super AMOLED display with high QHD resolution, a display that has been tagged as the best smartphone display ever. The 5.5-inch Retina display of the iPhone 7 Plus, meanwhile, is expected to largely be the same as the iPhone 6s Plus, though possibly with an upgraded sharpness to 1,080p. Processor And RAM Powering the Galaxy Note 7 are the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 or Samsung Exynos 8890 processors that were used for the Galaxy S7 line, with the chipset used depending on the region of the smartphone. The Galaxy Note 7 also has the same 4 GB of RAM as the Galaxy S7 line. The iPhone 7 Plus is expected to come with 3 GB of RAM, compared with only 2 GB of RAM of the iPhone 7 and its predecessors iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The device will be powered by Apple's A10 processor, which is the successor to the A9 chipset used for the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Camera The Galaxy Note 7 also features the same camera as the Galaxy S7 line, with a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. The iPhone 7, meanwhile, is said to be featuring a dual-lens rear camera system, which is the reason for the RAM upgrade. Storage The internal storage of the Galaxy Note 7 starts at 64 GB, compared with the native storage of 32 GB for the Galaxy S7. The Samsung smartphone, however, also features expandable memory through a microSD card slot that will add up to 256 GB in storage. The iPhone 7, for the first time in the history of Apple's smartphone line, will drop the 16 GB storage option, making the 32 GB option the lowest option in addition to 64 GB and 256 GB models. The iPhone 7, like all other iPhones, will not feature expandable memory. Other Features Other important features for the Galaxy Note 7 include the trademark S Pen stylus, which has been upgraded to make it water-resistant and more accurate, a USB Type-C connector and an iris scanner for added security. The iPhone 7 Plus, on the other hand, is said to be coming with a redesigned Force Touch Home button, with the 3.5mm headphone jack replaced by a Lightning connector. The antenna lines of the smartphone are also said to have been redesigned to give the device a cleaner look. Price The Galaxy Note 7 will come with a price tag of $849 once it launches in the United States, while the 32 GB iPhone 7 Plus is rumored to be coming with a price tag of around $900. Verdict As always, the final decision comes down to the consumer. The good thing about the decision is that whichever smartphone you decide to purchase, you will surely end up with a high-quality premium smartphone with powerful specifications and the latest features.

The photos show what appear to be the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7s Plus, which is the only model with Apple's Smart Connector port and "S" logo.  ( Weibo ) Advertisement Several new images of Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have leaked. The photos provide a close-up look at what is believed to be the new space black color option, in addition to gold and rose gold variants. With each passing year, it's becoming increasingly difficult for smartphone makers to keep their unannounced next-generation handsets out of the public's eye. Whether it comes in the form of leaked specs, new features or actual images of a yet-to-be announced device, tech fans can follow their favorite smartphone maker's future handset on an almost-daily basis. For instance, if you love Google's Nexus smartphones and their guarantee of always having the latest and greatest version of Android, you got your first report that HTC was building Google's next-generation smartphones back in January. Renders of the HTC Nexus Marlin and Nexus Sailfish first leaked in July, and those images were quickly followed up with a video detailing their design later in the month. Most recently, the five-inch Sailfish was spotted on AnTuTu benchmark. iPhone fans got a jump on Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in November 2015, a couple of weeks after the company began selling its current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. That initial report claimed what sounded unthinkable at the time, that Apple would drop the standard 3.5 mm headphone port and instead use its Lightning port for charging, data transfer and audio. Several reports over the last few months have backed up that claim, and most recently, a video showed what are supposedly Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus' Lightning EarPods in action. Smartphone fans also have a pretty good idea of what Apple's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will look like ahead of the company's expected September launch event, as images and videos of the smartphones have been leaking on an almost-daily basis. The latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus leak comes in the form of several images, which show the smartphones in various color options. It appears that Apple will introduce a new space black hue to replace space gray. The iPhone 7 Plus' dual-lens rear camera is shown, as well as the larger rear shooter expected on the smaller iPhone 7. The handsets' Apple logo and iPhone branding are also in view. Another set of images show what appears to be space black, rose gold and gold iPhone 7 Plus handsets with Apple's proprietary Smart Connector on the lower rear of the device. As you can see in the image above, these models also have an "S" stamped below the iPhone branding, just like Apple's current iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, leading some to believe Apple may launch three iPhone 7 models: an iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 7s Plus. Take these new images with a grain of salt for now, however, as it has also been widely reported that Apple canceled the Smart Connector port from this year's iPhones.

From the dual lens camera and the twin external speakers to the redesigned antenna lines and the missing headphone jack , many of the iPhone 7 's key features have already been leaked. But one question still hanging in the air is when Apple will unveil the long-awaited gadget - and when you'll be able to get your hands on it. There are, of course, plenty of rumours about that too. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, leaked images, price rumours and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone Apple usually launches its flagship iPhones in the first half of September, and notorious leaker Evan Blass (aka @evleaks ) has predicted the new iPhone will go on sale on September 16 - with preorders starting a week earlier on September 9. Now Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman, who made his name as a famously accurate Apple leaks specialist at 9to5Mac, has named September 7 as the day of the launch event. Read More iPhone 7 launch date CONFIRMED - Apple to unveil its new smartphone next week The date was buried in an article about MacBook Pro upgrades, but spotted by Forbes journalist Gordon Kelly . "The MacBook Pros aren’t likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for Sept. 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone," wrote Gurman. Read More iPhone 7: Release date, leaked images, price rumours and all the latest news about Apple's next iPhone The dates all fit nicely together, but suggest the iPhone 7 launch timescale could be significantly more condensed than in recent years. Last year, the iPhone 6s didn't hit the shelves until September 25 - two weeks after the launch event on September 9. Meanwhile, the latest leaked photos reinforce previous rumours that the iPhone 7 will feature a pressure-sensitive home button. The pictures, which come from phone repair company GeekBar supposedly show the iPhone 7 display assembly, with part of the standard home button cut-out visible.

However, the consensus is that, if Apple does make this change, it won't be until next year, when the company is supposedly planning a major design overhaul for the iPhone. The addition of pressure sensitivity to the existing home button in this year's iPhone model may be intended as a stopgap, allowing app developers to start experimenting with potential uses for this new feature.

The N22 is powered by an Intel Celeron N3060 processor clocked at up to 2.48GHz with integrated Intel HD graphics, and features an 11.6-inch HD anti-glare screen. Its battery life is an impressive 14 hours (claimed), and the laptop features a 180-degree rotatable webcam. It also weighs a lightweight 1.3kg, features 32GB of storage, packs 2GB of RAM, and runs on Chrome OS, naturally – so you'll need an internet connection to complete most tasks. 11.6-inch HD anti-glare display Intel Celeron Processor 2GB of RAM Google Chrome OS 32GB of storage Buy Now: Lenovo N22 11.6-inch Chromebook for £109 – save £50 at Amazon What we said: We haven’t reviewed this particular model, but we did review last year’s very similar Lenovo N20 Chromebook. That scored 7/10, and was praised for its smooth, flexible hinge, the slick Chrome OS, and while it's not without its issues, we deemed it stonkingly good value for money. Read our full Lenovo N20 review here What you said: The Lenovo N22 holds an impressive 4.6/5 score on Amazon, based on 68 user reviews. Comments include: “Really pleased with it so far”, “Light and easy to transport”, “ What a great bit of kit. Fantastic value for money." How good a deal is this?

The Ideapad 100S is lightweight and portable, landing it firmly in Chromebook territory – just with more offline usability thanks to Windows 10 being a full-featured OS. 14.1-inch HD 1,366 x 768 display Intel Celeron Processor 32GB eMMC storage Windows 10 OS 2GB of RAMBuy now: Lenovo Ideapad 100S for only £149.99 – saving £80 What we said: Unfortunately, we haven't had the Lenovo Ideapad 100S in for review. However, glancing at the spec sheet, we're impressed. The Intel Celeron processor takes care of most day-to-day tasks, including web-browsing, word-processing and Netflix binging.

One owner has said that it's "light, quick and perfect for web-browsing and Office Applications", while another commented that they were "really, really impressed by this little machine". How good a deal is this? The Lenovo Ideapad 100S usually retails at £229.99, so an £80 saving is nothing to turn your nose up at.

Meanwhile, the 8GB of RAM makes it burly enough for heavy duty tasks, including video and photo editing. 14-inch 1920x1080 IPS anti-glare display 8GB RAM 128GB SSD storage Windows 10 operating system 720p HD cameraBuy now: Lenovo Ideapad 510s for £529 from Very - saving £70 What did we say? We had this model's little sibling in for review and we really liked it. We particularly liked the fact that at 14-inches it was thin and portable but didn't sacrifice a good screen for the cause. The model we had to test kept up with our needs despite the smaller Intel Core i3 processor. It's even better then, that the Ideapad on offer here has a larger Intel Core i5 processor. Add on the already equipped SSD and this is a seriously speedy machine. Buy now: Lenovo Ideapad 510s for £529 from Very - saving £70 How good a deal is this? The Lenovo Ideapad 510s has a heap of great features including an Intel Core i5 processor, an SSD and a full HD anti glare screen.

Recover your password Delimiter About Delimiter Contact us Ethics Principles Privacy Site Terms Comments policy Consumer Tech News Apple rejects banks’ proposed mobile payments “cartel” By Daniel Palmer - 12/08/2016 8 news In a strongly worded letter to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC), Apple has rejected the formation of a mobile payments “cartel” proposed by four major Australian banks. Should the ACCC grant permission for the group’s formation, it would have the right to “jointly negotiate the terms and conditions with third-party mobile wallet providers, including Apple, and institute a joint boycott during those negotiations”, the tech giant pointed out. Further, Apple said, the banks’ application is so full of “factual and legal misstatements” that it has not been able to prepare a comprehensive submission. That will follow at “a later date”, the firm said. In the meanwhile, Apple “strongly” urged the ACCC to reject the request for interim authorisation. If granted, it said, the request would “harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent”. The Cupertino-based firm went on to argue that three of the banks – Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac – are three of the four biggest banks in Australia, and that “given their scale and market share”, the applicants are essential to its ability to offer Apple Pay on a “meaningful basis” within Australia. The fourth financial institution in the applying group is Bendigo and Adelaide Bank. Apple further confirmed that it “struggled” to negotiate agreements with the Australian banks when introducing its mobile wallet service to Australia. “Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the applicants perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat,” Apple said. “These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers.” “The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple’s entry into the Australian market,” it added. Apple’s claim is at odds with comments last December from Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens who said in a letter to a Labor MP that he has not seen “any evidence” that Australia’s major banks are actively boycotting the Apple Pay mobile payments service. Such a boycott would represent a “hard-core breach of the Competition and Consumer Act”, Apple said. Accusing the banks of relying on “innuendo and misstatements” to support their application, Apple suggested the banks have “little direct insight” into Apple Pay or Apple’s terms. To back up the claim, the firm said one of the four banks has “refused” to enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple to discuss the terms under which it might participate in Apple Pay. The banks’ application to the ACCC for permission to negotiate with Apple as a collective group is aimed to “force Apple and other third party providers” to accept their terms, and allow them to charge consumers choosing to use Apple Pay, Apple said. Innovation would be another victim of the banks’ plans, according to Apple, which said: “It would slow innovation and reduce choices by protecting members of the cartel from competition with each other for the next three years. The banks would have little incentive to compete amongst themselves to develop the best and most innovative payment services for their customers.” The ACCC and its predecessor have never before authorised a collective boycott. While the banks have sought ACCC approval on “public interest” grounds, Apple said it “cannot identify any public benefits that could arise from the boycott”, and further that the banks’ application “lacks any proper evidence that could safely be relied on to substantiate such benefits”. The iPhone maker went on to say that the authorisation is “inappropriate” under the ACCC’s Authorisation Guidelines if it has the potential to be “significantly anticompetitive” and the applicant has not demonstrated “compelling reasons”. “The banks have failed to provide compelling reasons in this case that would justify the significant risks of anticompetitive outcomes,” Apple said.

Let’s not give more money to a company that does everything it can to dodge paying it’s due’s in this country. Daniel Rossi 12/08/2016 at 10:14 pm mobile is a cartel. They collude to protect their insecure white elephant trash from fibre internet. I would never do transactions over mobile whatsoever. Now we’ve just learnt Android is vulnerable to the Linux TCP hole and older phones are now not receiving software security updates. I know mine isn’t. Phones have no firewalls of any kind. Banks are stuffed also. They kill business with their criminal transaction fees. We aren’t a cash economy after all. With IP gateway terminals they should be connected via VPN also not over a public network to the bank. Chris B 13/08/2016 at 9:56 am Apple has precisely nothing to gain from operating services, payments, streaming media, etc, in the corrupt, fragmented and tiny Australian market. They should just sell their gadgets (marked up with a hefty Australian Consumer Law Tax to pay for our political bullshit) and stay the fuck away from “distrupting” our corrupt 1960’s era banking and media sectors. Gavin 17/08/2016 at 12:19 pm What they have to gain is market share in the mobile phone industry. Apple Pay would be a great tool for getting extra people to buy their devices if they are the only recognised brand offering this type of payment service. Daniel 15/08/2016 at 10:31 am I can already picture Apple being forced to pull out of dealing financial business with Australia at this rate. Would this give Australia a bad reputation with other companies thinking about expanding a presence here? Of course its all about money, but they are apparently concerned about customer security and looks like Apple do not want to risk that. Paul 16/08/2016 at 7:48 pm Very surprised by the comments so far. Bigger picture guys! If they can block ApplePay, then they can do the same for Android and any other payment system that they don’t like. This is all about the 3 major banks stopping innovation so that they can control there profits. PeterA 18/08/2016 at 10:31 am Android pay is open enough that they can develop their own competitors on the platform. I already use the NAB app to use my phone as an NFC payment device. Because Android is an open platform that allows that. Apple require all payments to go through their own app. No one can write their own payment system that runs on the Apple hardware. I think both sides of this are scumbags. Apple for holding the banks to ransom and denying them the chance to write their own payment processing (effectively asking for a kickback for letting people use their platform), and the banks, for colluding with the credit card companies to maintain their monopolies (and I haven’t heard great things about the EFTPOS system really… but I am uninformed on this point). Paul 18/08/2016 at 6:04 pm Hi Peter, well I didn’t know that! I believe ApplePay is locked to Touch ID, so they don’t what to seperate it out for security concerns… and if they get to force money out of banks, well that an “unfortunate” side effect! How is the process on an Android phone? Do you have to unlock and open the app to make a payment? Comments are closed.

Interestingly, however, it seems Apple is using variable pricing in these different locations, unbeknownst to many artists and publishers. _______________________ Guest Post by Bobby Owsinski on Music 3.0 If you want to get your music to be heard in every part of the planet, then Apple Music is currently the way to go. Apple recently announced that it has expanded its reach to 114 countries, far more than any other service at the moment. Spotify, which Music Business Worldwide now estimates at 36 million paid subscribers, is only in 60 countries at the moment, and despite the graphic disadvantage, seems to be growing faster than Apple Music. Still, you can’t argue with the footprint that Apple Music has, as it’s now available in in prized territories like China, Turkey, Taiwan and Israel. One of the things that most artists and bands aren’t aware of though, is that Apple Music utilizes variable pricing from country to country. This means that while subscribers in the U.S. pay $9.99 per month, Israeli subscribers pay about $5.20 and Russian subscribers around $3. That means that if most of your streams come from a low paying territory, you’ll be paid a lower royalty as a result. The variable pricing is a result of a “what the market will bear” that Apple also uses for iTunes, which proved to be successful in the past. In the last few years Spotify has also launched in a number of other countries as well, adding Italy, Poland, Portugal, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Estonia, Latvia, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Chile, Cyprus and Czech Republic to the list. The company expects to launch in Russia and Japan later this year. Spotify also utilizes variable pricing, but most of the time the price is actually higher than the U.S. For instance, Australians pay $11.25 while Swedes pay the equivalent of $15.22. Poles only pay $6.62 however. What this shows is that streaming is expanding both territorially, and revenue-wise, which can only be good for artists, bands, labels and songwriters everywhere. The problem is that the variable pricing makes it a lot more difficult to determine just how much an average stream is worth, something that will haunt us all for some time.

Subsequently, Sharp ran into huge financial troubles, and its good but expensive LTPS and other panels never made it en masse to iPhones and iPads, so Apple's investment was in the end said to be around $100 million in total. Fast forward to today, and Apple's iPhone assembler, Foxconn, finally got the green light from the Chinese authorities to acquire Sharp for the no-less cool $3.8 billion. The struggling Japanese company will thus be folded in the sprawling conglomerate of the flamboyant CEO Terry Gou, but not for its excellent phones with the best screen-to-body ratio that are only sold in Japan. In fact, the display know-how of Sharp will reportedly help Foxconn fulfill the future needs of its master Apple, and the rumored shift to OLED displays for the 2017 iPhone, and probably the subsequent ones. Sharp has been rumored to work with Apple on OLED display tech for a while, but for now it doesn't have the money and scale to produce them in mass numbers with the price and quality that Samsung or LG would offer, so it lookс like Apple might stick with Samsung for next year's "disruptive" iPhone edition.  With Foxconn's production facilities, and Apple's money, however, those three might crack the OLED code all on their own, so that Apple can reduce its part supply dependence on its chief rival in the smartphone realm. Sharp is also holding patents on its IGZO display technology, which is very frugal, and allows Sharp phones to easily last two days on a charge, yet is available in 4K mobile screens, so there is plenty of benefits to look forward to from that acquisition. source: FT Featured stories   LG V20 camera tips and tricks   When will my phone get Android 7.0 Nougat?   Best high-end Samsung smartphones you can get right now (November 2016)   iPhone 7 Plus vs $1600 camera: which takes better portraits?   Nokia's return to smartphones confirmed for 2017   Bezelless Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8?

Even their follow Japanese panel such as Panasonic and Sony are better. I know because I make a lot of comparison before I bought my recent UHD TV. posted on 12 Aug 2016, 04:17 2 Reply 3. ibend (Posts: 5020; Member since: 30 Sep 2014) and they should stick with IGZO LCD.. it's already good enough.. and sharp didn't have much experience with OLED. obviously, their OLED quality will be far behind superAMOLED (but of course, apple fans will say it's as good as superAMOLED, lol) posted on 12 Aug 2016, 04:21 0 Reply 4. NoAllegiance (Posts: 227; Member since: 21 Mar 2016) My M2 Note has an IGZO display, the blacks aren't as punchy as an OLED but the colors are pleasant to loo at. I wonder why there aren't that many phones using IGZO. * Some comments have been hidden, because they don't meet the discussions rules. view all comments Want to comment? Please login or register.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Apple iPhone Space Black variant and A10 processor surface online Apple iPhone Space Black variant and A10 processor surface online Apple iPhone 7 is likely to feature cosmetic design change and a new faster and power efficient A10 processor By: Tech Desk | Updated: August 12, 2016 5:33 pm Apple A10 chipset leak reveals an all new processor for iPhone 7, which could be as fast as A9X (Source: Weibo/Techtastic) Apple is widely rumoured to introduce iPhone 7 with an updated A10 processor next month. While we have only seen design changes coming with the product, a new leak reveals what A10 chipset might look like. Apple iPhone 6s is powered by A9 processor and its natural for the next processor to bear the A10 name. Apple generally introduces a new processor lineup with iPhone and an X variant of the same processor follows the iPad range. The recent iPad range – which includes 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Pro – are powered by Apple’s A9X chipset. The images of A10 chipset posted on Chinese social network Weibo reveal the die of the new processor along with design of the logic board. The leak doesn’t reveal any details about the new processor but Apple CEO Tim Cook already hinted at the iPhone will be very compelling in terms of performance. Apple is likely to launch three new iPhones at its special event in September (rumoured to be held on September 7) with redesigned antenna layout, a protruding ring to protect the camera lens and a new home button with support for haptic feedback. Apple is likely to follow the leads of LeEco, Motorola and drop the 3.5mm headphone jack and is reportedly working on lightning connected headphones. Earlier we saw renders of lightning connector based Apple earpods leak on China’s Weibo platform.

Apple iPhone 7 is also reported to come in a Pro model with dual rear camera setup. While some reports indicate Apple’s plans to introduce dual rear camera based smartphone, it is unclear how the dual camera setup will work. Apple iPhone 7 is also reported to come in space black colour variant along with rose gold, gold and space grey colour options (Source: Techtastic) A leaked Geekbench listing revealed A10 processor’s single core benchmark score of 3000, which puts it right in the league of A9X processor powering iPad Pro. Apple’s A9X is the most powerful processor ever packed into a mobile device and it is likely that iPhone 7 will be the most powerful smartphone when it launches next month. Apple is also likely to introduce a new space black colour variant this time. Last year, Apple introduced Rose Gold as a new colour option and it immediately turned into a rage among iPhone buyers. This time around, it could be time to go completely black with iPhone 7.

Apple first announced plans for the $950M data center some 18 months ago, aiming to deliver better connectivity to European customers for all its online services. All looked on track as the company was quickly granted planning permission for the facility, but despite the fact that the center will be entirely powered by renewable energy, an appeal was lodged on environmental grounds … The planning body An Bord Pleanála asked Apple to address five concerns, which it did in May. It was announced earlier this week that the inspector responsible for scrutinizing Apple’s response had submitted his recommendations, and An Bord Pleanala has now given the final go-ahead for both the data center itself and associated electrical substation. A number of third party appeals were lodged with An Bord Pleanála against the decision of Galway County Council to grant planning permission for the development. The Board’s decision is to grant permission for the proposed development with revised conditions. A separate application from Apple Distribution Limited was also lodged on 12th February, 2016 to allow for a 220kV electricial substation and a number of towers. This case was also considered by the Board on 10th August, 2016. The Board’s decision is to approve the proposed development. The approval requires Apple to carry out all of the proposals put forward in its oral response to objections, as well as imposing additional conditions. These include reducing the number of car-parking spaces, promptly restoring removed or damaged trees, limiting noise levels, running all external cables underground, ensuring no extra development above roof level and facilitating an archaeological appraisal of the site. Apple had originally aimed to have the center operational by next year, a deadline which now looks unlikely following the significant delays resulting from the appeals process. Apple says that the center will meet the company’s needs for the next 10-15 years.

The ad titled 'The Human Family' is part of the company's 'Shot on iPhone' campaign. It has voice of poet Maya Angelou and seeks to show people from different countries who are competing at the Games. | Updated: Aug 12, 2016, 04.34 PM IST Apple recently released its Rio Olympics 2016 ad. The ad titled 'The Human Family' is part of the company's 'Shot on iPhone' campaign. It has voice of poet Maya Angelou and seeks to show people from different countries who are competing at the Games. The Apple commercial also has not one but three images from India. While it surely is flattering, there's also a bit of disappointment that the world's most-loved technology brand stuck to cliches. India's representation in the ad is in the form of three sadhus and a famished-looking peasant (who seems to be looking at sky awaiting rains). While Apple sees India as a market with huge growth potential and is said to be upping its ante here, the perception among the top echelons of the company about the country still seems to be that of the 'being a land of snake charmers'. The ad seems to reinforce the popular western view about India. The 'sadhus' in the ad wearing long tikas are surely part of our culture. But, they symobolise our country as much as our journey to Mars -— that too on a shoestring budget. And yes Apple, we are still an agrarian economy and proud to be one. But remember, we also have an army of software engineers who drive the codes at IT behemoths around the world, as do our ISRO scientists, who are good a match to NASA scientists (may be if not better). India also boasts of a diversity far bigger than you can fathom. This 'unity in diversity' is quintessentially India, more than anything else. And so, would have been a wonderful representation of the country. So Apple, next time you decide to include us in your global ads, we will really appreciate if you look beyond our 'Sadhus' and 'farmers'. > RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

The new Apple data centre will be in Athenry, costing the company some €850m of an overall €1.7bn investment that will see a similar centre built in Denmark. Renewable energy projects are at the core of this build, with the company claiming that it will run the centre on 100pc renewable energy. When completed, the centre will power Apple’s online services, including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri, for customers across Europe. To be built on a 500-acre greenfield site in Derrydonnell, the company hopes the new facility will be open by the end of next year. Though despite the financial outlay and the promise of some 150 jobs in the area upon completion – added to the jobs that will be created by the construction work needed to erect the facility – the plan wasn’t to everybody’s liking. However, after considering the objections it received, An Bord Pleanála has given the official go-ahead to Apple. The 24,500sqm Athenry data centre will be the company’s largest data centre project in Europe. In another planning application, Apple sought approval for a 220kV electrical substation and a number of towers. Again, after objections, An Bord Pleanála has given official approval. As part of the deal, Apple has had to sign up to a number of conditions, including providing a €1m fund for ocean energy testing in Galway, as well as committing to the planting of native trees to offset the environmental impact of the build. It is understood that the data centre, which will come online in 2017, will have a 6MW requirement and this will grow to 30MW when it is fully operational. This could grow to 240MW in 10 to 15 years’ time. This all adds to recent assertions, posited by Ronan Harris, head of Google Ireland, that Ireland is the data capital of Europe. A detailed report published by global data analyst group 451 Advisors in 2013 predicted that Ireland’s data centre industry would overtake the UK and mainland Europe locations, with a growth rate of 18pc over the coming years.

 Apple's pricey data center finally gets the green light Sam Shead Aug. 12, 2016, 11:36 AM 4,087 facebook linkedin twitter email print A computer generated image of Apple's data centre. Apple Apple has been given the green light to build the first data hall for a huge new data center on a 197-hectare site near the west coast of Ireland. Irish planning body An Bord Pleanála gave Apple's first data hall the go ahead on Wednesday despite opposition from a number of individuals and local businesses. The planning body said the data center will provide the area with a significant economic boost, adding that they took into account how hard it is to find sites that are able to accommodate huge data centers that need to be connected to the national grid. Apple has received planning permission to build just one data hall but it hopes to build a total of eight on the site over the next 10-15 years. The iPhone maker will have to apply for planning permission every time it wants to open a new data hall. The facility will be built in the middle of a forest just outside the small town of Athenry in County Galway. It will initially consist of a single data hall, an administration building, and other associated developments. Over 200 people will be employed in the building of the data center, while a significantly smaller number of IT workers and data center technicians will operate the facility when it's built. The data center — which Apple says will be totally powered by renewable energy — will be built on land that state forestry company Coillte used for growing and harvesting non-native trees. Apple plans to restore native trees to Derrydonnell Forest and create an outdoor education space for local schools, as well as a walking trail for the community. Apple Maps/Skitch/Sam Shead Apple's Irish data center plans were approved last September by Galway County Council but they were held up after a number of appeals were made to An Bord Pleanála. Appellants raised concerns over the impact on the local wildlife, the data center's energy usage, and flooding, among other things. Apple wants to use the data center to store European user data and to help power online services including the iTunes Store, the App Store, iMessage, Maps, and Siri for customers across Europe, according to a press release announcing the development in February 2015. The Cupertino company was hoping to have the facility up and running by early 2017 but that target date now looks unrealistic given Apple is yet to start any building work. Some 5,500 of Apple's 18,300 European staff are based in Ireland, which is also home to its European headquarters. The company has pledged to hire an additional 1,000 staff in Ireland before 2017. Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have also built data centers in Ireland, and Facebook also has one planned. Elsewhere in Europe, Apple is planning to build a data center in Denmark on the same scale as the one in Ireland. The company does not reveal where all of its data centers are but reports suggest Apple also has data center facilities in Newark, Santa Clara, and Cupertino on the west coast of the US, as well one in Maiden on the east coast. Business Insider contacted Apple about the data center completion date but did not immediately hear back. NOW WATCH: How to supercharge your iPhone in 5 minutes Loading video...

It's expecting even more people this year, according to officials at the Cambridge, Mass.-based marketing automation provider. HubSpot Inbound takes place Nov. 8 to 11 at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center. Last year, HubSpot competed with Content Marketing Institute's (CMI) Content Marketing World in Cleveland, which featured 3,500 attendees. Conferences were held the same week in early September.  They aren't going head-to-head again this year: CMI kept the early-September date for its conference while HubSpot moved it back to November. Interestingly, HubSpot's conference falls on the day Americans vote for a new president: Tuesday, Nov. 8. But HubSpot's helping Americans attending its conference get out their votes. It posted an FAQ that directs them to absentee ballots. HubSpot this week announced the addition of tennis star Serena Williams as one of its guest speakers. She has 22 Grand Slam titles — victories in the sport's four major events: Australian Open, Wimbledon, US Open and French Open. She joins Reshma Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology and prepare young women for jobs of the future, actor Alec Baldwin and several other keynote speakers.  In other software technology news ... Madison Logic Expands Activate ABM  New York City-based account-based marketing provider Madison Logic announced new attribution and engagement analytics for its Activate ABM platform. Officials said the platform provides B2B marketers with a combination of targeted advertising and content syndication to influence prospective accounts. Marketers can measure the amount of time an account spends with specific content and attributes that exposure to engagement on a website, driving demand — and ultimately leads — to fill the sales pipeline, according to company officials. "With these insights, B2B marketers can now better optimize targeted advertising and content syndication tactics to influence their prospects and ultimately drive revenue," Madison Logic CEO Tom O'Regan said in a statement. "Activate ABM provides visibility into how two previously siloed tactics work together to drive product awareness and pipeline." Carnegie Partners With BlueConic Westford, Mass.-based Carnegie Communications, which provides digital marketing solutions for higher education, announced a partnership with BlueConic, a Boston-based customer data platform. Carnegie has offered colleges marketing and recruitment solutions for 30 years. Through the BlueConic partnership, Carnegie officials promised to provide their clients the ability to track prospective student activity, synchronize the data associated with each individual student and deliver a personal experience across their entire marketing ecosystem — from web, social, CRM systems, mobile apps and analytics tools.  Joe Moore, CEO of Carnegie Communications, said in a statement his company "has always been dedicated to going above and beyond" for clients. He added, "By providing this service they gain a competitive edge in having the ability to understand and to cater to the intent of each student prospect on their site.” Workplace Happiness ... or Not Good&Co released its “Tech Industry: Quantified Culture & Workplace Happiness Report" this week that revealed findings about the corporate culture of some of the tech industry’s biggest players including Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft.  The report used more than 10 million anonymous, psychometric data points collected from more than 4,000 Good&Co app users over the last two years. It quantifies the personality traits that have the greatest impact on employee success at each organization: social boldness, persistence, curiosity, organization and adventurousness.  According to the report: Facebook is demonstrably lacking when it comes to fostering a culture of creativity According to hiring practices, Microsoft is more innovative than Apple, despite being commonly considered the more conservative company of the two The most successful tech industry employees are easily inspired and fully committed Employees at Apple and Twitter perceive their company as it’s actually managed, an insight that is indicative of a good company culture “While each individual, and therefore each workplace culture, is unique, assessing data in aggregate across large samples has provided us with unprecedented insights into what it’s really like to work at some of the industry's most desirable and competitive organizations,” Samar Birwadker, Good&Co CEO, said in a statement.  “Until now, there has been no way to measure company culture and employee fit — two critical success factors for both employees and HR professionals. We put people and culture first again, by quantifying both company culture and fit to re-humanize the recruiting process, fight back against employee turnover and to produce a long-term, positive impact on organizations’ hiring processes.” Facebook employees scored 10 percent lower on intellectual curiosity than Apple employees. Facebook employees were on average 17 percent and 18 percent less adventurous than Microsoft and Apple employees, respectively. When compared to Microsoft, Apple employees were on average 7 percent more intellectually curious, 13 percent more competitive, 13 percent more methodical. Apple employees were also 8 percent less prone to mood changes (or less volatile) than Microsoft employees. Marketers' Priorities Where are marketers putting their energies — and money? To find out, R2i partnered with research firm Clutch to survey mid-market and enterprise organizations across US-based B2B and B2C brands. The survey was conducted with 500 marketing professionals at companies with at least 500 employees. About half surveyed have more than 1,000 employees and more than $100 million in annual revenue.  Here's what researchers found: Multichannel marketing is not an optional strategy for reaching customers into today’s buying environment. While a brand’s website remains the number one channel used by brands to connect with their audience, the majority of marketers need a healthy mix of digital, offline and mobile channels to stay in front of their buyers Brand awareness and customer loyalty rank as close top priorities for marketers yet more and more CMOs are responsible for showing ROI in investments. Capturing the lasting loyalty — and dollars — of a desired audience remains at the top of marketers “to do” list Survey respondents ranked TV advertising as the top priority despite 2015 Nielsen data indicating that more than 40 percent of TV content is now viewed on screens other than a traditional TV While the website for marketers may have previously been simply a brand asset, a digital platform on which to tell the brand story, it is now the most important technology along with an analytics solution, for marketing execution Smooch Raises $10 Million San Francisco-based Smooch, which helps companies facilitate customer conversations over messaging and communication platforms, announced this week that it has secured about $7.7 million in an institutional seed round. The financing is a co-investment led by Real Ventures and iNovia Capital, with participation from TA Associates and Smooch’s founders. Smooch will use this financing round to expand its support for consumer messaging channels and business software vendors, and to continue to build its team. The company is currently hiring for more than 20 positions in San Francisco and Montreal, including senior sales, product marketing and engineering positions. Smooch features a unified messaging platform, the Smooch Conversation CloudSM, that is designed to allow companies use to their existing business software and processes to have conversations with their customers through messaging apps and SMS, to websites, mobile apps and more. Smooch integrates with consumer messaging channels such as Facebook Messenger, LINE, WeChat, Kik, Telegram, Twilio and others. Cision Appoints Global CEO Cision, a global media intelligence and communications solution provider and portfolio company of GTCR, announced that Kevin Akeroyd has been named global CEO. Akeroyd succeeds Peter Granat, who will transition to chairman of the Cision Board of Directors. Akeroyd has more than 25 years of experience in digital, social and mobile marketing globally. Most recently he was general manager and senior vice president at Oracle Marketing Cloud. Prior to Oracle, Akeroyd held senior leadership positions at companies including Data.com, Salesforce.com and RR Donnelley. “Peter Granat has been an innovative leader with a proven track record of success, and I am grateful for his work to bring the company to such an elite position of strength in the industry,” Akeroyd said. “I look forward to working with Peter and the entire Cision team in the company’s ongoing efforts to deliver innovative products and services to marketing and communications professionals.” Under Granat, Cision has grown from $130 million in revenue to more than $630 million in revenue, and has completed five acquisitions in the last two years. Got a Cool CMO? The CMO Club has announced this year's 2016 CMO Awards. Nominations are open to the public and are now being accepted online.  2016 will mark the CMO Awards' fourth induction into the CMO Hall of Fame. Last November, the honor went to Jon Iwata, senior vice president of marketing and communications at IBM who joined 2014 winner Beth Comstock, CMO at GE, and 2013 winner Stephen Quinn, former CMO of Walmart. Nominees for outstanding CMOs in the ten categories may be submitted through Aug. 30. Nominations are open to the public and nominees are not required to be a member of The CMO Club. Nominees must hold the title of CMO or senior marketing title for a major company, brand, or organization (excludes companies selling predominately to marketing organizations). Marketing executives are permitted to nominate themselves. Finalists in each of the ten Award categories will be announced in September, selected by CMOs in The CMO Club, with four winners per category selected by Oct. 11 as voted on by fellow CMOs, and announced at The CMO Club's Innovation and Inspiration Summit in Santa Monica.  0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Simplicity is the Future of Customer Engagement Dropbox Is Reinventing Itself to Win More Love From IT 7 Big Problems with the Internet of Things Why 2017 Must Be the Year of Content Marketing How to Measure the Effectiveness of Your Content #CMWorld HubSpot Braces for Bigger Crowd at Inbound, More News Has Content Marketing Gotten Too Boring?

Random-Apps makes it easy for iOS users to discover cool and exciting apps that they might normally not encounter via the App Store. The app presents a random listing of quality 4 and 5-star apps directly from the App Store, and because the apps are presented randomly, there's no bias towards displaying apps from developers that have the deepest pockets. Since the early days of the App Store, Apple's iTunes Store and App Store have been the only convenient way to discover apps. Unfortunately, app discovery via those apps has long been broken. While the big boys can easily buy attention for their new apps by advertising, running big contests, and gaining a prominent position in the App Store, the little guys are left to fight for attention. Random-Apps' random presentation system guarantees equal discovery for all the best apps in the store, no matter who the developer is. "We love discovering new apps, but Apple's app discovery system has long been broken. When the App Store first launched, Apple touted that every developer had a level playing field, however this is no longer the case. The bigger your marketing budget the better your app will do on the App Store," says Hi-Voltage Director Tony Tanevski. "The App Store has many hidden gems that most users never really get to see. We wanted to create a unique and friendly way for users to discover these hidden gems. With Random-Apps users can discover a plethora of great apps that they normally might never have found!" Features: * Discover hundreds of thousands of cool apps * Only the best apps with a 4 or 5-star rating are selected * Apps are shown randomly, without any developer bias * Scroll through a seemingly endless list of great apps * When a user finds a cool app they like, they can share it with their friends * Displays both free and paid apps * Clean, easy-to-use interface While Random-Apps presents apps in a random listing, users do have options to allow them to control what they will be viewing. The app offers the ability to view all types of apps, view only games, or view only apps. If the list of apps for the United States doesn't interest them, a user can tap the App Store option in the Settings menu and set the app to display a random listing of the apps in another country's App Store. Also, Hi-Voltage prides itself on listening to its users, so they've included a handy way to send feedback from directly within the app. "If you're a user that's tired of seeing apps from the same big developers every time you visit the App Store, then you should download Random-Apps today," continues Tony. "Random-Apps is the only way to truly get a unique and fair sampling of the best games and apps that are available in the App Store, and we're proud to offer it free to the iOS user community." Device Requirements: * Compatible with iPhone and iPod touch * Requires iOS 8.3 or later * 4.0 MB Pricing and Availability: Random-Apps 1.0 is free, and is available worldwide exclusively through the App Store in the Reference category.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software MacBook Pro will Soon Receive its Biggest Update in Years August 12, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Useful Tips to Make Your MacBook Pro More User-Friendly GoPro Unveils Telemetric Addition for Footage Captured Through Hero 5 It’s been a while since MacBook Pro has been updated with some heavy features. In fact, over these four years since its arrival, we haven’t seen a single update to the device that has made the MacBook Pro stand apart from its previous versions. But it’s time, says Apple, as the company is now gearing up to put some beefy updates on table for the MacBook Pro. According to Bloomberg, Apple has been testing a new MacBook Pro since the beginning of 2016, and it includes a fresh design that would narrow the thickness of the device noticeably. Along with this comes the trimming of the bezels around the display, which will also yield a smaller frame for the MacBook Pro. The best part of the new MacBook Pro is that it will be replacing the physical function keys on top of the keyboard with a narrow touchscreen OLED display. Basic laptop functions could be controlled using this strip of OLED display. There is no info on what all additional functions and shortcuts Apple will include on the touchscreen. The updated MacBook Pro is also likely to house the Intel Skylake processor that should improve the performance and power consumption of the device. Besides, MacBook Pro is also said to be arriving with the new AMD Polaris GPU. On the outside, MacBook Pro will have its USB ports replaced with USB Type-C ports. This could also replace the MagSafe port and Thunderbolt ports, given that USB-C ports support the Thunderbolt protocol. Despite having the redesign nearly completed for the MacBook Pro, it looks less likely that we will be having the new MacBook Pro launched during their iPhone 7 event scheduled on September 7. Apple could push the launch of upgraded MacBook Pro to October, following which it will be made available on the markets the same month.

The main house on Rana Creek Ranch in Carmel Valley has only one bathroom and two half-bathrooms, but it’s linked via a walkway to a guest wing with two bedrooms and there’s also another two bedrooms in a separate guest house. The working cattle ranch also boasts its own private 2,900 ft landing strip and a lake. It was previously listed for sale in 2013 for $59.95 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. But Markkula, 74, and his wife Linda paid just $8million for the house and 9,000 acres in 1982. ‘We were the first one to look at it and we bought it on the spot,’ he told the Journal. They refurbished the houses over the years, converting one room in the main house into a ‘cowboy bar.’ ‘We’ve enjoyed it, we’ve loved it, but it’s time to move on,’ Markkula added.  Markkula invested in Apple in 1977 after being introduced to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. He was the company's CEO between 1981 to 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 until 1997.

He would be right, the iPhone 7 is, but it is not the leap of technological advancement that many of the fanboys would have liked or hoped for. Indeed, the iPhone 7 is more the refinement of a phone that is been nine years in the making. But even if Apple is playing it safe, safe is a great place to be. Here's why the iPhone still cuts it in today's market. Apple iPhone 7 review: Similar design with some tweaks The new iPhone might come in a similarly designed chassis to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S models, with the same 4.7-inch screen, but it looks noticeably different thanks to the more subdued antenna lines. Oh, and there are two new finishes - glossy "Jet Black" and matte "Black" - which join the gold, rose gold and silver colour options also available. We have the glossy black model on review, which is a fingerprint-magnet of a model - reminiscent of the iPhone 3G. The deep black colour hides the newly designed antenna incredibly well, while the new finish also makes the transition from metal to glass almost impossible to see. It is "proper shiny". In contrast, the new "regular" black model is more the stealthy option. The finish, which replaces the "Space Gray" option of the previous 6S range, is less likely to be prone to smudges and scratches (those old enough will remember that issue made the iPhone 3G look rather tatty by end of its first year), and it is a much blunter finish compared to the whimsical rose gold and gold options. It is on those models that the new antenna design is more apparent - it now cuts around the top edge of the phone rather than intersecting top and bottom. New finishes aren't the only design changes. The headphones socket has been dumped (yep, no 3.5mm jack here) and replaced with a speaker grille, while the physical Home button has also been changed from a solid state one to one that doesn't move. Apple iPhone 7 review: No headphone socket At the iPhone 7 launch hysteria quickly settled in that Apple had lost the headphone jack and that it would be the end of the world as we know it. Turns out it wasn't, and it makes barely a jot of a difference. Pocket-lint In the iPhone 7's box you get a set of in-ear headphones that connect via the phone's Lightning port instead. If these aren't for you then there are so many brilliant wireless headphones on the market. But we realise that, for some, that might mean the prospect of buying new cans all over again, and sucking up the expense, or using the included adaptor in the box to convert Lightning to 3.5mm. READ: Best Bluetooth headphones 2016: 10 of the best on- and over-ear cans for wireless listening During our testing we've been using the rather controversial-looking but quick-pairing AirPods (which aren't included in the box, they're £159 extra) and a range of other headphones. All work seamlessly. Apple iPhone 7 review: New Home button The iPhone 7's Home button is the part on the phone you probably interact with the most, and upon hearing Apple was ditching the physical "click" element and replacing it with the same technology found in the Apple Watch and MacBook trackpad, we were worried.  In practice, though, it works amazingly well. Like the MacBook trackpad that uses the same technology, you get the feeling that the button is moving when "pressed" - without anything physically moving. Pocket-lint Tap the Home button, and the so-called Taptic Engine inside the phone makes it vibrate gently - making you believe that the button is moving when in reality it isn't. Removing the physical element means there are less parts and less things to "stick". It's all-round neater. The Home button offers three sensitivity settings to make it as responsive as you prefer. It still allows you to flawlessly use it for double-tapping or Touch ID fingerprint recognition. Although Apple says that Touch ID hasn't been upgraded, it feels a lot more responsive to our touch in the iPhone 7 - even with sweaty hands after a run. Once you try it, you'll wonder why Apple hadn't changed the Home button earlier. Apple iPhone 7 review: Water-resistance Apple has made the iPhone 7 water-resistant to a rating of IP67 - meaning it can be immersed in a metre of water for around 30-minutes without drowning. Pocket-lint Yep, dropping your phone down the toilet or in the swimming pool isn't going to be the major headache it once was. We nervously ran ours under the tap and it continued to work just fine. It's not going to allow you to take pictures under water in a pool, because the screen won't necessarily operate properly, but it should protect you from any accidental dunks. Apple iPhone 7 review: Taptic Engine The same Taptic Engine as used to convince you the Home button is physically moving is also used to greater affect across the new iOS 10 user interface. Pocket-lint Playing Codemaster's F1 2016 game, for example, it adds vibrational nuances when crashing into the barriers or going over bumps. Likewise, the rather dull Zombie Gunship showcases the technology too. In both cases it's as if the whole phone is vibrating rather than just a part of it. "Feeling your phone" is going to be a thing now. Apple iPhone 7 review: Stereo sound The space where the headphone socket was in the iPhone 6S is now replaced with a speaker in the iPhone 7, meaning the new phone offers stereo sound from the two speakers at the bottom. There's an extra speaker at the top, too. Pocket-lint The audio enhancements certainly make a difference: the iPhone 7 produces a richer sound that the iPhone 6S. It's not as good as the speaker setup on the iPad Pro, nor will it be loud enough to fill the room with music, but it's ideal for watching a YouTube video or Facebook Live stream around the house (if you're not plugged into the Lightning port or making the most of wireless). Apple iPhone 7 review: Upgraded cameras  The iPhone 7 has a camera update on both the front and back. However, it misses out on the dual-camera offering and wide-angle lens of the iPhone 7 Plus. READ: Apple iPhone 7 Plus dual camera tech explained Pocket-lint Instead the iPhone 7 offers a new 12-megapixel sensor and an improved lens, plus an improved 7-megapixel front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies. Apple has also added a new flash for better skin tones and plenty of processes in-camera to make sure your photos zing. The camera protrudes out the back of the iPhone 7, just as it has before, and sports a more accentuated circular design - meaning your old cases are unlikely to fit. That's something else for the shopping list. The protrusion is visible, but it's not enough to warrant any concerns and certainly not enough to make the phone wobble when laid on a desk or table. Although you don't get the dual lens technology, the iPhone 7's camera isn't to be sniffed at. It's very good in all situations and noticeably better than the already very good camera on the iPhone 6S. At a team meeting we snapped some side-by-side comparisons to get a closer look and the new camera produced sharper-looking results in all cases. Pocket-lint That's partly thanks to the new f/1.8 aperture lens and the addition of optical image stabilisation (previously OIS was only available on the 6S Plus), but we also suspect a lot of the image processing Apple is able to do with the new more powerful processor on board. The colour in all our test shots looks just natural; the camera auto-detects and handles exposures for different situations well (back-lighting, neon strips, faces, etc); there's detail in the close-up shots we've snapped; and that f/1.8 aperture doesn't overdo things - so further-away subjects remain crisp, while close-up subjects get that lovely blurred background effect. However, we can still see grain in some areas (we're talking when zoomed to 100 per cent) and we've found that images look better on the phone at smaller scale than they do on a larger computer monitor. Some processing does smear away some detail, too, such as the thread in a shirt, as one example. Pocket-lint For those really wanting to take things to the next level, you can now shoot raw, but Apple has held back from adding that capability to its own Camera app, so you'll need a third-party app to get access to that feature. Unlike previous years, there aren't any new camera modes to play with the iPhone 7, and it won't be getting the Portrait mode that the iPhone 7 Plus will be getting later in the year. Apple iPhone 7 review: Speed and performance A new iPhone means upgraded speed. The iPhone 7 gets the new Apple A10 Fusion processor that promises to increase the power and performance over previous models. Pocket-lint Ultimately, it means your phone will be able to load things faster, process things faster, and generally not be in any way sluggish. That's exactly what we've found in our testing to date: games load almost instantly and graphics are rich. The screen - which is the same 4.7-inch size and 1334 x 750 resolution as the iPhone 6S - also feels a lot brighter (it's 25 per cent brighter and comes with a greater colour gamut according to Apple). It's not the Tru Display technology found on the iPad Pro 9.7, though, so no ultra-high resolution to be found here still - but that ought to help battery life. Apple iPhone 7 review: Battery life Apple made a fairly big song and dance over how the battery life had improved for the iPhone 7 following efficiencies in processor and software performance. But we've not really seen those in our tests. After the initial few days using the iPhone 7 and trying to catch-up (the Photos app blasted our battery trying to work out what to do with the 15,000 images we've taken over the years) and we've still not seen the huge improvements promised. Pocket-lint The iPhone 7's battery still lasts a whole day, but it soon drains away - especially if you use social networking or chat apps. A full day in London when using GPS, camera, Slack, Twitter, Facebook, and Mail meant that 13-hours in, by 6pm, we had around 20 per cent battery left. For us that's not improved over our iPhone 6S experience. As always, how you use your phone will determine how long the battery lasts. Play Pokemon Go and you probably won't make it past breakfast, let alone dinner. Apple iPhone 7 review: iOS 10 The new iPhone comes with the latest operating system, iOS 10, as standard. Like the hardware refinements, this new software experience is a subtle change over what users will have seen in iOS 9. iOS 10 comes with a number of new features like a dedicated Home app to allow you to control and manage your HomeKit accessories, a much more advanced Messages app that bring things like apps and stickers, and Widgets to the lock screen so you can quickly grab information snippets from your favourite apps (if they are supported). READ: Apple iOS 10 review: Bringing more complexity and features to your iPhone and iPad The notion that iOS is a simple operating system is now a long and distant memory, given the complexity it opens up for power users. In iOS 10 Apple has focused on layering the experience with even more complexity and depth than ever before. In the same breath, if you're not a phone geek it's still a breeze to use. Verdict The iPhone 7 is not the overhaul that Apple usually presents us with every two years, but there is enough here to keep those upgrading from the iPhone 6 happy. At first glance, however, it's perhaps not the phone to draw in iPhone 6S fans who might be upset that their phone is now old and needs to be replaced - for the iPhone 7 could almost be seen as an "S" version of the iPhone 6S. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack may remain briefly controversial, while the odd-looking AirPods (£159) have also raised some eyebrows. But this biggest point of change isn't really going to impact most users as much as it might sound. Ultimately it's the iPhone 7's other, more subtle changes - the new Home button and glossy/matte black finishes with better hidden antennas - that add to the refinement, without tearing up the rule book and starting again. It's also these technologies that continue to ensure the iPhone 7 is a state-of-the-art smartphone. So Tim Cook is right: the iPhone 7 is the company's best iPhone yet. It's just that the best is only slighter better than what we've already had for the past year.

Samsung’s Note 7 steals the thunder from Apple Hindustan Times 12-08-2016 Korean smartphone-maker Samsung might have stolen the limelight with the launch of its new phablet - Galaxy Note 7 - just days ahead of Apple’s annual event which is speculated to be held between September 7 to 12. “Samsung already has an advantage over Apple as consumers are no longer excited about Apple’s new iPhone 7 launch in September. People are only expecting incremental changes in Apple products this year rather than a complete overhaul in the smartphones space,” Tarun Pathak, senior analyst, Counterpoint Research, said adding that Samsung took the lead in sales with changing design aesthetics, camera and the stylus. “Samsung performed way better with the S7 Edge than the normal flat S7 and this goes to show the success of its design,” Pathak said. © Provided by Hindustan Times Samsung on Thursday launched the new Note 7 priced at Rs 59,990 along with two wearables -- Gear Fit 2 for Rs 13,990 and Gear IconX for Rs 13,490 -- and the new Oculus Gear VR which is 23 grams lighter than its predecessor. The Note 7 comes with an octa-core processor, 4GB RAM and 64GB memory expandable to 256 GB. “The water and dust resistant design of Samsung along with its price of Rs 60,000 will help Samsung against Apple, which will be dependent on its huge install base globally to reap profits,” Patak explained adding that history shows that Apple products are steeply priced than any other in the market which might work as a deterrent. According to a report from Strategy Analytics, Apple is loosing marketshare to Google in India as its pie dropped to 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 4.5 percent in the corresponding period last year. The report also showed that Apple’s iOS fell 35 percent annually and the company just shipped 0.8 million smartphones in India in Q2 2016 compared to 1.2 million during the same period last year. “Apple’s smartphone marketshare has halved from 4 percent to just 2 percent in India during the past year. Apple iOS will need to reduce iPhone pricing to cheaper levels, attract more operator subsidies and enlarge its retail presence through Apple stores or online channels if it wants to regrow significantly in the future,” Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said. In the September event, Apple is expected to launch a new iPhone, a new Macbook and two watches. Leaked images of Apple’s upcoming flagship smartphone have both models -- iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus -- featuring larger cameras, bigger batteries as compared to their predecessors -- iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Other changes includes the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack and inclusion of two speaker grills that suggests stereo sound output. However, Faisal Kawoosa, telecom lead at Cybermedia Research thinks that Apple still stands a chance although he said that the price of the new Samsung Note 7 will add potential to the device in terms of sales. “iPhones have a niche and most iPhone users upgrade. However, the last iPhone didn’t do so well in emerging markets for who it was designed. This might be a red flag for the country if it is looking for growth,” Kawoosa explained. Android currently dominates the India market with 97 percent market share followed by iOS at 2.4 percent. “Android dominates the India smartphone market and looks unbeatable right now, due to its deep portfolio of hardware partners, extensive distribution channels, and a wide range of low-cost apps like Gmail,” Neil Mawston, executive director of Strategy Analytics, said.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more…   skip to main content skip to main menu     Cydia Eraser updated to support iOS 9.3.3 By Anthony Bouchard, Aug 11, 2016 Tweet 35 Comments Saurik has launched an update for the Cydia Eraser tool on Thursday so that it can now be used to un-jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 if you used the Pangu jailbreak tool. The timing couldn’t be better, as Apple recently released iOS 9.3.4 and is expected to close the iOS 9.3.3 signing window in the near future. Cydia Eraser for iOS 9.3.3 With Cydia Eraser now in full support of iOS 9.3.3, those who have jailbroken their iOS 9.3.3 devices with Pangu, whether it was with the Chinese Windows jailbreak tool, over the web in the Safari web browser, or with the English Pangu jailbreak tool that utilizes Cydia Impactor, now have a way to remove the jailbreak and put their device back to a stock non-jailbroken installation of iOS 9.3.3. Saurik officially re-branded Cydia Impactor into “Cydia Eraser” last month just before the English Pangu jailbreak tool was released that used an app called “Cydia Impactor” to sign and install an IPA for jailbreaking your device. When the name change occurred, Saurik only noted only partial support for the dated iOS 9.0. So the added support for iOS 9.3.3 this week is very welcoming without a shadow of a doubt. Cydia Eraser effectively removes all traces of the jailbreak you currently have and allows you to restore your device to the firmware it’s already on without having to connect to iTunes to “restore and update” your device. The major benefit to using this tool over iTunes is after you use it, your device can be re-jailbroken on the firmware it’s on if you so desire to try again. This tool is also useful for anyone who has a jailbroken device they’re trying to sell, because it lets the seller sell the device as a “jailbreakable” device, which may add value to it if it gets sold to the right buyer. How it works Cydia Eraser appears to take advantage of the OTA update system. Saurik explains how it works in Cydia, and we’ve included the excerpt below: Eraser uses the firmware archives provided by Apple for its “over the air” update feature. These files are ~2GB large, so Eraser goes to extreme lengths to minimize the amount of data it needs to download: most recoveries will require less than 10MB of transfer. First, the update’s “bill of materials” is compared against the files on your device, generating a list of changes. Then, all files on your device that have been modified or otherwise destroyed are downloaded directly from Apple. In a series of carefully calculated file migrations, all new files are moved to the user partition, and all system data is moved back to the system partition. Up until this point, the idea is that no changes to your system have been made that are “unsafe”: at any point, if Eraser fails/crashes or your device reboots, you can just run it again later. Finally, all of the staged changes to the filesystem are “committed”, all user data is deleted, and iOS is told to run its “reset all content and settings”. The idea is that this “critical window” lasts only the final few seconds of a process that lasts for multiple minutes. (That said, I still highly recommend not at all “messing with” the app while it is running, and maybe if you have a lot of data this will take longer than I expect.) When the device reboots, it will look as it did when you first turned it on; it will also no longer be “jailbroken”: if you want to jailbreak it, you will need to do so using a desktop jailbreaking tool. Simple enough? Well, maybe not for everyone, but to summarize, it’s a very clever tool that exploits the OTA system so that your device gets all the resources it needs to replace the modified files on your device with factory-fresh ones from Apple. As a result, you get a factory-fresh installation of your current iOS version when you run the tool. As a last resort only Cydia Eraser is to be used as a last resort only if you are having trouble with your jailbroken device, such as when you are having frequent stability issues or when you’re absolutely sure you want to sell or re-jailbreak your device. This is because Cydia Eraser effectively erases your files and settings from iOS. When it finishes running, your device will behave just how it did when you pulled it out of the box after buying it. You’ll have to set it up, activate it, and reinstall all your apps and apply all your old settings again manually. When you’re done, you can either put it back in the box to sell, or you can attempt to jailbreak the device again and hope for the best the second time around. Whatever you’re using it for, it works wonders, so if you need to un-jailbreak your device and you don’t want to update the firmware, Cydia Eraser is the way to go. Wrapping up With Cydia Eraser now officially supporting iOS 9.3.3, those who jailbroke with the Pangu jailbreak tool can now un-jailbreak their devices without being prompted to update to iOS 9.3.4 in iTunes. Although iOS 9.3.3 is still being signed as of this writing, Cydia Eraser is the safest way to un-jailbreak your device at this point in time.

Anthony Bouchard They shouldn’t. All they’re doing is changing the screen out. They need your passcode to authorize a software update. Blip dude No. And if they make the suggestion to update (Best buy tried pulling that crap on me with an an iPod Touch once), just simply say you’ll do it on your own time period. Rowan09 9.3.3 is still being signed? Gabriel Anaya At the moment yes. Anthony Bouchard Yes, for now. mama’s boy Lets say i used cydia eraser and i wanted to update my phone to 9.3.4 how am i supposed to do that? Joshua The-Legend Wiebe Does this support the latest devices? Anthony Bouchard Yes diggitydang Does this work on 9.0.2? I think I’m staying downgraded but want this ability to unjailbreak at this version. Anyone know? Guilherme  Yes, according to the source. diggitydang Cool, thanks! Tom M Will this work if i updated to 9.3.3. over the air before? I went from 9.3.2 to 9.3.3 OTA, and then jailbreaked. will cydia eraser cause any trouble, or will i have a “fresh” 9.3.3.? Anthony Bouchard It doesn’t matter how you updated. David Gow Sweet. Thanks AndreG Same question just confirming. I’m currently on 9.0.2, and have some issues, can I use cydia eraser for a fresh start and re-jailbreak staying on 9.0.2 and will it work. Anthony Bouchard Saurik said it works for iOS 7.1-9.3.3. 9.0.2 falls in between, so I assume yes, but no guarantees. AndreG Thanks Anthony nova voter Is there a tutorial on iDB for how to backup and restore JUST iMessages/SMS? I like to do clean restores, but I dont want to lose my messages. the only “normal” way to do it is through a full restore from backup which I don’t want to do. I used to have a link to a good guide on which files to save and put back, and how to change the security settings after putting them back on the restored phone, but I can’t find it. Anthony Starr So do I install it now from Cydia, and sit on it as a “just in case” tool that is in my settings? Or does it begin erasing immediately after install? This isn’t clear. Rei That’s what I want to know! Ghaith Al Hami i used it and now am stuck at the icloud activation screen Dplumber I recently jailbroke my phone with pangu. While trying to uninstall a program from cydia it made cydia disapear. I have since tried to remove pangu from my phone and rejailbreak several times only to get the same result. Jailbroke with no cydia. Any program on my phone that uses cydia comes back with adress not found. Feeling like a hampster on a wheel about now. Usually find a way but ive got to get off this wheel. Can someone please tell me what i can do before i give up and go back to android lol yihwen Do a restore iPhone but manually with the 9.3.3 IPSW and re jailbreak again.

Used with permission MediaTek has revealed an upcoming Helio X30 system-on-chip (SoC) that will likely be one of the first 10nm fabricated SoCs to arrive when it ships in mid-2017. The deca-core mobile SoC will also be one of the first to use ARM’s new Cortex-A73 successor to the Cortex-A72, according to PhoneRadar, which based its story in part on an EETimes China interview [translated] with MediaTek CTO Zhu Shangzu. Manufactured using TSMC’s 10nm FinFET process, the mobile-focused Helio X30 has a tri-cluster design with two 2.8GHz, Cortex-A73 based “Artemis” cores, as well as four 2.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and four 2.0GHz Cortex-A35 cores. The X30 also sports the high-end, quad-core PowerVR 7XT GPU, which is capable of driving VR headsets, says PhoneRadar. The Helio X30 will support up to 8GB of LPDDR4 RAM and is powerful enough to drive a 26-megapixel rear-facing camera, as well as a front-facing cam. The SoC is said to support UFS 2.1 storage, as well as a three carrier aggregation (3CA) modem that supports the speedy CAT 12 LTE standard. MediaTek’s latest SoC follows its similarly 10-core, but 20nm fabricated Helio X20 and X25. These SoCs debuted the tri-cluster concept, but use only two architectures as opposed to three with the X30. The X20 and X25 have two Cortex-A72 cores and two quad-core banks of Cortex-A53 cores with different clock rates. The Helio X25, which is exclusive to the Android-based Meizu Pro 6 smartphone, clocks the Cortex-A72 cores higher to 2.5GHz instead of 2.3GHz and has a faster 850MHz version of the Mali T880 MP4 GPU. Cortex-A73 cores should provide a 30 percent better sustained performance and efficiency than Cortex-A72, claims ARM, which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank. The tiny, 0.65 x 0.65mm design, which has been licensed by HiSilicon and Marvell, in addition to MediaTek, features an Artemis microarchitecture borrowed from the rarely used Cortex-A17 chip. Artemis emphasizes “sustained performance,” which means that mobile devices can maintain peak performance for longer periods before being forced to throttle down due to heat buildup. The Helio X30 also features power-efficient Cortex-A35 cores for its low-end cluster. According to ARM, Cortex-A35 draws about 33 percent less power per core and occupies 25 percent less silicon area, compared to Cortex-A53. The -A35 is not as power efficient as the new, IoT-focused Cortex-A32, which is slower, but smaller and more efficient. Cortex-A32 is the first ARMv8 chip that works only in 32-bit mode. Coming Up: Apple A10 and Snapdragon 821 According to PhoneRadar, the Helio X30 won’t ship for another year, either at the end of the second quarter or the beginning of the third. A lot can happen in that time, including the upcoming Apple A10 due in the iPhone 7, which is said to be fabricated at 10nm as well. The latest rumors has Apple sticking with two Cortex-A72 or -A73-like cores, following the minimalist design of the dual-core, 16nm Apple A9/A9X. Previously, the A10 was rumored to have between three and six cores. In AnTuTu benchmarks the dual-core Apple A9 has beat most other Android-targeted mobile SoCs with many more cores. The A9 was edged out only by Qualcomm’s quad-core, 14nm Snapdragon 820, which has four Cortex-A72 like “Kyro” cores, although the 14nm, octa-core Samsung Exynos 8890 was close behind. In other benchmarks, the A9 has beaten the Helio X20 and X25. It’s unclear whether Apple has proven that high core counts don’t matter or whether Big.Little dual- and tri-cluster SoC designs have yet to evolve to their full potential. Battery life and other considerations are also important. It remains to be seen how these complex multi-core designs are following through on promises to offer smoother transitions between operation modes like high-power video and VR, standard text and voice, and sleep/idle. Meanwhile, with the move to VR and augmented reality, GPUs are becoming almost as important as CPUs. Indeed Imagination’s PowerVR 7XT is expected to beat out the the Helio X20’s ARM Mali GPU in high-end gaming. MediaTek cares more about competition on high-end Android devices than it does about Apple. Principally, this comes down to Qualcomm and Samsung, with upstarts like Kirin advancing from below. Qualcomm recently introduced a modest upgrade to the Snapdragon 820 called the Snapdragon 821. Due to arrive in devices later this year, the SoC is claimed to offer 10 percent faster performance and provide better battery life than the 820. Intel’s Kaby Lake Stays at 14nm If all had gone according to plan it would be Intel, not MediaTek, announcing the first 10nm processor this month. Last month, Intel began shipping its seventh-generation Kaby Lake core processors, but with few details. We do know that the 7th Gen Core CPUs, which were originally meant to debut a 10nm process, will instead stick with the same 14nm process used by the sixth-gen Skylake and fifth-gen Broadwell chips. Intel’s ditching of its traditional “tick-tock” product release cadence is a sign that the Moore’s Law pace of chip miniaturization is slowing. Still Intel’s 10nm “Cannonlake” is expected in 2017, and on the ARM side, TSMC is already working on a 7nm process. The actual transistor density of the 7nm design is expected to be very similar to the 10nm Intel process, however. Meanwhile, Kaby Lake should offer incremental performance improvements over Skylake while squashing some of the bugs that have nipped at Skylake’s heels. We’ll find out more next week at the Intel Developer Forum. One thing Kaby Lake won’t be is a mobile processor, unless you count high-end tablets and all-in-ones. Intel appears to have dropped future development on its 14nm “Cherry Trail” Atom SoCs, which failed to win over many phone vendors, although more embedded-oriented SoCs like the “Braswell” Celeron, Pentium, and Atom x5-e8000 continue to do well.

TAIWAN RECOMMENDED MOST READ RECENT COMMENTS MOST COMMENTED NEWS SECTIONS TOP STORIES TAIWAN CHINA BUSINESS WORLD ASIA SPORTS EDITORIAL COMMENTARY LIFE HEALTH MOVIES ART & LEISURE CLOSE TAB Site Search Submit SEARCH BY DATE CLOSE TAB Text Size Small Medium Large CLOSE TAB Shares end down but recoup part of earlier losses Tweet SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     CNA August 12, 2016, 12:31 am TWN TAIPEI--Shares in Taiwan closed lower Thursday at a time of concern over stiff technical resistance after a recent strong showing, but the weighted index recovered part of its earlier losses in late-session bargain hunting, dealers said. <a href="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE"><img src="http://ax-d.pixfuture.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=537134883&cs=fb1025fdcc&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> The bellwether electronics sector led the downturn, with selling focusing on Apple concept stocks after a research report said that Apple Inc. has pressured component suppliers to cut prices, the dealers said. Market sentiment was also hurt by sales reports released by contract chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電) and contract electronics supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. (鴻海) that disappointed the market, while selling in select financial stocks also pushed down the broader market, they added. The weighted index on the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 68.59 points, or 0.75 percent, at 9,131.83, after moving between 9,063.81 and 9,187.18, on turnover of NT$92.44 billion (US$1.95 billion). Knee-jerk Reaction to a Weaker Wall Street The market opened down 0.34 percent in a knee-jerk reaction to a weaker Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.20 percent and the S&P 500 index ended 0.29 percent lower on a fall in international crude oil prices overnight, the dealers said. Selling on the local main board escalated, sending the weighted index to the day's low, with Apple suppliers in focus. Investors took cues from a research report about lower prices the U.S. consumer electronics giant paid to these suppliers, and some bargain hunters then turned active, which helped the broader market climb from the low by the end of the session, they said. “The main board breached the 9,200-point level a day earlier, a target many investors had previously set,” KGI Securities analyst Phil Chu said. “It was understandable that these investors tended to pocket their profits and run today.” Chu said that investors used the research report released by U.S.-based RBC Capital Markets about Apple's move to seek discounts from its suppliers as a reason to cut their holdings in Apple concept stocks throughout the session. According to the report, Apple has been pushing for price reductions from a number of its suppliers in a bid to take on foreign exchange losses and maintain its gross margin. Apple Concept Stocks Among the Apple concept stocks, smartphone camera lens maker Largan Precision Co.(大立光) fell 1.83 percent to close at NT$3,750.00 but remained the most expensive stock in Taiwan, while Catcher Technology Co. (可成) lost 1.87 percent to end at NT$209.50. Hon Hai, an assembler of iPhones and iPads, dropped 0.56 percent to close at NT$89.50, after the manufacturer reported lower-than-expected sales for July, but the stock recovered from an early low of NT$88.40. TSMC, the most heavily weighted stock in the local equity market, shed 1.67 percent to end at NT$176.50, also due to market disappointment over its July sales. Led by TSMC's losses, the bellwether electronics sector closed down 1.05 percent, and the semiconductor sub-index ended down 1.30 percent. The Financial Sector In the financial sector, which closed 0.64 percent lower, Cathay Financial Holding Co. (國泰金) fell 1.05 percent to end at NT$37.60, and Fubon Financial Holding Co. (富邦金) lost 1.07 percent to close at NT$41.55. Bucking the downturn on the broader market, food maker Uni-President Enterprises Corp. (統一) rose 0.63 percent to end at NT$64.20, and Eclat Textile Co. (儒鴻) gained 6.03 percent to close at NT$387.00. “Despite the fall by the close, the index came off an early low by recovering more than half of its earlier losses, which means that some investors remained willing to hunt bargains,” Chu said. “I remain upbeat about the market movement in the near future and believe an uptrend will continue after the current volatility, since the main board has been awash in liquidity with no signs of any immediate withdrawal by foreign investors,” Chu said. He added that whenever the index falls and moves closer to the strong technical support level at around 9,050 points, investors could find a good buying moment.

Thursday, August 11, 2016 [Tweets] [Favorites] Emoji in iOS 10 and Sierra Apple: More than one hundred new and redesigned emoji characters will be available to iPhone and iPad users this fall with iOS 10. This exciting update brings more gender options to existing characters, including new female athletes and professionals, adds beautiful redesigns of popular emoji, a new rainbow flag and more family options. Benjamin Mayo: The emoji depicting people and faces now use a new gradient style to give them a visual refresh. The default yellow face emoji now look more artistic and less like ‘Simpsons’. In fact, they look more like traditional emoticons from chatrooms. Glenn Fleishman: The new public betas now include 10 additional families: every combination of single mom and single dad with one and two children across gender binaries. I’m not sure what families with more than two children use for emoji, but there you go—these are both symbolic and concrete at once. Technically, these new families involve coding of combinations of emoji using Zero Width Joiners (ZWJs), which Jason explains in detail in his column. When you open an iOS Pages document containing the new families using El Capitan, those combos are revealed, such as a woman, a boy, and a girl instead of the all-in-one single mom plus one boy and girl emoji. Apple has also added gender variants for all sports and professions in which a male or ostensibly non-gendered figure was provided before. There’s now a basketball player with cropped hair and one with a ponytail and the slighest suggestion of breasts. For swimmers, the male and female differ between a partial unclothed male torso and a swimsuit on the female version. […] Now, Apple hasn’t gone that far. It’s still in the hills above the uncanny valley. But compare the before and after faces, and you’ll see a more definitive expression than the previous drawings. The emoji look like someone specific, instead of a generic impression. (The new “woman” emoji looks eerily similar to a tech reporter friend; I shared it with her and she agreed.) Jeremy Burge (via Jason Snell, Hacker News): Pistol emoji has changed from a realistic-looking gun in iOS 9.3 to a bright green toy water gun in the iOS 10 beta. In the history of running Emojipedia, I have never seen an emoji change so poorly received. […] If Apple goes ahead with this change in the public iOS 10 release, one person could innocently tweet a toy and have that be seen by others as a weapon. […] All other vendors display this emoji as a real gun. teddyh: The unicode code chart actually says “PISTOL = handgun, revolver”, and the reference glyph (with a larger version on page 4) is pretty clearly a Beretta M9. John Gruber: Intriguingly, Microsoft is switching their pistol emoji from a toy sci-fi ray guy to a realistic revolver. And Ben Sandofsky argues that the new emoji should be a variant, not a replacement, to avoid the ambiguity of the glyph conveying a very different meaning depending on the recipient’s OS. Benjamin Mayo (tweet): With previous iOS versions, Apple presented this emoji as an actual gunmetal pistol. With iOS 10, they’ve changed it to a green toy water gun. I don’t like how they have handled this. This has nothing to do with the associated political implications of free speech and everything to do with the way Apple has implemented this technically. My personal qualm is that Apple has distorted the integrity of the Emoji language by replacing the glyph for a character which has a very different meaning. A toy water gun depicts very different intentions than a real gun. John Gruber: While I’m on it, I’ve heard from a little birdie that Apple’s new water pistol glyph was in fact changed from left-pointing to right-pointing, but only in internal-to-Apple builds of iOS. The idea was to make the water pistol pair well with the “splashing sweat” symbol, which to date has been rendered left-to-right. But because flipping the gun direction changes the meaning when it’s paired with any other emoji to its left, it was decided that it would be easier to flip the direction of the splashing emoji and leave the pistol left-pointing. If Apple does change the splash direction, it will also pair better with the much-beloved eggplant. Carl Franzen: In this case, the change to the squirt gun emoji comes nearly a year after a social media campaign called #DisarmTheiPhone was launched by advocacy group New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, with the goal of pressuring Apple to drop support for the revolver emoji. Previously, Apple was reported to have pressured the emoji masters of the universe —the Unicode consortium, an international standards body — to drop plans to add a rifle emoji to the set. Jason Snell: There are now around a thousand base emojis and tens of thousands of variations. One day, in a dark mood, I wondered: What are the least-loved emojis? I checked out the live stats on emojitracker.com and asked Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia for his site’s least-favorite emojis. The result is this list: The world’s least-loved emojis. Stephanie Studer (via Hacker News): Kim Uryong, a professor of communication at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, says emoji are South Korea’s “third language” (after Korean and English) – worthy, he thinks, of their own dictionary. […] Stickers give cadence and character, punch-lines and punctuation, to South Korean text-speak. They act as qualifiers that inflect words with humour or sadness; they also establish an intimacy that most would shy away from in face-to-face dialogue. Many appeal for forgiveness. A dog called Frodo, one of KakaoTalk’s signature characters, proffers a bouquet of roses on one knee while perspiring. […] Emoji in South Korea and Japan tend towards over-dramatisation, irony and self-mockery. They appeal not just to the young but also to middle-aged office workers looking to smooth awkward or delicate situations with bosses, colleagues and family members. One sticker set revolves around “Salaryman Mr Ho”, who veers between slumping over his desk from exhaustion surrounded by energy drinks, spinning gleefully in the CEO’s chair, and crying with rage. Kim’s recent hits include a crotchety grandmother who curses a lot – a softer way for chat-app users to swear in front of their elders – and a loving father-daughter set in which the girl gently admonishes her dad. Kim says wives use such stickers to show their disapproval of their husbands’ behaviour – when they’ve been out drinking late, for example. See also: Hacker News. Update (2016-08-13): Becky Hansmeyer: As I seek to understand more about the popularity of stickers in messaging apps (hint: they’re more than just big emoji!), I thought I’d share some of the interesting articles I’ve come across. Update (2016-08-15): Pierre Lebeaupin: When I first heard of the change, I was already skeptical, and after pondering it some more, I have reason to think the benefits are not worth the costs. To begin with, by doing it this way Apple makes the change retroactive. Any piece of text (email, text message, blog post, article, photo caption, or of course tweet) with a pistol emoji has now had its meaning retroactively changed when viewed on the latest iOS 10 beta. This change does not just affect newly received messages: any time the pistol emoji was used in the last few years will be affected by this change. It’s not clear to me that there even is a benefit. I suppose the idea is that Apple, the company that made the 1984 ad, thinks that Newspeak emoji would reduce real-world violence. I’m not aware of any evidence that would support that hypothesis, and any potential effect might actually be reversed by the ambiguity the change introduces with other platforms.

It was rumored that the next version of the wearable would be unveiled at WWDC 2016, but the event didn’t bring any updates. However, a new report from KGI Securities analytst Ming-Chi Kuo, obtained by AppleInsider, sheds some light on the second coming of the Apple Watch. It’s slated to arrive later this year, along with an updated version of the original. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat The Apple Watch 2 is said to share the same design as its predecessor, but will get a GPS radio and barometer for improved geolocation capabilities. It’ll also have a larger battery to better support the new components – but its bulk will prevent Apple from slimming the new watch’s profile. The other addition to the lineup will be an iterative upgrade from the first Apple Watch – bringing improved intervals like a faster 16nm processor from TSMC and enhanced waterproofing. We also heard rumors earlier this year about LTE support coming to the Apple Watch. Kuo expects that to arrive only in 2017, which means you won’t see a model capable of receiving phone calls and data on its own this year. A redesign of the wearable may only happen in 2018. If that’s all that Apple can bring to the table in the next couple of years, I can’t say I’m excited by the prospect of a new Apple Watch. The predicted future versions only list incremental improvements in features – but nothing revolutionary. Similarly, there isn’t any mention of a major increase in battery life, which is a bummer given that the current version runs out of power in a day. That doesn’t mean that people won’t buy the next Apple Watch, of course. But if Kuo’s right about the upcoming models, Apple will once again miss an opportunity in 2016 to make smartwatches the norm for tech enthusiasts.

A star rating system isn’t new and we’ve seen this applied to various rating systems for movies, video games, and so on. However could it be that Apple has decided that maybe they don’t want to rely on the star system anymore? As spotted by Kirkville, in iTunes 12.5 and iOS 10, there does not appear to be the option to give star ratings anymore. In iTunes 12.5, users can still enable the star rating system, although it is no longer there by default, suggesting that Apple could be trying to phase it out. On iOS 10, it is a different story as the star system is gone completely. In a way this makes sense. With Apple Music, Apple gave users the option of liking a song by giving it a “heart”. As per our previous report, iTunes 12.5 also introduced the ability to “dislike” a song, meaning that when it comes to rating a song, it’s a more binary process of either you like it or you dislike it, versus the star system where a 4/5 could mean you like it, but maybe not as much as a 5/5, or maybe a little bit more than a 3/5. A binary system would make it easier for Apple Music’s recommendation algorithm to decide what songs you do or do not like. It is possible that since this is in beta that the star system could return in the final build, but in the meantime if it doesn’t, would you be sad to see it go? Filed in Apple.

SCOUT Share & Embed Odell Beckham shows Eli Apple tricks of trade Larry Stansbury 08/11/2016 The rookie cornerback is learning the nuances of his position from none other than Odell Beckham Jr. Eli Apple’s Thoughts about the Preseason Game This Friday and JPP             This Friday is the preseason debut for Eli Apple and he couldn't be more stocked. The New York Giants cornerback had to play against Odell Beckham Jr. during training camp and wow, did he take him back to school. You can tell Apple has learned so much for going against his teammate.             “He has taught me how to read routes better and he will tell me things from a receiver perspective, like what receivers look for and little things like that, so he can help me out with just the top of the route stuff.” Apple said during a media session. “He has really been on me about and just telling me to trust my talent and get my head around. Little things like that we have been talking about all the time, so he has been helping me out a lot actually.”             During the play, Apple has improved himself as a cornerback by prepping during practice and now after repetition, it has come naturally for him. After playing against Beckham Jr., he is fully equipped and now privy tor all Beckham’s tricks on the field. Beckham is not the only player that Apple has admired, Jason Pierre-Paul is the unquestioned leader on the defense.             “He is an energizer bunny out there on the field. He is the one that is always bringing the energy. Even on walkthroughs, he is going full speed. He is a funny guy off the field and he is definitely the man around here, so I am just trying to pick up everything from him that he tells me to do, and I just make sure to do it full speed like him.”             You can tell that the camp is really wraps up for the players and they are continuing to develop themselves for Friday’s game. There are ready for Friday’s preseason game.             “Yeah, I think everybody wants to do well. Of course, it is preseason, everybody is going to be watching, it is the first real live action when you can hit somebody, so I am interested. Of course, it is football, it is something you have done your entire life and you just want to play well.”    Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Best Rivalry Trophies in College Football Talib's Return Will Spark Denver's Defense FOX Sports Radio: The Giants Beat Army Ground-Launched Hellfire Attacks Drone What We Learned: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final The Giants Beat Top Stories Beyond the Boxscore: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final While most fans had their eyes on the boxscore following the game, the Giants Beat digs a little deeper to reveal the variables and factors that dictated the outcome in Week 11. by Alex Evans The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:31 PM Unheralded Heroes: Week 11 Edition The Giants Beat covers the players whose contributions were overlooked during Sunday's win. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:12 PM What We Learned: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final The Giants Beat recaps the major takeaways from the Giants narrow win over the Bears. by Scott Thompson The Giants BeatMonday at 1:18 PM FOX Sports Radio: The Giants BeatThe Giants Beat publisher hosted a two-hour FOX Sports Radio show in New Jersey talking about the Giants and the rest of the NFL. by Staff The Giants BeatMonday at 12:44 PM Game Balls and Goats: Week 11 Edition The NY Giants have won their fifth straight game with a 22-16 victory over the Chicago Bears at MetLife Stadium. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatSunday at 2:45 PM Fantasy Slant: Week 11 Recap The New York Giants improved to 7-3 on the season, winning a 22-16 squeaker in windy conditions at MetLife stadium.

About Portfolio Photos Blog Pico Facebook Twitter Tumblr Instagram RSS Should Apple Buy Netflix? Posted August 11, 2016 by Om Malik I was on Leo Laporte’s TWIT show yesterday and ended up going on a bit of a rant about Apple and “Planet of the Apps.” My view on “content” efforts like this is pretty simple. It is distracting, non-core to Apple and basically avoids the bigger challenges: how to add data and Internet DNA into a company that has managed to struggle with services. The App Store needs more smarts and better search, and it needs to take a contemporary, data-centric approach to surfacing apps. “Planet of the Apps” is just an old media-like thinking applied to “apps.” I might be the only one who feels that way, but the reality is that these kinds of efforts are really not good for Apple at a time when it is competing with Google, Amazon and Facebook. Apple—if it really wants to get into content and wants to make a strong statement to the Hollywood establishment that has stymied its television efforts so far—should make a big, bold bet. It should use its massive stock market capitalization and cash hoard to buy Netflix. Apple is currently valued at $584 billion and it can afford Netflix, which is valued at around $42 billion. This is a way better use of its financial resources than spending $58 billion on stock buybacks over the next two years. Apple already has spent $117 billion on stock buybacks since 2012 and given out $46 billion in dividends. That is more than enough to buy Tesla. What does Apple get with Netflix? It gets a large library, and a company that has presence on all major platforms and has partnered with most (if not all) major entertainment hardware makers and is well represented in the Android ecosystem. It has established relationships with top broadband providers and has a big infrastructure to support its nearly 83 million subscribers. It already is an established brand—but most importantly, it brings some much-needed Internet DNA into Apple. Netflix’s engineering and cloud teams are amongst the best in the business and have contributed to the modern cloud movement. In more ways than one, they could help add the vital Internet and cloud DNA to Apple, which seems to be fairly serious about its services business. Like this: Like Loading...

Ben Estep (XMFShazam) Aug 11, 2016 at 7:23PM Source: Fitbit Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) is the world's leading tech wearables company and continues to grow at a rapid pace. Despite their industry standing, the company's stock price has sharply declined over the last year, down over 50% from its 52-week high of $45.25, due to concerns over growing competition and its future growth and profitability. I think the market's concerns over Fitbit's future are overblown and, with the stock close to its all-time lows, I recently bought it at what I thought was an attractive price with plans to hold for several years. The Market Share Leader Competition in the wearables space has heated up over the last several years with the arrival of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch, Xiaomi's Mi Band and many fitness tracking devices launched by smaller companies. Even with growing competition, Fitbit remained the dominant player with 24.5% of market share in the first quarter of 2016 . The closest competitors were Xiaomi, with 19% market share, and Apple, with 7.5% market share. It's important to note there are vast differences between the product mix offered by each of these companies. Source: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Wearables Tracker Apple offers two products, the Watch, prices range from $549 to $1099, and the recently launched Watch Sport, prices range from $299 to $349 . Xiaomi's only fitness tracking device is the Mi Band, which is priced at $14.99 , and offers limited features compared to Fitbit and Apple. Fitbit differentiates its product assortment from Apple and Xiaomi in several key ways, which should help it retain its market share. First, it currently offer 8 products, ranging from simple tracking devices to smartwatches. Fitbit's newer products provide continuous heart-rate monitoring, on-screen workouts, connected GPS, automatic sleep tracking, and more. It's newest product, Blaze, provides similar functionality to the Apple Watch, but costs $100 less and has a battery that lasts five days versus Apple Watch's 18 hours of life.  Second, its products' prices range from $59.95 to $249.95, occupying a price niche between its two closest competitors. Finally, Fitbit is accessible on 200+ phones, including Android, iOS and Windows operating systems – more than any other fitness tracker on the market.   Plenty of Room to Grow There have been growing concerns that the market for fitness bands and tracking devices is reaching saturation, but there's evidence that the category (and the value of Fitbit's share of it) has plenty of room to grow. According to IDC, a global provider of market intelligence, worldwide shipments of wearables are expected to reach 101.9 million units by the end of 2016 and continue growing at a compound annual growth rate of 20.3% over the next 4 years. IDC expects 213.6 million units in the wearables category to be shipped in 2020. This estimate includes clothing and eyewear, but watches and wristbands should still be major categories with an expected 80% share of the wearables units shipped in 2020.  Fitbit proved it can continue to create popular products with the success of the recently launched Blaze and Alta, which accounted for 54% of the company's revenue in the second quarter of 2016. I think Fitbit could remain the market share leader over the next several years as they continue launching new devices, which should allow them to maintain their share, or even capture more of the quickly growing wearables market. Building A Social Experience Fitbit's competitive advantage isn't limited to product features -- the company's apps and social experience create a powerful network effect. According to Fitbit CEO James Park: The robust social experience in the Fitbit app is another key part of our success, and it's created a competitive mode supported by the network effect of our large active user community. We believe people are more likely to buy a Fitbit over a competitor, because their friends and family are more likely to be already participating in the Fitbit social experience.  By year-end 2015, active users in the app increased 152% year over year, with 16.9 million active users out of 29 million registered device users. The company also added 1,000 Fitbit Wellness enterprise customers, who traditionally have purchased large quantities of devices or subsidized employee purchases through discounts and encouraged active use.   Attractive Valuation The price-to-sales ratio, or P/S ratio, is a valuation measure calculated by dividing a company's market cap by its revenue. It could be an indicator a company is undervalued when compared to company's in a similar industry. Forward price-to-earnings, or forward P/E, is another valuation measure calculated by dividing the stock price by analyst estimates of future earnings per share. In the most recent quarter, Fitbit had a P/S ratio of 1.51 and forward P/E of 13.24, compared to 2.85 and 18.65 for the S&P Information Technology Index. Potential Acquisition Target That attractive valuation, plus the fact that the company has no long-term debt, is experiencing rapid revenue growth (46.5% YOY in last quarter), and has plenty of cash ($535 million), means Fitbit could become an acquisition target. In the past, Apple, Garmin, Samsung, and Under Armour had been mentioned as potential acquirers. Fitbit has significantly increased R&D and SG&A expenses over the last several years and an acquirer could realize substantial cost savings by cutting from these areas, making the acquisition more attractive. I didn't invest expecting an acquisition, but I'm not ruling out the possibility. As I stated earlier, I think a lot of the market's concerns over Fitbit's future growth are overblown. Fitness tracking devices and wearables will continue to be an extremely competitive market, but I think Fitbit is positioned to continue leading the category. Ben Estep owns shares of Fitbit.

"Our investment in Sharp has completed all necessary reviews by the relevant governments, and our company and Sharp will now move to complete the transaction in accordance with our agreement as soon as possible," Foxconn said. Like Us on Facebook Advertisement Sharp confirmed that it has received the cash infusion from Foxconn, or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, in new syndicated loans from two Japanese banks. At the same time, the Taiwanese company assumed a 66 percent stake in the Osaka-based firm. With the deal completed, Sharp's CEO Kozo Takahashi, who apologized to shareholders in June for failing to live up to their expectations, resigned from his post and Tai Jeng-wu, the right hand of Foxconn founder Terry Gou, was appointed following a board meeting scheduled on Saturday. The Financial Times reported that under Foxconn, Sharp is bracing for radical changes with Guo signaling the need to cut down the Japanese company's workforce. This contrasts his statement before the deal about the need to keep employees. Sharp, which is famous for its consumer-electronic products, incurred massive losses for the second-straight year in the year which ended in March. It faced hurdles as its consumer-electronics business encountered fierce competition from other Asian brands and it also became too dependent on the volatile display panel business for growth, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Siri Gives Funny Responses To Pokemon Go Questions Matthew Mueller - 08/13/2016 3 comments share Newsletter Share on Facebook Tweet This Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Pin to Pinterest Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of You knew it was only a matter of time before Apple's Siri weighed in on the phenomenon that is Pokemon GO, and it turns out she has a lot to say about the subject. Even Siri needed time to put her thoughts together, though, so initially if you asked her about the game she wouldn't know what to say. Now if you ask about Pokemon GO you'll get a range of responses (via Mac Rumors). For example, if you ask "Do you like Pokemon GO", Siri might reply "Look, there's Jigglypuff behind you! Oh wait, it's Wigglytuff. I always get those two mixed up." You also might get "Snorlax. Zzzz. Sorry, what was the question?" or "I know it's my destiny." If you ask "What's your favorite Pokemon?" instead, you could get one of several answers. Those include "Higgledy Piggledy", Geodude, dude", or "That yellow species with an electrostatic tail of variable angles is rather cute." Siri seems to really like Pikachu, but then again who doesn't? Cheeky responses aren't the only things Siri can help you with in regards to Pokemon GO. Thanks to sources like Wolfram Alpha, Siri can also answer your Pokemon specific questions. For example, if you ask "What kind of Pokemon is Pikachu?", she'll answer "Pikachu is an electric Pokemon", or if you inquire about Snorlax's abilities, she'll say "it looks like the answer is Gluttony." Well played Siri, well played. As time goes on, expect more and more responses from Siri to show up online, but in the meantime, go ahead and give it a try.
