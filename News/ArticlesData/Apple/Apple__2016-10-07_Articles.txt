However, that of Apple is expected to pick up next year, while that of Microsoft will still be struggling to grow. Apple’s combination of macOS and iOS in 2017 which is expected to power iPhones and Macs will come in second behind Windows in the category of devices that were shipped in 2016. The gap that exists between the two is expected to slightly widen in 2018. Gartner in a forecast it gave to Computerworld where it broke down operating systems said that 260 million devices will be powered by Windows and shipped before 2016 comes to an end, which results in 12% decline through the year. For the 260 million devices, it represents 11.2% out of the total 2.3 billion in devices that run Google’s Android overwhelmingly.

The firm in March this year made a projection that the total number of devices that will be shipped this year will be 2.4 billion out of which 283 million will be powered by Windows representing 11.7%. There has been a documentation of the Microsoft’s operating system that has been experiencing shrinking share. Windows made an improvement this year after Microsoft gave up on the fight it has with Google and Apple by stepping out the smartphones market. Both macOS and iOS will account for the 259 million devices shipped this year alone which represents 11.1%. This is a decline from last year’s 278 million and a further decrease of 14% from the protection made in March this year. The reason for this is due to the sale of iPhone which is the major device that Apple is concentrating its effort on.

On Windows part, it is projected to further drop by 3% resulting in 253 million in the year 2017, but will regain a little to 254 million in 2018. The projections made by Gartner for 2017 for all devices this year have been quite gloomy. They also added that smartphones category that has seen positive growth will witness decline in some segments. The smartphones, the firm projects a 1.1% decline of premium smartphones shipment, blaming it on Apple’s inability to maintain growth after the arrival of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Source:computerworld.com The firm says it is very worried about Microsoft being that the company has always depended on shipment of personal computer that has not been seeing a growth in recent times. Also Read: OnePlus 4, iPhone 8, Surface Phone, Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 Will Debut Next Year Gartner is of the opinion that there will be a continuous contract of PC-like devices and that they will shrink at the end of the year by 8%, but that it will pick up a little in 2017 with 0.4% gain and in will in 2018 see 3% gain. Gartner has been projecting for tablets, smartphones, PCs and hybrids but has not delved into such things as smart watches, Apple TV and streaming devices.

Anirban Ghoshal, Hindustan Times, New Delhi |  Updated: Oct 08, 2016 22:46 IST People wait outside an Apple store during the launch of iPhone 7 at Ambience Mall, in Gurgaon. (Parveen Kumar/HT Photo) Don’t be too disappointed if you couldn’t get your hands on the latest iPhone 7 after standing hours in queue outside a local Apple outlet on Friday evening. For one, thousands of fellow-Indians are in the same boat. The smartphone’s long-awaited countrywide launch was marred by complaints that Apple failed to provide enough units to Indian consumers, resulting in its black-coloured variants being sold for a premium of up to Rs 40,000 in the grey market. “There was a dire shortage of the product this time, and I had to cancel several pre-orders for customers who only wanted its black variants,” a retailer told HT on the condition of anonymity. “The demand for jet black editions of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is really high. However, Apple has been able to provide very few units of that kind – the ratio of orders and units received in that regard is 100:1.” Grey market operators had been holding on to their stock in anticipation of Saturday’s sale, he said. “From early that morning, they began selling the products at a premium of anywhere between Rs 10,000 and Rs 40,000.” This is not the first instance of Apple failing to meet the customers’ demand for its hottest product. Initial stocks of the iPhone 7 Plus were sold out globally just days after its launch. While every colour variant of the iPhone 7 Plus disappeared in a blink, it was the jet black version of its smaller cousin that was the first to be swiped off the shelves. Though all Apple stores have run out of stock, customers continue to place online orders for the models they desire. “We sincerely appreciate our customers’ patience as we work hard to get the new iPhone into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible,” Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said in a statement. But India seems to be a different ball game, with retailers alleging corruption in the allocation process. “Many units were deliberately moved to the grey market, so more profits could be reaped through the creation of a false demand. Meanwhile, customers had to return home empty-handed,” another retailer told HT. While police were reportedly summoned to a GK-1 store to control the mob of customers, large crowds were also witnessed at Apple outlets in Cyber Hub, DLF Promenade and Connaught Place. Another retailer said an Apple outlet was supposed to open at Nehru Place in tandem with the launch, but was forced to keep its shutters down owing to unavailability of units. “A second shop was forced open by the company, but it sold just a couple of handsets as a formality,” he added. Experts, however, discounted the conspiracy theory. “It may be part of a strategy shift. Apple is probably trying to sell more of its products in tier-2 and tier-3 cities through online partner Flipkart,” an analyst said. Retailers did not agree. “As far as we know, Apple had allocated 1.25 lakh units for India – out of which 70,000 made it here. However, only 10,000 units were shared with big Apple partners. So what happened to the rest of the stock? Did all of these go to the online partner?” one of the retailers asked. The Cupertino-headquartered giant plans to sell five lakh units in the first 15 days after the launch, he added. While Redington, Ingram and Beetel are the key iPhone distributors in India, Futureworld and iZenica are its top resellers. Apple refused to comment on the matter.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Big-Little Apple Festival helps rejuvenate Killingly Grange Saturday Oct 8, 2016 at 5:32 PM Oct 8, 2016 at 5:32 PM Francesca Kefalas For The Bulletin DAYVILLE — Aaron Brouillard had his own ideas of how to play the bean bag toss at Killingly Grange’s third annual Big-Little Apple Festival. Anyone else interested in playing Saturday was willing to let the 2-year-old use the toss as everything from a slide to a jump ramp and a secret hiding place for the bean bags. “He’s having a great time here,” said Aaron’s mom, April Phillips, of Canterbury. “I like to come and support the grange when I can.” Organizer John Bennett said the event was conceived as a way to highlight the grange during The Last Green Valley’s Walktober. The event featured live music from The Frost Brothers, accompanied by some friends and family, an apple pancake breakfast, cider donuts, apple sauerkraut hot dogs and vendors featuring canned and pickled foods and crafts. “This really is a way to help rejuvenate the grange,” Bennett said. “We may have recruited a few new members today.” Granges support the small, local family farm, Bennett said — “And the traditions those farms are carrying on,” he added. In addition to trying to revive interest in the grange, Bennett said the Apple Festival has also given the grange a platform to promote its other events, such as its Bluegrass Concert Series. The next concert is at 7 p.m. Oct. 22, he said. Doors open at 5 p.m. and dinner is served all night long. Stanley Zadora, of Rogers, said he enjoys coming to the festival as a vendor to sell his pickled items. “I like to support the grange,” Zadora said. “And I like to support my hobby.” Ilma Tikkanen comes from Rhode Island to sell her jams, jellies and canned items. “You start to see some familiar faces and you get to know people,” Tikkanen said. James Easton, of North Windham, not only comes to sell his carved wooden crafts, but to demonstrate how he makes them. “I like the people,” Easton said. “I love meeting the people who stop to talk.” Grant Bombia, of Norwich, was attending his first Apple Festival at the grange as a vendor. Bombia makes brooms the old-fashioned way, from sticks. “It’s been a very good day,” he said.

Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Monday 14th November 2016 | Cambridge, UK Menu News Comment Science Features Culture Reviews Music Fashion Theatre Sport Write for us Jack-offs: the problem with the new iPhone earphones Apple veers off into the wrong direction by Christian Harvey Saturday October 8 2016, 10:00pm Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp The aux cord. The jack. The plug. Since 1878, there has been a universal standard for audio, shared by your headphones, your car stereo, your dad’s absurdly expensive liquid-cooled speakers – and you’re probably using it right now. The noble 3.5mm headphone jack has served generations of listeners, and it should continue to serve generations to come. But Apple, facing declining phone sales and increased competition, has decided to destroy literally centuries of tradition. They call it “innovative”, they call it “magical”, they call it anything other than what it is – a cash grab. Indeed, the decision to remove the headphone jack from their latest flagship phone, the iPhone 7, has caused some controversy among those with two brain cells. Not many companies could release a phone with the same thickness, and fewer features, and then call it an upgrade – but Apple is willing to wager that it can. They could be right. This is not Apple’s first controversial removal. When they removed the Ethernet port from the Powerbooks, users complained – similarly with disk drives from the MacBook. They have constantly pushed against the boundaries of existing technologies to create a sleeker future. Can they do it again? In short – no. Ethernet had been superseded by Wi-Fi. DVDs were making way for the now ubiquitous USB flash drive. What, then, can replace a connector that everyone already has? One of two choices that would make Pyrrhus flinch: either use the iPhone’s single lightning connector, or stick a toothbrush in your ear. Yes, the AirPods – yours for the low, low price of £159 – offer the exact same dreadful quality and terrible in-ear feel of the out-of-the-box EarPods, with the revolutionary feature of getting lost if you turn your head too quickly. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_wImaGRkNY). And best of all, they have a battery life of five hours! No more long study sessions, movie marathons or, heck, picking up your headphones in the morning and assuming they’ll work – with this revolutionary new feature, you’ll never finish a Wagner symphony again. Apple's headphones are uncomfortable, overpriced and just sound badChristian Harvey Fine, but those are optional (very optional when you’re a broke student). Just use the included headphones and don’t complain, right? This option assumes that you will never need to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. That means no long road trips, blasting your summer playlist, no more falling asleep with your favourite ASMR channel, no more powerbanks. And it means that you have to buy Lightning headphones – and this is where the whole idea becomes a farce. Remember the last time you pulled your headphones out of your phone and plugged them into your laptop? Apple doesn’t make a single laptop with a Lightning jack. So even if you were fine with being locked into using Apple products forever, you couldn’t bend over if you wanted to. You may say that they will add Lightning jacks in a future refresh: but the new Macbook (yes, the one with only one port to do everything including charging) uses USB-C, which is basically Lightning without Apple getting licensing fees every time someone builds a device with that in it. Their lineup is fractured by design. This is perhaps Cook’s Machiavellian intention. By demanding its users buy Lightning headphones, Apple creates its own market. A market where they get a cut of every single pair of headphones sold. It is important to note at this point that Beats (which Apple owns) are the only third party that currently makes wireless headphones – and they are also suitably overpriced. Apple wants to control every single facet of the user experience – especially the wallet-opening procedure. It is this that is the only convincing reason to buy into this line of accessories – the somewhat utopian idea that Apple will create a world without headphone wires, with seamless pairing, and with an actual replacement. But that world is not the iPhone 7. Vote with your wallet.

In an 8-3 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone. Together, the two cases are the remnants of a global legal battle between the world's biggest makers of smartphones that began in April 2011 and at one point spanned four continents. In this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to make phone calls. The bulk of the award, $98.7 million, was for the detection patent that the earlier panel said wasn't infringed. The February decision also said the other two patents were invalid. That was a wrong decision, the court ruled Friday, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. The opinion was a surprise -- the court never announced that it would consider the case before all active judges prior to issuing the opinion. In a dissent, Circuit Judge Timothy Dyk objected to the full court opting to take on the case without allowing additional legal arguments, saying the majority opinion results in "profound changes" in the analysis of whether patents cover obvious variations of earlier ideas. The three judges who objected to the majority opinion were the same ones who had thrown out the verdict in February. Dyk said the panel "has continuingly expressed willingness, and indeed desire" to remove the information that the majority objected to, saying it wasn't necessary to the original decision. The Federal Circuit handles all patent appeals in the U.S., so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

October 8 AAPL: 114.06 0.17 Class action lawsuit against Apple over iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’ hardware flaw gains momentum Chance Miller - 1 month ago @ChanceHMiller iPhone 6 AAPL View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit A few months back, we reported on a hardware flaw plaguing a growing number of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users, which garnered the name of “Touch Disease.” Shortly after the flaw was initially reported on, a trio of iPhone users filed a class action lawsuit against Apple, claiming that Apple refuses to repair devices affected by Touch Disease for free. Over a month later, Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge the issue. Now, Motherboard reports that the push to get Apple to respond to the issue is growing thanks to more backing behind the original class action lawsuit in California and a separate, new lawsuit in Utah… Touch Disease is a hardware flaw that causes the displays on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus units to become unresponsive and show a thin gray, flickering line along the top. Though the iPhone 6 is not immune, the issue seems to primary plague the larger-screened Plus model. The flaw affects the logic board’s “touch IC” controller chips, thus meaning that replacing the iPhone’s display is not an adequate fix. Because Apple will not perform logic board repairs on iPhones, the company’s solution to the problem thus far has been to purchase a new phone. Apple pushes users to pay $329 to replace their Touch Disease-ridden iPhone 6 Plus with a refurbished model, which according to today’s Motherboard report, is often hit with the same bug “within days or weeks of being replaced.” While Apple has yet to publicly acknowledge Touch Disease, today’s report claims that “five separate current and former Apple Geniuses have confirmed” that Apple is aware of the problem, but won’t tell customers about it. Apple has, however, at least acknowledged the issue in federal court. The company has requested an “extension of time to respond to the Complaint” in the more recent Utah class action, while in California Apple requested that the Utah and California cases be combined into one: “Given the similarity between the [Utah] and [California] actions, it would unnecessarily tax judicial resources if these actions were to proceed in separate class action lawsuits—especially where the [Utah] and [California] Plaintiffs purport to represent the same putative class of all consumers who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the filing. The California case is much larger than the Utah one, as well. One attorney in the case has been contacted by 10,000 people asking to join the suit. That same attorney, Richard McCune, filed an updated lawsuit against Apple last night, adding several plaintiffs and three separate law firms to the battle. In an email to Motherboard, McCune wrote: “Each of the firms (who had their own clients) brings strength to the case, including Stephen Larson of Larson O’Brien, who is a former Federal Judge. With these firms working with us, we believe it gives us the best chance of obtaining a positive result in the case for the owners of the phones.” With the growing push behind these cases, it’s unlikely that Apple will continue to ignore the problem, so it shouldn’t be long until the company issues some sort of response… Guides iPhone 6 View THe Guide AAPL Get the latest AAPL stock and company news View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft's Everyday Graphics 'Paint' App to Gain Enviable new 3D tools with Windows 10 Update | Main | Samsung Spits in the Face of Evidence that the Note7 Replacement is a Danger » October 08, 2016 Apple Files Patent in Australia Revealing Possible Future Apple TV Features   This week the European Patent Office revealed an Apple patent application filed in Australia that painstakingly walks through Apple TV with the new remote with Siri. More importantly, a few patent figures discovered in the patent filing present new Apple TV scenarios or options that may be realized sometime in the future.   Some of the new things the engineers discuss and describe in this Australian patent filing are obscure, such as how users will be able to get more information from an icon on the Apple TV interface. In one description it sounds as if they're describing the use of 3D Touch to peek at content or drill down further so that you could view a trailer or order content.   The second method therein describes how the Apple TV remote's touch area will be able to tilt an icon on your TV to reveal information about the content on the reverse side or to indicate the category of content being displayed in the "Watchlist" area that sits directly above the icons area as noted below.   The new Watchlist icon on the Apple TV Remote noted in the example above is currently occupied by the Home Button as noted below. Content Choice on One User Interface   Today, you can find content within individual content channels or apps such as iTunes, Netflix, Crave, CBS, ABC and so forth. In the patent figures illustrated below the user is working within a redesigned unified user interface where a user will be able to find content first and then click on the channel that they wish to watch it on be it Hulu ( shown as 'Oolu Plus') AMC, Netflix (shown as Movieflix), iTunes and so forth.   Possible 3D Apple TV Icons   In Apple's patent Figure 5NN illustrated below we're able to see that an icon is displayed using multiple layers (e.g., layer 5028 showing the text "Ping Pong Mania!!," layer 5030 showing a ping pong ball and 51 its trajectory, layer 5032 showing a racquet, and layer 5034 showing a net).   The sizes and relative positions of these layers are adjusted in accordance with a user input to provide an improved visual perception of the icon (e.g., providing a three-dimensional perception of objects shown in the icon).   Apple's patent filing was published this week in Europe and originally filed in Australia under application number 2016100650 on May 19, 2016.     Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Google's launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google's brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, including Samsung's, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. "This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands," said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet's Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a "very significant marketing campaign". He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone's October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleve, a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple's ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. "When you have an inferior brand, it's OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you," he said. "But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice."

Tesla is opening a 65,000 square foot store, its largest retail center to date. The facility will offer sales and service of Tesla's electric car line. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Interbrand just released this year's Top 100 global brands, and Apple, Google, and Coca-Cola take this year's Top 3 spots again.  Newbies who entered the Top 100 are Tesla and fashion empire Dior. This list is based on consumer influence and brand presence. Advertisement Apple and Google have consistently been the top two global brands for the past four years, and they are still growing. Both companies respectively have seen a 5% and 11% percent growth respectively in the past year. The brand consultancy agency has been curating this list for the past 17 years, and CEO Jez Frampton says that based on the topnotchers on the list, it can be told that "the best global brands are not just weathering change, but driving it, They understand their Anatomy of Growth is complex, unique and personal; they look inward and outward, expand into new markets, and create better experiences to grow their brands and businesses." Tesla is a welcome addition in the respected list of the Top 100 global brands. They have proven that it's possible to grow into a super company from scratch. Especially in the auto industry, that's pretty much an impossible feat. With Elon Musk's lead, Tesla is now one of the leading brands in its sector. There are qualifications for companies to take a coveted spot on the list. According to their official website, a company must be operating in three major continents and they must have a roadmap in emerging markets. Thirty percent of the revenue must come from other countries, and fifty percent of it shouldn't come from just one continent. The Interbrand way of determining who makes the list is ISO certified as well. The qualifications are pretty strict, which makes being part of the list an even bigger privilege. Will Apple and Google still reign supreme on next year's list? With many industries going up and down, it's anybody's guess who'll be the next game changers.

Austin Yake shot a 14 on a par-3, effectively taking himself out of the running for a Division III boys golf district tournament and the lone advancing spot for next week's state tourney. I got to the tourney about halfway through it. I watched the Cardington senior play up No. 18 at Apple Valley then make the turn at No. 1, carding a 1-over-par 37 on the backside. After getting some shots on video, I went off to find the Ridgedale boys and Pleasant's Jason Joehlin. Later in the day, I stood at the eighth green waiting for him to play the last two holes. While standing there, I overheard a mother of another player say she "just wanted to give the Cardington kid a hug." What? And then she told me what happened. He hit into an unplayable area on the short par-3 fifth hole. He elected to take a penalty stroke and go to the drop zone. What followed was shot after shot after shot after shot into the water guarding the green. A kid who was within a shot of the lead suddenly was no longer. But as Yake came up No. 8, he looked no different than he did on Nos. 18 and 1 when he was very much in the mix for a championship. Incredibly, he showed no emotion in either circumstance, respectably playing out the round with a pair of pars and bogies. Afterward, I wondered how he and his coach would react. After 26 years of earning a paycheck covering high school sports, I know delicate situations. The last thing anyone wants moments after screwing up is a recorder in his or her face with questions about how it came to be. Cardington coach Troy King was candid and honest, but also heartbroken for his guy. As for Yake, I was stunned. He explained his plight and answered my questions. He was obviously hurting, but he offered no excuses and shed no tears. He handled his situation with a grace that belied his years. In my time on the preps beat, I've seen my share of poor sports. Usually, it's the coaches howling about how they were wronged, but I've seen kids melt down sobbing over less than what Yake experienced. I've had coaches pull the gutless I'm-not-talking-to-the-media after tough losses. I've watched kids kick benches, throw towels, strip off jerseys and refuse to wear runner-up medals. Yake and King could have done any of the above and I wouldn't have been surprised. Sadly, I was surprised by their good sportsmanship, which says a lot I think. Yake suffered through a 15-minute stretch where he lived his golfing nightmare and experienced something he never did before — a 14 on his scorecard after four ker-plunks. It would shake a pro, let alone a teen, but he never let on in the moments afterward. My final question to Yake was about what he learned of himself Wednesday afternoon, and he offered this bit of wisdom: "If I didn't lose it mentally here, I don't think I'll lose it later on." If you need someone who is unflinching in the midst of adversity, if you need someone who can keep it together in crisis and move on, if you need someone who can persevere after enduring a dark moment, if you need someone to show character and not become one, Yake is your guy. He may not have been crowned a champion Wednesday, but he certainly showed championship qualities. Yake didn't win a medal at the district golf meet, but he won a sports writer's respect. He may have seen his high school golf career come to an end, but with his class, dignity and demeanor, he'll do far greater things I'm sure. Austin Yake is just that extraordinary.

Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with $3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming introduction and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc.Direct competition Google’s introduction of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet Inc’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who spoke on anonymity. Verizon investment Wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc, which has a U.S. exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 introduction through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel.Creative ads But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said noting the white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Unofficial Remixes and DJ Sets Are Coming to Spotify and Apple Music Anna Gaca // October 8, 2016 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Getty Images Spotify and Apple Music users can now use the services to stream unofficial remixes of some songs, and more remixed content, like hour-long DJ mixes, is soon to follow, TechCrunch reports. Until now, remixes not released under the auspices of the original artist were absent from both services. The library expansion comes via an agreement with Dubset, a distribution service focused on DJ releases. Dubset operates like a rights clearinghouse for remixed material, using file-scanning software to determine which songs were incorporated and thus who deserves a slice of revenue from a given track. Partnering with Spotify and Apple Music “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid,” Dubset CEO Stephen White told TechCrunch. As White notes, adding DJ content gives Spotify and Apple entrée to musical territory primarily occupied by SoundCloud. While some tracks on SoundCloud are covered by licensing agreements, other remixes, bootlegs, and DJ sets available on its platform are unlicensed, user-submitted uploads that record labels regard as a form of piracy. SoundCloud launched its own paid streaming service, SoundCloud Go, in March, but it hasn’t matched the success of its more established peers. A recent Financial Times report suggested that Spotify was looking to acquire SoundCloud, but that may be a less attractive proposition if Spotify finds it can secure its own access to music that distinguished SoundCloud’s catalogue with fewer legal headaches. As Variety notes, however, Dubset currently has a big limitation: It’s made deals with music publishers, but it hasn’t signed on any major labels. Unless Dubset can secure their cooperation, many of the most popular remixes won’t appear on paid services. Dubset’s Stephen White identified a DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of “Room in Here” by Anderson .Paak—who’s an independent artist—as being among the first unofficial remixes available on Spotify and Apple Music.

Today, the US Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's original 2014 verdict, awarding Apple $120 million (about £96.5 million, AU$158 million) in damages. The dispute all started over Apple's patents for swipe to unlock, autocorrect and quick links feature. Quick links allowed phone numbers and addresses to automatically be turned into links. Ironically, Apple's latest iOS 10 update got rid of slide to unlock. Victory... Today's decision reinstates a victory that was overturned earlier this year by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In an 8-3 verdict, the court said that the three-judge panel, the same panel that opposed today's verdict, was wrong to throw out the case in February of this year. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," said Judge Kimberly Moore in the court document. This decision is an important one, as it sets a precedent for Apple's smartphone patents. Some competitors might have to re-engineer their unlock methods, autocorrect systems and quick links, or risk a costly lawsuit with Apple. ...for now As we've come to expect with these two, the Apple vs Samsung battle isn't over yet. This latest court decision comes less than a week before the US Supreme Court considers Apple's case against Samsung for copying the design of its iPhone. In August, over 100 renowned designers from around the world, including Calvin Klein, Dieter Rams and Alexander Wang, filed an amicus brief in support of Apple. The designers claimed that a product's visual design has "powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes." The brief cites a 1949 study that showed 99% of Americans could identify a Coca-Cola bottle by its shape alone. Samsung argues that Apple's generic smartphone design shouldn't have been allowed to be patented in the first place. Tech giants including Dell, Facebook, Google and HP argued in favor of Samsung in their own amicus brief. This will be a seminal case, according to The New York Times, as the US Supreme Court hasn't heard a design patent case in over a century. Stay tuned for more on that verdict. iOS 10 tips and tricks Via Bloomberg Tags: world of tech Samsung Phones patent newstrack lawsuit Apple vs Samsung Apple Follow Techradar onfacebookLiketwitterFollowgplusFollow Contribute to TechradarWrite for Us More from this author Beyerdynamic DT 1990 Pro V-Moda Forza Project Scorpio: everything we know about Microsoft's 4K-ready Xbox How to watch the 2016 US presidential debates Noontec Zoro II Wireless Related Stories Apple requests Samsung patent retrial over claim for billions, not millions Samsung will make more slim, metal phones to fight back against Apple Apple iPhone VR headset discovered in recent patent This new Apple Watch patent could upgrade your handshake Nvidia picks up patent infringement club, beats Samsung with it Apple files patent for a new ‘paper bag’ Patent row blocking Apple Watch sales in Switzerland Join the discussion with Techradar India Characters Remaining: 3000 Share on Twitter X Sort By:NewestOldestDiscussedUp VotedDown Voted Be the first one to review.

When iQunix offered for me to try their Edin stand for MacBooks, I was eager to find out if I could welcome it into my life. Packaging Since iQuinix’s packaging resembles Apple’s packaging at a glance, expectations are set high from the beginning. After sliding off the tight white outer sleeve, a more unique black box is found with iridescent branding on every side but the bottom. This box opens to reveal the Edin stand, with a sleek presentation aided by the box’s platform-esque bottom piece. Materials & Construction If the packaging wasn’t enough, iQunix uses bead blasted aluminum with light gray silicone padding to match Apple’s iMac aesthetic. If you’re looking to buy a matching stand for your Space Gray MacBook, you’ll have to look elsewhere. However, it blends right in with a MacBook Pro connected to a Thunderbolt Display. A knurled thumbscrew tightens on what is essentially one half of a clamp, which can be adjusted to fit all of Apple’s MacBook offerings. In Use Setup is no problem: loosen the thumbscrew, lay your MacBook on its edge, adjust the Edin to the proper width, and tighten the thumbscrew. I found it easy to set the Edin to a width that securely holds my MacBook Pro, while it’s still a soft enough grip to pull the MacBook Pro out of the grip of the Edin’s silicone padding, which protects from aluminum on aluminum scratches. A generous amount of silicone padding on the bottom also keeps the stand stable, and keeps a nice buffer between the desk and the aluminum base. For a MacBook Pro with fan ventilation, I prefer to lay the MacBook hinge up, which gives access to all ports while giving a clear pathway for air to travel through the hinge vents. I would lay a standard MacBook hinge down to give the stand a thicker point to grip, and to orient the Apple logo properly. Conclusion If you’re on the hunt for a MacBook stand, you know what you’re getting from the iQunix Edin: a reliable, well made, adjustable stand that matches Apple’s iMac aesthetic. You’ll still have to manually manage your cables, and you’ll have to lay your MacBook the long way to keep access to all of your ports (and possibly keep your MacBook safe from breaking), but it’s hard to beat the price and quality of the Edin if you’re okay with those minor compromises. The iQunix Edin is currently available on Amazon for $39.99. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to send me a tweet @eriknordlund!

The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung's infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Friday's decision was made by the full slate of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow US Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California, which ordered Samsung to pay $119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday's decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday's ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. "But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward - and it's a big win for Apple."   Andrew Chung Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 China moots midnight bans to combat internet addiction Business Standard Apple wins in appeals court against Samsung A federal court has reinstated the $120-million jury award to Apple Andrew Chung  |  New York  October 8, 2016 Last Updated at 21:29 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

Pocket-lint Sections App Camera Car Drone Fitness Tracker Gadgets Games Headphone Laptop Parenting Phone Smart Home Smartwatch Speaker Tablet TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards Polar M600 review: Top-notch smartwatch and fitness tracker fusion Chris Hall8 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint 4.5 stars - Pocket-lint recommended £269 For Solid design, sports takes priority over smartwatch, all of Android Wear's functions, Polar Flow does so much, respectable battery performance for a smartwatch, IPX8 waterproofing Against Design could be more exciting, swimming could be better served, heart rate can be a little erratic, price Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The explosion of smartwatches and fitness trackers has thrown up some real gems and thrown down some real turds, leaving us all to step carefully when choosing a new device. Polar is an established name in fitness devices, one of the oldest, perhaps, when dealing with heart rate monitoring. A widening portfolio from Polar has seen the birth of more lifestyle devices in the A family and stepping up in functions across the M (sport) and V (pro) devices, with a gradual increase in wider connectivity across the brand's offerings. The M600 is a rethinking, adopting a proper smartwatch platform and offering those fitness tracker functions the company is known for combined with a lot more on the watch side than you'd normally get. The result is one of the most considered sports devices we've seen and certainly one of the best Android Wear devices to date. Pocket-lint Polar M600 review: Design and build The Polar M600 mates the body module with a rubber strap and, like the TomTom Spark, the body slots into the strap meaning the two sections can be easily separated when you want to clean them. The design looks a lot like previous Polar watches, although it's pretty thick, meaning you need enough wrist for it to sit on. If you're of the thin forearm variety you might think it's too big, but we found it sat well on an average male arm. The chunkiness gives it some substance and it looks good, both from a sports point of view and as a smartwatch. Compared to other Android Wear devices, Polar's watch-making experience is apparent, as this is much nicer than something like the Moto 360 Sport and looks better and wears better than that previous attempt. As with other Polar devices the screen is square fitting Polar's family design. Pocket-lint On to the more serious stuff. There's proper waterproofing with an IPX8 rating so it supports swimming, the screen is protected with Gorilla Glass to avoid scratches and the metal detailing that frames the display left and right gives a premium look. There's the choice of black or white, although we'd like to see a choice of strap colours to give the design wider appeal. The rubber strap is easy to adjust and uses a conventional two pronged buckle, with two bands to stop the spare strap catching on things. Most importantly, the M600 is comfortable to wear and sweat through, and weighing 65g, it's not too heavy either. Polar M600 review: Sports features first Designed as a sports watch first, there are two buttons. The first button to the left side is the standard Android Wear button, letting you go home, wake the display or long press to access the menu. The second button on the front takes you straight to the sports side, opening the Polar app. This is very much sports territory and we really like that Polar hasn't been distracted by Android Wear: it's taken the platform and owned it, rather than skipping around Google's fancy smartwatch features. Pocket-lint The hardware tells a similar story. With an optical heart rate sensor onboard and its own GPS you're ready to run out the door and leave your smartphone at home. There is no compass or barometer, however, so direction and elevation is based on GPS. There's also support for accessories, so if you have an H7 Polar chest strap, you'll get the option of using that, which might be the preferred option for cyclists. One of the skills that Polar does adopt from Android Wear is the support for Bluetooth headphones and local storage for your music, meaning you can take your music with you on the run, again without your phone. TomTom Spark 3 offers this, as does Apple Watch 2, and it's a feature that is sure to be popular. The great thing is that this full feature set, supported by this hardware, makes for a great fitness device, before you even touch the smartwatch side of things.  Polar M600 review: Hardware specs and display The Polar M600 is powered by a MediaTek chipset with 512MB RAM and a standard 4GB of storage. The battery is 500mAh which is pretty good for this type of device and explains the thickness. Pocket-lint There's a 1.3-inch display on the front with a 240 x 240 pixel resolution. This isn't the largest or sharpest Android Wear watch display, but as we said, the screen fits and we found it a good size for reading on the move. It supports always on functions, dimming in normal wear and brightening up when you move the watch to look at. As an LCD this is a backlit full colour display so it's illuminated, rather than using the lower power displays that some other sports watches offer. It looks great, which adds to the appeal, but does draw more heavily on the battery than the mono TomTom or Garmin displays, for example. It does have an ambient light sensor, however, so adjusts to the lighting conditions around you. Polar M600 review: Battery life and charging The 500mAh battery will give you about 2 days of use when connected to an Android device, including exercise time. You might be able to push it to a little more in casual wear. We've not tested the Polar M600 with an iPhone, but reports suggest this drops to about a day with Apple's phone. In reality, the Android Wear experience is much enhanced when paired with an Android phone and at least you have the option, unlike the Apple Watch. Pocket-lint Two days is good for Android Wear devices, but it does mean regular charging compared to many other sports watches which will often give you perhaps 5 active days or more - but without really offering any smart functions. That's the trade-off here: the Polar M600 doesn't have great endurance in sporting terms, but it offers a whole lot more in terms of functionality, meaning it does a lot more than just tell you the time when you're walking around.  Charging is via the magnetic connection point on the rear and over the past weeks that we've been using the M600, we've typically opted to charge every other day without it running flat. The charger neatly attaches to the rear of the watch without needing to clip anything on or fiddle around. Polar M600 review: Setup and connections To get the M600 up and running you need two things: the Android Wear app and the Polar Flow app on your phone. The first handles the connection to your phone, the second syncs with your Polar account and syncs the data from your watch. Using Android Wear on an Android smartphone makes for a fast and easy connection as the devices are designed for seamless cooperation. Once you're connected, you can use the Android Wear app to control many of the smartwatch functions, like deciding what notifications you want from your M600 and so on. Pocket-lint The Android Wear app will also then sync your apps, so anything you have on your device that's compatible with Wear will then move over - like Spotify, Play Music, Citymapper and even other fitness apps if you want to use them.  The Polar Flow app then handles everything else. This is where you'll view your stats and be able to get a good look at your activities you record using the M600. We like the Polar Flow app. It's very much a lifestyle app on your phone, firstly delivering a report on your daily activities, but it lets you dive into your runs, check out your heart rate and pace from an activity as well as your route and other essential details.  Taking things further, the Polar Flow app has a calendar in it too where you can schedule workouts, meaning you can tap the watch and dive into the workout that you've planned. If you're training against a plan, it means you've got the information on your wrist, ready to get going. You can setup intervals, distance or time targets. You can also sync Polar training results and targets into your Google Calendar if you want and share the data with a couple of other services - Strava and Training Peaks. Pocket-lint Information is synced from the app to the web version of Polar Flow which includes a few more options and has more in-depth information. However, you don't have to use the browser at all during setup: you can connect the Polar M600 to your phone and do everything there, without having to use a PC. There are a couple of bespoke Polar watch faces that will show you daily activity, so you can see where you are with your target at a glance, which help boost the fitness tracker side of the M600. Polar M600 review: 24/7 activity monitoring Before we get to actual sports tracking, the M600 wants to monitor what you're doing all the time. We mentioned that the Polar Flow has a lifestyle approach and this is has, breaking down your day into sleep, resting, sitting, low, medium or high activity. With this in mind, you're presented with your progress through your day on the watch face. One of the elements of this is steps, which we feel is a little too enthusiastic about awarding you a "step". It's a hard thing to measure, as when we measured physical steps, the results seemed accurate enough, but in an average day in the office, we seemed to accrue many more steps through other movements. Compared to Fitbit tracking, for example, it's a lot easier to hit your step target with the M600, suggesting that it's a lot more sensitive to movement than it perhaps should be. Steps isn't really an absolute measure, however, so if it's steps you're interested in, this probably isn't the device for you. If you're inactive for too long you'll get inactivity alerts and these aren't just reminders to move, they get logged in Polar Flow, so you'll feel the enduring shame. If that's not a motivator, we don't know what is. One of the nice aspects of Polar Flow is that it reports on your day, week and month assessing your activity and telling you what difference that has made to your life. Polar M600 review: Running and sports functions Press that button on the front and the Polar app opens on the M600. There are two sections, one to check your daily activity in more detail and the second to start recording a sport. Polar gives you freedom to choose your sport profiles to suit the activities. For many this will be running, cycling or swimming, but there's a full range of sports to choose from, like badminton, dance, football or plain old walking, for example. That's great, because you don't have to compromise on categorising your activity. Want to record your dog walking? No problem. Want to record your Friday rowing session? No problem. Pocket-lint For outdoor sports you have GPS tracking, so there are different profiles for pool and open water swimming for example, which we really like and you only have to have the sports on your watch that you actually need. Don't want "other outdoor"? You can remove it. Head into the Polar Flow website and you get to customise your sports profiles further, changing the information you see on your watch, which it really clever. Once you've selected your activity, the watch sensors fire up, looking for GPS and turning on the optical heart rate sensor on the rear. You can start the activity immediately, or wait for those things sensors to lock on, but again, with time being precious, it's sometimes good to get going without having to wait. We've found the GPS to lock on quickly, however, so there's never really been too much of a delay in getting started.  During your sport, you're presented with a number of screens with relevant information, based on the activity you're doing. For running you get a main screen that's similar to Polar's other devices, like the V800. The M600 has the advantage of colour, so as you move through different heart rate zones, the colour of the HR readout will change too, for at-a-glance information. There's also clear indiction of pace and distance when running. Swimming isn't as well served as it could be, with pool swimming lacking the option to detect lengths automatically like the Apple Watch 2 does. That leaves you with heart rate tracking and time, which is good enough. We also found that the flow of the water was able to swipe through screens, so we'd often stop a set in the pool with something different on the display. Pocket-lint With Android Wear automatically dimming the display, Polar has added the option to have the display always on. This means you can glance and see the stats without having to touch and avoids the problem of not being able to view the screen without an over exaggerated gesture. That will eat more battery, but if you're busting a gut trying to beat your 10k PB run, you won't care, you'll just need to keep an easy eye on your pace. If there was one thing we'd want to boost the watch's sporting credentials, it's another button. We'd love a start/stop button, rather than having to use the display, but that's a minor thing. There's also no automatic detection for your activities, but sitting closer to a serious running watch we think that's fine: it will differentiate between activity levels in the daily tracking anyway, so there's no harm in selecting the sport you're doing for detailed tracking. One of the great things is that the Polar Flow website provides a lot more information than you'll find on other platforms. It will give you an overview of your running progress, it will estimate how much fatigue you might be carrying over from earlier workouts as a guide to whether you're over or under training. You can also sign-up to training programmes, meaning there's a lot on offer, beyond your actual running stats. Polar M600 review: GPS and heart rate performance There's a wide degree of variation in performance with the latest crop of sports gadgets, something that's seen widespread reporting about accuracy. The Polar M600 performs well in tracking via GPS, with some really accurate route tracking and good distance recording. Polar has put six LEDs in the optical heart rate sensor on the back of the M600, aiming to ensure it's as accurate as it can be. Naturally, using the optional chest strap will give better results, but wrist measurement is all about convenience. The M600 performs fairly well, but we have seen some inconsistent HR results at times. Pocket-lint We've seen a fairly slow start at times, with the first 10 minutes or so seeing a slow build-up of heart rate, not quite reflecting the real rate increase. We've also had some runs where the watch would occasionally show a blank result, as though it wasn't recording, but it was. On checking the results afterwards, there's no sign of drop-out.  To verify what was happening, we tested it against a Garmin Forerunner 610 with chest strap. The Garmin was faster to respond to rate changes, more accurately reflecting the build-up of heart rate at the start of the run, as well as responding faster to some sprint sections we threw in. However, at the end of the run, both showed an average of 152bpm and both showed the same distance covered and same average pace. So, although there are some anomalies with the results, that overall doesn't have a huge impact on the bigger picture of runs when using the Polar M600. Outside of running we've found it to deliver some good results and we're impressed it manages to offer a consistent result when swimming, for example.  Polar M600 review: A full Android Wear experience That's where most sports devices would reach the limit of their functionality, but sitting on the Android Wear platform, the Polar M600 offers a whole lot more. You get a full range of alerts and notifications and if you have an Android smartphone, this really is a first class offering, especially compared to the arrangement on some other sports devices. It's something that's offered by other Polar watches and some Garmin devices, but here you're supported by the Android community for your functionality, not just Polar. Pocket-lint We've mentioned apps and one of the aspects that the M600 gets from Android Wear is Bluetooth headphone and music support. You can connect any Bluetooth headphones you like, but music support is limited to Google's Play Music service and you have to download and sync that from your phone, which is a bit of a faff so it's worth only syncing music for running, but we love not having to carry that vintage iPod on the run.  Expanding out into other Android Wear highlights, you have Google Maps for navigation while you're connected to your phone, support for Ok Google voice controls, so you can speak replies to messages and so on. Then you have all the fun stuff, like being able to pause your Spotify music from your watch, controlling Netflix over your Chromecast, or getting Citymapper directions right on your wrist.  Although Android Wear has a bad rep from lacklustre early devices, the Polar M600 isn't one of them. This is a sports watch that benefits from a huge range of extra functions enabled by Android Wear, resulting in something fun and functional. In many ways, the Polar M600 is currently without compare. Verdict The Polar M600 is a fusion of smartwatch and sports device. It takes Android's platform and laces in sports and fitness tracking functions, but maintains a balance that some devices don't manage. It succeeds in being both where others have failed. It feels like a proper Polar sports watch, boosted by the best of Android Wear. For an Android smartphone user, this is a device that's worth serious consideration. If you've been put off by Android Wear so far, this is how to do Android Wear right. It's not about bland presentation, it's about underpinning something more exciting.

October 8 AAPL: 114.06 0.17 Review: Amber Watchcase Power Bank is hands down one of the best Apple Watch accessories [Video] Jeff Benjamin - 1 month ago @JeffBenjam Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With the recent release of new hardware, I’ve been in search of a better Apple Watch charging and storage solution. There’s no shortage of watch-compatible docks, but the Amber Watchcase Power Bank by ClearGrass is far and away one of my favorites. Have a look at our hands-on video walkthrough to see why this might be the best Apple Watch charging and storage solution yet. For starters, the Amber Watchcase Power Bank brings the following handy features to the table: Charging Apple Watch on the go Charging Apple Watch and iPhone/iPad simultaneously iOS app with charging notifications and battery status The biggest feature, at least for me, is the case’s ability to charge my Apple Watch on the go. This is possible because the Amber Watchcase Power Bank features a built-in 3800 mAh rechargeable battery, enough to recharge an Apple Watch six times. The inclusion of an internal battery means that you will have enough juice to power your Apple Watch for a full work week, even when not tethered to a power outlet. This makes the Amber Watchcase Power Bank perfect for traveling, or for using in locations where there isn’t a power outlet available. Amber Watchcase Video Walkthrough Subscribe to the 9to5Mac YouTube channel for more Apple Watch videos ClearGrass’ Amber Watchcase can also be used to charge an iPhone or iPad, as the 3800 mAh battery provides enough juice to recharge an iPhone 7 Plus from 0 to 100% with some leftover juice to spare. In fact, you can charge both your Apple Watch and your iOS device at the same time. Design The first thing that struck me about the Amber Watchcase was its design. This is a well-designed product, and it’s obvious from handling it that lots of thought and work went into its build. The Watchcase plays nice with third-party bands like this one from Monowear The Amber’s exterior is constructed out of aluminum, and the interior is comprised of a soft plastic material that won’t scratch your Apple Watch. Almost everything about the case, from the external aluminum, to the plastic interior, to the hinge, feels like quality construction. Molded indentations for the case and Digital Crown demonstrate a keen attention to detail Charging You’ll need to buy a separate Apple Watch charging cable, or sacrifice the cable that came with your Apple Watch, in order to set up the Amber Watchcase. Included in the package is a USB-enabled spool that you connect and wind the charger’s cable around. From there, it’s just a matter of mounting the magnetic puck neatly inside the front portion of the spool. The spool is then locked into the case and covered by a plastic housing that serves to hide and protect the charger’s wire. The spool features a female USB port to connect the Apple Watch charging cable On the rear of the Amber Watchcase is where you’ll find two USB input ports. One standard USB port is used for charging your iPhone or iPad, and another micro USB port is used for charging the Amber Watchcase. The spool with Apple Watch charging cable in place On the top of the device is where you’ll find a small button next to a set of five LEDs. These LEDs allow you to quickly see how much power remains on the unit’s internal battery. USB for charging iOS devices and micro USB for charging the Amber Watchcase If you’re the type of person that likes to keep the Amber plugged in next to your bedside, then you’ll be happy to know that ClearGrass designed it in a way to intelligently route device power. When the Watchcase is connected to a power outlet, it will directly feed that power to the Apple Watch and any other iOS device that’s connected via USB. By intelligently routing power, it prevents the unit’s internal battery from being drained as often, thus prolonging the battery’s lifespan. Five LEDs provide a glanceable battery indicator If the case’s internal battery is exhausted, it simply functions like a normal charger, with the ability to power both your Apple Watch and iPhone. It can even charge an iPad as long as you use a proper iPad charger, and not the standard 5w iPhone charger. Amber comes in four colors Color Image Space Gray Silver Gold Rose Gold Usage I was skeptical about the Amber initially, as it started off as a Kickstarter campaign and I’ve had my fair share of bad experiences with Kickstarter. Amber taught me that I should be careful not to lump every Kickstarter-backed product into a single pool, because this truly is a wonderful product. It’s probably my number one Apple Watch accessory, as it greatly improves the ownership experience. This Apple Watch is charging without any external cables Being able to charge the Apple Watch on the go, or on a whim when a power cord isn’t in sight, is truly a marvelous thing. I love the fact that the Amber is a case that completely hides your Apple Watch from view. Not only is the watch protected inside of the Amber Watchcase, but it’s actually being charged in the process. The Amber Watchcase Power Bank features a 3800 mAh internal battery And not only is this device easy to use, but it’s very well-designed. It’s the type of product that I wouldn’t be shocked to see on the shelves of my local Apple Store. ClearGrass contracted the folks at Foxconn to build these units, so it’s no surprise that the final product comes out looking as good and as polished as it does. The Amber app lends charging notifications and more granular battery level readings The free Amber app will help you discern how many cycles the battery has been through, allows you to locate the Amber via Bluetooth, and will send you push notifications to let you know once your Apple Watch is fully charged. Of course, you can also see the unit’s internal battery status in a much more granular way than is possible via the five LEDs located on top of the case. Potential negatives The main downside that I noticed while using the Amber was that the Apple Watch display is obscured behind the bottom half of the case while resting inside. This makes it hard to see the current time while the watch is in Nightstand mode. That’s not a huge deal, but it’s something that may potentially annoy some users. I also wish that the App provided more stats, such as the current battery status of the Apple Watch, although this could be an API limitation. You can receive a notification when your watch is fully charged, but you won’t know the status of the watch as it charges without opening the case’s lid and physically looking at the watch. The app also won’t send notifications after it’s killed by iOS, which is a definite weak point. The folks at ClearGrass state that they currently have no plans to update the app to support proper push notifications, which is a bummer. The micro USB cable that’s used to charge the Amber is way too short. For a device that’s designed to sit next to your bedside, you’d think it would come with a much longer charging cable. You’ll need to supply your own Apple Watch charging cable. If you only have one Apple Watch charger, then you’ll basically be sacrificing it to use in this charging case. The price, at $99 will be too expensive for some. If you just dropped hundreds of dollars on a new Apple Watch, I could certainly see being hesitant to drop another $99 on an accessory. Granted, it’s a very cool and nice to have accessory, but it’s certainly not a requirement to enjoy your Apple Watch. Conclusion If it sounds like I’m gushing over this product, it’s because I am. It’s really that good. I’ve always found charging my Apple Watch to be a bit of an annoyance. Now I can just place my Apple Watch in the Amber, and take the case with me wherever I happen to be. The Amber Watchcase Power Bank is available in four different colors on Amazon. Yes, it’s a little pricey, but it makes storing and recharging the Apple Watch so much more convenient that I think it’s a worthwhile investment for any Apple Watch owner.

Beyond the hardware that will be announced at the event on October 26, Microsoft is to focus on sharing their vision of the future of Windows 10. One of the new things coming to a future Windows 10 update is a complete overhaul of the long standing 'Paint' app by introducing simple 3D tools. While Apple has been known to make easy-to-use software, Microsoft's new Paint is going to be wildly applauded by Windows users as you'll see in the video below.     Apple has been working on several 3D centric technologies as covered in our archives. While most of Apple's 3D projects are very high-end, they're also working on a few apps that will take advantage of creating quick 3D avatars and one for manipulating photos and videos to 3D. Apple will begin by delivering an iOS 10 update later this month that will allow iPhone 7-Plus owners the ability to use their new dual lens camera to produce/deliver a new depth enabled photography technique called the Bokeh effect.   Yet Microsoft's Paint has always been an amazingly simple app that delivers a basic set of drawing tools for everyday use. It's one of the most practical tools ever created and one that I use every day. Now that it's leaping into delivering simple 3D tools, it's only going to get dramatically better across all Surface products including their new all-in-one desktop arriving in weeks.     I can only hope that Apple will one day add such a tool for macOS and iOS users in the future. Then again, Microsoft's 'Paint' could be accessed by those using Windows 10 on their Macs today via Parallels, and so the updated version with 3D tools will likely be coming to a future Parallels update for Macs sometime in 2017. I can't wait to try it out.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

October 8, 2016 Cristina Lee Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently launched its newest flagship smartphone, the Pixel alongside Pixel XL, and boy, did the Mountain View, Calif.-based company made some bold claims. According to Google exec Sundar Pichai, the Pixel has the single best phone camera ever made. And to erase all doubts that Google is coming after the iPhone 7, the event was filled with savage burns directed at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple is all about camera performance and it’s been one of the key features that’s consistently improving with every reiteration of the iPhone. To illustrate how deeply Apple cares about camera performance, execs say that over 800 engineers worked on the iPhone 7’s camera, piecing together over 200 components within the teeny tiny camera modules. And because of the improved hardware, the iPhone 7 featured a bump that most users are unhappy about. Google execs made not-so-subtle digs at the iPhone 7 camera bump during the launch. In a live demo, the bump has been mentioned one time too many, highlighting the fact that the Pixel does not have this much-maligned design. The execs added that Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC assembled the Pixel smartphones. Google also bragged about the Pixel’s camera performance, highlighting the fact that its newest smartphone scored 89 out of 100 in a DxOMark Mobile test. On the same test, the iPhone 7 scored an 86. DxOMark is known for rating cameras and lenses for smartphones and high-end DSLRs alike using sophisticated analysis software. However, it’s worth noting that DxOMark has yet to review iPhone 7 Plus’ camera. Google also slammed one of most common sources of frustration among iPhone users, the limited storage. As you know, photos and videos eat a lot of space and if you’re using an iOS device, then you might be familiar with the annoying storage full popups. According to Brian Rakowski, Google’s vice president of product management, Pixel and the Pixel XL users can kiss these “painful” Storage Full popups goodbuy because their flagship smartphones will come with “free unlimited storage for photos and videos at full resolution.” Moreover, both the regular and the XL Pixels share the same features, which means, Google is not putting a premium on extra/special features, something that’s been a tradition at Apple. To top it all off, the Pixel smartphones will be the first to feature Google’s newest digital assistant, the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri. Other notable Pixel camera features include the ability to edit photos. Google’s Pixel smartphone features a sleek, aluminum and glass form factor. The smaller, 5 inch model – priced at $649 – comes with a storage of 32 GB, while the larger XL, features a 5.5-inch screen with up to 128 GB storage, just like the iPhone 7 Plus. Both Pixels boasts of a high res display, 12 megapixel rear cameras, 8 mega pixel front cameras and the latest chipset by Qualcomm Snapdragon.

Lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit against the company in California earlier this fall have signed on three additional law firms to support their case, and an additional class action lawsuit related to the issue has been filed against Apple in Utah. For the last month, Motherboard has been following “touch disease,” a flaw in iPhone 6 Plus phones that causes the touchscreens to become unresponsive. Swapping out the screen itself doesn’t correct the underlying issue, which is caused by two “touch IC” controller chips coming loose from the phone’s logic board. The flaw is believed to be related to the phone’s larger form factor and unreinforced logic board, which can cause it to flex or bend even under normal use—you may remember “bendgate” from when the phone was first released. Read More: A technical explanation of 'touch disease' Apple will not perform logic board-level repairs for consumers, which require soldering and reseating of millimeter-size components. This means the only Apple-sanctioned “fix” for a touch diseased phone is to buy a new one. One of the major problems is that Apple has been replacing touch diseased iPhone 6 Pluses with $329 refurbished ones, some of which are showing symptoms of touch disease within days or weeks of being replaced. Over the course of my reporting, a total of five separate current and former Apple Geniuses have confirmed to me that Apple is well aware of the problem but will not tell customers about it. Image: Trent Dennison/YouTube Court filings by Apple show that the company is at least aware of the fact that it’s being sued in federal court over the issue in both Utah and California, (there is also a class action suit in Canada). A September 20th filing in the Utah case claims that “[Apple] has requested an extension of time to respond to the Complaint.” A filing submitted by Apple earlier this week in the larger California class action suit asked to combine the two cases into one, presumably so Apple can focus its legal resources to just one suit. “Given the similarity between the [Utah] and [California] actions, it would unnecessarily tax judicial resources if these actions were to proceed in separate class action lawsuits—especially where the [Utah] and [California] Plaintiffs purport to represent the same putative class of all consumers who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the filing. "With these lawsuits hanging over its head, Apple won’t be able to ignore the issue forever" Apple has still said nothing publicly about “touch disease” and has ignored five requests from Motherboard for comment spread out over the course of a month; no other media outlet that has been able to get Apple to comment on the issue, either. Since running my initial story about touch disease, I have gotten hundreds of emails from consumers who have had to buy new phones to replace their broken iPhone 6 Pluses and several Geniuses have told me about the internal protocol Apple requires its employees to use when a touch diseased phone is brought to the store. Richard McCune, an attorney at the California-based McCuneWright law firm who is representing plaintiffs in the California suit, told me that nearly 10,000 people have contacted his firm asking to specifically join the lawsuit (a form to submit information is here). Friday night, McCune filed an updated lawsuit against Apple that has added several plaintiffs and adds three separate law firms to the legal battle. The new complaint has been embedded below. “Each of the firms (who had their own clients) brings strength to the case, including Stephen Larson of Larson O'Brien, who is a former Federal Judge,” McCune told me in an email. “With these firms working with us, we believe it gives us the best chance of obtaining a positive result in the case for the owners of the phones.” For the time being, Apple continues to pretend like touch disease doesn’t exist. But with these lawsuits hanging over its head, it won’t be able to ignore the issue forever. iPhone Touch Screen - Amended Complaint [CONFORMED COPY] by MotherboardTV on Scribd Topics: iphones, apple, iPhone 6 Plus Touch Disease, Touch Disease, iPhone Touch Disease, lawsuits, iFixIt, Right to Repair Contact the author by email or Twitter.

By Jason Snell October 7, 2016 9:00 AM PT Syncing feeling: iCloud Drive in macOS Sierra Documents and Desktop, nestled into iCloud. So many of macOS Sierra’s new features are about freeing up space from our fast-but-tiny solid-state drives. In addition, Apple has extended support for iCloud Drive to optionally include your Desktop and Documents folder, and mixed those two approaches together to create a third feature, called Optimize Mac Storage. I like what Apple’s going for, but both of these features have problems, and some of them bit me when I was writing my review of Sierra. Let’s take a much closer look at what’s going on with syncing and optimizing, including the bugs, the missed opportunities, and the workarounds. Syncing Documents and Desktop to iCloud Drive In Sierra, iCloud Drive finally gets to break out of its own protected folder and into the system at large. In reality, that’s not quite what’s going on—when you first install Sierra, you’re asked if you want to sync your Desktop and Documents folders with iCloud. If you turn this feature on, your Desktop and Documents folders are really moved inside iCloud Drive, with the old locations linked to your home folder so that everything behaves more or less normally. (Except when there are bugs—a few of my apps seemed to get confused when those folders changed locations.) iCloud syncing is pretty robust, and once I got up and running with this feature, it worked as advertised. However, the act of turning it on can be terrifying, especially if you’ve already turned it on while using a different Mac. If your Mac discovers that another Mac is already syncing its Desktop to your iCloud Drive, Sierra will create new folder called “Desktop - Your System Name” inside the Desktop folder within iCloud, and move your files inside. (The same thing happens with your Documents folder.) What this looks like in the Finder: All your files disappear off of your desktop. Maybe a few new files from your other Mac appear. If you keep your key files on your Desktop, it can be terrifying. However, if you look around, you’ll probably see that “Desktop - Your System Name” folder, and all your files should be in there. Apparently Apple didn’t anticipate this moment of terror, though it should’ve seen it coming. The right thing to do is probably to generate a warning for users, and maybe leave that folder open in a Finder window. Even better would be to give the user a few options when they turn on Desktop and Documents syncing on a different Mac—keep the two Desktops separate, merge them together, or set either one of the Macs as the “real desktop.” But right now, the first Mac wins and the next Mac stuffs its files into a subfolder and waits for the user to sort it out. Because I wrote a book about Photos, I bought a huge amount of iCloud space to sync my entire Photos library. As a result, I was able to sync everything in my Desktop folder—even huge audio files—to iCloud without difficulty. If you don’t have enough free iCloud space to sync your Desktop and Documents folders, Apple will offer you the exciting opportunity to buy more. If you decline, Apple won’t let you enable this feature. (Later, if your folders surpass the amount of space available on iCloud, you’ll get an alert and your files will stop syncing with iCloud. They’ll still be present on your Mac, safe and sound, but syncing will stop until you free up or purchase more iCloud space.) The trouble with optimizing iCloud storage Combine the concept of purgeable space and the ability to sync more files with iCloud and you get a third key feature of macOS Sierra. When you turn on syncing of the Desktop and Document folders, the Optimize Mac Storage feature is turned on. (You can turn it off in the iCloud Drive section of the iCloud Preference Pane, and probably should, for now.) Optimize Mac Storage is a feature that defines files that have been uploaded to iCloud as purgeable, more or less. Apple prioritizes your files so that things you’ve accessed recently will be kept around, but items you haven’t accessed for a long time can be removed. When a file is removed, it’s gone from your hard drive, but it lives on in the cloud, and can be downloaded again by clicking an icon in the Finder or when it’s demanded by an application. Scary, right? But again, if everything’s working perfectly, you’ve just granted that tiny SSD on your MacBook an extra few hundreds of gigabytes of storage, because it can offload your old junk to the cloud. And if it turns out you need it, you can get it back. If everything’s working perfectly. And if the system can truly differentiate between files you need and files you don’t. So something bad happened when I was working on my review of macOS Sierra. As a responsible reviewer, I need to use all the features of a new operating system. That comes with some risks, but that’s why I’m here. Risk (of losing data) is our business. Here’s what happened: While I was working on a podcast-editing project in Logic Pro X, a bunch of my audio files were removed by Optimize Mac Storage. I keep all my key files and projects on the Desktop, as many people do, and since this is a feature that’s designed to keep your work in sync, I decided I was not going change my workflow one bit. Apple has since told me that I absolutely ran into several different bugs, as well as a few quirks of the file-management process. Many apps store all of their asset files in a single package file—it’s really a folder, but all the important files are stuffed inside so that if you move the package, everything comes along for the ride. A Keynote presentation file is actually a package with a Keynote document and all of the images and movies you dragged in, all bundled together. Optimize Mac Storage works great with packages. It’s not going to delve down inside a package and get rid of your files—old projects can be optimized away, but new products will remain on your drive, and nothing gets plucked out of the inside of projects. The problem with some apps—and Apple’s Logic Pro X and Final Cut Pro X fit into this category—is that either they don’t use packages, or stuffing all your files inside a package is optional. My podcast template keeps audio files in the same folder as my Logic project files, but they don’t live inside a package. Now, it turns out that App developers can take advantage of file-coordination APIs to designate all the files that a given project is using, even if they’re not inside a package. If Logic Pro X used those APIs, perhaps my files wouldn’t have been touched, because iCloud would recognize that they were part of an active project. Alas, not even Apple’s own apps support all of Apple’s APIs. (Optimize Mac Storage apparently looks at the last time you opened a file in the Finder as a way to help determine the age of a file, but if you open a project file and that file then reads from other files, the feature doesn’t consider them actively used.) The setup of my project folders, Logic’s lack of support for file coordination, and the bugs that made my Mac think it was much more space constrained than it actually was—this was the situation that conspired to make Optimize Mac Storage look at a few 14-day-old 600MB audio files and decide that they were old junk. Pro tip: Turn it off or move key files elsewhere With any luck, Apple’s hot on the case of fixing the bugs. Perhaps the teams in charge of Apple’s pro apps are working on coordinating project files a bit more aggressively. And I suspect that I might be a little responsible for this new Apple tech note, which suggests that if you’re using a pro app, you should move your projects out of synced folders or turn off Optimize Mac Storage. Yep, that’s Apple saying that people who use pro apps should just turn off or avoid using a major new feature of macOS Sierra. It burns a little—what’s the point of making new productivity features if some classes of Mac user just shouldn’t use them? What’s worse, it points out the larger risk in turning on Optimize Mac Storage: If you keep key files outside of a package—images you’re planning on dropping into a Keynote presentation, for example, but haven’t yet—you risk them being deleted by Optimize Mac Storage. If your internet connection is permanent, fast and unmetered, this is no big deal. If you’re working on an airplane and discover that one of your files you were counting on is gone, welp… that sucks for you. Optimize Mac Storage offers no user interface, so there’s no way to designate certain files or folders as un-purgeable. It’s all or nothing. Either you take your chances or you walk away. For many classes of Mac user, the risks are low and the benefits are great. For other classes, the right answer is to do what Apple recommends in its tech note: walk away.

Thanks to Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., students have this technology. Unfortunately, Jobs, 56, passed away Wednesday, Oct. 5, due to a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Anything with an “i” before it is Jobs’ doing. Jobs, who dropped out of college after only attending Reed College for six months, started Apple Inc. at an early age and created a totally new culture of technology, including the Mac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and iPhone. Students and faculty rely heavily on Apple products, especially Macs, for their majors and classes. Associate professor of art Theresa Harris, who teaches graphic design and typography, has been using Macs for a long time and believes they are necessary for her classes. “[Apple] is the industry’s standard,” Harris said. “It’s what over 95 percent of the graphic design industry and design field use as well as fields in video and animation. Everybody is an Apple fan. Jobs’ influence on the graphic design industry cannot be understated. He totally revolutionized the field.” Graphic design major Khalid Spry agrees with Harris when it comes to using Macs for his major. “His products will help me launch my business designing clothing.” As Harris said before, Apple products have been being used for the field of video and animation as well. Jobs was also the owner of the animated film company Pixar. Theatre & Cinema major Carlos Gomez works with Macs all the time for his major and says it’s essential that students can be able to use the technology at Western. “At Western, the Mac labs have been absolutely necessary for our cinema and digital animations majors, which seem to be expanding with the current entertainment industry,” he said. “Mac or PC?” has been a very popular question that has been asked in past years, and Gomez explains why Macs works better for his major. “Apple has the rights to use more powerful software in their computers,” Gomez said. “Apple has the rights to the big filmmaking software, like Final Cut Pro. Although software, like Adobe’s Premiere, is both for a PC and Mac, it was first created for Mac, so the brand trust is with Apple.” Macs have helped a lot of other majors, like journalism for laying out newspaper and yearbook pages, but Apple technology has also changed this generation as a whole. “[Jobs] connects with this generation in terms of music and the visuals and animation in the movies,” Harris said. “It’s a beautiful thing: The way he has this marriage between design and technology, and it just comes together in a wonderful package that is efficient and functions well. He made using technology an experience and made us all want to be a part of that culture.” Even though Jobs has passed away, Spry believes he will not be forgotten. “Steve Jobs will live on as long as you see the Apple mark.” This entry was posted in Features, Lifestyles and tagged death, Ipad, iPod, Legacy, Steve Jobs.

Cupertino described the removal of the headphone jack as an act of courage, pointing out that Apple has always been among the first to make changes that were eventually adopted by the rest of the industry. But leaving these changes aside, the iPhone 7 lineup brought few surprises after several months full of leaks and controversial debates on whether the iPhone can re-become the best-selling phone in the world or not. Samsung has improved a lot lately, and the Galaxy S7 posted record sales, finally challenging the iPhone and helping the South Korean company become the number one phone manufacturer in the world. The first half of the year was quite a bumpy adventure for Apple fans, with rumors even claiming that the company planned to launch this year’s iPhone as a variation of the iPhone 6, in an attempt to save the iPhone 7 name for next year when it celebrates 10 years from the first model. And yet, here we are using the iPhone 7, looking exactly like in the leaks that made the rounds before the launch and sporting the majority of features that we’ve heard about through unofficial channels. This is a little surprising given that Apple has always tried to keep everything secret prior to big launches, but leaks did happen, and many of them were quite accurate. The new phone series brought the same two models as before, despite rumors that a Pro version could be added as well. After reviewing the iPhone 7 Plus with a dual-camera system, we decided to take the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7 for a spin too and see if this is a worthy upgrade or not. Continue reading to find the answer to this question. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus back view Hardware and performance Aesthetically, the new iPhone 7 features almost no changes as compared to its predecessor, and unless it’s painted in Black (matte) or Jet Black (glossy), those uninitiated might really have a hard time guessing which one is which. The most striking difference is the bigger camera cutout on the new model and the antenna lines that have been moved to the top and the bottom edges. Otherwise, the old and the new models are exactly the same. They have the same dimensions (138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm / 5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in), but the iPhone 7 is lighter (138 grams versus 143 grams). And all these resemblances continue in terms of hardware as well. The display is the same 4.7-inch IPS LCD screen with 16M color support and resolution of 750x1334 pixels. The same pixel density is maintained - 326 ppi, and given that no difference in size has been made, it also has the same screen-to-body ratio - 65.6 percent. The biggest difference is that the iPhone 7 comes with wide color gamut support, which means that you can enjoy more natural colors on the display, especially when shooting photos. Every pic you take looks beautiful, and this is partially thanks to the camera, but also because the display manages to accurately reproduce more colors on its screen. “The yellow tint of the screen goes away after a while.” This doesn't mean that the display is flawless, though. The model we’ve tested was suffering from an issue that’s been reported on other iPhones as well, including older models, which led to a yellowish tint of the display. There’s no official explanation for this, but it’s believed that the glue that Apple has used to seal the screen and make the device waterproof is at fault because the first units were shipped without it getting dry. But the more you use it, the more the yellow tint is supposed to go away - we did see some changes during our two-week test, though, and the color indeed was gone almost entirely. Apple has obviously upgraded the CPU, and this is happening with every new iPhone model, so the iPhone 7 comes with the quad-core A10 Fusion, a worthy upgrade from the dual-core A9 clocked at 1.84 GHz. The same amount of RAM is being offered - 2 GB, as Apple decided to upgrade only the Plus model to 3 GB, most likely in order to deal with the necessary amount of extra processing power caused by the addition of a dual-camera system. Cupertino has also changed storage options and discontinued the 16 GB and 64 GB versions, offering instead an entry-level version with 32 GB and two additional configurations with 128 GB and 256 GB. This is clearly a welcome change since the OS itself and photos eat up more space on the phone, so 16 GB was no longer enough for the base model. The iPhone 7 no longer has a headphone jack, but comes with a Lightning connector that is being used for both charging and listening to music, and you probably heard all the controversy around this change. Apple is offering a Lightning set of headphones in the box, as well as a jack to Lightning adapter, but there’s no doubt that the transition is painful, to say the least. Speakers are now stereo, with a secondary one placed in the earpiece, but the quality of the sound is only slightly improved. We’ve noticed the same thing on the iPhone 7 Plus, and used the same tech on both models. The same is valid for call audio quality, as only small improvements can be noticed. iPhone 7 Home button The Home button has also been replaced with a touch-sensitive version that helps ensure waterproofing. To compensate for the removal of the physical button, Apple used a new haptic engine that emits a soft vibration to simulate a real press, and you can configure the intensity by choosing one of three pre-defined levels from settings. Other than that, you get the same features, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, NFC for Apple Pay, GPS, and the rest of the package. There is no microSD card support, no fast and wireless charging, and no infrared port. Overall, the iPhone 7 is super similar with small exceptions here and there that are only supposed to improve the general experience with the phone. This is clearly a step in the right direction, but the similarities between the old and the new models are likely to affect sales, as many iPhone 6s owners can hardly find a reason to upgrade. And they really can't be blamed for anything, especially because performance is nearly identical and the new hardware doesn't make such a big difference given the excellent software optimizations in iOS. Camera Apple is trying to make the Plus a more compelling model for all buyers, and just like it did with the 6s series, the company is offering some exclusive features on the bigger version of the new generation. This time, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with a dual-camera system that’s supposed to help you take higher quality shots, while the standard 4.7-inch iPhone comes with a single-lens configuration that at first glance isn’t offering the same performance. And yet, this is not true. And it’s all very simple. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a dual-camera system that includes the wide lens and a telephoto lens, while the iPhone 7 comes with the exact same configuration, but without the latter. So the only thing you’re missing is the optical zoom, which to be honest, you’re not going to use too often, so you’re safe. Dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus (left) and single-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Furthermore, the iPhone 7 now comes with OIS, as compared to the previous model which lacked this feature, as it was exclusive to the Plus, and has the exact camera specs as the bigger brother, without the telephoto lens. As a result, the iPhone 7 features a 12-megapixel unit with F1.8 and 1/3” sensor size, up from F2.2 on the 6s. This improvement allows the iPhone 7 to shoot better photos in low-light conditions and to make sure that performance here is better, Apple also equipped the device with a quad-LED flash, up from dual-LED on the predecessor. iPhone 7 camera performance in optimal light conditions The rest of the feature package is unchanged, as you get the typical features such as HDR, touch focus, face detection, and 4K video recording. The front-facing camera has also been upgraded and is now featuring 7-megapixel resolution and F2.2, up from 5 megapixels and F2.2. This leads to a small improvement in video quality during FaceTime calls, but otherwise, you won’t spot any huge difference. As far as real-life performance of the camera is concerned, here’s the thing. When comparing the iPhone 7 with the 6s, the improvements are more than obvious. The iPhone 7 shoots better photos in low light and takes more natural shots in perfect light. Compared to rivals such as the Note 7, it doesn’t offer the same detail quality, but it’s not far either, and it still has one of the best cameras on the market right now. iPhone 7 camera sample - zoom in to view detail sharpness Low-light shots are processed depending on the subject, and this is where the quad-LED flash is coming into play. The iPhone 7 uses a system similar to the one we’ve seen on the Lumia 950 XL, which also featured an RGB flash, and turns to the LEDs in the flash to compensate for the colors in the photo. Just like we’ve said for the Plus, there sometimes seems to be a larger amount of red in night shots, but otherwise quality is above average. All in all, the camera on the iPhone 7 is a worthy upgrade. And what’s also important, the rounded design makes more sense, aesthetically speaking, as the dual-camera system looks kind of odd on the Plus model and makes it feel clunky when trying to use on a desk. Note: all these photos feature no edits, so they're just copied from the phone and published in the article. For more camera samples, you can also check out the review of the iPhone 7 Plus, whose main camera is available on this model too. Battery life First and foremost, it’s worth noting that this time Apple has actually increased battery capacity, so no matter what, the iPhone 7 should last longer than its predecessor. This means that if you were pleased with the autonomy of the iPhone 6s, you should be pleased with the iPhone 7’s too. Cupertino used a lithium-ion 1960 mAh battery, up from 1715 mAh, with the company claiming that it offers better life, but without providing any figures. And truth be told, official figures are rarely accurate because they’re calculated in the perfect scenario, which is super different from real life. “It doesn't always get you through the day.” What we can tell, however, is that depending on how you use the iPhone 7, you can get anywhere between 18 hours to 30 hours of battery life. Yes, we know it’s not ideal, and sometimes you can get even lower than that, but you can always recharge it quickly, and you’re good to go with 100 percent of battery once again. Battery information in iOS 10 The problem here is that the iPhone 7 does not feature fast charging, and given that only the Lightning port is available, charging the device every few hours isn’t the most convenient thing to do, especially if you want to use it for listening to music. There’s no wireless charging either, and this is again a major drawback, because it could have helped overcome the lack of a headphone jack. In the end, the iPhone 7 provides decent battery life, but be ready to plug it in more frequently if you are a heavy user. If you’re not, then there’s no reason not to be pleased with battery life. Software iPhone 7 ships with iOS 10 and if you’ve already used it on a different iPhone model, you pretty much know what to expect. And truth be told, there’s nothing new you’ll get in terms of software when it comes to the iPhone 7, except for some small tweaks here and there, such as vibrations and a few extra options. These are nice refinements, but you can live without them just fine. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10 home screen iOS 10 offers the same feature package on the iPhone 7 as on any other iPhone, but you also get vibrations when changing keyboards, when toggling from ringer to silent, or when opening the notification center. The Home button also comes with three pre-defined vibration levels, which you can configure from settings, but that’s pretty much it. We’ve found iOS 10 on iPhone 7 to be exactly as fast as on the 6s, and just like we’ve said when reviewing the Plus, there might be a small improvement in terms of browsing speed in Safari. “Few iPhone 7-specific options” On the good side, iOS 10 continues to offer super advanced optimizations and it’s just amazing that Apple finds new ways to squeeze every little drop of performance from an operating system that doesn’t need an insane amount of RAM. Just think that Android devices have already reached 6 GB of RAM, but Apple is offering at least comparable performance figures with 2 GB, and this is impressive, to say the least. Furthermore, Apple keeps putting extra focus on battery optimizations with every new iOS update and the new version, coupled with a bigger battery on the iPhone 7, provides longer life than on the 6s. In the end, iOS 10 is a welcome upgrade, but once again, nothing that you couldn’t live without. It’s clearly nice to have, especially given the aforementioned refinements here and there, but we’re not so sure that many 6s owners would agree to pay that much just for having a new phone that does almost the same thing as their old one. The bottom line Let us put it this way: if you’re not pleased with the look of the iPhone 7, and the chances are that you’re not given the fact that it brings only little in terms of aesthetics, just try the black version. You won’t believe the difference it makes. It looks fresh, it looks luxurious, and it certainly looks smaller. On the iPhone 7 Plus, the black color makes such a big difference that you don’t even notice how big it is. Although on paper adding a new color to the iPhone lineup seems to be such an insignificant thing, after holding it in hand for a few minutes you can’t help but wonder how come that Apple didn’t do this earlier. And the iPhone 7 with its dimensions makes this even more compelling, especially if you’re no longer interested in big phones. We must be honest here: the Plus model is still gigantic and with those huge bezels, it kind of lost the design battle with its rivals. Just look at the Note 7 - it has a bigger display, but it's almost the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. But the standard 4.7-inch iPhone is easy to carry around, has a decent battery life, it has the same main camera as on the Plus model, runs iOS 10, and offers all the advantages that you get from the bigger model. You’re not losing anything except for the telephoto lens, which we guarantee you’ll use quite rarely anyway. This upgrade also brings OIS on the iPhone 7, so really, you won’t be losing anything. The 4.7-inch iPhone continues to be the iPhone, and even though Apple is trying to push more people to the Plus version, the smaller version is just not done yet. And by bringing it in line with the Plus, Apple’s making even harder for new buyers to ignore the 4.7-inch iPhone.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (42 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 7 Plus#iPhone review#iPhone 7 review subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it iPhone 7 (42 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 7 Plus Review BlackBerry DTEK50 Review Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review iPhone SE Review - Best Phone... of 2012 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background 42 photos    iPhone 7 in Black new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   Fitbit Blaze Review - Jack of All Trades, Master of One more on: Fitbit i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

But not all data related to iMessage has that same level of protection -- and that information can still be turned over to law enforcement authorities. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Andrea Peterson The Washington Post     When a user sends someone a message through Apple's iMessage feature, Apple encrypts that message between Apple devices so that only the sender and recipient can read its contents. But a recent report from news site the Intercept is a good reminder that not all data related to iMessage has that same level of protection -- and that information can still be turned over to law enforcement authorities. That may be surprising to everyday users who view Apple as a privacy champion after its legal battle with the Justice Department this year over a court order that would force the company to break its own security measures. But to experts, it's just a fact of how communication systems work. For instance, as security expert and noted iPhone hacker Will Strafach notes, Apple needs to know things such as whom you're chatting with via iMessage so that it can deliver your messages. According to a document obtained by the Intercept, Apple logs information about whom you're contacting in iMessage while the app figures out if the person you are texting is also using an iOS device. If they are using iOS, the message gets encrypted and routed through iMessage, which is signaled by blue chat bubbles. If the recipient is not using an Apple device, the message gets routed as a standard text without that extra layer of encryption, and messages appear in green bubbles in the iMessage app. According to the document, which the Intercept says originated "from within the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Electronic Surveillance Support Team," these logs don't necessarily show that you messaged someone. Instead, they show when you opened up a chat window and selected the contact or entered a phone number. Apple says those logs are wiped every 30 days. But because that data exists at all, police can use court orders to force the company to hand it over. And, as the Intercept notes, in ongoing investigations it's possible to extend court orders to get new data, which would allow law enforcement to build a record that goes beyond just 30 days. "When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the requested information if it is in our possession," Apple told The Washington Post in a statement. "In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices." Apple emphasized that because iMessages are encrypted, the company is not able to give police access to the content of conversations. Nor do the message logs "prove that any communication actually took place." All of this seems consistent with Apple's legal process guide, which notes that information about your contacts is among the data it may turn over to investigators when served with a court order or subpoena. Of course, metadata can still be incredibly revealing, especially when analyzed over time: Knowing whom you're messaging (or even thinking about messaging) can reveal who's in your social network or expose personal data. For instance, if you're regularly sending text messages to a suicide crisis line someone reviewing your log could assume that you're having a serious mental health crisis. That type of privacy concern is among the reasons why civil liberties advocates pushed back so hard on the now defunct National Security Agency program that allowed the government to collect bulk metadata about Americans' phone calls, including the numbers they dialed and duration of calls. The Intercept also raised another issue about the logs: They appear to contain IP addresses, which can be used to determine a user's general location. Revealing that information, the Intercept argues, seems to run counter to a statement Apple made in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent of the NSA's spying powers. "[W]e do not store data related to customers' location, Map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form," Apple said in the June 2013 statement. But it's worth noting that the geolocation information that can be determined by IP addresses is typically less specific than what you'd get from GPS data or from looking up a specific address. And Apple's legal process guide also notes that IP addresses are among the information that police can request with a court order or subpoena.

Highs Excellent battery life Accurate sleep tracking Snappy performance Lows Wildly inaccurate heart rate monitor Dated design Primitive operating system Dim screen No Wi-Fi or GPS support Cannot compete with modern smartwatches DT Editors' Rating 4.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Wearable Reviews > Smartwatch Reviews > Pebble 2 + Heart Rate review By Kyle Wiggers Posted on 10.06.16 (updated on 10.09.16) Research Center: Pebble 2 + Heart Rate Pebble was a Kickstarter darling that started the smartwatch craze. Pebble’s low-power LCD (‘epaper’) display, weeklong battery life, and ability to work just as well with an Android phone as an iPhone attracted legions of fans. However, the small startup faces a market drastically different from the one it helped to pioneer. These days, it faces the Apple Watch, Samsung’s Gear smartwatches, and a veritable ecosystem of Android Wear devices. That’s not to imply Pebble has stumbled too hard. It still has its fanbase, an app store with thousands of apps, and a number of smartwatches on sale, including Pebble Time Steel, Pebble Time Round, and more. But it isn’t 2014 anymore, and the competition is not slowing down: analysts at Kantar Worldpanel estimate that this past fiscal quarter, Apple Watch commanded 33.5 percent of the U.S. smartwatch market. Related: Can’t wait to get a wearable? Here are the best smartwatches you can buy It’s formidable competition for the Pebble 2, a smartwatch that promises to track your sleep, steps, and heart rate; let you respond to messages and record notes via voice; and deliver up to a week of battery life. Unfortunately, the Pebble 2 only accomplishes a few of its goals. A clunky, dated design The Pebble 2’s design is definitely geeky and futuristic. It has big bezels and the small 1.26-inch, 144 x 168-pixel screen is super dim. Women and fashion-forward people need not apply. It’s a clunky, dated design that only true Pebble fans could possibly love. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends There’s a lot of plastic on the Pebble 2 — the watch’s entire body is constructed of it, in fact. It’s not going to feel premium like a Huawei Watch or an Apple Watch, but that is not the point. This is a basic, techy smartwatch that offers geek cred in place of style. It feels smooth, firm, sturdy, and durable. It’s exceptionally light and thin at 31.7 grams and just 9.8mm thick. The Apple Watch Series 2, for the sake of comparison, has a depth of 11.4mm. It’s not an all-plastic affair. Shielding the Pebble 2’s E Ink display is a scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 covering that’ll easily withstand the occasional bump against a stairway railing and knock against a table edge. On its underbelly, you’ll find the Pebble 2’s heart rate sensor — a first on a Pebble smartwatch — and two metal contacts that connect to the Pebble 2’s charging cord. On either side are the watch’s hardware buttons. On one end, you’ll find the power button, and on the opposite end are two buttons that serve the dual purpose of navigating the interface and adjusting volume. A center button, meanwhile, acts as a “select” button, and on the top and bottom are 22mm lugs that’ll fit any compatible wristband with quick release mechanisms. The Pebble 2’s design is old school. Pebble devices in years past have received a fair share of criticism for designs that make them feel like they’re built for kids. This Pebble is no different, but it’s subtler and quieter. It looks less conspicuous than its predecessor and that’s a good thing. Related: Mobvoi TicWatch 2 review But those refinements don’t come without sacrifice. The Pebble 2 is not as water-resistant as the model before it — it can withstand pressure at depths of 30 meters versus the old model’s 50 meters. The Pebble 2’s display and processor also have not been upgraded: they’re the same 1.26-inch, 144 x 168 pixel always-on display and ARM Cortex M4 present on the Pebble and Pebble Time, respectively. The interface has improved On the whole, navigation on the Pebble 2 is relatively intuitive. The Pebble 2 ships running the company’s latest firmware, version 4.0, which launched in last August of this year. The company calls it the “Timeline” and it’s much better than earlier versions of Timeline we tried. It’s an ongoing, chronological stream of notifications, news, reminders, and events laid out like a menu and loaded as needed. The Pebble 2’s heart rate tracking is wildly inaccurate. Apps that you frequently access can be designated as “favorites” and doing so pins them to the timeline for easy access. You can scroll up to three days ahead in the timeline. A relatively new feature called Quick Views presents you with upcoming calendar appointments and notifications at a glance. When one appears, pressing the “down” button opens additional information for perusal. It doesn’t take long to get a handle on the software. You move through the list of running timeline entries with the side keys, tapping until you’ve reached an entry about which you’d like to learn more. Then, you press the “select” key to populate the screen with additional information. Selecting a timeline notification about the weather, for instance, opens a screen with the time of day, current temperature, location, and a succinct forecast. Hitting select a second time in any app summons a settings menu with options to remove the app from your timeline or “mute” its future notifications. Notifications from a paired phone also hit the Pebble just like they do on the Apple Watch or Android Wear. When you get a Facebook Message or Instagram update, your wrist will buzz accordingly. Some of those notifications are actionable. Play a song on your iPhone or Android and you’ll be able to start, pause, or skip through tracks from the Pebble 2, or change the volume. Incoming calls also show a number and caller ID, and can be answered, silenced, or dismissed. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends As the Pebble development team points out on the wearable’s support webpage, Pebble is the only non-Apple wearable that can send replies to received iOS messages. It recently gained the ability to reply to emails, too. It’s a seamless process: hitting the “select” button when a message arrives pulls up a list of options — Delete, Archive, Mark as Read, Reply All, and Star — which work just the same as they do on the Apple Watch. You can reply to a message using voice dictation, or send a canned response. The Apple Watch still offers more options, like emoji, scribbles, and digital touches, but it’s nice that Pebble added canned responses to its software. Highly customizable Perhaps the best thing about the Pebble 2’s timeline is the degree to which it can be customized. On the Pebble 2 itself, you can change the text size of notifications and the strength of vibrations. From the companion app, you can toggle the notification settings of individual apps like Hangouts, Instagram, Messages, Slack, and almost any other app that taps into the notification framework of iOS or Android. Each can be muted permanently or periodically — only on weekdays, for example, or weekends. The companion app is also where you can reorder apps in the Pebble 2’s timeline, access settings menus, and choose watch faces. When it comes to watch faces, you have tons of options. You can edit watch faces in the companion app, too. Watch faces range from cute playful ones to everything from nationalism and mathematics to sports and brainteasers. New apps are also downloaded on your phone through the companion app. The Pebble 2 boasts thousands of apps to choose from, and that’s no exaggeration. There’s a mood tracker that measures your demeanor by asking you questions over a week; travel app that show you flight alerts, reservations, and weather ahead of and during a trip; and business directories that present nearby restaurants, bars, and other attractions for your consideration. There is also a surprisingly robust selection of games including Fitcat, an app that rewards physical activity with currency to spend on an adorable feline, and Pixel Minder, a Dig Dug-inspired title that tasks you with digging for rare minerals. Popular apps like Uber, Evernote, PayPal, RunKeeper, GoPro, Misfit, and Dominos are also available. As with previous Pebble devices, each storefront page contains a description of the app, the date it was last updated, and links to the creator’s previous work and contact information. Installing an app is as simple as tapping the “add” button in the upper right-hand corner, and a heart icon lets you mark your favorites. More isn’t always better, though, and many of Pebble’s apps feel like siloed experiences. They can’t easily tap companion apps on a paired smartphone, access weather data, or sync certain data in real time. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Somewhat surprisingly, Pebble doesn’t offer a voice assistant to make the most of its built-in microphone, either. In an age of smartwatches with voice-powered assistants like Siri and the Google Assistant, it’s an odd omission. Pebble Health Apps and watchfaces are only one component of the timeline, though. The rest is dominated by typical activity tracking for your steps, sleep, and heart rate. All of these metrics are tracked in Pebble Health, a built-in service that Pebble developed in collaboration with Stanford University. When you set up the Pebble, you can select your weight, sex, height, and birth date as well as specify goals like “I want to be more active” and “I want to sleep more.” The app lets you choose whether or not you’d like your data fed to third-party services like Google Fit or Apple Health. From that point on, almost everything is automatic. There’s a Workout app that collates heart rate data, distance, pace and steps in a single screen, but otherwise, sleep, activity, and fitness tracking happen in the background. Pebble simply cannot compete with modern smartwatches. Sleep tracking is by far the most impressive — and consistent — of the three. Lay motionless for a while and the Pebble will automatically detect that you’ve gone to bed, after which it’ll begin recording distinct periods of restfulness: sleep, deep sleep, and the times when you fall asleep and wake up. On the watch, that information is shown as a succinct summary: the start time and end time of your last sleep session; the length of your last “deep sleep” period; and the number of collective days you’ve gotten a good night’s rest. Sleep is broken down by individual days, too, up to a week proceeding, and each overview includes a timeline indicating how frequently you’ve entered deep sleep. The Pebble 2’s step tracker is much the same. The metrics are different, but the interface is identical. You see an overview of calories you’ve expended, the distance you’ve traveled in miles, a 30-day average, and a day-by-day overview of calorie burn you’ve burned throughout the past week. Heart tracking lacks an expanded view altogether: an animated heart icon above indicates your current heart rate in beats per minute. The companion Pebble app provides a much more detailed overview. The dedicated “Health” tab splits biometrics into three graphs: Activity, Heart Rate, and Sleep. The green Activity graph provides a nifty visualization of the calories you’ve burned over the course of a day, week, and month, indicating physically intense activities in a darker shade of green and lighter activities in a light shade. The Heart Rate graph plots chronological changes in BPM. And the Sleep app indicates both the total number of hours you’ve spent — on a daily, monthly, or weekly basis — sleeping (in light blue), in deep sleep (dark blue), or napping. Heart rate and fitness tracking don’t … work The Pebble 2’s heart rate tracking, unfortunately, is wildly inaccurate. It fluctuates between sky-high readings (180 beats per minute) one minute and impossibly low ones (50 beats per minute) the next. It didn’t seem to much matter whether readings were taken during, before, or after exercise, or even during periods of inactivity, and adjusting the tightness of the band didn’t appear to improve readings. This is a basic, techy smartwatch that offers geek cred in place of style. That’s a huge problem. The heart rate monitor is supposed to be a big selling point. It should be accurate and help improve calorie burn and exercise metrics, too. An inaccurate heart rate monitor is useless, and you might as well buy the slightly better looking Pebble Time without a heart rate tracker for $30 less at $100. The Pebble 2 + HR starts at $130, and that’s a lot to pay for an otherwise base-level Pebble watch with a heart rate monitor that doesn’t work. Poor heart rate monitoring isn’t the Pebble 2’s only fitness fumble. It doesn’t keep track of workout data: once a month’s time has elapsed, the previous days’ and weeks’ data is lost forever. The Pebble team said it plans to address that limitation in a November software update, but right now, it makes discerning trends and insights an obvious challenge. Battery life The Pebble 2 is zippy, for the most part. Apps launch largely without delay, the timeline’s animations are consistently smooth, and notifications frequently arrive on the Pebble and your phone simultaneously. Related: 30 must-have Pebble Time apps, watchfaces, and games for your wrist Perhaps more impressive than the Pebble 2’s performance is the longevity of its battery. The Pebble team quotes seven days on a single charge, and our unit seemed on track to best that estimation. Even with sleep and activity tracking features enabled, our Pebble 2’s battery percentage meter dipped no more than a few percentage points each day.

If you want a wearable that tightly integrates with services from the likes of Google and Apple, the Pebble 2 is not for you. If you want an accurate heart rate monitor and activity tracker that’ll provide substantive fitness insights, the Pebble 2 definitely is not the smartwatch for you. What are the alternatives? The DT Accessory Pack Bigger Leaner Stronger $13.13 Thinner Leaner Stronger $13.49 HealthMaster Elite Food Emulsifier $75 There are better alternatives at the Pebble 2’s price point. Sony’s $130 SmartWatch 3, a Android Wear-based watch with built-in GPS, a full-color screen, and a two-day battery life, is worth considering. If you’re in the market for a smartwatch, money is no object, and you own an iPhone, we highly recommend you consider the Apple Watch. It’s $150 more and offers built-in fitness tracking, a bright screen, and a classy-but-functional aesthetic. If Android Wear is more your style, the Huawei Watch is one of the best options out there. If you’re strictly in wearables for the fitness features, you might entertain the $130 Fitbit Alta, a tracker that lacks apps and games but delivers one of the best activity-tracking experiences in its class. For $40 more, you can get the $180 Samsung Gear Fit 2 with a heart rate monitor, GPS, and several smartwatch features. Pebble simply cannot compete with modern smartwatches. How long will it last? The Pebble 2 is already out of date. Its black and white screen, old design, and poor heart rate sensor make it a bad buy when there are much more capable devices available for the same price or a bit more. Pebble is also likely to sell new smartwatches soon, and its other offerings, including the Time Steel, are more stylish and worth your consideration if you’re dead set on a Pebble. Should you buy it? No. The Pebble 2 fails on several key points: It is a horrible fitness tracker, its apps generally are not as capable as those on the Apple Watch and Android Wear, and its hardware falls behind on too many levels.

By: FE Online | Published: October 8, 2016 6:06 PM In February 2016, the FBI had asked a court to ask Apple to help hack the encrypted iPhone 5c of another terrorist, San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook.(Website) In yet another battle between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the tech giant Apple, the former has been trying to crack open a password-locked iPhone, belonging to Dahir Adan, the private security firm employee who stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall this September. In February 2016, the FBI had asked a court to ask Apple to help hack the encrypted iPhone 5c of another terrorist, San Bernardino shooter Rizwan Farook. FBI director James Comey had then informed the public that the demand was just for a terrorist’s phone,instead of asking for the secrets of every iPhone owner. Now, what seems to be another legal battle between the two, another similar case has cropped up, where the FBI sought Apple’s help to unlock the iPhone of a killer. Dahir Adan, the man who stabbed 10 people in Minnesota was shot and killed by a police officer. Meanwhile, ISIS had claimed credit for the attack through social media. At a press conference, FBI special agent Rich Thorton said that the FBI was “in the process of assessing our legal and technical options to gain access to this device and the data it may contain.” However, the model of the operating system of the iPhone which was used by Adan was not revealed by Thornton, and it is important to note that, after iOS 8 that was launched on 2014, Apple devices have been encrypted, so much so, that not even Apple can decrypt the contents of the device. However, the Bureau has not filed a lawsuit against Apple yet, like the previous instance. Last time, which the case was going on, FBI abruptly withdrew the case and claimed that it had found a hack to enter the iPhone and also claimed to have had paid $1.3 million for it.

The option of pre-ordering iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus over the Internet does not seem to be enough for Apple fans in India as they waited in line – some for several hours – outside retail stores across the country on Friday evening to get their hands on the swanky new smartphones. Unlike previous years, when sales used to start at midnight, Apple this year started selling its new iPhone models at 7pm in India. But like every year, fans lined up and waited for several hours outside the stores to buy the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Many early buyers had placed offline pre-orders for the smartphones in order to be among the first to get their hands on the newest Apple gadgets.(Also see: Airtel's Rs. 19,990 iPhone 7 Offer: All You Need to Know) However, some people who had not placed pre-orders were apparently turned away by stores.

The iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s latest flagship, and it’s a super-size version of the iPhone 7. It has a lot in common with its immediate predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, but still controversial because of design decisions Apple made; namely, leaving out the headphone port. We’ve extensively tested this high-end model. Is it any good? Read this Apple iPhone 7 Plus review to find out. Build & Design Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is not a significant redesign from its recent predecessors. This look premiered with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, and then was used again on the 6S series in 2015, and now here it is again. There are tweaks in the new version, but anyone looking at this new model could easily confuse it for one released two years ago. It’s a fine design with rounded corners and moderate screen bezels, but Apple is reportedly putting all its design efforts into next year’s model, and seems to be coasting a bit with this one. To demonstrate, the iPhone 7 Plus is exactly the same size as the 6 Plus: 6.23 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches. Still, this has advantages, as some cases won’t have to be redesigned, though ones made for last year’s model will have a superfluous headphone jack (more on that later). The new device is actually just a hair lighter: 6.63 vs. 6.77 ounces, but that’s not a noticeable amount. There are a couple of new color options: black and jet black, in addition to silver, gold, and rose gold. Space grey is no longer an option, but it’s close to black anyway. The 5.5 inch screen is what makes this iPhone a “Plus,” but it brings drawbacks. This is undoubtedly a big phone, and makes a noticeable bulge in a front pocket. Anyone carrying one in a back pocket risks breaking it by sitting on it. It’s more hassle to carry around than most of its rivals. The iPhone 7 Plus is available in five different colors. It’s waterproof, and that’s a welcomed change. But don’t go overboard with it… literally. This model is IP67 standard, which means it is protected against dust and can withstand immersion in water up to one meter deep. Basically, that means there’s no worry about the iPhone 7 Plus getting rained on, and it will survive an accidental drop into the pool. However, it’s hard to use the touch screen when it’s wet, and no one should even try using this phone underwater. Display The Apple iPhone 7 Plus display is the same 5.5 inch size and 1080 x 1920 pixel specs as its predecessor. Apple typically keeps phone screen resolutions the same for several years so third-party application developers don’t have to modify their apps with every new model. And Apple did increase the maximum brightness by about 30%, and improved the color range. This makes it easier to see outside than any of its predecessors; we were even able to read an ebook in direct sunlight with no problems. Although Apple didn’t increase the pixel density past 401 ppi, one could argue that it didn’t need to. While the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 has an even higher pixel density topping 500 ppi, Apple’s offering already has so many pixels per inch than the human eye can’t make out individual pixels viewing it from an average distance, and therefore sees text and images displayed as smoothly and evenly as possible. At nearly 13 square inches, the display in the iPhone 7 Plus has over 35% more screen area than the iPhone 7. We find the iPhone 7 Plus to be a better option for watching video or playing games. People who need reading glasses can turn on options that will increase font sizes without overcrowding the larger display. Those who use their phone as their only mobile computer, rather than sporting both a phone and a tablet, owe it to themselves to consider whether they need the extra room. No phone supports the Apple Pencil; that’s reserved for the company’s iPad Pro line of tablets. Ports, Buttons, & Speakers The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has two rear-facing cameras. Easily the most controversial change Apple made with the iPhone 7 series is removing the dedicated headphone port, with the Lightning port taking over. A set of Lightning earbuds comes with this phablet, as well as an adapter so older headsets can still be used. There have been some complaints about the audio quality of the adapter, but we weren’t able to discern a difference between an MP3 played on the iPhone 7 Plus and the same file played on an iPhone 6S. The Lightning port continues to be the only charging and data port. As Apple won’t put memory card slots in its phones or tablets, users will need to turn to third-party options, like the ones from SanDisk and Lexar. Continuing with the controversies, the Home button on this new device isn’t really a button; it’s a capacitive area on the front, so it doesn’t move when pushed. There’s a slight vibration instead. This takes a small bit of getting used to, but not much. That said, using the phone while wearing gloves just got a bit more challenging. This “button” still functions as a fingerprint scanner for the Touch ID security system, taking the place of passwords for many functions, including unlocking the phone. This is generally quite reliable, correctly identifying proper fingerprints, and rejecting others. The exception is when the fingertip is wet; almost any amount of water severely downgrades the performance of this biometric scanner. Apple used the extra space freed up by removing the headphone port to add a second speaker. This offers stereo playback, but the speaker separation is tiny. Still, it does mean this device is capable of putting out a lot more sound than its predecessors. We had no problems hearing a TV show in a moderately noisy area, or using the speakerphone while driving. Camera The Apple iPhone 7 Plus has two 12-megapixel rear cameras, while the smaller iPhone 7 does not. One of these has a wide-angle lens with an ƒ/1.8 aperture, while the second has a telephoto lens with a ƒ/2.8 aperture. The inclusion of the second camera allows for a 2x optical zoom, which results in sharper images than the digital zoom provided by just about all other smartphones. Dual rear cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus One of the best photo effects isn’t available yet. Apple demoed a portrait mode in which the person being photographed is in focus but their background is blurred out, an effect typical of more expensive DSLRs and interchangeable lens cameras. This feature has been promised in a software update coming later this year. The rear camera supports 4K video recording at 30 fps, and there’s optical image stabilization for video and still images. The iPhone 7 Plus’ shooter functions well in dimly-lit areas, even with the flash off. The new quad-LED flash is brighter than the ones in previous iPhones, and does a nice job of lighting up dark areas. The front-facing camera is 7 MP with an ƒ/2.2 aperture, which is better than most main cameras from a few years ago. It supports 1080p video recording. Sample Pics Performance The iPhone 7 Plus is built around the A10 Fusion, Apple’s first quad-core smartphone processor. This includes two 64-bit 2.34 GHz CPU cores, along with a second slower pair dedicated to less demanding software, extending battery life. We ran the just-released Geekbench 4 test, and the score was 5590 on the multi-core test. This is the highest score of any Apple product, solidly outperforming even the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s 4750. The iPhone 7 Plus also beat the new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 and Galaxy S7 on this test. Real world use bears up the benchmarks: the iPhone 7 Plus offers as good a performance as anyone can expect from a mobile computer. One of the controversies surrounding this model is the reports that some iPhone 7 models have an odd hiss when performing demanding tasks. This might be emitted when the new processor when strained, but we haven’t experienced this on our test unit. The iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM, a fairly generous amount. The smaller iPhone 7 has 2GB, and the only iOS device with more is the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Apple offers the iPhone 7 Plus with 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB of built-in storage. This is another welcome change, as it’s twice as much as its predecessor for the same prices. We feel that 32GB is plenty for people who don’t want to carry around a lot of multimedia files, but those with many MP3s or videos should choose the 128GB one at least.

An in-depth discussion of all the new features in this version is outside the scope of this hardware review, but we will say that the iPhone 7 Plus’ 5.5-inch display makes it an outstanding platform for the new iMessage features, like stickers and hand-drawn comments. Apple bundles its iWork suite of productivity applications with all new models, as well its iLife suite. Battery The Apple iPhone 7 Plus includes a 2,900 mAh battery, which Apple says is good for up to 15 hours of web browsing over a Wi-Fi connection. We put this model through our own grueling battery test, asking it to continuously stream video from Hulu over Wi-Fi with the backlight on 50%. The 7 Plus lasted 7 hours 43 minutes before the battery hit 0% and the device shut down. This is a “torture test” and is close to the shortest amount of time one can expect this model to last with extremely heavy use. In our real world use, even on the days we heavily used our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review unit during the testing period, we never once ran out of of power, or even got below 38%.  Days with lighter use typically ended with the battery at about 60%, indicating to us that this phone could go two days without needing to be charged, as long as it was used fairly moderately. Apple still refuses to support wireless charging for its devices, so the only way to power up the 7 Plus is to plug in a cable. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t charge particularly quickly. In our testing, a hour of charging increased the battery level by approx. 35%, so a full charge takes about three hours. Value The retail cost of the iPhone 7 Plus is $769 for the version with 32GB of built-in storage. For comparison, last year’s iPhone 6s Plus with the same capacity is now $649. On the other hand, the list price for the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 with 64GB is between $850 and $880. Although the iPhone 7 Plus is about $100 less than one of its top rivals, this has to be regarded as a very expensive product. Still, it is Apple’s flagship, and the best iOS phone on the market. Those who want top-of-the line will usually be willing to pay for it, but there are more affordable options. Conclusion Apple’s decision to forgo the headphone port has drawn the most attention, and controversy. However, there’s a lot to like in this model, such as a long battery life with speedy performance, an innovative camera, and water resistance. The new Home button takes some getting used to, though. An unusual issue with the iPhone 7 Plus is it’s competing with a model that hasn’t even been announced yet. Rumors about the 10th anniversary iPhone are already making the rounds, and it is shaping up to be a more revolutionary model than this one, which is very evolutionary. Those who can wait might consider holding off until 2017 to see what Apple has to offer. Pros: Outstanding performance Very long battery life Water resistant Excellent cameras Cons: No headset port Expensive LEAVE A COMMENT 0 Comments | Log in to comment All content posted on TechnologyGuide is granted to TechnologyGuide with electronic publishing rights in perpetuity, as all content posted on this site becomes a part of the community.

Google is making a greater commitment to hardware in unveiling new phones, a smart speaker and other gadgets. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Google's "hardware" push is still really about its software. On Tuesday, the technology giant unveiled a raft of new gizmos it proudly proclaimed to be #madebygoogle, including two smartphones and a smart home speaker. The message from Google is that it's a new and gadgety dawn for the tech firm, which has floundered a bit in its hardware efforts. But based on what the company showed off, Google still seems far behind despite earlier serious hardware efforts. It's easier to think of the new gadgets as follow-ups to competitor products: a competitor for Apple's iPhone and for Amazon's Echo speaker. Yes, making products is hard; much harder, perhaps, than asking people to use your free websites or download your apps. So is it too late for Google on hardware? Why should it even bother, when the smartphone world, in particular, is so crowded already? It's true that even Google probably couldn't just make an iPhone clone and expect instant success. But smartphones are evolving into something new. After years of trying to make phones that are the fastest, thinnest and lightest, companies now need to deliver something more to draw consumers to stores. Smartphones have essentially become a commodity, albeit a valuable one that acts as the central remote control for everything else in your life. Google, in taking a leaf from Apple's playbook to design both hardware and software from the ground up, gives itself a chance to break through in this second leg of the hardware relay race and lead the next one. And for Google, the it-factor in this race is its voice-activated Google Assistant. Listening between the lines of the prepared speeches Tuesday, it seems pretty clear that Google wants to make Assistant an essential in everyone's life. Chief executive Sundar Pichai even said, explicitly, that he sees us moving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first world. In what was ostensibly a hardware event, the real promise of the presentations was one of a personalized Google that can answer questions about your life rather than a general query. Type "What am I doing next week?" into regular Google search, and you might get weekend productivity tips -- but not information about your next work trip. Assistant, if Google pulls it off, should be able to crawl through your calendar and give you the answer that you really need. Its conversational tone should also be able to deliver the right information, no matter what words you use to ask. That extends beyond what Amazon's Alexa can offer -- smart as it is, that voice assistant still answers queries based on the general Web more than on your personal digital information. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) And Siri, while plugged into your calendar, often doesn't understand what you're asking. Plus, Assistant isn't designed only for the smartphone. Google's decision to pair its Assistant-powered Home speaker with its Chromecast streaming dongles makes old tech new again, and responsive to voice commands for far cheaper than a new "smart" sound system or a smart TV. Assistant's many forms promises a low buy-in for homes to have the "Star Trek" computer -- the voice-activated assistant -- that we've always wanted. For consumers, an assistant plugged into the products we already use to run our lives is a big selling point. If Google offers nice hardware that really outshine others when it comes to integration with its popular software products -- Mail, Maps, etc. -- it could maybe pull a reverse-Apple and lead people to their hardware through their services. (Arguably, this could also be called pulling an Amazon.) In that sense, this hardware push isn't about Google straying from its software roots, but rather making the right package for them. Will it succeed? That's a difficult thing to say, of course. But going after both an aging, changing market in smartphones and the nascent smart home industry simultaneously is smart. That means you may come into the Googleverse through the Pixel phone, but you may also fall in love with the Home and then have that lead you to the phone. And it's certainly true that one can lead from behind. Getting serious about a product late doesn't necessarily mean getting counted out. Look at Apple and the iPad. Or Apple and the iPhone, for that matter. Still, this is by no means a slam-dunk for Google. Looking at its much-anticipated Tuesday hardware event, the only thing that really stands out is still its software -- which may raise questions about why they didn't just release it as an app that works on all phones. But if Google can really make good, logical hardware, it stands a better chance than most at upending a hardware market that's gotten a little stale.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US Election World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Flipkart CEO turns 'delivery boy' for iPhone 7 promotion: Did you see him at your doorsteps on October 7 Flipkart advertised CEO Binny Bansal as one among the delivery executives delivering Apple iPhone 7 orders to customers. Rahul R October 8, 2016 16:21 IST 1 Shares 1 Shares CEO of Flipkart, Binny Bansal on the right hand sidePress Release Apple's iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be sold in India through Flipkart, but this is not the news that should get you excited now. Major update is that Binny Bansal, CEO at the e-commerce giant turned himself into a delivery boy to personally give out iPhone 7 units to select pre-order customers. Deliveries of Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus began at 7 pm IST on October 7 and the highlight here was Binny Bansal who was advertised by Flipkart to hand-deliver iPhone 7 consignments to select buyers in Bangalore. Why advertise with us? Related Apple iPhone 7 hits stores in India on October 7; price, specifications details Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon Festival Sale: Worst mistakes you would be doing and smart solutions to avoid it "Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal will be one among the delivery executives who will be delivering the iPhone 7 today starting at 7 PM in Bangalore. Who will be first lucky customer who will get the first phone today?" Flipkart said in an earlier statement. Apple iPhone 7 customers, having pre-ordered their phones through Flipkart can let us know if they saw Bansal at their doorsteps on October 7. As of now, Apple has chosen Flipkart as an authorised seller of iPhones in India. However, what is notable at this juncture is the fact that rival e-commerce company Snapdeal has also started taking official orders to deliver iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets across India. As a promotional offer, , consumers can avail discounts on the new phones through Snapdeal's on-going exchange offer with zero cost EMI option. American Express credit card holders get an additional Rs 10,000 cashback on booking Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Nonetheless, Flipkart's promotion of advertising Binny Bansal as a delivery executive captures the eyeballs and beats rivals hands-down. If you are looking at purchasing Apple's newest flagships, you can do so, but it is not known whether Bansal would personally deliver it to you now. Cost-wise, the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will set you back by Rs 60,000 (price of a 32GB edition). If you have got money to burn, then try going-in for a 256GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus that is priced at Rs 92,000.

A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that Samsung had infringed on Apple's famous slide-to-unlock patent as well as its quick links patent, which covers software that automatically turns information like addresses and phone numbers into links, The Verge reported. Earlier this year, when Samsung appealed against the previous decision of Apple being granted a win, a three-judge panel stripped away Apple's triumph, saying one patent was not infringed and the other two were invalid. However, on Friday the three judges who sided with Samsung did not win a single ally and Apple's win was restored on an 8-3 vote (One of the 12 sitting Federal Circuit judges, Richard Taranto, did not participate), Ars Technica reported. "We conclude that the jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record. We thus reinstate the district court's award of costs which the panel had vacated," the court was quoted as saying. The full panel of judges determined that the three judges acted incorrectly by considering information that was not introduced in trial and by ruling on issues that were never brought up on appeal, the report added.

They take a deep look at the educational framework of the school,” said Stefan Eady, assistant head of school for academic resources. “Darlington’s project-based learning curriculum, focus on STEAM and makerspace integration, and our professional development approach were all considered.” The Apple Distinguished School program opens a number of opportunities to Darlington Community, including additional resources for teachers as well as increased exposure for the school. “Prior to implementing our Apple pilot program, I served on a committee of Darlington teachers, students, and parents,” said Rebekah Kinney, technology integration coordinator. “We visited a number of Apple Distinguished Schools to learn about their programs and it’s amazing to see that we are now achieving this designation and will be able to host visits from schools who are where we were six years ago.” As part of the application process, information technology staff members prepared an interactive e-book that outlines the school’s technology implementation program and integration of Apple products. This book will soon be trademarked and available for download in the iBooks Store. Chef Greg Paulson, and his wife Beth, stand in front of Kilkenny Castle in Kilkenny, Ireland, with the culinary students that participated in the “Irish Food and Cuisine” course. Media release: Chef Greg Paulson, director of Culinary Arts at Georgia Northwestern Technical College (GNTC), has always brought international cooking techniques to his kitchen-lab to teach students the various cooking methods used in other countries.This summer, he exposed students to Irish cuisine by bringing them to Ireland. The ten-day course “Irish Food and Culture,” was taught at the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT) in Waterford, Ireland, just outside of Dublin. Ten students took part in the chance-of-a-lifetime course which also included field trips to various markets, restaurants, butcheries, fromage (cheese) shops, famous landmarks, castles, and beaches. Georgia Northwestern was the first college in the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) to take part in the international agreement between the Waterford Institute of Technology and the TCSG. According to Paulson, one of the primary reasons GNTC was chosen was because TCSG officials were impressed by the culinary lunches that the Culinary Arts program offers to the public, which feature international cuisine. “Dr. Ian Bond, executive director of the International Center at TCSG, was very impressed with our ‘Fundamentals of Restaurant Operations’ course,” said Paulson. “As part of this course the students create the menu, prepare the food, serve it to the public, and interact with the customers.”         The Culinary Arts program is taught in the Woodlee Building on the Floyd County Campus of GNTC. The building is an early 20th century dwelling that has been renovated and updated to include a first-class teaching kitchen, commercial-grade equipment, and a refined serving area. Paulson says that he is entertaining the thought of doing a nine-day course in France and Germany in the future and hopefully making international experiences an ongoing part of the program.     Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Related Filed Under: Bartow, Education, Gordon, Polk ← Ware Mechanical forecast: Wind gusts up to 30 mph possible today from Hurricane, but no rain.

The Google Pixel and Pixel XL are the first smartphones to be “Made by Google.” They may have been manufactured by HTC, but make no mistake, that G on the back is very important. This is a major strategy shift for Google, and one that is long overdue. By taking end-to-end control of software and hardware, Google can elevate Android to the next level, addressing its major shortcomings. It’s a move that shows a willingness to stand toe-to-toe against Apple and shrug off any lingering deference to dominant Android partners like Samsung. How did we get here? When Google started the Open Handset Alliance it was reliant on hardware partners like HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony. It was only through them that Google could position itself on the majority of the world’s smartphones. The Nexus line was never a serious attempt to muscle in on the market. It grew out of a desire to produce a reference device for developers to test on. Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. The marketing muscle and cutting-edge technology that really drove Android adoption came from Google’s partners. All of them had been caught flat-footed by Apple’s iPhone and Google stepped into the software void and allowed them to compete again. It has largely been a mutually beneficial arrangement, but over time, the line between the open ideals of the platform at its conception and Google’s stewardship have grown increasingly blurred. Google has found itself walking a tightrope; trying to persuade partners to follow its advice, but unable to really bare its teeth for fear of them abandoning the platform. For years it looked as though gaining a foothold on devices through the software might be enough for Google, but stepping into hardware is the only way that the company can realize its vision for Android. To fully understand this move we have to consider the platform’s weaknesses. The problems with Android In the early days of Android its competitors bemoaned the complexity of the platform. It lacked the elegant simplicity and accessibility of iOS. Google worked hard to catch up and possibly even surpass its rival. In truth, the two platforms have far more in common today than features that divide them, but the idea that Android is harder to get to grips with has stuck. It’s an idea that has been reinforced by fragmentation — the Achilles heel of Android. There is no standardized Android experience because there are so many different versions of the platform out there on so many different handsets. Google never dictated hardware rules and that helped Android to grow quickly. But, while budget devices have propelled the platform into pole position, they’ve also often made for a poor experience. There’s a much bigger gap between a budget Android device and a flagship like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 than there is between the latest iPhone and the S7. Manufacturers desperate to differentiate themselves from the Android competition layered their own software on top of Android. This has muddied the waters further, negatively impacted performance, and led to excessive bloatware with lesser versions of Google’s apps set as defaults on many devices. As the underlying operating system has improved, these manufacturer UIs have grown increasingly superfluous, but what’s worse is that they’ve effectively blocked Google from rolling out important Android security updates when it wants to. There’s a multitude of hardware and software combinations, so updates have to pass through countless manufacturer and carrier hoops before they can reach our phones. This has left consumers adrift without the latest innovations from Mountain View, California. It has also left serious security vulnerabilities unpatched. There’s no way to spin that as a good thing for Android device owners. The Nexus devices addressed some of these problems, but they always felt like half-hearted releases from Google. They weren’t heavily marketed; they flew in the face of carriers; and Google never took full ownership of Nexus phones in the way it is now with the Pixel phones. Complete control Google cannot put the fragmentation genie back in the bottle. It has to try something different. Taking complete control is a gamble, but Google is coming from a position of strength. Parent company, Alphabet, has never been in better health. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This isn’t something that happened overnight, either. Google has been building towards this moment. It has worked with many of the world’s best hardware manufacturers. It owned Motorola Mobility for a while. It has also been quietly separating key features from the open Android platform and innovating through its own suite of apps instead. Google is now managing its own distribution and building a supply chain. Former Motorola chief Rick Osterloh was brought in specifically to build a hardware division. Google phones are now being developed in-house and the company intends to manage every facet, eventually designing its own “silicon” (customized processors), according to VP of Engineering Dave Burke in an interview with Bloomberg. More on fragmentation: Android is losing its battle with fragmentation, and you’re paying the price It’s that kind of tight control that has enabled Apple to achieve levels of performance that surpass the basic specs of the iPhone. That’s why the iPhone 7 has trounced Samsung’s latest and greatest in benchmarks and speed tests. The phenomenal success of Apple’s model cannot be denied. It only sold 17.2 percent of the smartphones on the market last year, but it secured 91 percent of the profits, according to Cannacord Genuity. Of course, to get anywhere near that level of success, Google will have to do a lot more than release a fast, expensive smartphone. It has to build the brand and show consumers why Pixel phones are worth paying a premium. The first phones of many The launch of Google’s new Pixel phones has been met with a mixed response. There’s a general perception that they’re too expensive, and they probably are, though that perception is partly because of the budget-priced expectation Google created with earlier releases in the Nexus line. But these phones aren’t supposed to illustrate what can be achieved to other manufacturers, they’re supposed to compete with the latest round of flagships. We’re already seeing predictions of relatively low sales, but it’s not like this is Google’s last throw of the dice. As Google integrates its artificial intelligence bot Assistant, not just into phones, but a whole line of hardware, buying into that ecosystem instead of Apple’s or Amazon’s becomes a more tempting prospect. The supply chain will solidify, the marriage of software and hardware will grow closer, and Google will continue to pour the lion’s share of its innovative goodies into Pixel phones that will surely get better and better. Hands on: Google guns for the big boys with the spec-stacked Pixel We’ve seen what Google can do with software. Android is the world’s most popular mobile operating system by far, with an 87.6 percent share of the worldwide market, according to IDC. But it didn’t conquer the world overnight. Given time, there’s no telling what Google might do with hardware. This is a smart step for Android to take. It’s a necessary step, but let’s remember that it’s also the first step.

Apple  has a tough act to follow after the success of the iPhone 6, but sales are expected to benefit this year from the inclusion of the Chinese market, where the gadget’s debut was delayed in 2014 due to regulatory issues. With one of Apple’s largest markets in the fold, analysts expect the company to sell about 12 million to 13 million phones in the first weekend of availability, up from more than 10 million last year. Eager from San Francisco to London to Sydney have camped out for days prior to the release, and Apple said earlier this month that based on pre-orders, sales of its new phones were on pace to beat last year’s first weekend performance. “The stage is set for Apple to show year-over-year growth over the Herculean iPhone 6 sales,” FBR Capital Markets senior analyst Daniel Ives said. Apple relies heavily on the sale of its flagship iPhones, which generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue in the latest quarter. First released in 2007, the iPhone is Apple’s best-selling device ever. After a dramatic redesign last year in which Apple enlarged the iPhone’s screen and added mobile payments, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus boast more modest improvements. The phones, which are the same size as last year’s models, feature improved cameras and 3D touch, a display technology that responds according to how hard users press their screens. Apple executives have said just a fraction of their customers have upgraded to the iPhone 6, suggesting they have plenty of room to grow this year. And lackluster offerings this year from rival smartphone manufacturer Samsung will help Apple’s stand out in the marketplace, analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy wrote in an email. “Over the long haul, the 6s will eclipse the 6 as Apple is even more competitive versus Samsung in emerging regions and is gaining share in traditional regions,” Moorhead wrote in an email. “Samsung didn’t bring a whole lot of compelling features to consumers with their new lines of phones.” The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, which start at $199 and $299 with a two-year contract with a mobile service provider, will be available on Friday in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Adam Howell, Phoneys' creator, says that he was told by Apple that: The stickers couldn’t be blue or green, they couldn’t use San Francisco as the typeface, and the app could no longer be marketed as a “prank” app, because Apple doesn’t approve prank apps... Howell was given until this Thursday to change his stickers. Howell decided not to change them and the stickers were pulled from sale. Today, Howell published a follow-up that provides interesting insights into the early iMessage App Store from the perspective of an app that sat in the #1 paid spot for eight days in a row. Phoneys, which cost $0.99, netted $23,206 in the eleven days it was available and drew nearly two million impressions. The high number of impressions were driven by Phoneys' spot in the Top Paid chart, but conversion rates were highest from customers who tapped a link to Phoneys from Howell's and other websites, highlighting importance of marketing outside the App Store. Howell makes a number of other interesting observations about selling stickers in the iMessage App Store including that: Right now, depending on the day of the week, 1,000–1,500 sales a day will make your app #1 Top Paid in the iMessage App Store. Around $2,500-$3,000 dollars in sales a day will make your app #1 Top Grossing in the iMessage App Store. Being featured on the iMessage App Store home screen will get your app around 150,000-200,000 impressions a day, but unless you’re on the top paid or top free chart, it won’t drive very many conversions (I’ve talked to several folks whose stickers are currently being featured that back this up). Howell's data reflects the performance of just one sticker pack that was available for less than two weeks, but given its success during that brief period, Phoneys is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the early iMessage App Store.

Under this offer, the telecom operator will provide unlimited local and STD calls, free roaming, and free data (5GB, 10GB or 15GB, as per the plan you choose) under a new postpaid plan. The offer, however, is available only to customers in Noida and Karnataka, according to the Airtel website. An Airtel representative whom Gadgets 360 spoke to said that this plan is under “testing” in these regions.Update, 10 October 2016: Sources have reiterated to Gadgets 360 that the offer is available only in Delhi and Bengaluru, and added it's for select enterprise customers only. Meanwhile, Airtel has issued the following official statement with respect to the said plans: We understand that there is some confusion regarding two separate offers from Airtel on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus.   There is a special 10 GB per month free additional data offer with any Airtel Infinity plan with iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. The offer is open for all customers and is very much active. There is also a device lease plan, which is being piloted for employees of select enterprise customers, and this offer is also very much active. In the interest of customers and to avoid any further confusion, relevant changes are being made to the website. These will reflect shortly. As part of this plan, new and existing Airtel customers can opt for the ‘iPhone for Life’ plan by making a down payment to get their iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The remaining amount will be paid for by Bajaj Finance Limited. Customers can choose between either of three postpaid plans mentioned below, and can switch the plans when they wish to. They must remain subscribed to the ‘iPhone for Life’ plan for one year.(Also see: Top 10 Features of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus) During the one year period, customers will not be able to port to another network, switch to non-‘iPhone for Life’ plans (either postpaid or prepaid), terminate the services, or transfer ownership of neither the plan nor the iPhone to someone else. However, customers have the option to foreclose the loan from Bajaj Finance by paying the charges that the company levies. After the completion of one year, the iPhone 7 users will have two options: either to upgrade to the next version of the iPhone or to buy the handset they are using by making a balloon payment. Following are the down payment options as well as the corresponding balloon payments under this plan. Additionally, if a customer does not visit an Airtel store to return the iPhone 7 or upgrade it, Bajaj Finance will automatically debit the balloon payment amount from their bank account at the end of the thirteenth month. The users can then keep the handset with themselves. (Also see: Buying iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus? Here Are the Discounts You Can Still Get) However, Airtel has not mentioned the charges, if any, will be levied to ‘iPhone for Life’ subscribers who want to upgrade to next year’s iPhone. Moreover, Airtel has the option to refuse the upgrade to users who have damaged the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus units given to them under this plan. Users can be refused an upgrade if the iPhone unit given to them is returned with damaged or missing part, heavy wear and tear, or non-standard components. In order to upgrade or return the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, customers have to visit an Airtel store within 30 days of the completion of their year-long rental period. They can then also decide to go for another postpaid plan; if they do not state which postpaid plan they wish to subscribe to, Airtel will continue with their existing plan, but at a lower rate. According to Airtel’s website, the Rs. 1,999 plan would then cost Rs. 1,199, the Rs 2,499 plan would go down to Rs 1,599, and the charges for the Rs 2,999 plan will become Rs 1,999 per month. (Also see: Apple iPhone 7 vs Google Pixel vs Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge) The ‘iPhone for Life’ plan cannot be clubbed with other offers that Airtel is running. Airtel’s offer comes around the same time Reliance Jio announced that it will offer iPhone users free calling and 4G data a total of 15 months, or an extra year after the welcome offer expires for everyone else. Under this offer, Reliance Jio users will get unlimited local, STD and national roaming voice calls, 20GB of 4G data, unlimited 4G data usage at night, 40GB of Wi-Fi data at Jio hotspots, unlimited SMS, and subscription to Jio's apps. The company pegs the value of all this at Rs. 18,000. Enterprise customers get an additional discount of 25 percent. This year's iPhone models come in three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB. The 32GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 60,000, while the 128GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 70,000, and the 256GB iPhone 7 has been priced at Rs. 80,000. The 32GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 72,000, the 128GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 82,000, while the 256GB iPhone 7 Plus has been priced at Rs. 92,000.

Dubset Spotify and Apple Music get unofficial mixes, the best part of SoundCloud Posted Oct 6, 2016 by Josh Constine (@joshconstine) 0 SHARES Next Story Buying Washio’s assets, Rinse cleans up part of the on-demand laundry market SoundCloud’s big differentiator is its offering of unofficial, user-uploaded content that the major labels don’t release and that isn’t on Spotify or Apple Music. Or at least they weren’t. The first unofficial single-track remixes just went live on Spotify and Apple Music thanks to their partnerships with music rights management service Dubset. Apple struck a deal with Dubset in March, and Spotify did in May, BPMSupreme reported. But the remixes are finally beginning to stream today, starting with this DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of Anderson .Paak. We’ve reached out to Spotify and Apple for comment. [Update: Spotify confirms that short-form mixes are now available. This is apparently just a small part of its integration with Dubset. It says the bigger part is when long-form mixed content becomes available, but there’s no definite timing on that.] Still missing are the multi-song mixsets DJs often share from their gigs. But Dubset is also equipped to distribute royalties from those and its deals permit them. Dubset CEO Stephen White tells me “Mixes are coming next!” Dubset works by scanning an entire mix and matching every part of the track to its Mixbank of snippets of official songs based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. Dubset matches the samples in a mix to these snippets, then distributes royalties for the play evenly to the original rights holders. In this case, Anderson .Paak’s rights holders would get paid because his music is the basis of Jazzy Jeff’s remix. White says 700 million people a month listen to mixed content, making it a big opportunity. But record labels have historically fought against unofficial mixes because they considered them piracy since they weren’t getting paid. Dubset gives them a fair share, so they’ll permit remixes and mix sets to stream on the major platforms. Royalty revenue from the platform is shared with rights holders while Dubset gets a cut. “Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with,” White tells me. This “allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid!” The fact that unofficial content is now going live on Spotify and Apple Music could reduce the acquisition potential for SoundCloud, which the Financial Times says is in late-stage negotiations to be bought by Spotify. TechCrunch’s sources confirm the two have recently been talking about M&A. But if Spotify can get the best of SoundCloud’s content without coughing up a ton of money for a broken company that’s been struggling for years… Without the legal grey area of music as a differentiator, Spotify and Apple Music will end up competing on product features like Spotify’s Discover Weekly playlist and Apple’s Beats 1 live radio station, as well as on exclusives and early access to big releases from top artists. The real winners here, though, are the artists and listeners. Original rights owners will get paid, remix producers and mixset DJs can share their creativity without being pirates and listeners can hear the music they want no matter how it got made. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Music Description All the ways you love music.

By Leslie P. Norton and Crystal Kim Biography Updated Oct. 8, 2016 10:58 a.m. ET For decades, the derision aimed at “socially responsible” investing was palpable. It was a style of investing that brought to mind visions of the Summer of Love and no-nukes sit-ins, earning the disdain of many on Wall Street. But the times they are a-changed, and investing with an eye toward companies with sustainable business practices is now considered, well, just good business. A company’s efforts toward sustainability, such as fair labor practices, good environmental stewardship, and diverse internal leadership, improves returns, according to research by index provider MSCI. And funds that invest in these sustainable companies are top performers themselves, Barron’s finds in our first annual performance ranking of the 200 most sustainable funds. (SEE THE FULL LIST HERE.) That shouldn’t be a surprise, though it might be to some—including the fund managers themselves. Of the 50 sustainable funds on our list that beat the market in the past year, all but one eschew the term. “Sustainability? What’s that?” queries Jack Murphy of Levin Capital Strategies, who co-manages No. 1 performer Transamerica Large Cap Value (ticker: TWQAX). Good question: What exactly is “sustainability?” It’s a broad term that encompasses corporate management that is ethical, efficient, and long-term focused. Also called ESG investing—for environmental, social, and governance factors—it has been demonstrated time and again that companies that embrace this type of good management outperform their peers. Companies that ignore ESG factors do so at their peril. Cutting corners on environmental issues, for instance, can lead to lawsuits, fines, and damages. Businesses that use less water and less power have lower costs and operate more efficiently. Good corporate governance plays a winning hand in capital allocation and is critical to corporate longevity. “If a company is being managed for the short term to maximize revenue, that’s not sustainable,” says Phil Davidson, co-manager of American Century Equity Income (TWEIX), No. 3 on our list. Sustainable practices, in other words, predispose companies to outperform. Some 80% of Standard & Poor’s 500 companies now issue sustainability reports, which provide information on their economic, environmental, social, and governance performance. In the 1990s, just a handful did. Campaigns led by sustainable investors helped break apartheid in South Africa and forced Nike NKE 0.7541178805318516% Nike Inc.

Apple changed its practices; Volkswagen was slapped with billions of dollars in penalties. A growing number of data providers are rating companies on metrics of sustainability. Indexes of sustainable companies have popped up, including some from Dow Jones, which owns Barron’s, and three from Morningstar. INVESTORS ARE EMBRACING this approach. From 2012 to 2014, sustainably invested assets in the U.S.—including mutual funds, separate accounts, and institutional assets with a sustainable mandate—rose 76%, to nearly $6.6 trillion, or one of every six dollars under professional management in the U.S., according to the Forum for Sustainable & Responsible Investment. That means there’s more money invested with an eye toward sustainability than there is in the entire exchange-traded fund industry and the hedge fund industry combined, according to Tiburon Strategic Advisors. The amount of money on the planet that is sustainably invested is an eye-popping $21.4 trillion. “This is one of the few segments of active management that’s not losing to ETFs” and where asset growth is still accelerating, says Tom Manning, CEO of Wellesley, Mass.–based F.L.Putnam Investment Management, a financial advisor that oversees $980 million in sustainable stocks and bonds. The prospect that sustainable funds will change society isn’t far-fetched. Tiburon found that 85% of millennials and 77% of women are very interested in such investing, versus 61% of men. Millennials are “more socially concerned and active than any generation of young people since the 1960s,” says Robert Zevin, regarded as the father of socially responsible investing and the founder of Boston-based Zevin Asset Management. “The mood of the whole country is much more concerned with environmental and economic-justice issues. People feel they can address these as investors and in other parts of their lives.” It’s not just investors driving the change. “It’s driven by consumers and investors, but there’s also internal interest—well-educated professionals who work for major companies take these issues seriously,” says Jon Hale, head of sustainability research for Morningstar. “It no longer feels cynical.” LIKE THE REST OF THE FUND UNIVERSE, sustainable funds come in all shapes and sizes. Morningstar’s database includes 225 funds with some sort of sustainable mandate; they have $182 billion in assets. But “sustainable” is an umbrella term for a variety of investment styles. The oldest and perhaps best-known carry the moniker “socially responsible investing.” SRI funds tend to exclude companies that negatively affect society.

Domini Social Equity (DSEFX), from the firm co-founded by Amy Domini, a doyenne of socially responsible investing, doesn’t invest in tobacco, alcohol, gaming, weapons, nuclear energy, oil, gas, or coal. That fund landed at No. 187. The next iteration, ESG funds, focus on what companies are doing right, favoring those with the best environmental, social, and governance practices across their industries. This is true stock-picking, and it has room for different philosophies.

The Catholic-oriented Ave Maria funds won’t invest in corporations that facilitate abortion or embryonic stem-cell research, ruling out most drug and biotech companies, hospitals, and health insurers. They also prefer companies that don’t offer benefits to same-sex couples. BUT WHAT IS PERHAPS most interesting is how mainstream sustainable investing is becoming—so much so that many funds that don’t wear the label still embrace the practice. Major fund purveyors, such as Wellington Management and Capital Group, are already using environmental, social, and governance factors in creating their portfolios, including the behemoth $82 billion American Funds Washington Mutual WMIH -9.090909090909092% WMIH Corp.

Research firm Sustainalytics evaluates the sustainability of 6,500 companies worldwide using more than 100 of ESG factors, as well as incidences of environmental accidents, fraud, or discriminatory behavior. Morningstar has partnered with Sustainalytics to use its data to assess 20,000 funds, giving them a sustainability score based on their portfolio holdings. Barron’s took this a step further. To see if sustainable funds—whether they call themselves that or not—can really outperform others, we used the Morningstar data to screen for large-company U.S. stock funds (the ones most widely held by U.S. investors) that had sustainability grades of “above average” or “high.” In comparison, an S&P 500 index fund has an “average” sustainability rating. We threw out any with assets of less than $300 million, and came up with a list of 200, with $1 trillion in total assets. We then ranked them by one-year performance. The list was top-heavy with value funds. But it also yielded some surprising findings. It includes well-regarded investors, such as Chris Davis of Davis Advisors, Bruce Baughman of Franklin Templeton, and the folks at Mairs & Power—none of whom you’d associate with even a faint whiff of patchouli. Indeed, our sustainable group performed better than most large-cap funds, returning 13.4% over the past 12 months, versus 11.9% for the category. True, that’s below the S&P 500’s blistering 15.4%, but even here these sustainable funds shone: 50, or 25%, did beat the S&P, compared with just 12% of all actively managed large-cap funds. Also startling: We had to go through quite a few funds before we found one that actually identifies itself as sustainable, and that is Jerome Dodson’s Parnassus Endeavor (PARWX), at No. 7. Dodson, one of the great stockpickers of this century, unabashedly embraces the sustainable moniker. Perhaps his confidence comes from the fact that he’s one of just a handful of pros who has topped the S&P 500, year in and year out. (He was featured in a Barron’s cover story early this year, “The Market Beaters,” Jan. 9.) Some pillars of sustainability, however, such as Domini Social Investments and Calvert Investments, landed at the bottom of our list. Meanwhile, of the 44 sustainable large-cap funds, 25 didn’t make the list at all. Ten were eliminated because their portfolios weren’t sustainable enough—earning an average or even below-average ratings from Morningstar. In the accompanying article “Who’s Not on the List, and Why”, we explain further. Indeed, many fund managers on our list didn’t realize that their funds might appeal to sustainable investors. “This is interesting to hear—the fund is not marketed or positioned that way!” exclaims Ray Nolte, chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital, whose SkyBridge Dividend Value (SKYIX) was up 21% in the past year, placing it at No. 5. It owns 10 of the Dow’s highest-yielding stocks, and an additional couple of dozen that rank highly on profitability, valuation, and yield. Its largest positions include Viacom VIA 1.0786635096027362% Viacom Inc.

A KEY REASON FOR OUTPERFORMANCE is that companies with sustainable practices and good governance are likely to be high quality.

For a company to be considered for the portfolio, it must have had a 15% return on equity, every year for 10 years. Co-manager Rob McIver says that Jensen didn’t set out to be a sustainable investor, but has learned that “good long-term practices translate into good environmental, social, and governance [results],” he says. “More importantly, it mitigates regulatory risk and can improve a company’s profitability. It has always been baked into our analysis.” And what happens when, as night follows day, blue chips fall from favor? In such periods, these funds probably will trail the market. But chosen well, stocks of sustainable companies will beat the averages over the long haul. So will the funds that own them.

The Orchard's special page on the website is was very odd.  Apple has taken down the description since I started writing this piece and one hopes someone wasn't just fired. But there are some Tweets to reference the oddness of the language.

In an 8-3 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Together, the two cases are the remnants of a global legal battle between the world's biggest makers of smartphones that began in April 2011 and at one point spanned four continents. In this case, Apple claimed that Samsung infringed patents for the slide-to-unlock feature, autocorrect and a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to make phone calls. The bulk of the award, $98.7 million, was for the detection patent that the earlier panel said wasn't infringed. The February decision also said the other two patents were invalid. That was a wrong decision, the court ruled Friday, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. The opinion was a surprise -- the court never announced that it would consider the case before all active judges prior to issuing the opinion. In a dissent, Circuit Judge Timothy Dyk objected to the full court opting to take on the case without allowing additional legal arguments, saying the majority opinion results in "profound changes" in the analysis of whether patents cover obvious variations of earlier ideas. The three judges who objected to the majority opinion were the same ones who had thrown out the verdict in February. Dyk said the panel "has continuingly expressed willingness, and indeed desire" to remove the information that the majority objected to, saying it wasn't necessary to the original decision. The Federal Circuit handles all patent appeals in the U.S., so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Trump plans to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants George Pyle: By backing Trump, after all, Mormons blow their moral lead Utah football: After wild weekend, Utes have two 'Super Bowls' remaining to secure lofty goals Oregon medical examiner identifies remains as daughter of Piano Guy Emails: Utah State officials knew multiple women had accused student Jason Relopez of rape, but didn ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Picture by Terry Harris 07:00 Saturday 08 October 2016 0 Have your say While it might prove unlucky for some, the 13th annual Apple Day proved to have a wide a-peel to visitors. Stamford Community Orchard Group hosted its annual Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre and it proved as popular as ever to people from across the area - except for a short time in the afternoon when a heavy burst of rain kept people from coming in and those who were already in, from leaving! Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre. The East of England Apple and Orchards Project brought along many different varieties of apple for people to see and sample and experts were also on hand to identify some of the apples visitors brought with them. This proved popular with the experts run off their feet for most of the day. Members of the community orchard group also shared their advice on how to look after your own apple trees, while there was also lots of crafts and fun games for children - including of course, apple bobbing. Stallholders were also there selling a range of products. But for chairman of the Stamford Community Orchard Group Annie Hall, the highlight was seeing the look of pure joy on a youngster’s face when he realised he had won a competition to guess the number of apples in a basket. With guesses ranging from 20 to 79, it was nine-year-old Finley’s guess of 30 which meant he secured a book token and some delicious apples of his own to enjoy. Apple Day at Stamford Arts Centre. Annie said: “It was once again enormous fun - we had a lot more people bringing in their apples so the experts were kept very busy identifying them all. In fact, they’ve never been so busy.” Annie also thanked all the volunteers without whom this day just can’t happen and to businesses which gave tombola prizes. She paid particular thanks to Stamford Arts Centre for hosting the event.

The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung’s infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Watch all our tech videos below Friday’s decision was made by the full slate of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. In an 8-3 ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow US Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.

Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly $99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded $158,400 in damages. Friday’s decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that Friday’s ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. Related: Apple told to pay $302 mn in damages to US patent firm “But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward – and it’s a big win for Apple.” The case is Apple Inc v.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Apple should acquire Twitter Nate Swanner - Oct 7, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit With Google and Disney bowing out — and Salesforce throwing cold water on a deal — Twitter’s acquisition hopes seem dead on arrival. Though an internal struggle over any acquisition may be bubbling, there’s one company that remains a dark horse; a company that has every reason to want a news platform that moves at the speed of light, but has a social layer attached along with some streaming media add-ons. Yup, we’re talking about Apple. It’s not crazy Let’s break down what Twitter is in 2016. You’ve obviously got social, but that’s sputtering along. Twitter has gone so far as to rebrand itself as a news app in the App and Play Stores to distance itself from social. Still, social matters. Twitter has looped in several social tricks like contextual stickers and longer video playback to help encourage people to actually use it. Twitter is also a video streaming service. Remember that chatter about Apple wanting to start its own TV service, but having trouble striking deals with networks or entities like the NFL? There’s nothing wrong with buying your way in. Its main focus is now news, and Apple News could use something that makes it more real-time. Alerts might surface news items once a journalist hits ‘publish,’ but that’s a lot of obfuscation between ‘breaking’ and ‘happened.’ right now, Apple News is basically Flipboard — but it can (and should0 be more. Twitter fits that mold nicely. The rest of Twitter When we hear ‘Twitter may be acquired’ we narrow our scope to the streaming service we interact with (maybe?) daily. There’s more to Twitter, though. Vine is a good bit of fun, but also recently expanded its scope to become more than a six-second looping video feed. In letting users submit video that’s about two minutes long, there’s a lot of synergy between it and Twitter that the company hasn’t yet seized. Periscope is to video what Twitter is for 140-characters. It’s punchy, immediate and downright easy to master. Its real-time, contextual aim is a winning proposition for a company that wants to get into the news and streaming video game as Apple does. And there’s a heavy developer angle to Twitter. Fabric, the company’s dev-centric toolkit, would make a tidy home inside of Apple. While some of the third-party workarounds may be lost (unless Apple also buys Stripe, which lol no), the framework is there for Apple to re-position Fabric as internal tools for developers. Think TestFlight, which Apple bought and — more or less — left alone. You probably wouldn’t even know it was coming, either Do you know how many startups and companies Apple acquires in a given year? No, you don’t — nobody outside the company really does. While Apple couldn’t avoid a very Beats-like public spectacle in buying Twitter, it might be kicking the tires incognito. With Beats, Apple was poised to revamp iTunes into streaming, so all eyes were on its next move.Twitter, though — Twitter is unnecessary. Apple could very well build what Twitter has, it would just take time. The downside there is time itself. We don’t want to wait for Apple to figure out streaming deals and how to capture real-time news or if there’s a good social sharing platform it can think of (we blast it for trying social, but we still give it a shot when there’s something like Ping or Connect ). The time is now. And while Twitter stock is at an all-time low, I say but the company and keep the executives tweeting.

The court said that there was substantial evidence for the jury verdict related to Samsung’s infringement of Apple patents on its slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, as well as quick links, which automatically turn information like addresses and phone numbers into links. Yesterday’s decision was made by the full slate of judges on the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC In an eight to three ruling, the judges said that a previous panel of the same court should not have overturned the verdict last February. The three-judge panel did not follow US Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review, because it examined evidence outside the record of the case, the decision said. Representatives for Samsung and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. The appeal stems from a May 2014 verdict from a federal court in San Jose, California, which ordered Samsung to pay US$119.6 million for using the Apple features without permission. Infringement of the quick links feature accounted for nearly US$99 million of the damages. The jury had also found that Apple infringed a Samsung patent on digital photo technology and awarded US$158,400 in damages. Yesterday’s decision upholds that award. The two companies have been battling over mobile device technology patents for years, with Apple mostly prevailing. In December, Samsung paid Apple US$548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case. Part of that dispute has been appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear it on Tuesday. James Gibson, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in an email to Reuters that yesterday’s ruling is based on a procedural issue rather than a disagreement over patent law. “But this seemingly pedestrian ruling is an important precedent for those who want patent protection going forward - and it’s a big win for Apple.” The case is Apple Inc v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al, in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, No. 15-1171. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week The best action cams for winter sports Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Xbox at 15: Five of the very best original games Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Apple now sells refurbished iPhones China unveils first satellite smartphone Huawei wants to beat Apple in smartphones in two years Three top smartphone cameras in real-world tests Samsung seeks redemption with AI-infused Galaxy S8 phone Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: Trump picks Priebus as White House chief of staff Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles Apple, Samsung take battle to US Supreme Court Apple wins patent ruling against Samsung in US appeals court Apple wins ruling to force Samsung to change products Apple and Samsung are friendly again, and the competition should be terrified Apple vs Samsung case calls on the rising complexity of patents Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

We still had a good crowd all day and streets are full,”  said David Cornett, who been hawking his Just Herbs custom-blended seasonings at the Apple Festival for 34 of its 39 years. “We come every year and have a lot of repeat customers. People look for us.” While many of the more than 110,000 visitors who travel to the festival come from surrounding states, it was just a short drive over from neighboring Sullivan County for Tandy Hobbs and her husband Travis. They were on a search for apples, and Tandy knew just which ones she wanted. “Everybody has their own taste, but I love the Winesap,” she said. “We have apples at home, but these are big and you can tell they’re really fresh.”  Eva Hubbard, a member of the Unicoi County Chamber of Commerce, which stages the annual festival, said the chamber was pleased with the excitement people seemed to have for the festival. “We’ve had a great turnout,” she said. “And even though it’s rained, our weather sure is better than last year. We have a lot of new vendors, a lot of diverse vendors. And we have a lot of really good food.”  A regular on Southeast Tourism Society’s list of Top 20 Event and a three-time winner of the Northeast Tennessee Tourism Association’s Pinnacle Award, the festival top attractions include the  Blue Ridge Pottery show, held at the nearby Unicoi County Middle School, and more than 300 arts and craft vendors who line the streets of Erwin for the two-day festival. Today’s festival activities will include live music on two downtown stagesand a tailgate party with the weekend’s biggest games on big screen TV at The Bramble entertainment venue on Gay Street. Festival hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Parking is available just outside the festival area at Exit 37 of Interstate 26. Because of the large number of people who attend the festival, organizers request no pets, bicycles and skateboards inside the festival area.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple looking at oddly shaped batteries, could improve phones’ battery life By Ethan Baron / October 7, 2016 at 5:56 PM Apple is thinking outside of the box. Or at least outside of the traditional box shape of a mobile device battery. “This common type of battery pack design may be unable to utilize free space in the portable electronic device that is outside of a rectangular space reserved for the battery pack,” said a patent application from Apple that was made public this week by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. “For example, a rectangular battery pack of this type may be unable to efficiently utilize free space that is curved, rounded, and/or irregularly shaped.” And with its recently released iPhone 7,  Apple appears to need some help with regard to the battery. Research firm Which found the iPhone 7 had the worst battery life in its class, because the battery was relatively small. Apple’s patent application, made in February, envisions batteries in non-traditional shapes ranging from a rectangle with some areas removed to a “a spirally wound jelly roll” structure. Although the technology is not guaranteed to reach the market, Apple may have hit on a way to boost battery life for its phones and other devices by leaving no internal corner unfilled.   Photo: The Apple logo hangs on the Apple Store on Fifth Avenue on August 5, 2015 in New York City.

The Cupertino - hqed company is pulling out all the stops to ensure that its debut in India generates as much of good news. And it’s tie ups with the Mukesh Ambai owned Reliance Retail and Jio are steps in that direction. Buyers of a new iPhone7 and iPhone7 Plus, are being offered Rs 1,499 worth Jio Digital Life services complimentary for 12 months from 1 January 2017. This includes unlimited local, STD and national roaming voice, unlimited text, 20 GB of 4G Data, 40 GB of WiFi Data and Unlimited Night 4G Data, unlimited subscription to premium Jio Applications. The offer is valid in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru only. And it has also been extended to new purchases of older iPhone models such as the 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+, 5SE across all Reliance Digital stores and select Apple Premium Resellers (APR) and Apple Authorized Resellers (AAR). Plus of course, they are entitled to the three months of free data, voice and app services until 31 December 2016. Making it a total of 15 months of freebies if they buy one of the above iPhone models now. “Today’s announcement brings together India’s best premium 4G network with the incredible iPhone experience," said Jio president Mathew Oommen. "Jio is India’s 4G-only network, providing high-speed internet across India. The true power of iPhones can now be experienced by all Indian iPhone users on the Jio network.” Reliance Retail is offering users the convenience of pre-ordering the iPhone models online and having them delivered, installed and activated with Jio services in their homes. “It’s a great initiative by Apple, Jio and Reliance Retail,” says a marketing consultant. “It should lead to volume uptakes. However, With Jio’s calls now getting connected with other mobile telcos easier than before, one will have to wait and watch whether it can provide consistent service in both data speeds and in voice.” Jio is currently under challenge from other mobile providers like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea who have also shaved their 4G wireless broadband prices, in line with it playing the volume and price warrior game. tags iPhone 77 Plus7+6S6S PlusiPhone6. 6+6 Plus5SEMukesh AmbaniJioReliance Digital4Gwireless broadband Trending Dish TV Videocon: Building a DTH powerhouse of global reckoning From a barber's shop to a tea stall: BBC Urdu looks at the lives of India's young Muslims Zoom is back with s2 of 'Yaar Mera Superstar' from today National Geographic's global rebranding date coincides with 'Mars' Sony Pictures to telecast UFC 205 live in New York City   Latest Reads Via.com e-comm launches 'Lite' for mobile browsing MUMBAI: Leading omni channel travel, retail and fintech company, Via.com, has launched a Lite version of its website for mobile browsing in India.

In 2014 a federal jury found [JURIST report] Samsung guilty of infringing numerous Apple smartphone patents such as the iPhone's slide-to-lock, autocorrect, and online linking features. Though the company was originally ordered to pay damages, a three-judge panel of the Federal Circuit overturned [opinion, PDF] the verdict in February. Sitting en banc, the full appeals court stated Friday that the panel erred by considering evidence outside the record of the current case. Samsung has therefore been ordered to pay the originally determined damages. The companies have yet to respond to the new ruling. This is the most recent installment of the ongoing patent dispute [JURIST op-ed] between the two electronics giants. In March the Supreme Court agreed to hear [JURIST report] Samsung's appeal in another case against Apple. In July Apple filed a brief [JURIST report] asking the Supreme Court [official website] to rule against Samsung in its patent infringement lawsuit. In January the US District Court for the Northern District of California [official website] granted [JURIST report] Apple's motion for a permanent injunction against Samsung for infringing upon three software patents. In August 2014 the US District Court for the Northern District of California denied [JURIST report] Apple's request to ban Samsung from selling any of its products that infringed on Apple's patented technology. Earlier in August 2014 Apple and Samsung agreed to drop [JURIST report] all patent infringement lawsuits in courts outside of the US. In June 2014 Apple and Samsung also agreed to dismiss [JURIST report] their appeals of a patent infringement case at the US International Trade Commission [official website] that resulted in an import ban on some older model Samsung phones.

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Apple got its verdict back—$120M against Samsung Federal Circuit judges revive Apple patents on "slide-to-unlock" and autocorrect. by Joe Mullin - Oct 8, 2016 1:03 am UTC Login to bookmark 140 A 1992 paper by Catherine Plaisant describes a touchscreen "slider toggle." Apple lawyers said that until the iPhone was unveiled, it wouldn't have been obvious to use such an invention on a phone. Court documents What looked like a solid defense win for Samsung in the second Apple v. Samsung litigation has suddenly slipped away, due to an opinion issued earlier today by the full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The second Apple v. Samsung trial led to a $120 million jury verdict in Apple's favor. Samsung appealed, and, in February, a three-judge appeals panel said that the jury got it wrong. The judges stripped away Apple's win, saying one patent wasn't infringed and the other two were invalid. Apple got the full court to take up the case, and the three judges who sided with Samsung didn't win a single ally. An opinion (PDF) issued earlier today restores Apple's win entirely on an 8-3 vote. (One of the 12 sitting Federal Circuit judges, Richard Taranto, did not participate.) The earlier opinion held that US Patent No. 5,946,647, which describes how to turn phone numbers and other software "structures" into links, wasn't infringed because Samsung products didn't use an "analyzer server" as the term was defined. The opinion also found that US Patent Nos. 8,046,721 and 8,074,172, which respectively cover Apple's slide-to-unlock and autocorrect features, were invalid in light of prior art. Today's opinion by the full court, written by Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore, wholly rejects those earlier findings, saying the three-judge panel went too far in reversing "nearly a dozen jury fact findings" involving infringement, prior art, copying, and other matters. Only the three judges from the original panel dissented, holding fast in their view that Samsung should win the day. On the '647 patent, the eight-judge majority held that "substantial evidence" supported the jury's decision that the accused devices used an "analyzer server." The dispute was over where the shared library code performs its functions—Apple argued that Samsung's shared library code is "separate" from the client, while Samsung argued there was no separate server. "The concept that the analyzer server must be 'standalone' or 'run on its own'... has no foundation in the '647 patent, in our prior Motorola decision, or in the parties briefs on appeal to this court," Judge Moore's majority opinion states. On the '721 slide-to-unlock patent, the majority noted that the patent emphasized making phone activation "user-friendly" and "efficient" while still preventing pocket dialing. Apple didn't contest that two prior art references disclosed all the elements of their patent claim, but argued that a person would not have been "motivated to combine" the various references. (One of the references, the Plaisant patent, is pictured above.) "[A] skilled artisan designing a mobile phone would not have been motivated to turn to a wall-mounted air conditioning controller to solve a pocket dialing problem," argued Apple, and the appeals court agreed. "[S]ubstantial evidence supports the jury's fact findings that Samsung failed to establish a motivation to combine," writes Moore. The opinion also cites Apple executive Philip Schiller's testimony at trial, touting how important the slide-to-unlock feature was in Apple's advertising. "That one gesture... you get an instant idea of how multitouch works so that you're doing a gesture on the screen, and it does something simple and useful to you, and that it's easy to use," Schiller said during his 2014 testimony. "Finally, the video of the crowd 'burst[ing] into cheers' when Steve Jobs demonstrated the slide to unlock feature supports a conclusion that consumers valued this particular feature," wrote Moore. As to the '172 autocorrect patent, the earlier panel agreed with Samsung that the Apple patent wasn't a serious improvement over two previous methods, including the US Patent No. 7,880,730, entitled "keyboard system with automatic correction." AApple’s expert testified that the earlier system didn’t display text while the user typed, so it doesn’t have all the features disclosed by Apple’s patent. The same expert argued that another piece of prior art, by Xrgomics, involves "word completion" that offers alternative words, and is not directed toward spelling correction. A reasonable jury could have agreed with Apple on those points, Moore wrote in her opinion today. All three judges from the original panel filed sharply worded dissenting opinions, disagreeing not just on the merits of the patents but about the manner in which the case was heard. Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna, for instance, complained that the full court chose to overturn the case on narrow grounds and did so without additional briefing from the parties, amici, or the government—all standard practice in a full-court "en banc" case. "The en banc decision neither resolves a disagreement among the court's decisions nor answers any exceptionally important question," wrote Reyna in his dissent. "The court should not have granted en banc review in this case." Today's decision involved the second Apple v. Samsung litigation. The first Apple v. Samsung case, which resulted in Samsung making a payment of $548 million to Apple after losing a jury verdict, will go to the US Supreme Court next week. It will be the first design patent case heard by the high court in a century. Expand full story Reader comments 140 You must login or create an account to comment.

Home Fe columnist Google Pixel, Pixel XL biggest challenge to Apple iPhone; here’s why Google Pixel, Pixel XL biggest challenge to Apple iPhone; here’s why Google’s new phone could be the biggest challenge to the iPhone By: The Financial Express | Updated: October 8, 2016 6:33 AM But, the advantage that Google has is that it can, over time, tie-in the various ventures under Alphabet. Apple now has serious competition for leadership at the top-end of the global smartphone market with the launch of the Google Pixel. Google has achieved something that no other device-maker, bar Apple, has—an integration of devices and software to build a strong ecosystem. Pixel competes head-to-head with the iPhone on all parameters, be it OS, app stores, cloud storage, online assistance and even price. Google also gains from the fact that Pixel was launched at a time when the largest-selling Android device-maker Samsung was in trouble over exploding Galaxy Note 7. While other device-makers opted for the Android OS—since the iOS is a walled garden—for Pixel, it is part of Google. It also has the Play Store to compete with Apple’s App Store; while Apple offers storage on the iCloud, Google is offering Pixel users unlimited cloud storage for full-resolution photos and video. As far as voice-activated assistants go in an AI world—it is a fight between Apple’s Siri and the Google Assistant. But, the advantage that Google has is that it can, over time, tie-in the various ventures under Alphabet. That includes the connected home device—Google Home, driverless cars and Nest. iPhone sales that have been on a down-trend—from 51 million in Q2 2016 to 40.4 million in Q3 2016—could have gained traction with the launch of the iPhone 7. But, the Pixel could just be the beginning of the biggest competition to Apple. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile New Candle From TwelveSouth Smells Like A New Mac – Why? Because Fanboyism By Uzair Ghani Posted 1 month ago 17Shares Share Tweet Submit Being a fanboy is one thing, but owning a candle that takes proceedings further is a whole new level of extreme. This Candle From TwelveSouth Smells Like a ‘New Mac’ – The Earth is Flat, Too I’m an Apple fanboy and I wholeheartedly admit it without shame. My primary phone is an iPhone 7, my main work computer is an iMac, and my notebook is a MacBook Pro. But my fanboyism ends right there. There’s nothing else out there that entices me further as a fanboy at all. But it appears as though Apple hardware is not enough for a lot of people to show off their fanboyism. Why? Because there exists a candle from TwelveSouth, called the ‘New Mac,’ that emulates the smell of a freshly opened Mac box once you light it up. Wait, what? Yes, that’s right. This is a legit product that was made by a premium Apple accessory maker. And apparently, people love it. How do I know this? Because if you head over to the candle’s official landing page, you’ll notice the product is actually ‘out of stock.’ This means a lot of people out there are so much taken in by the smell of a new Mac that they had to relive the moment once again through a candle that costs 24 bucks. Advertisement Officially called the ‘New Mac Candle,’ it’s made from 100% Soy Wax and burns for around 45 to 55 hours, which is more than adequate amount of fresh Mac smell one can take in. But sadly enough, if you’re looking to buy this product right now, then you might want to try your luck elsewhere as TwelveSouth’s own store is out of stock and new units will arrive later this month. Thankfully though, you can get notified when the product is available by clicking on the ‘Notify Me’ button on the landing page. Also, if you’re in the United States, the product features free shipping. That’s great actually, considering you get to experience the new Mac smell with zero shipping costs. Here are a few images showing off the candle in all its magnificent glory. Wrap Up Will I ever buy this candle? The answer is an obvious no. But of course, if you’re willing to throw in your spare change for something that will make you more cooler than your Apple fanboy friends, then the ‘New Mac Candle’ is the route you should definitely take. Who doesn’t love the new Mac smell right?

A federal appeals court just reinstated the May 2014 verdict that would award the Cupertino giant with $120 million after it was proven that the South Korea brand indeed infringed some patents. According to the Wall Street Journal, the federal appeals court reinstated the $119.6 million jury verdict in favor of Tim Cook’s company in its fight against Samsung that was overturned by a U.S. circuit appeals in February.  The case centers on three key smartphone functions that were patented by Apple: slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and the feature that automatically transforms information into links called quick links. By reinstating the verdict, the court is saying that there was substantial evidence to prove that Samsung infringed Apple’s patents.  Related Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Leak Ahead Of Release Stress Test Reportedly Proves Galax Note 7 Could Catch Fire Easily New MacBook Pro, Air Reportedly Coming Soon The reinstatement was not reached unanimously as three out of the 11 judges were not in favor of reinstating Apple’s victory. Nevertheless, the majority of the appeals court judges saw that the three-judge panel that overturned the case six months ago did not follow the U.S. Supreme Court limits on the scope of its review by examining outside evidence, as per Reuters.  Because the three-judge panel acted incorrectly in ruling after taking into account information not provided in the first trial, the federal appeals court has decided to reinstate the first ruling and also added that Apple should also pay Samsung $158,400 in damages because the Cupertino giant infringed a video and gallery patent of the South Korea tech company, Engadget has learned.  Out of the three patented features, the one pertaining to quick links gave Apple entitlement to over $98 million in damages, since the Cupertino giant invented the feature. Regarding the slide-to-unlock feature, it was said that there was “substantial evidence of copying by Samsung.” As for the autocorrect feature, the appeals court rejected Samsung’s argument that Apple’s patent was invalid. This now accounts for $18 million out of the total amount that Apple is being awarded.  Both Apple and Samsung have yet to comment on this new development in their long-running war over patents.

Today, the US Court of Appeals upheld the lawsuit's original 2014 verdict, awarding Apple $120 million (about £96.5 million, AU$158 million) in damages. The dispute all started over Apple's patents for swipe to unlock, autocorrect and quick links feature. Quick links allowed phone numbers and addresses to automatically be turned into links. Ironically, Apple's latest iOS 10 update got rid of slide to unlock. Victory... Today's decision reinstates a victory that was overturned earlier this year by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In an 8-3 verdict, the court said that the three-judge panel, the same panel that opposed today's verdict, was wrong to throw out the case in February of this year. "The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," said Judge Kimberly Moore in the court document. This decision is an important one, as it sets a precedent for Apple's smartphone patents. Some competitors might have to re-engineer their unlock methods, autocorrect systems and quick links, or risk a costly lawsuit with Apple. ...for now As we've come to expect with these two, the Apple vs Samsung battle isn't over yet. This latest court decision comes less than a week before the US Supreme Court considers Apple's case against Samsung for copying the design of its iPhone. In August, over 100 renowned designers from around the world, including Calvin Klein, Dieter Rams and Alexander Wang, filed an amicus brief in support of Apple. The designers claimed that a product's visual design has "powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes." The brief cites a 1949 study that showed 99% of Americans could identify a Coca-Cola bottle by its shape alone. Samsung argues that Apple's generic smartphone design shouldn't have been allowed to be patented in the first place.

The tool would end the FBI’s high-profile fight with Apple over access to the phone, but Bennett said there was no celebration. “There wasn’t high fives, and there weren’t people singing down the hallways,” he recalled. “It was very much business. ‘OK, let’s move forward to the next steps. Let’s get on the phone. What do we need to do to purchase the tool?’” The iPhone fight exposed a rift between the FBI and Silicon Valley technology companies over encryption, and it sparked a debate about the right balance between privacy and national security. Bennett, 52, was a key figure in that battle as head of the bureau’s digital forensics labs, which extract evidence from computers and other devices and were tasked with accessing the San Bernardino shooter’s phone. Bennett is now in charge of the agency’s San Francisco division, where he views his role, in part, as trying to bridge the divide between Silicon Valley and the FBI. He took over as special agent in charge of San Francisco in May after nearly 30 years in law enforcement. He started his career as a narcotics investigator with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and did a stint with the Drug Enforcement Administration eradicating cocaine smuggling operations in South America. He has investigated child sex crimes and animal rights extremists for the FBI and previously served as an assistant special agent in San Francisco. “The U.S. government sometimes loses sight of what is important to corporations ... and privacy is incredibly important,” Bennett said during a recent interview at his office, where a Thompson submachine gun like the type used by agents in the 1930s sits in a glass display case on a coffee table. Still, he was unapologetic about the bureau’s desire to access the phone. “We were pretty surprised that this turned in such a way that it became this national debate,” Bennett said. “It was never intended to be. ... We were trying to get on one phone because we had 14 murdered people.” The fight between Apple Inc. and the FBI centered on the work-issued iPhone 5C of Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people at a 2015 holiday gathering of county workers. The U.S. Justice Department demanded that Apple create software to bypass security features on the phone. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the FBI was asking his company to create a “back door” that could be used to unlock other phones, exposing customer data. Agreeing to the FBI’s demand would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to other calls for Apple’s help to obtain private information, Cook said. Apple vowed to fight a judge’s order granting the FBI’s request. The two sides were gearing up for a court battle when the Justice Department announced in March that it found a way to potentially get into the phone without Apple’s help. News organizations sued the FBI in September to learn who the government paid and how much it spent to hack into the phone. Bennett declined to say who helped the FBI, though he said the business was among a number of U.S. and international companies that approached the bureau with potential solutions. FBI Director James Comey has hinted that the agency paid more than $1 million for the tool. Investigators found nothing of significant value on the phone, Bennett said. He disputed that the FBI was asking Apple for a tool that could access other iPhones, calling it a “one-shot deal.” Bennett’s desire to build a stronger relationship with Silicon Valley companies is laudable, but the two sides might never agree about encryption, said Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox Web browser. “We can still have some healthy tension,” she said. “I think that’s positive.” Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers who invests in computer security firms, said Bennett’s technology background could help the bureau make better decisions about what to ask of Silicon Valley companies and how to get their help. Bennett acknowledged technology firms and the FBI might continue to disagree over data access, but said the need for dialogue will remain. “There are absolute, good reasons why companies have concerns about cooperating with the FBI. But there are also opportunities we should be able to talk to each other,” Bennett said. “What’s comfortable for a private corporation that will still provide an investigator the ability to stop or prevent a terrorist attack, a missing child or a national security incident?” Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

A French maker of open-source software said Friday it is suing Apple in an effort to get the company to make iOS more supportive of Web standards. Nexedi is suing Apple under French law in hopes it can force Apple to allow rival browsing engines onto the iPhone. From a report on Recode:Although Apple allows rival browser apps, such as Google's Chrome, on to the iPhone, the'y all have to use Apple's Web rendering engine. That means the ability to draw on the latest Web standards is is limited to whatever Apple decides to include. That means some newer technologies, like the WebM video standard and the WebRTC protocol for real-time communications, can't be made to work in an iOS browser even though they work in nearly all other browsers. "We hope [this lawsuit] will help Apple to sooner support the latest Web and HTML5 standards on its iOS platform -- the operating system used by all iPhones," Nexedi said in a blog post, which also explains the more granular details of how technology works and what needs to change, in their estimation. apple html5 lawsuit ← Related Links → FBI Looks Into Unlocking Minnesota Mall Stabber's iPhone Class Action Lawsuit Grows Over iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' Law-Defying Transistor Smashes Industry 'Limit', Measures Just 1nm This discussion has been archived.

For desktop applications, it isn't even useful isolation because you have a big attack window via the IPC to the display server. That said, iOS uses the TrustedBSD MAC framework (also in FreeBSD - Apple funded the development of both), which allows very fine-grained resource control to processes. The entire sandboxing framework is based on this. Second, the grandparent doesn't really mean sandboxing, he means compartmentalisation (which depends on some isolation primitive). Process-based isolation is fine when your threat model is different levels of trust for different processes. In a web browser, that isn't the case. Your tab browsing some random site needs to be strongly isolated from the other tab that contains your webmail login. Ensuring that this isolation is really present and not leaky is a very hard problem. Even that isn't really enough: if someone sends you an image as an email attachment and there's a vulnerability in your copy of libpng that allows arbitrary code execution, it doesn't really help you that the attacker can't compromise any other tabs: they already have the high-value target. Beyond that, mobile Safari also has some quite neat tricks. It makes use of execute-only memory for the JavaScript engine. On startup, it reserves a range of memory for the JIT code emission and generates a special memcpy that copies data into an offset within that address range. It then deletes all copies that the process holds of the base address and marks the special memcpy as execute-only, so there is nowhere in readable memory that contains the address range where JavaScript code will run, making it almost impossible to exploit gadgets placed in JIT'd JavaScript code. That said, no security is perfect and a monoculture is a good way of turning a vulnerability into a pandemic. If you have 4 different browsers with approximately equal market share, it's a lot harder to exploit all of them. This is why Verisign uses a mixture of FreeBSD and Linux with 3 different DNS server implementations on their root nameservers: If you want to take down their root zone, you need a to have a compromise for at least two DNS servers and for both operating systems.

Apple is to be awarded $119.6 million for Samsungs infringement of patents for slide-to-unlock, autocorrect, and the method used to detect phone numbers for tap-to-call functionality. The lawsuit originated back in 2011 with the Samsung Galaxy S in which Apple alleged that Samsung infringed on 10 of Apples patents across a span of four continents at one point in time. The initial $119.6 million verdict was thrown out by a three-judge panel back in February. The U.S. Court of appeals ruled 8 to 3 for the case to be reconsidered. The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apples iPhone. Check out the full report from Bloomberg.

As a quick refresher, the FBI was unable to unlock an iPhone 5c belonging to Syed Farook, one of the perpetrators involved in a 2015 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. In turn, the FBI wanted Apple to create a custom version of iOS that would allow them to bypass the device’s lockscreen. Apple strenuously objected, with Tim Cook even going so far as to say that the FBI wanted Apple to create the software equivalent of cancer. Now, many months later, a similar sequence of events has developed. According to a report from Wired, the FBI is currently having trouble accessing a locked iPhone that belonged to Dahir Adan, the terrorist who went on a stabbing rampage at a mall in Minnesota where he attacked 10 people before an off-duty cop managed to kill him. DON'T MISS: Leak reveals major design changes coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 In a statement to reporters, FBI special agent Rich Thorton said that the FBI is “in the process of assessing our legal and technical options to gain access to this device and the data it may contain.” Thornton didn’t say in the press conference what model iPhone Adan owned or what operating system the device ran. Both are key factors in whether the FBI will be able to get past its security measures. That’s because beginning with iOS 8 in 2014, iPhones and iPads have been encrypted such that not even Apple can decrypt the device’s contents, even when police or FBI serve a warrant to the company demanding its help. Of course, the FBI paid big bucks for a software solution to access Farook’s phone and it remains to be seen if that same solution can be utilized in this case. All the same, the iPhone in question shouldn’t be thought of as impregnable, especially with more and more security companies touting their abilities to access data residing on any locked iPhone and Android device.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Despite Samsung’s attempt to appeal, a court recently said that the company does indeed need to pay Apple $120 million in damages. That’s the fine levied against the Galaxy-maker by a jury in the spring of 2014, when Samsung was found guilty of infringing on an Apple patent. The patent involved slide-to-unlock technology. Funny enough, Apple doesn’t even employ that, now simply requiring users to press the home button to unlock their smartphone. Another fine is included in the total $119.6 million owed by Samsung, though the other is minimal at $158,400 and relates to camera technology, Reuters said. Keep in mind this is also separate from a different ruling in which Samsung already forked over $548.2 million for infringing on Apple’s design patents.

Or driving an autonomous car. As the technology expands in its capabilities and applications, we’ll be confronted with massive social change. How will Apple, for example, both serve us and meet competitive challenges? Back in August I referenced a terrific article by Steven Levy about Apple’s development of Siri. “Siri and Apple’s Machine Learning Are About to Get a Lot Better.” Author Levy was given an inside look at what Apple is doing with machine learning and the transformation of Siri. The interview was likely granted because there had been a lot of press about artificial intelligence (AI), and Apple’s traditional secrecy made it appear that Apple wasn’t doing much. Plus, the Amazon Echo was getting a lot of press, and Apple has had nothing equivalent. Even if competing with the Echo is not in Apple’s plans, it certainly seemed like a good idea to reveal to author Levy that a lot of good things are happening at Apple with AI. Humble Servants. For Now But the scope and prognosis for AI has sweeping implications for our culture, far beyond a little cylinder that can order more cereal or play music on demand. We’re just geting started. And while Marc Andreessen points out (article #1 below) that the Amazon Echo project consumed 1,500 engineers for four years, the evolution of technology ensures that future projects will be far grander in scope but use merely equivalent resources. This week I’ve been reading about the unintended consequences of AI. Instead of just one major article, here’s my reading list. Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen explains how AI will change the world Westworld-style sex with robots: when will it happen – and would it really be a good idea? 4 Ways Every Business Needs To Use Artificial Intelligence Exponential Intelligence: Microsoft Is Building the First AI Supercomputer One theme of these articles is that AI is being developed because it can make big money. Right now, applications are fairly primitive—the kinds of things you can do with Siri, Cortana or Alexa. As that technology evolves, there will be new applications that may or may not directly serve the consumer on a small scale. For example: Unintended Consequences Persuasion. Robo callers that use a vast library of historical data and psychological techniques to sell or persuade politically will be used. “Robo” used to mean robotic-like phone dialers. In the future, people who are unprepared could be manipulated by vastly intelligent AI Robos into a variety of legal and illegal schemes. Drones. Independent, armed law enforcement drones are conceivable. Unless strict legislation intervenes, various governments could find it convenient and efficient to use AI drones for patrol and arrest, pending arrival of a human police officer. Sexual surrogates. Article #2 above goes into considerable ethical detail about human sex with androids. A licensed psychiatrist providing a prescription for a sex surrogate is one thing. However, the purchase of a commercial android sentient enough to be pleasing and have a mind of its own is conceivable. What would be the legalities of a rape by the human? Courts. AI agents that can scan case law on behalf of attorneys are likely. How will the legal system be affected by AI agents that are skilled enough to battle each other? Does an accused without great financial resources have a right to an AI agent of equal prowess as that owned by a government? Local and Federal Law. AI agents could scan and digest municipal laws on behalf of a citizen. Imagine a (hypothetical) case where where Siri, having just absorbed every law on file in the state of Colorado and the city of Denver advises: “I see you’re about to use Apple Pay to purchase six pounds of fertilizer. The purchase of more than 5 pounds is illegal.” Will Siri cancel the transaction? If the customer insists, will (should) Siri report the violation of the law? International Relations. Could a day come when the president, plus staff, the Secretary of State and Defense might consult an AI agent on the impact of certain foreign policy decisions? As is often the case, (for example chess) smart decisions can appear illogical on the surface. How would the U.S. President explain certain decisions to the American people that appear offensive but are, in fact, effective and brilliant? Questions for Apple We’re just at the beginning of the commercial exploitation of AI agents. The questions I have are: Will Apple build personal AI agents that are designed to protect us at all costs? This is related to the recent issues raised in the conflict between the FBI and Apple over encryption. What happens when we humans no longer understand what each side in the encryption battle is up to? How will Apple’s research lend itself to dealing with the AI industry at all levels? That is, will Apple limit it’s vision or, instead, become embroiled in the highest level of effort that only tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft can afford? As businesses of all kinds begin to utilize AI agents of lesser capability, will Apple’s AI work be able to properly defend us? Should there be a law that says AI agents of a certain class of sophistication (to be defined) cannot approach a human with out his/her own AI representative? The articles I’ve listed above go into many more issues. But perhaps, before I get a serious headache, it’s time to move on. Next page: The Tech News Debris for the Week of October 3rd.

The problem with voice recognition, and this just happened to me with iMessages when I tried it again having reading this article, is if you use a new word, it makes a mistake and you have to correct it manually. That defeats the purpose of using dictation. Okay, it’s too much to ask the app to know something it hasn’t heard before, but there must be a way to make the correction also through the voice interface. Now that seems to be a big problem for a silicon mind, how does iMessages’ natural language interface distinguish between a command and actual text without reserving words that signal that a command or text is about to follow? Humans easily make this distinction in conversation. A steno easily figures out if what she is hearing is text to be transcribed rather than an aside. And if she makes a mistake, it is easily corrected through conversation. She easily infers intent, she has a good idea of what’s in the head of the person giving dictation. I think this is a challenge that pervades all of AI: inferring idiosyncratic intent. There is a much reproduced experiment in psychology (a field notorious for irreproducible experimental results) where they show that humans, down to 2 years old even, understand the concept of ‘people other than myself have their own thoughts and own sets of knowledge’ and, more importantly, can make accurate guesses of what another person is thinking of and knows. Earlier this week, news came out that this experiment was run on bonobos, chimps and orangutans and the key finding is that they also exhibit this ability. (Well maybe not to the extent that we do.) Here… https://today.duke.edu/2016/10/falsebeliefs As far as I know computers can’t do this, and as long as they don’t, AI systems will not be able to do the Star Trek-like things that people hope they can do in the future.

The Mac Observer found some options worth checking out, and they’re all available today. Apple’s AirPods aren’t the only wireless earphone option for iPhones We got our first look at AirPods in September when Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The latest iPhone models don’t include a 3.5mm headphone jack, so Apple offered up two of its own solutions for music listening: the Lightning connector EarPods included with the new phones, and the totally wireless AirPods which earned a thumbs up from TMO’s Bryan Chaffin. SmartOmi Boots Like Apple’s AirPods, the SmartOmi Boots are completely wireless, meaning there isn’t a wire connecting them to your iPhone, or a wire between the two ear pieces. They’re IPX7-rated waterproof and sweat proof, support Siri voice commands, last for five hours of music playback or phone calls, and sport a 200 hour standby time. You can use one at a time, or together they offer stereo sound. The SmartOmi Boots are priced at US$72.99 on Amazon. SmartOmi Boots Rowkin Bit Charge You won’t find any wires connecting the Rowkin Bit Charge Wireless Headphones to your iPhone. They’re IPX5-rated waterproof and sweat proof, can be used individually or together for stereo sound, and can pair with two devices so you can play games on your iPad and answer calls on your iPhone without changing connections. You’ll get three hours talk and music playback time, and the included case packs its own batter for up to 15 earbud recharges. The case also includes a USB port so you can charge other devices, like your iPhone. The Rowkin Bit Charge Wireless Headphones cost $129.99 on Amazon. Rowkin Bit Charge EARIN M-1 The EARIN M-1 Wireless Earbuds are designed to give you great sound without any wires, but doesn’t include a microphone, so you won’t be making phone calls or telling Siri what to do. You get three hours of music playback time, and the included charger case lets you juice up three times for up to 12 hours of total listening time. They’re surprisingly comfortable to wear and most people won’t notice you’re wearing them. The EARIN M-1 Wireless Earbuds cost $199 on Amazon. EARIN M-1 Plantronics BackBeat GO 3 There’s a special kind of freedom you feel when using totally wireless earphones, but that’s not everyone’s style so the Plantronics BackBeat GO 3 earn an honorable mention. They include multiple ear tip sizes, inline mic and playback controls, are sweat proof, and sport a 6.5 hour battery life for playback and include a charger case for up to 13 hours of music time. They connect to your iPhone via Bluetooth, but are tethered with a wire. The Plantronics BackBeat GO 3 are priced $129.99 on Amazon. Plantronics BackBeat GO 3 Jaybird X2 Another honorable mention goes to Jaybird’s X2 Sport Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Like Plantronic’s headphones, the X2 connects to your iPhone via Bluetooth, but the earbuds are strung together with a wire that includes a built-in microphone and playback controls. You get eight hours playback time between charges, several ear insert sizes, plus they’re sweat proof and offer great sound quality. You can pick the Jaybird X2 on Amazon for $99.

In the latest twist in a series of patent cases between the smartphone giants, the Federal Circuit Appeals judges ruled 8-3 in a rehearing of the case, reversing a panel of the same court in February. Apple's lawsuit contends that Samsung infringed on patents for 'slide to unlock' and autocorrection, among others. Apple's lawsuit contends that Samsung infringed on patents for 'slide to unlock' and autocorrection, among others GLOBAL TRUCE  Samsung and Apple decided in 2014 to drop all patent disputes outside the United States, marking a partial ceasefire in a seemingly relentless legal war between the world's two largest smartphone makers. The companies have battled in close to a dozen countries, with each accusing the other of infringing on various patents related to their flagship smartphone and tablet products. Friday's ruling said Samsung failed to prove that some of the Apple innovations were 'obvious' and thus not able to be patented. The opinion also said the court must defer to the decision of the jury when in doubt. 'Even in cases in which a court concludes that a reasonable jury could have found some facts differently, the verdict must be sustained if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record that was before the jury,' Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. Apple asked for an 'en banc' rehearing of the case -- before all the appeals court judges -- following February's decision to toss out the award. Apple had sought some $2.2 billion at trial, only to have a jury award the California-based company $119.6 million.

The latest news is that Samsung is acquiring the AI and personal assistant platform Viv, which was developed by the trio that created Siri for Apple. TechCrunch says that Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham sold their initial entry to Apple in 2010 and founded Viv two years later. Viv will continue to operate as a separate company. The two pillars of the platform are its interconnected nature and the programmability of its backend systems.  The latter capability is particularly intriguing: Viv calls this “dynamic program generation,” and it allows Viv to understand the intent of the user and to create programs to handle tasks on the fly, even if it’s never heard that particular one in the past. Millennial Smartphone Use Continues to Grow Any time it seems that video consumption on smartphones couldn’t go up any more … it goes up. Part of the reason is that folks find new ways to use their devices. NPD Group this week released research that found that the percentage of millennials surveyed by the firm using their phones for video calling rose from 42 percent to 56 percent. The percentage using it for shopping has risen from 49 percent to 59 percent, and for video streaming, from 31 percent to 40 percent. Commentary in the press release says that device use continues to move from computers to smartphones. There is nothing new in that, of course. The important takeaway for businesses is that the millennials they hire may perform better if allowed to use these devices. Carriers need to keep bulking up their networks, too. Gartner: Device Sales Sink Again Gartner said that combined shipments of devices – including PCs, tablets, smartphones and other form factors – will fall 3 percent this year. That, according to the firm, is the second straight year of decline. The fall off this year is far greater than in 2015, according to eWeek. Last year, the market fell by only 0.75 percent. The return to single digit growth is not expected to happen “anytime soon.” Both of those categories are predicted to have single-digit growth. The five years ahead are expected to be flat. The silver linings this year, according to Gartner, are premium ultramobile devices and entry-level mobile phones. DDoS Attacks on IoT Devices: Very Scary One of the great fears of the Internet of Things (IoT) is that the skills and insight of crackers (malicious hackers) are ahead of those of the people trying to defend the devices. Those fears could be close to playing out in the real world. Deepak Puri, the founder of SkilledAnalysts, posted a commentary at Network World describing the grim reality of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on IoT sensors. Puri lays out a four-step process in which IoT devices are captured, subverted, activated and attack targets chosen by the crackers. This seems no different from other DDoS attacks. What is different, however, are the sheer number and weakness of these targets: Millions of vulnerable IoT devices make it easier for hackers to assemble the firepower needed for a DDoS attack. IoT device manufacturers keen to lower costs often neglect security provisions. This neglect causes widespread harm and hampers longer-term IoT growth. It’s hard to update a vulnerable IoT device with better safeguards once it’s been installed. Puri describes the problem and suggests what devices crackers may go after. What he doesn’t offer – because he can’t – is an easy way to address the problem. Is Samsung Digging a Deep Hole for Itself? On Wednesday, a Galaxy Note7 caught fire and forced the evacuation of a Southwest jet in Louisville. Nobody was hurt. Samsung had replaced faulty Galaxy Note7s because of incidents such as this. The disturbing thing for the company is that the phone that caught fire reportedly was one of the replacements. If it turns out that the device indeed was one of the replacements, it is a big problem for the vendor. It is bad enough to issue faulty phones in the first place, but not successfully replacing them creates an even more serious credibility issue. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Battery cases for your new iPhone 7 By Cody Lee, Oct 7, 2016 Tweet 11 Comments Apple says the iPhone 7 gets up to two more hours of power over the iPhone 6s, and the iPhone 7 Plus gets an additional hour over its predecessor. But folks wanting true all-day battery life, or erratic all-weekend battery life, are still going to need some help. That’s where battery cases come in. A battery case can double (or more) your iPhone’s battery life. There aren’t a ton of them available for the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus yet, but we’ve put together a list of some solid options based on price and customer feedback. Apple Smart Battery Case for iPhone 7 You can’t have a battery case roundup without including Apple’s Smart Battery Case. It extends your iPhone’s battery life up to 26 hours of talk and 22 hours of Internet use on LTE. Its humpback design received some initial criticism, but I think it’s growing on people. It’s not too bulky, and you get the compatibility/reliability reassurance that it was made by Apple. You can buy the Smart Battery Case for iPhone 7 for $95. Note: we initially linked to Amazon because the case was a little cheaper and offered free [Prime] shipping, but it looks to be out of stock. Of course you can always find it at Apple.com. ZVOLTZ iPhone 7 3100mAh Battery Case I’m not real familiar with the ZVOLTZ brand, but it has a number of well-reviewed products on Amazon and it offers a 1-year worry free warranty. It’s also less than half the price of Apple’s battery case. The built-in battery is 3100mAh that the manufacturer says can “double the lifespan of your iPhone 7 battery life.” The case is MFi-certified, and supports pass-through Lightning charging. You can buy the ZVOLTZ battery case for iPhone 7 for $45. Trianium Atomic Pro Battery Case for iPhone 7 Trianium is also not a very broadly known brand, but I come across their products a lot in doing research for Daily Deals and the feedback in generally positive. The Atomic Pro battery case for the iPhone 7 features a 3200mAh battery, LED status lights, and sync-through charging technology. It also comes with Trianium’s “lifetime warranty.” You can buy the Trianium Atomic Pro battery case for iPhone 7 for $40. Mophie Hold Force Case with Powerstation for iPhone 7 If you’d rather stick to well-known name brands, here’s an option from popular accessory maker mophie. It’s not an all-in-one battery case, though, it’s a modular case. So you buy this base layer that has embedded magnetic plates, and you can buy various add-on accessories for it like a wallet and yes, a battery pack. Sure, it’s different, but we felt like it was worth mentioning. You can buy the Hold Force Case with Powerstation for iPhone and iPhone 7 Plus for $100. QCell 4000mAh Slim Battery Case for iPhone 7 This battery case from QCell is the #1 new release in its category on Amazon. The claim is up to 163% more battery life with the built-in 4000mAh power pack. Features include dual layer design for added protection, sync-through charging technology, and a 12-month warranty with lifetime technical support. You can buy this QCell 4000mAh battery case for iPhone 7 for $48. Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Waterproof cases for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Some great wallet cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Some heavy duty cases for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Some great minimalist cases for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Related Topics Accessories, Battery, Case, Cases, iPhone, iPhone 7, Roundup Ryan what i really want in a battery case is the a headphone jack Joonyaboy I think Mophie has one coming ravinigga What is a headphones jack, I only know lighting, USB c or Bluetooth. 🙂 rvs007 It might be important to note that other than Apple’s official smart battery case, none of the other brands support the new lightning headphones. That might be a deal-breaker for some. Chloe Elizabeth Wade Might wanna correct this article u put feedback IN instead IS generally positive TheGreatShalaw No thanks, no iphone 7 for me this time Jamessmooth I HATE Mophie. Every year I tell myself I won’t buy their case, and every year I do and am disappointed. Case in point: bought the Mophie case for the 6+ a few months back. Used it maybe 5 times. Was in Europe and it wouldn’t charge. When I needed it the most! Much like Samsung: never again! Stefano Yessir. Mophie and I have had too many bad experiences in the past. Call me unlucky, but every case we had went sour in 10-14 months White Michael Jackson I have bought two cases from Mophie’s website one in 2012 for my 4s and one in 2015 for my iphone 6 and there are still running strong. Plus I can always get a new one if I submit through their warranty program. edwilk55 Yeah…I’ve been done with them for a couple years now. Mini-USB ALWAYS pulls away from the board when it slips off or the battery just poops out. I’ve found the $35 from Amazon work as well if not better. 5723alex .

Patently Apple then reported on a modular all-in-one type of Windows Desktop PC patent this past February. In June the rumors began that a Microsoft PC was in the works to take on Apple's consumer iMac. By mid-July new Microsoft patents revealed some interesting new Surface tablet ideas as well as new controller ideas for the Xbox and more importantly, another modular PC concept. Earlier today the news emerged that Microsoft will hold an event on October 26, one day before Apple's event, to launch an iMac Challenger / all-in-one PC.    According to The Verge, "Microsoft is holding a special Windows 10 and Surface event in New York City later this month. The software giant has started emailing out invites to an event on October 26th, and Microsoft is expected to make some Xbox-related announcements at the event, alongside new Surface hardware…" including "at least one new all-in-one desktop PC."   The Verge further noted that "The main focus of the event will be the unveiling of Microsoft's vision for the future of Windows 10, and the company's desktop PC hardware to support it." For more on this, read the full Verge report here.   Lastly, keep in mind that the Microsoft patent figures noted in our cover graphic and social media links are conveying a Microsoft concept and not the actually look of the end device. The patents were all utility patents and not design patents.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Why You Should Upgrade Right Now iOS 10 Is Here! Why You Should Upgrade Right Now Apple's tenth revision of its mobile operating system is here. This is how to upgrade right now for free. Read More might not seem like a big deal, but developers have already made great use of this new function. Not every app has a great widget, but there are a few must-haves that are just a swipe away. You can access widgets by swiping right from the lockscreen or homescreen. To edit the widgets you have on your phone, scroll to the bottom of the widget screen and tap Edit. What Makes iOS 10 Widgets Better? Widgets have been around in iOS for a while now, but they’ve been constrained to just one part of your phone: the Notification Center. And while that’s not a terribly bad place for them to be, it’s not a great one, either. A lot of iOS users totally ignore the Notification Center Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Take Control of iOS Notifications on Your iPhone or iPad Your iPhone can notify you about just about anything, but left unchecked, this feature can quickly get out of control. Here's how to make notifications useful again. Read More and the addition of widgets wasn’t enough for them to start using it (I was one of those people myself). But by moving those widgets out of the Notification Center and onto their own screen — and making them accessible from the lockscreen — Apple made them much more useful. They’re easier to get to, and more apps now have widgets available. In short, pretty much everything about widgets is better. Default iOS 10 Widgets A number of the native iOS apps have widgets in iOS 10, and some of them are pretty useful. For example, the Notes widget lets you open up any of the last three notes you saved, and lets you create a new text note, photo note, checklist, or hand-drawn note with a single tap. It can be really useful if you use Notes a lot (which you should Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? Should You Be Using Apple's Notes for iOS and OS X? For the first time since its release, Apple Notes for both OS X and iOS may be worth considering. Read More ). Ads by Google The Calendar and Reminder Widgets show you what you have coming up soon, which is really useful when you want to get an idea of what’s next on your list without opening up another app. News lets you skim a few headlines with just a swipe over to the widget screen, and Mail gives you an idea of what’s in your inbox. All pretty much things you’d expect. The Maps widgets can be useful, especially with Apple’s now-much-more-useful Maps Use Your iPhone to Find Nearby Food, Transport & Services Use Your iPhone to Find Nearby Food, Transport & Services In iOS 9, Apple made some big improvements to its Maps app — but how do these stack up against the big names in the map and discovery scene? Read More functions. You can add Maps Destinations, Maps Nearby, and Maps Transit, all of which will help you find and get to where you’re going faster with just a swipe and a tap. The Music widget is also useful for firing up tunes really quickly. Although the built-in widgets aren’t groundbreaking, they can save you a few seconds and a few taps if you tend to use the native iOS apps a lot. When widgets really come in handy, though, is when you start adding third-party options. To see which widgets you can use on your phone, just tap Edit at the bottom of the widget screen, and you’ll be given the option to add, remove, and reorder your available widgets (the iOS widget screen gives you two columns to choose from). Everyone’s going to have different options based on the apps on their phone, but here are 10 cool widgets you can use on the fly to make your phone more useful. 1. Level Today There are a lot of budgeting apps 5 Budget Apps You Should Use If You Really Want to Save Money 5 Budget Apps You Should Use If You Really Want to Save Money Here are the most effective budget apps currently available. Pick the one you like best. Read More out there, but few are as simple as Level: you tell it how much you can spend in a month, and it’ll tell you how much you’ve spent so far. When you hit $0, you’ve spent your limit for the month. The Level Today widget shows you the information you need: how much you have left to spend for the month and how much you can spend today if you average your available funds over the rest of the days in the month. 2. IMDb Latest Trailers If you like seeing what’s new in the movie world, the IMDB app is a must-have. Now you can see the latest trailers without even having to open the app! The widget displays four new trailers for upcoming movies. Just tap one of the trailers, and the IMDB app will open and play the trailer. Perfect for when you want to burn a minute or two on the bus or in line at the grocery store. 3. Pedometer++ Keeping track of the number of steps you take in a day is a great habit for your health; if you’re taking less than 10,000 steps, you may want to increase your activity level. Pedometer++ is a free pedometer that uses your iPhone to track your steps. The widget lets you take a quick look at your progress, and you don’t even have to unlock your phone to do it. Easy! 4. Google Maps Transit Time Want to see how long it’s going to take you to get home or to work from your current location? Just swipe over to the Google Maps Transit Time widget. Select driving or public transit to see how long it’ll take you to get there at this moment. Of course, you’ll need to have these saved so Google Maps knows where they are — head to Settings > Your Places and add them if you haven’t already. 5. Shazam Using Shazam to identify a song you don’t know Which Music Identification App Is King? Which Music Identification App Is King? Smartphones armed with music recognition apps make it easy to find out which song is playing at any given time, but which service is best? We compared Shazam, SoundHound and MusicID to find out. Read More is great, but opening the app as quickly as possible is crucial. If you miss it, Shazam’s not going to help. What if you could open it directly from the lockscreen? Now you can! Just flip from your lockscreen over to the widgets and hit the Shazam button — you’ll get the song info without even unlocking your phone. 6. Embark This is a great app for people who use public transit a lot; it can help you find a bus, train, or other form of transit from wherever you are to where you need to go. You can also mark certain routes and stops as favorites, and those favorites will show up on the Embark widget. No need to open up a browser or even an app to see when the next bus or train is coming — just flip over to the widget! 7. ESPN There are countless ways to get sports scores, but having your favorite teams’ results displayed on your lockscreen makes it really easy to find the information you’re looking for. Just add your favorites to the ESPN app and they’ll show up on the widget. With a huge number of teams and sports to choose from, you’ll be able to follow all the action right from your lockscreen. 8. Timeglass Having a timer on hand can be useful in a lot of situations. Whether you’re using the pomodoro method to get more done, hard-boiling an egg, taking a nap, or doing a seven-minute workout, Timeglass lets you fire up a timer on the double. Once you’ve saved your favorite timers, you can activate them right from the widget — it’ll take you to Timeglass, but you can then monitor the amount of time you have left without opening the app. 9. Amazon The Amazon app isn’t for everyone, but if you place a lot of orders and want to know where they are, it can be a good use of space on your phone. With the widget, you don’t even have to open the app to check up on your shipments. While I don’t have any shipments visible in the widget above, you’ll be shown the estimated arrival date of any order that’s coming your way. You can also go to the text, photo, and video search screens with a quick tap. 10. TripAdvisor TripAdvisor helps you find the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions wherever you are. The widget is just like the app, and shows you five places nearby that are highly rated. When you’re not sure what to do, just flip over to the widget and see what’s popular near you! Which Widgets Are You Using? The native and third-party apps mentioned in this article are great ways to put iOS 10 widgets to use, whether your phone is locked or unlocked. But there are tons of other widgets out there, and we want to hear from you about which ones you’re putting to use since updating to iOS 10. Are you using new widget capabilities in iOS 10?

Reply TJ October 8, 2016 at 6:08 pm Currently have Dark Sky, Do!, Unspent, and Tinycalc. Reply Dann Albright October 21, 2016 at 8:30 pm Not familiar with Unspent . . . is it like Level, where it shows you how much you have left to spend in a given amount of time? Reply TJ October 21, 2016 at 10:54 pm It's much simpler than Level, like bare bones, but it works for me. No bank info required,. No decimals either so I round up my entries. Reply Dann Albright October 26, 2016 at 9:21 pm No bank info required? Do you enter all of your transactions manually? TJ October 26, 2016 at 11:20 pm Yes and yes. I do use it along with Mint.com app (which I've been on since it started) to track budgets and trends at the end of the month. Dann Albright November 12, 2016 at 11:08 pm I've never tried one where transactions are entered manually. Just seems like more work than I'd be willing to put in. :-) I'm glad it works for you, though! I've also started using more than one app to track everything, and that's helped a lot. I would have thought it would complicate things, but it's actually reduced my financial stress. Devinder Maheshwari October 8, 2016 at 3:33 am Well, thanks for this informative article. I was really not sure why people are going mad over iOS 10 widgets, and now I know why! Reply Dann Albright October 21, 2016 at 8:27 pm Glad you found it useful!

Wait, Apple and Samsung’s slide-to-unlock patent war is still a thing? by Chris Smith 07 October 2016 0 shares Read Comments We honestly thought we were past informing you about the never-ending patent wars between Apple and Samsung, but alas no. Today it emerged (via Bloomberg) that a once-quashed patent victory for Apple over its arch rival has been reinstated, meaning the latter owes the former nearly $120m. The reason? The slide-to-unlock functionality that these two have seemingly been fighting over since the beginning of time (well, for the last 5 years). Related: iPhone 7 vs Galaxy S7 Apple says Samsung ripped it off from the iPhone, Samsung denies it and various juries and judges have been adjudicating on the matter ever since, much to the interminable boredom of the entire tech world. Today’s decision - reached by the jury of judges on an 8-3 majority - also covers a second disputed patent; the quick links feature that enables addresses and phone numbers to become hyperlinked to the maps or dialer apps. As for the other monolith of a patent lawsuit between these two, well that’s back in court next week. Samsung initially got its fine down from $1 billion to around half that amount (chump change for both of these companies), and will now ask the US Supreme Court to rule against those damages too.

Home Industry Tech Apple wins appeal, USD 120 mn award from Samsung restored Apple wins appeal, USD 120 mn award from Samsung restored In the latest twist in a series of patent cases between the smartphone giants, the Federal Circuit Appeals judges ruled 8-3 in a rehearing of the case, reversing a panel of the same court in February. By: AFP | Washington | Published: October 8, 2016 2:14 AM In the latest twist in a series of patent cases between the smartphone giants, the Federal Circuit Appeals judges ruled 8-3 in a rehearing of the case, reversing a panel of the same court in February.(Reuters) A US appeals court today handed Apple a victory in one of its battles with rival Samsung, reinstating a USD 119.6 million verdict for the iPhone maker for patent infringement. In the latest twist in a series of patent cases between the smartphone giants, the Federal Circuit Appeals judges ruled 8-3 in a rehearing of the case, reversing a panel of the same court in February. Apple’s lawsuit contends that Samsung infringed on patents for “slide to unlock” and autocorrection, among others. Today’s ruling said Samsung failed to prove that some of the Apple innovations were “obvious” and thus not able to be patented. The opinion also said the court must defer to the decision of the jury when in doubt. “Even in cases in which a court concludes that a reasonable jury could have found some facts differently, the verdict must be sustained if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record that was before the jury,” Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. Apple asked for an “en banc” rehearing of the case — before all the appeals court judges — following February’s decision to toss out the award. Apple had sought some USD 2.2 billion at trial, only to have a jury award the California-based company USD 119.6 million. In February, the panel of judges ruled that Samsung did not infringe on one of the Apple patents and that the remaining two, which involved auto-correct and slide-to-unlock features, were not valid. Neither company responded to requests for comment. The case is separate from another suit in which Samsung was ordered to pay USD 548 million for patent infringement to Apple and whose appeal is set for a hearing next week in the US Supreme Court. Samsung and Apple decided in 2014 to drop all patent disputes outside the United States, marking a partial ceasefire in a seemingly relentless legal war between the world’s two largest smartphone makers. The companies have battled in close to a dozen countries, with each accusing the other of infringing on various patents related to their flagship smartphone and tablet products.

Jake’s been playing Gears of War 4. Matt and I have been playing PlayStation VR, and talk about Thumper in a little more depth than I think we expected.

WIRED’s Jake Muncy has played all three (just a few hours of Dishonored 2, though), so I take this opportunity to quiz her on the results of Blockbuster Brawl 2016.   Plus, I yell about the NES Classic Edition, as you knew I might!

Now that we know exactly what it is, we can talk about what Nintendo didn’t say today, and what that might mean. Do those Joy-Cons have motion sensors in them? (Maybe.) Is that screen a touch screen?

And the Wii U, too, of course, but it’s 3DS that Nintendo focused on in its latest Nintendo Direct, announcing a few more games for the aging handheld.   All of them have a little bit of weirdness to them. There’s a port of the Wii U game Yoshi’s Woolly World that heavily features the tongue-lolling dog-thing Poochy (unless he dies on the way back to his home planet). There’s Super Mario Maker with no online level sharing. There’s a new Pikmin… but the real-time strategy has been traded in for Mario-ish side-scrolling action.   All in all, as I argue on this week’s Game|Life podcast, it’s a very safe lineup from Nintendo—taking as few risks as possible, attempting to provide 3DS software that could sell very well while still reserving the majority of its effort for the launch of NX.   After calming me down about Nintendo, as is their job, WIRED’s Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham discuss Obduction, the new puzzle adventure game from the creators of Myst.

(Or, you know, you’re on a giant waiting list with no end in sight.) On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Time’s Matt Peckham joins in and we run down our favorite VR experiences so far, and talk about what makes a good VR game versus a bad VR game.   Going off on a bit of a tangent, we talk about the idea that Microsoft and Sony might be introducing slightly-better game consoles soon, getting players into an incremental upgrade cycle.   Later, we pick up on a few news stories that have hit this week: Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is going to be available on Steam soon, and the publisher is PlayStation. (More like Everybody’s Gone Third Party!) Finally, rumors from a reliable source suggest that The Legend of Zelda for Wii U will feature voice acting… and an option to play as a female character.

(It’s nearly available here in the U.S., but you can play it on Xbox One right now if you set your regional settings to Japan.)   Talking about Nintendo and Dark Souls pretty much ran us out of time, so Matt Peckham and I take just a moment at the end to talk about one of the more interesting virtual reality experiences I had at Game Developers Conference last week.

TIME’s Matt Peckham and WIRED’s Jake Muncy have been playing a lot of Tom Clancy’s The Division, and they attempt to convince me that I should play it too.   Jake’s also spent a little bit of time with Square Enix’s new episodic Hitman, I’ve built a level using keys and doors in Super Mario Maker, and I wish I could give some extra dollars to the makers of Peter Panic on iOS in exchange for more songs.

Specifically: Jake Muncy and Time gaming editor Matt Peckham have been playing Superhot and Far Cry Primal, and have an enjoyable discussion about those, largely without me, who didn’t play them. But I did play Star Fox Zero, and Matt actually spoke to Shigeru Miyamoto about it, so we have a lot to say there, too. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social.

Maarten de Boer/Getty Images Podcast RSS iTunes Download At the DICE Summit this week, I got the chance to talk with Penn Jillette, one half of Penn & Teller, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, following their keynote presentation. The pair are working together on a new version, with some virtual reality elements, of the classic Desert Bus. Their session at DICE focused on how game developers can use principles of magic in their designs.   After a few minutes of conversation, I realized I wanted to share the whole session with everyone. So on this episode of the Game|Life Podcast, it’s the whole interview. To call it “wide-ranging” might undersell it a bit. Here’s some of what you can expect:   Desert Bus Hillary Clinton Janet Reno Virtual Reality, Shakespeare, and politics The Music Man The time Penn met Notch The Residents Guarding magical secrets The Internet as world-peace engine Fake lottery tickets   And more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and thanks to Jillette and Pitchford for joining in. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

I had a lot of thoughts about the message that this game was trying to convey, but I held a lot of them back at the time of its release for fear of “spoilers.”   Well, the statute of limitations on that is quite up, and more to the point, I haven’t been able to find other analyses of the game that get at what I was taking away from it. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture tackles one of the great questions of human existence—coming to terms with the inevitability of death—and gives us a metaphor to help us think about it. It can be a profound experience, aided by one of the greatest (and most impactful, in terms of its literary connection to the game’s message) original musical scores in recent memory.   On this episode of the Game|Life podcast, Jake Muncy and TIME’s Matt Peckham join in for a no-holds barred pull-apart of Rapture. But first, we do some relatively spoiler-free Firewatch discussion. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Everybody's Gone to the Rapture firewatch Game|Life Audio Skip Social.

There are certainly a lot of leaks and rumors coming out about it, which would tend to indicate that Nintendo is getting close to announcing something about the new dedicated game machine that it’s often said it planned to discuss at some point in 2016.   TIME’s Matt Peckham joins me on this episode of the Game|Life podcast to discuss the NX rumors and what it might all mean, what we might hear at Nintendo’s upcoming financial briefing on February 2, and of course what we both think about Jonathan Blow’s The Witness, because you pretty much have to talk about that these days on gaming podcasts.

I meanwhile tell him about Oxenfree, which it would be difficult to not be able to finish in a few hours.   Riding the line between easy and hard is Super Mario Advance 4, recently released on Virtual Console for Wii U. A souped-up version of Super Mario Bros. 3, the Virtual Console version contains the extra levels that were only distributed via collectible trading cards, and some of them only in Japan. Some are incredibly easy, and some are quite difficult! Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Game|Life Audio Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The case began in May of 2014 when a verdict directed Samsung to pay Apple $119.6 million for using its ‘slide to unlock,’ autocorrect and quick-link features without permission. The Globe and Mail reports that the verdict was appealed, and overturned in February of 2016. However, this past week, a jury determined that the original verdict never should have been overturned. Apple has been once again awarded $119.6 million in an 8 to 3 decision in a surprising conclusion to conclude a patent case that has spanned over two years. The decision was reportedly supported by evidence that the three-judge panels court appeal did not follow U.S. Supreme Court limits on the scope of the review. In December, a separate patent case forced Samsung to award Apple $548.2 million. That case will be heard in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Add to this all the legal fees, the waste of money is staggering! It’s Me Most technology product companies, that have ever been sued, will lose more than they ever get back from suing others. They only ones that might not are ones that tend not to produce anything and make money through lawsuits. If you find one that makes more from lawsuits than they win, let me know.

Google launches Android Pay at 5,000 Hong Kong locations 20 Oct 2016 Google’s new “Pixel” smartphone is off to a fast marketing start with US$3.2 million in television ads in two days since it announced the upcoming launch, and ad executives expect Google to spend hundreds of millions more to keep up with rivals Samsung Electronics and Apple. Google’s launch of the first phone it has designed itself puts it in direct competition with the two dominant smartphone makers, which each market heavily. While Google’s brand is known around the world, and its Android operating system powers most of the world’s smartphones, including Samsung’s, it is not known as a consumer goods maker. It has made forays, such as the Chromecast streaming player, but not of this size. “This is the first time they are in the position of selling themselves to people, as opposed to selling themselves to brands,” said Rachel Pasqua, practice lead, connected life at MEC Global, a New York-based advertising agency. Alphabet’s Google declined to discuss how much it will spend advertising the Pixel but Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz told Reuters it was a “very significant marketing campaign”. He said the tech giant may buy ads during Thanksgiving football games. Such ads can cost around a million dollars, according to a media buyer, who wished to remain anonymous. The battle for smartphone supremacy: Google unveils new Pixel phone and VR headset to take on Apple and Amazon Wireless carrier Verizon Communications, which has a US exclusive on the Pixel, will make a significant investment of its own in TV, digital marketing and social media, from around the phone’s October 20 launch through the holiday season, said Jeff Dietel, vice president of device marketing at Verizon. Over the two days of the Google launch, when the company could be expected to spend heavily, Apple spent $2.45 million and Samsung spent $1.4 million, according to iSpot.tv, showing a competitive start for the Pixel. But Google still must work to find its creative signature in advertising, said Mike McKay, Chief Creative Officer of Eleven Inc., a San Francisco-based agency that works with Apple. The first spots for the Pixel phones bore some similarities to Apple’s ads, he said, noting the familiar stark white backdrop and shots of a slowly rotating phone. “When you have an inferior brand, it’s OK to compare yourself to someone to elevate you,” he said. “But when you are such a strong brand like Google, you have to find your own voice.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Beijing confirms it will interpret Basic Law over Hong Kong legislative oath controversy 2 Oath-row intervention reflects Beijing’s distrust of Hong Kong judges, lawyers say 3 Hong Kong charities, unions and political organisations refuse to ‘say no to shark’s fin’ 4 Taiwan calls on Beijing to reopen dialogue to pave way for peace deal 5 How did China’s Xi Jinping secure ‘core’ status in just four years?

Here Are 9 Other Products They Straight Up Ditched By Stephen Clark  |  October 7, 2016  |  2:30pm Tech Lists google Share Tweet Text This week Google has commandeered all the headlines in the tech world with its announcement of not just two new smartphones, but also a whole bevy of other devices along with it. While there’s plenty of reasons to be excited for the new Pixel phone, Google is quietly killing the Nexus phone program. The hardware in Nexus phones and tablets have always been based on a major manufacturer’s flagship device, which doesn’t make much sense under Google’s new unified Hardware Division. Adapting third party manufacturer hardware to create a reference spec may return someday, but it will probably not be given the Nexus name. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. The truth is when you have as much money as Google, you can afford to bet on longshots. For every wildly successful product like Gmail, there’s a Buzz or Wave. In some ways, there’s something refreshing about Google’s willingness to invest in ideas and give them up when they actually don’t make sense anymore. What happened to Google’s longshot hardware ideas? We take a look through the hardware and concepts that Google has abandoned over the years. 1. Nexus Q The Nexus Q was announced at the Google I/O Developers Conference in 2012. It impressed many with a wealth of input formats, high-quality audio output, and network connectivity. Some were given away at first, but for $299 customers expected more when compared to the $99 Apple TV. It was discontinued before launching and the niche was filled a year later by the more capable Chromecast at nearly one-tenth the price. 2. Nexus Player Google TV was built upon Android 3.2 Honeycomb, but never caught on. When they relaunched the effort as Android TV built on 6.0 Marshmallow, Google released reference hardware in the Nexus Player to promote the experience. At only $99, Google was now in direct competition with the Apple TV. It featured voice search and a more open architecture for app development. Less than two years later Google discontinued it and underwhelming sales may have been to blame. 3. Low Cost Tablets Google released announced the Nexus 7 tablet for only $199 packaged with free content and a $25 credit on the Google Play store. They followed it up with the Nexus 4, a phone which matched flagship specs but cost as little as $299. Both devices were less than half that of flagship devices from Apple or the other Android manufacturers. While we did eventually get the Nexus 5, we never got our update to the Nexus 7. There was a hardware update to the Nexus 7 but third party suppliers didn’t like Google undercutting them. 4. Play Edition Phones Back in 2013, Android had a serious fragmentation problem. Every major manufacturer had their own custom tweaks to the OS making an inconsistent experience for both users and developers. Along comes the Play Edition series. Google took the flagship smartphones from Samsung, HTC, Sony and Motorola (and a tablet from LG) and built the same basic Android experience on each that you get from the Nexus devices. They still were sold at premium prices so sales paled in comparison to the Nexus 4. Interest by the manufacturers quickly waned and the program was cut the next year. 5. Google Wallet Card Many Android smartphones have NFC chips for secure purchases, but they are by no means in all of them. When Google Wallet was launched in 2011 they also released a debit card letting you access your account wherever you could use plastic. Google eliminated support for the debit card in July of this year to focus on their rising competition, namely Apple Pay. 6. Google Search Appliance Put the power of Google on your internal corporate network. Just one box can give you Google-like access to up to 30 million documents. Including features we love like autocomplete and user profiles, and a catalog of up to 20 languages and hundreds of file formats. Support is destined to end by 2018 with no new hardware planned. Instead, Google is pushing towards cloud-based search making many system administrators uneasy. 7. Google Glass In what looked like an attempt to jump ahead several generations in personal computing, Google released a heads-up display that floats just in front of the user’s eyeball. Featuring a camera, microphone, and internet-connectivity, it was the general public’s worst privacy nightmare. The conspicuous design of the headware meant “Glassholes” could be easily spotted. It became clear the world wasn’t ready for Glass, but the project earned Google a wealth of patents. It still exists as a B2B solution, but is no longer available in the public marketplace. 8. Project Ara An ambitious project was intended as part of Google’s effort to get low-cost phones into developing markets. The plan was to sell a framework where cell phone components like processor, GPS, camera, screen and more could be swapped out. Each can be removed and upgraded without having to replace the whole phone. By the start of 2016 the project was modified to force certain core components into the non-upgradable framework. By September of the same year the project was shelved altogether. 9. Google Talking Shoes Technically more of an experiment than a product destined for market. Google played with interactive designers YesYesNo to give shoes motion sensors, internet-connectivity, and… a personality? The idea was to show what’s possible by giving technology some character. How would we interact differently if we felt judged by our footwear? Like a concept car, the technology may someday become a part of our lives but this shoe won’t be in stores any time soon.

In a blog post, founder and CEO Jean-Paul Smets and UI designer Sven Franck said that the company has undertaken the lawsuit to force Apple to improve its support for the latest web technology in iOS. Smets and Franck point to technical shortcomings in mobile Safari such as lack of support for HTML5 service workers, webRTC, and WebM – web technologies necessary for running applications like the OfficeJS spreadsheet and Hubl.in online conferencing. At issue is Apple's requirement that third-party web browsers use the open-source WebKit layout engine. Apple has based its Safari browser on WebKit and requires that makers of competing browsers do the same for inclusion in its iOS App Store. Such technical homogeneity has compatibility and security benefits. At the same time, it prevents competitors from implementing capabilities that may be better than, different from, or unavailable in Apple's mobile browser. For years, Mozilla chafed at this restriction because it could not release Firefox for iOS with its Gecko engine. In 2015, it capitulated and released Firefox for iOS with WebKit support. Google is in a similar situation with its Chrome browser, but changes introduced in iOS 8 – specifically the ability to use the WKWebView rendering engine instead of the older UIWebView rendering engine – have allowed Chrome to close a performance gap with mobile Safari that existed for several years because Apple exempts its own software from rules applied to third parties. Smets and Franck contend Apple's rules are unfair. "We would be delighted at Nexedi to create a Web browser for iOS with better HTML5 support based on a recent version of Blink library, for example," they wrote in their blog post. "But as soon as we would publish it, it would be banned from Apple's App Store. Many developers have experienced this situation already. Many companies are being hurt by this situation. Some companies have already begged Apple to improve HTML5 support in iOS with little significant results." According to French publication Challenges, Nexedi has to spend €50,000 (~$55,860) annually to adapt its ERP5 software so it complies with Apple's rules. Smets and Franck said France several years ago passed a law designed to protect small companies from larger firms where there's a significant imbalance between the rights and obligations of the parties. That law has forced companies in other industries to modify their contracts, Smets told The Register in an email. "There are also some cases at the EU level based on competition law," said Smets. "But ... Apple has won cases that were based on competition law. This is why we use here French trade law." Apple did not reply to a request for comment. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 46 Comments More from The Register Dell/Quest Software plans layoffs and relocations – source Some products may go, too, once private equiteers take over 3 Comments Sony wins case over pre-installed Windows software User refused to sign 'end-user licence agreement' at startup 178 Comments SonicWall goes it alone as Elliott and pal swallow Dell/Quest Software Rumours abound of product lines ending – and layoffs too 5 Comments How's this for irony?

If you've already read the original news story, scroll to the bottom of the news item to decide whether Apple or Popescu has right on their side. Whichever it is, the underhand and clandestine machinations and the lack of a proper appeals process means that the developer can never be sure of a fair trial.   The dangers of living in an app store are obvious but somehow we all think that things will go well and there is nothing to worry about - but your income can be nuked in a single act and it does happen. The Dash iOS programming app from Kapeli has been banned from the App Store and Apple say that no appeal is possible.   The Dash app is a programmer's utility, an API documentation browser and code snippet manager, which is reasonably well thought of. It is source of income for programmer Bogdan Popescu, Kapeli's sole developer. However Popescu's blog post of October 5th states: "Earlier today, Apple cancelled my developer account and has removed Dash from the App Store." The really disturbing thing is how little information Apple supplied about the incident. In fact because the cancellation occurred during an administrative change to the account it wasn't even immediately obvious: Yesterday I sent Apple a request to migrate my account from an individual one to a company one. Once I verified my company with its D-U-N-S Number, they notified me that some features in iTunes Connect won’t be available during account migration. A while later my iTunes Connect account started showing as “CLOSED” and my apps were removed from sale. I thought this was normal and part of the migration. Today I called them and they confirmed my account migration went through and that everything is okay as far as they can tell. A few hours ago I received a “Notice of Termination” email, saying that my account was terminated due to fraudulent conduct. I called them again and they said they can’t provide more information. Yes it does sound a lot like something that would happen in a Kafka novel, only in this case there isn't a trial anywhere in sight. The blog was later updated with the note: "Apple contacted me and told me they found evidence of App Store review manipulation. This is something I’ve never done. Apple’s decision is final and can’t be appealed." Trial without jury, appeal or - well, trial of any sort. OK you might think that he is guilty and deserves everything that has happened, but you can't be certain and, in the issue of review manipulation, neither can Apple. A third party might well have done the deed and might even have done so to frame the innocent. So, without recourse to an appeal, a programmer has lost the right to sell his perfectly reasonable program without any way to market it to an alternative customer base. What is even worse is that, without a developer account,  Kapeli can't even write programs for iOS and hence Apple has invalidated all of the knowledge and skill he invested in acquiring. To stop a programmer from working on a particular platform is restrictive and bad, but to stop them after they have mastered it is criminal.  There has to be a right of appeal and a clear and a public due process. The app store is perhaps the worst invention of 21st century programming imaginable. In their current form they aren't so much walled gardens but totalitarian states with a weak sense of justice.  We really need to do something.   The big problem is that the usual organizations that fight for software and programmer freedom are not on the case because the programmer has, from their world view, already sold out to closed source software.    Update: 10/11/2016 Apple has now released a press statement to a select set of websites generally regarded as Apple-friendly. The Loop, for example, quotes from it with:  "Almost 1,000 fraudulent reviews were detected across two accounts and 25 apps for this developer so we removed their apps and accounts from the App Store. Warning was given in advance of the termination and attempts were made to resolve the issue with the developer but they were unsuccessful. We will terminate developer accounts for ratings and review fraud, including actions designed to hurt other developers. This is a responsibility that we take very seriously, on behalf of all of our customers and developers." Popescu has responded with a blog post: "What I’ve done: 3-4 years ago I helped a relative get started by paying for her Apple’s Developer Program Membership using my credit card. I also handed her test hardware that I no longer needed. From then on those accounts were linked in the eyes of Apple. Once that account was involved with review manipulation, my account was closed. What Apple has done: on Friday they told me they’d reactivate my account if I’d make a blog post admitting some wrongdoing. I told them I can’t do that, because I did nothing wrong. On Saturday they told me that they are fine with me writing the truth about what happened, and that if I did that, my account would be restored. Saturday night I sent a blog post draft to Apple and have since waited for their approval. Tonight Apple decided to accuse me of manipulating the App Store in public via a spokesperson." If we ignore Apple trying to manipulate the publicity machine so that Popescu has to confess before being forgiven, we also have the small matter that Popescu has a phone recording where an Apple spokesperson admits that they didn't give him any prior notification of the closing of his account. You might, at this point, be ready to take sides. Clearly Apple has some evidence of wrongdoing and it claims to be linked to an account that the Popescu has had something to do with in the past. It is also clear that, by being connected with this account, Popescu has made things more difficult. But... and this is the really, really important point, it doesn't matter where the guilt lies in this case, what is important is how the guilt and the punishment are being handed out.  There is no public evidence, no due process and no trial of any kind. Apple has a completely opaque policing of the app store and removes the right to practice the skill of iOS programming without public proof of wrongdoing.  Apple might be right or it might be wrong, but asking for a public confession in return for a lenient sentence is an unforgivable act of a bully and a PR disaster.  More Information Apple Has Removed Dash from the App Store Dash and Apple: My Side of the Story   Fear and Loathing In The App Store Apple Drops Bitcoin App  Apple Rejects App For Being Too Simple      Banned For Life       When Apps Vanish Apple Doesn't Want Amateur Hour        Apple's Reasons For Rejection  Google Wants Everyone To Know Where You Live    Apple Takes Down Innovative App       The EFF Refuses Apple's Conditions        Firefox Gets A Walled Garden         Apple Is Watching        Apple Punishes IFixit   Fear And Loathing In the App Store 13 - Apple Rejects Gravity  Apple Rejects F.lux And It Isn't Even In The App Store!

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Copycat Samsung to Introduce Galaxy S8 in Q1 2017 with Dual Cameras and No Home Button | Main | The Day Before Apple Launches the New MacBook Pro, Microsoft will introduce their iMac Challenger » October 07, 2016 Court Rules Samsung Intentionally Infringed Apple Patents & Orders Increased Judgement to be Considered   In February Patently Apple reported that "the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd did not infringe Apple's 'quick links' patent, and that two other patents covering the iPhone's slide-to-unlock and auto-correct features were invalid." It's being reported today that Apple has won their appeal that officially reinstates a patent-infringement verdict it won against Samsung, including the 'slide-to-unlock' feature for smartphones and tablets.   The verdict wasn't even close. Bloomberg reports that "In an 8-3 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said a three-judge panel was wrong to throw out the $119.6 million verdict in February. Instead, it ordered the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should be increased based on any intentional infringement by Samsung." Zing!   Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority stating "That was a wrong decision, the court ruled Friday, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record. The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record."   Bloomberg further noted that "The Federal Circuit handles all patent appeals in the U.S., so its decisions have broad ramifications for how cases are handled in the courts and before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   The decision Friday comes less than a week before the U.S. Supreme Court considers another case Apple had filed against Samsung. That case, to be argued Tuesday in Washington, focuses on how much Samsung should pay for copying patented designs for Apple's iPhone."   The last few months have been a disaster for Samsung. Rushing out their Note7 smartphone to get ahead of the iPhone-7 launch has proven to be nothing short of an epic blunder. Cutting corner on safety has physically hurt their customers and putting others in grave danger as witnessed on Southwest Airlines Note7 battery explosion this week. Their smartphone fiasco has spread to China. And though Samsung denies there's any problem, that's what they told the press about the newly release replacement Note7's. Yet the explosion on the plane this past week was in fact a replacement Note7. So how could the Chinese or anyone trust them?   Just this morning Patently Apple pointed out that Samsung is steamrolling ahead to copy a feature that they know Apple will be introducing with their 2017 iPhone: Dropping the Home Button.   Samsung is obsessed with copying Apple and so it's great news to read today that the Federal U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington has reversed an earlier judgement and believes that Samsung should actually pay more for its intentional infringement. That's usually referred to as 'Willful infringement' which carries a very hefty premium of at least double the verdict. At the end of the day, Samsung can't hide behind another appeal regarding these patents and so finally they're legally recognized as intentionally being what we've all known for years: an infringing COPYCAT.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

In another setback for Samsung this week, an appeals court reinstated a $120 million patent judgment that Apple won in the companies' long-running feud. As Bloomberg reports, the full US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit today reversed a February decision by a three-judge panel that threw out a $119.6 million verdict in Apple's favor. At issue are patents covering slide-to-unlock, tap-to-call, and autocorrect features. In February, the court found that the slide-to-unlock and autocorrect patents were invalid, while tap-to-call wasn't actually infringed. Apple's '647 patent, which describes how to turn phone numbers into links, allowing people to call a number in one click, was worth $98.7 million alone. So the February decision meant Samsung didn't didn't have to pony up $120 million or change its product designs. //Related Articles $120M Judgment Against Samsung in Apple Patent Case Reversed Today, however, the court ruled in favor of Apple in an 8-3 vote. As Bloomberg notes, the vote was a surprise and the three who voted against it were the ones who threw out the $120 million judgment in the first place. This case is separate from an Aug. 2012 decision that awarded Apple $1.05 billion, a sum that has since been reduced to $548 million. Samsung is taking that one all the way to the Supreme Court, which will consider it next week. Last year, Apple and Samsung agreed to drop all patent litigation outside of the States, leaving only US cases to be fought in court.

Best Before labels – with patch cut-off dates IoT insecurity: US govt summons tech bosses, bashes heads together In yet another reversal in the Apple-Samsung patent war, Samsung was told on Friday it actually did have to pay Apple $120m for infringing three patents. The surprise decision [PDF] from the full Federal Appeals Court in Washington, DC, comes eight months after it was told by a smaller three-person appeals panel that it did not have to pay. And that came just under two years after Samsung was hit with the fine because a jury decided it had copied slide-to-unlock, autocorrect and quick-link features in its phones. As if that wasn't confusing enough, the Supreme Court will next week look at a separate Apple-Samsung patent case in which Samsung was fined $548m for copying the iPhone's rounded corners, among other patents. The full court ruling was somewhat of a slapdown of the three members of the previous panel, with the 8-3 ruling showing the rest of the federal court ganging up on them. The three should not have overturned the original jury verdict, their colleagues said. They agreed with Apple's argument that the judges had relied on information that was not part of the original trial and which had also not been introduced by Samsung in the appeal process. In other words, the judges did their own independent research and decided that the original jury was wrong – something that the full court of appeals said goes against rules set by the Supreme Court. "Fact findings are indisputably the province of the district court," the judgment noted. In even worse news for Samsung, the appeals court also asked the trial judge to consider whether the judgment should actually be increased because of intentional infringement – willfulness – by the company. On the plus side, the award for Samsung and against Apple for $158,400 for yet another patent was upheld. So that's something. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 36 Comments More from The Register EMC-Pure Storage patent sueball circus sent back to square one Old Sun Microsystems patent prompts judge to order retrial 2 Comments Ludicrous Patent of the Week: Rectangles on a computer screen Pic Rights warriors gives their two cents on Tencent's nonsense 58 Comments Apple guilty in iPhone ringtone patent rip-off battle with Sony, Nokia Cupertino giant told to cough up equivalent of a rounding error on its financial sheets 23 Comments Score one for the patent trolls: US appeals court says it's OK to shop for patent-friendly judges No escape in sight from Delaware and eastern Texas 38 Comments Akamai, Limelight bury hatchet (not in each other) to end patent spat Networking foes settle war over 'induced infringement' with $54m deal 3 Comments Apple: Samsung ripped off our phone patent!

It has the “best smartphone camera ever” perhaps (that’s still yet to be officially determined, other than by DxOMark), there are some hardware optimizations, and the phone sports the super-new and super-fast Snapdragon 821. But other than that, Google is relying mostly on software to set this phone apart from the crowd. That’s fine by me, except for the fact that most of the software features Google is touting are only artificially exclusive to the Pixel. One of the most obvious is Assistant, Google’s AI-powered evolution of Google Now that the Mountain View company is putting in a lot of its new products. It’s built-in to Allo, it’s the central interface for Google Home, and of course, it’s front-and-center with a new home button on the Pixel phones. What frustrates me, though, is that there’s not really any reason other than helping push the Pixel out the door to hold it back from last year’s Nexus phones. Google, the company that has long pioneered Android as “open,” is closing some things off… This reminds me a lot of the launch of Siri on the iPhone 4S, which Apple famously touted as the big selling point of the phone — while holding the feature back from software updates to the iPhone 4. It was purely a software feature, and Apple used it as the central selling point. Perhaps this isn’t the best comparison, though, because the performance difference between iPhone 4 and 4S was a lot more substantial than, let’s say, the Nexus 6P and the Pixel XL. Apple might have had some justification for that decision. Google also has some justification, but it really comes only in the form of exclusivity and marketing. As our own Ben Schoon even admitted himself, a big reason he jumped on the Pixel bandwagon is because it just has lots of software exclusives that are hard to pass up. Assistant is the big one, but the Pixel and Pixel XL also offer 24/7 customer care, a lot of Android 7.1 features, the Pixel Launcher, and unlimited full quality photo and video backup with Google Photos. Some of these will eventually make their way to some of the newer Nexus devices, but for now, Google is using them to get you to spend $650+ on a phone that actually leaves a decent amount to be desired in the hardware department. The physical design isn’t exactly groundbreaking, there’s no waterproofing, there’s no OIS, there’s only one bottom-firing speaker… Perhaps the other justification Google has for limiting Assistant’s launch on older Nexus devices for the time being is to give it — and Google — a chance to learn some more and iron out some kinks before being pushed out to the “masses” (I put that in quotes because the number of people using Nexus devices is insanely small compared to the entire smartphone market). But I don’t really buy that, because Google already released Assistant publicly in the form of Allo. And anyone on any device — including iPhone — can download it and try it out right now. Rather, I think that Google wants its hardcore Nexus fanbase to help it promote the Pixel and get some sales moving out the gate. Honestly, if Google had released (or even directly promised) the Assistant in a software update — or even a developer preview — for the Nexus 6P and 5X, how many of Google’s most loyal fans who bought a Nexus last year would skip out on the Pixel and Pixel XL for now (or even entirely)? I think the number would be pretty decent. But it’s still annoying to me. Google has long trumpeted Android as an open platform and has never used software exclusivity to sell its hardware like this before. It’s a very Apple-like move, and only in the worst way. Google seems to be waking up to the fact that top-to-bottom control of its software and hardware will be the only way it can produce phones that have the “fit and finish” to compete well with the iPhone (although we aren’t really seeing the benefits of this with the Pixel, yet), but unfortunately they’re throwing long-time Nexus fans and loyalists under the bus in the process. Other than pushing sales of the Pixel, there’s no reason the Nexus 6P can’t have Assistant today. This has to be artificial for the most part, because even Google itself says that they want to allow 3rd-parties to put the Assistant on anything. “We imagine a future where the assistant will be able to help from any context and from any kind of device,” the company said at its event earlier this week. They even mentioned the eventual possibility that Assistant could run on a Raspberry Pi. And one of our anonymous tipsters (if you’re reading this, feel free to send us an anonymous encrypted email, we’d really love to chat), who has told us some things that ended up confirmed, also suggests that this is the case. We’re hearing from said tipster that internal developer Nexus devices have the Assistant running “perfectly” (The Verge also mentioned it running on the Nexus 6P in a lengthy feature). Further, this person confirms the obvious, saying that Google is holding it back for a some amount of time to give Pixel the exclusive. The Android 7.1 change log that Android Police obtained, however, clearly distinguishes which features are Pixel-exclusive. The developer preview for Android 7.1 is said to be coming at least to the 6P, 5X, and Pixel C, by the end of the year. Here’s what Google told us on the matter: There will be certain features — such as the Google Assistant — that will be unique to Pixel before we make a decision to offer it up to the rest of the ecosystem.  With some of these features currently unique to Pixel, we’re carefully experimenting with these changes to assess user reaction and feedback. So when and which devices in Google’s portfolio will get the Assistant is entirely up in the air for the moment. Which, I don’t know about you, is probably a sign of things to come. It’s clear that the Pixel line is going to basically have its own fork of Android (which, actually, was true of the Nexus phones as well considering they didn’t run technically pure “stock” AOSP). What’s confusing is that we’ve now heard of a couple cases where Google is considering Nexus-like devices. The Huawei tablet that we’ve (and Evan Blass, and some others) heard about is one of them (which likely won’t be Pixel-branded, as Huawei refused to let Google remove its branding for the Pixel), but Android Police also noted that Huawei is being “solicited by Google” to make a mid-range smartphone as well for launch next year. Assistant is probably just the first of many features that make up the “more opinionated” exclusives of the Pixel line, and while it’s exciting that Google is taking the bull by the horns and trying to deliver a unique and compelling top-to-bottom smartphone package, it’s also going to be unfortunate for those that want to stick with Android but would perhaps prefer hardware from other companies (or in this case, would like to stick with Google’s hardware from last year for a while).

The handset has a better camera and more RAM than its smaller counterpart, which is a first for Apple. Previous iPhone pairs including the iPhone 6/Plus and iPhone 6s/Plus had nearly identical feature sets, with only minor differences existing between them (screen and battery size, and optical image stabilization). But the iPhone 7 Plus is still a very big device — too big for some people — and the size is unavoidable due to Apple's current design. Next year's iPhone 8 Plus is also expected to be the better version of the iPhone 8, but the phone doesn't necessarily need to be as big as the iPhone 7 Plus. DON’T MISS: Under no circumstances should you buy a Galaxy Note 7 The front side of the iPhone features large spaces at the top and bottom that are needed to house various components, including the front-facing camera, speaker, sensors and the home button. Next year, Apple will place the home button under the iPhone 8’s display. The phone will likely not have a headphone jack either. These design choices would let Apple expand the screen across more of the iPhone's face. In other words, the company could reduce the sizes of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus without reducing the display. But it turns out that Apple could also reduce the top bezel of the handset by employing an edge to edge display. And at least one company gas already made such a screen. sharp-connect-r-display-2More Sharp’s Corner R display, shown above, can be cut in different shapes, The Verge reports. Such a solution would let Apple equip its iPhone 8 models with edge-to-edge displays. Sure, the display in the image above is mounted on an Android prototype device with no ear speaker. But Sharp has made similar bezel-less displays for its smartphones before. Also worth noting is the likelihood that Sharp probably isn't the only company working on displays like this for the future, especially when it comes to the iPhone. That said, Sharp is rumored to increase OLED display manufacturing investments to meet Apple’s iPhone demands, with production set for 2018 for the iPhone 8’s successor. Specs-wise, the Corner R display in these images measures 5.2 inches and offers Full HD resolution. This is an IGZO LCD, however, which probably means it would not be found on Apple’s iPhone 8 next year, since it will reportedly feature an OLED screen. While a full-screen solution like this would let Apple place the home button underneath the display, it’s not clear where the front-facing selfie camera, earpiece and sensors would go. sharp-connect-r-display-1More Finally, the Sharp Connect R screen featuring Free-Form Display technology is only a prototype for the type being, so don’t expect to see it in a commercial product anytime soon, be it an Android device or an iPhone.

In addition, the Apple Watch Series 2 will be launching in India on the same day as well. Apple has now confirmed that the iPhone 7 will be launching in a slew of African and Middle eastern countries, including: Jordan and Oman on October 15, and Maurice, Madagascar, Maroc, and Uganda on October 21. The company also confirmed that the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 will launch in Thailand on October 21. The company confirmed the dates on its website. It’s worth noting that the iPhone 7 is launching through third-party vendors such as Flipkart, as Apple currently has no official retail presence within the country. Flipkart began accepting preorders for the new phone today, which could potentially cut down the usual lines outside its stores. In the U.S., lines weren’t as long as they were in previous years, likely due to Apple saying they won’t have Plus’ models or Jet Black models in either color on launch day. Mashable notes that Indian retailers will be selling the device later than usual at 7PM local time rather than midnight.

By Andy Boxall — October 7, 2016 11:51 AM Subscribe to this topic Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here Apple iPhone 7 MSRP $649.00 DT Recommended Product Learn More Look out Apple, Samsung, and just about every other smartphone maker out there, because Google’s coming for you with the new Pixel smartphones. There are two, the Pixel and Pixel XL, and they run the very latest version of Android, look super, and have some exclusive features to make sure smartphone fans sit up and take notice. They come just a few weeks after Apple’s latest iPhone models went on sale. Like the Pixel there are two different types, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and they both look great, have some special features not seen on other iPhones, and as always with an Apple launch, made people sit up and take notice. Related: Google Pixel vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 — which 5-inch flagship is right for you? Inevitably, if you’re about to buy a new phone, these two will be on your list. The Pixel naturally goes up against the iPhone 7, so which one should you buy? Each phone has its own positive and negative points, and we’ve given them an thorough examination to find out which deserves your money. Google Pixel iPhone 7 Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3 mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 in) 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1 mm (5.44 x 2.64 x 0.28 in) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.87 ounces (138 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 4.7-inch Retina HD LED backlit screen Resolution 1,080 × 1,920 pixels (441 ppi) 1,334 x 750 pixels (326 ppi) OS Android 7.1 iOS 10 Storage 32, 128GB 32, 128, 256GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 A 10 Fusion with 64-bit architecture, M10 motion coprocessor RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12MP rear, 7MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30, 60, or 120fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30 or 60fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated Yes, IP67 rated Battery 2,770mAh 1,960mAh Ports USB Type-C Lightning Marketplace Google Store Apple App Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, Jet Black, gold, rose gold, silver Availability Verizon, Google Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile Price $650 $650 DT review Hands-on  3.5 out of 5 stars Performance The Google Pixel is bang up to date with its processor. It uses the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which is a small but significant update to the Snapdragon 820, seen in most major flagship phones released during 2016. The 64-bit Snapdragon 821 has four cores and gets a 10 percent performance bump over the already speedy Snapdragon 820, a 5 percent increase in graphical capabilities, is more energy efficient, and can use Quick Charge 3.0 for even faster battery recharging. Apple doesn’t use a Snapdragon chip, and instead uses the A10 Fusion chip of its own design. Apparently it’s 40 percent faster than the A9, according to Apple, and it’s the first time the company has used a quad-core chip. Both chips utilize the multiple cores in a similar way, splitting the workload across them to reduce power consumption during easy tasks. The Snapdragon 821 is so new, we’ve not seen a phone with it inside to test out yet, so establishing any of our own benchmarks is impossible. Early benchmark results seen in Geekbench 4 return a multi-core score of 4,089. The iPhone 7 managed 5,600. Does that make the Pixel a slowcoach? No, and we’re wary of that unconfirmed benchmark, as the Galaxy S7 regularly scores over 5,000, and it uses a Snapdragon 820 chip. At this early stage, we can’t say either phone is faster than the other. However, we know the iPhone 7 is quick, and have no reason to think the Snapdragon 821 will be any different. Elsewhere, the Pixel comes with 32GB or 128GB of internal storage, and doesn’t have a MicroSD card slot, sadly. The iPhone 7 adds a 256GB option to the list, so if masses of storage are important to you (and you can stomach the extra cost), the Apple phone has a slight advantage here. Winner: Tie (pending further tests) Design This is ultimately going to come down to personal preference, but there are a few things you should keep in mind as you size the two up. The Pixel is made of metal, glass, and plastic. The glass panel on the rear provides the antenna with room to breathe, while the plastic sections recall manufacturer HTC’s Desire range of phones. It’s thin at 7.1mm and light at 143 grams. For the iPhone 7, Apple has blended in the antenna breaks more than on the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, decluttering the rear panel, but keeping the camera bump. Google has avoided this by slightly enlarging the body itself. The iPhone 7’s body is made from aluminum, is 7.1mm thick, and a little lighter than the Pixel at 138 grams. In our hands-on, the Pixel is described as being, “high-end, not too heavy, or fragile, even with the half-glass back.” Concerns over the screen bezel are also unfounded, with it appearing larger in pictures than in real life. The iPhone 7 is extremely comfortable to hold, with wonderfully curved sides, and corners that nestle in the palm nicely. Arguably, the Pixel looks a lot like an iPhone, but this doesn’t really bother us — both are great looking phones. Google gives you the choice of a white, black, or limited edition blue Pixel, and it’s the blue that really catches the eye. The iPhone 7’s jet black color is the elusive limited edition for showoffs, and it’s the regular matte black that’s the winner, as it neatly conceals the antenna lines for a smooth look. Google’s phones have never been stunners, while the iPhone 7 has a class that the Pixel can’t quite match, supreme in-hand comfort, and a real premium build, which along with its lighter body and wider choice of colors sees it edge out the Pixel here. Winner: iPhone 7 Battery and audio Google has selected a 2,770mAh battery for the Pixel, complete with fast charging provided by the Snapdragon 821 and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 feature. Plug it in using the USB Type-C cable and after 15 minutes it’ll be at 70 percent capacity. We’ve not used the phone for long enough to judge the overall use time on a daily basis. Inside the iPhone 7 is a 1,960mAh battery and in our review, we have seen 12 hours of solid use, and more than 40 percent left at the end of a day. There’s no fast charging though, and recharging the iPhone 7 will take longer than the Pixel. Neither phone has wireless charging as standard. The iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, and audio performance is vastly improved over the iPhone 6S while the Pixel has a single downward firing speaker. However, the Pixel retains a 3.5mm headphone socket, while Apple forces you to use headphones with a Lightning connector or Bluetooth. More battery capacity, faster charging, and a traditional headphone socket make the Pixel a clear winner. Winner: Google Pixel Display Looking at the numbers, the Pixel should run away here. The 5-inch display is an AMOLED panel, therefore producing deep blacks and strong colors. It has a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and a 441ppi pixel density, is covered in protective 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4, and Google claims it has an excellent viewing angle with little decrease in brightness. Related: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The iPhone’s Retina HD LED-backlit screen measures 4.7-inches, has a 1,334 x 750 pixel resolution for a 326ppi pixel density, and also a 2.5D piece of glass over the front. Although it has a lower resolution, it does still look great, but the Pixel’s AMOLED screen and higher pixel count will automatically make pictures, webpages, and games look better. However, there is one thing in the iPhone 7’s favor, and that’s 3D Touch, Apple’s pressure sensitive system. Here, additional functionality can be accessed with a harder screen press, and it’s surprisingly helpful, especially with iOS 10 installed. The Pixel doesn’t have this feature. Despite this, it’s as much a software feature as it is a display feature, giving the Pixel the win. Winner: Google Pixel Camera Let’s start with a spec shootout. The Pixel and the iPhone 7 both have 12-megapixel rear cameras. The Pixel has an f/2.0 aperture against the iPhone 7’s f/1.8 aperture, which should let in a little more light, plus it has a quad-LED flash rather than the Pixel’s dual-LED. However, while both have phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus only comes on the Pixel. Both have image stabilization, but only the iPhone uses traditional OIS, as the Pixel has a clever system that utilizes the phone’s gyroscope for smoothing out video. We’re big fans of the iPhone 7’s camera, although consider the iPhone 7 Plus to be the real winner, but have yet to really put the Pixel’s camera to the test. In our hands-on with the phone, we noted the speed with which it captured and processed photos, along with its low-light performance and cool HDR+ mode. The Pixel also has free, unlimited full resolution photo storage in the cloud through Google Photos, while you’ll have to pay for extra iCloud space or full-res Google Photos storage if you own an iPhone. Until we get our hands on the Pixel for a full review, we must turn to well-respected camera testers DxOMark, where the Pixel received an 89 rating, the highest of any smartphone yet. The iPhone 7 isn’t far behind with 86 though. It’s likely to be a tight contest between the iPhone 7 and the Pixel here, just like it is between the iPhone and the Galaxy S7, so we’re calling it a tie for now. Winner: Tie (Pending further tests) Durability Unless these phones are securely wrapped up in a case, neither are going to come off well in the event of a nasty fall. Glass and aluminum bodies aren’t designed to withstand much shock. It’s also worth mentioning that if you choose the jet black iPhone 7 and don’t wrap it in a case, expect it to gather up some scratches and scuffs pretty quickly. Apple knows the special finish is delicate, and recommends the use of a case. Apple now edges ahead of the Pixel here, having made the iPhone meet IP67 standards of splash, water, and dust resistance. We’ve tested this out, and the iPhone happily continues working after taking a bath, something the Pixel is unlikely to do even with its basic IP53 protection. Accidents happen, and if they involve the wet stuff, you’ll be glad it was the iPhone and not the Pixel underwater. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Software If design was a difficult category to judge, due to personal preference playing a considerable role, software is also subjective. Unlike pitting a phone like the Galaxy S7 or LG G5 against the Pixel, Apple is prompt and regular with its software updates, which matches how Google will react with its new Pixel devices. The Pixel comes with Android 7.1 installed, the very latest version of the operating system, which can’t (and won’t) be found in this form anywhere else. The Apple iPhone has iOS 10. The two are very different, yet also quite alike. There are icons to tap, a virtual assistant to help — Assistant on the Pixel and Siri on the iPhone — and special messaging apps for both. On the Pixel, it’s Duo for video calls and Allo for chats, while on the iPhone there’s FaceTime and iMessage. Downsides of Google’s operating system don’t really apply here. It’s going to get regular updates, there’s no messy user interface over the top, and you’re assured of the latest version for at least a few years yet. Apple treats the iPhone in the same way. There’s little to choose between them when it comes to app stores either, with both being equally well stocked with apps, books, movies, and more. Winner: Tie Pricing and availability Wallets at the ready? They better be, because you’re going to have to open them pretty wide to get either one of these phones. Unlocked, without a contract, the Pixel will cost you $650 for the 32GB model or $750 for the 128GB, and it can be purchased directly through the Google Play Store. The iPhone 7 also costs $650 for the 32GB, $750 for the 128GB, and then $850 for the 256GB model. It can be bought through the Apple Store, either online or in a retail store. Contract prices vary for the iPhone, but it’s available with each major carrier in the U.S., while the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive. This hurts the Pixel here. We don’t like being forced onto one carrier and many people buy their phones in stores. However, there is good news for the Pixel: You can buy it unlocked from Google and get the same month-to-month financing you get with the iPhone at carriers. We’d suggest not buying either phone locked to a network, or fixed into a contract, anyway. There are financing options available for both the Pixel and the iPhone 7 through Google and Apple respectively too. However, be aware if you choose an iPhone on AT&T or Sprint with financing through Apple, it’ll be locked to that network. International buyers will also find it easier to buy an iPhone 7, with 25 countries on the list at launch, and more than 30 having been added since then. Others are coming in October. Google is only selling the Pixel in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Germany at the moment. Wider availability, more carrier options, and equal pricing sees the iPhone take this category. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 Overall winner: iPhone 7 (for now) It’s three category wins for the iPhone 7, and two for the Pixel, with three overall ties. However, two of those sections will likely have a different result when we’ve played with the Pixel for a longer amount of time, so there’s still everything to play for. It’s interesting to see where the iPhone 7 beats the Google Pixel, particularly because durability and price have long been problem areas for Apple, and winners for Android phones. Apple has turned that around with the iPhone 7. The Pixel has it beaten when it comes to display, battery, and the presence of a 3.5mm headphone socket. Right now, because you can buy it in more places, with fewer restrictions, and it won’t stop working if it gets wet, the iPhone 7 has to take the win. Don’t dismiss the Pixel yet though, we’ve yet to test out two areas where it could very easily fight back and take the win. Check back soon.

Under this new scheme, the iPhone users on Jio's network will receive one year of complimentary services, sources said. This means people who buy any iPhone device from Reliance Retail or Apple store and use Jio connection would get the 'Welcome Offer' completely free till December 31, 2016.

"We are delighted to roll out this exciting data offer for our users to allow them to get the most out of the amazing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus," Bharti Airtel Director Operations (India and South Asia) Ajai Puri said. The latest edition of the iPhone has been launched in India today across multiple platforms like Apple resellers, Flipkart, Snapdeal and Tata Cliq. Most of these companies are bundling in offers to woo customers in the world's second largest telephony market. While Snapdeal has teamed up with American Express to offer the latter's card members a discount of Rs 10,000 on the purchase of the device. Flipkart also said it has prepared itself to make deliveries to customers from 1900 hrs onwards today. "Delivery executives are fanning out across key cities in India to surprise several lucky customers at the exact time when the clock strikes seven. Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal will be one among the delivery executives who will be delivering the iPhone 7 today starting at 7 PM in Bangalore," it said in a statement. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available in 32GB, 128GB and 256GB storage variants in silver, gold and rose gold colours. The new jet black colour variant will come only in 128GB and 256GB variants. While the 32GB phone will be available for Rs 60,000, the pricing of the other models has not been disclosed. IPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display with 3D touch, while iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch Retina HD display with 3D touch. Both the smartphones are powered by a new quad-core Apple A10 Fusion processor, which it claims is 40 percent faster than the previous generation. The iOS 10-powered iPhone 7 sports a 12MP iSight camera and 4K video recording. The iPhone 7 Plus has dual 12MP rear cameras ? one wide-angle and a telephoto lens. The handsets come with IP67 rating, signifying the fact that it is water and dust resistant, a first for the Apple smartphone. The Cupertino-based company is betting big on the Indian market. In July, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said that India is one of its fastest growing markets.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     First user-created music remixes about to launch on Apple Music and Spotify By Christian Zibreg, Oct 7, 2016 Tweet 1 Comment Unofficial remixes of songs are launching on both Apple Music and Spotify thanks to a partnership with a company called Dubset Media Holdings. Apple signed a deal with Dubset in March 2016, while Spotify cut a similar deal of its own in May. Remixes and DJ mix sets, typically distributed through services like YouTube and SoundCloud, should start appearing on Apple Music and Spotify. Dubset’s proprietary scan-and-match technology will ensure that artists get paid fairly for musical remixes, TechCrunch said Friday. Licensing remixes and DJ mixes based on original recordings is incredibly difficult. A typical remix might have upward of 600 different rights holders. For example, a DJ mix created from 25 to 30 different songs would require royalty payments to the same number of record labels and anywhere from two to ten publishers for each track. This poses a major problem for services like Apple Music that don’t own the rights to distribute user-created music remixes. Using a custom platform called Mixbank, Dubset scans an entire mix to find the likely source of each sample used in a mix by matching it against official song snippets from Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. By finding the stop and start point in each mix, the software finds the corresponding rights holders in a dataset together through multiple partnerships and direct feeds. Dubset has deals with over 14,000 labels, publishers and music holders. Royalty revenue from the Mixbank platform is shared with rights holders while Dubset gets a cut. According to Dubset CEO Stephen White: Content owners have been very supportive. The publishing and label deals we have under license provides a large catalog to work with This allows some of the content that until now has only been on YouTube and SoundCloud to come to these great paid services where content owners will get paid. In the future, Apple’s partnership with Dubset could expand to include multi-song mixes, longer DJ sets and other perks. White claims that 700 million people a month listen to mixed content, making it a big opportunity. The article does not make it very clear when first user-uploaded remixes might be going live on Apple Music so be sure to watch this space because we’ll be reporting more information as soon as it becomes available. The Financial Times has learned that Spotify is in advanced talks to acquire SoundCloud, which has upwards of 200 million registered users.

Appeals Court Rules For Apple In One Of Its Patent Infringement Fights With Samsung Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Appeals Court Rules For Apple In One Of Its Patent Infringement Fights With Samsung Image courtesy of Adam Fagen October 7, 2016 12:52 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk back and forth samsung apple patents patent infringement smartphones tablets Apple just won the latest round in one of its fights with Samsung over patent infringement, with a federal appeals court ruling that reinstates a $119.6 million patent-infringement verdict it scored. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an 8-3 ruling [PDF] that three-judge panel shouldn’t have thrown out the verdict in February, and instructed the trial judge to consider whether Apple is actually due more money based on any intentional infringement by Samsung. This fight centers on a number of software patents that Apple claims Samsung infringed, including autocorrect, a way to detect phone numbers so they can be tapped to initiate a phone call, and the slide-to-unlock feature for smartphones and tablets. In 2014, Apple said it wanted $40 for each phone sold that used one of the patents in question, for a total of about $2 billion in damages. The court first issued a summary judgment that Samsung had infringed the patent for the autocorrect feature, and a jury then found that it had infringed the two other patents as well. Apple got damages of $119.6 million for those infringements. Then in January 2016, Judge Lucy Koh of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California banned Samsung from selling certain smartphones that infringed on those three patents held by its rival. The next month, however, a three-judge panel threw out that $119.6 million verdict and ruled that Samsung didn’t infringe on Apple’s detection patent, and said the other two patents were invalid. The court ruled today that that was not the right decision, because it relied on issues that were never raised on appeal or on information that was beyond the trial record, Bloomberg notes. “The jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record,” Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. This is all separate from another patent infringement lawsuit going on between the two, which is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court this fall. Samsung is appealing a $548 million award it was ordered to pay for allegedly copying the look and feel of the iPhone — most notably the pinch-to-zoom feature.

Comments By Grant Gross Follow IDG News Service | Oct 7, 2016 10:15 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Mobile & Wireless Computer Hardware Smartphones Comments A U.S. appeals court has reinstated a $119.6 million award for Apple in its long-running smartphone design patent dispute with rival Samsung. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that two Apple smartphone design patents, one related to a slide-to-unlock feature, are valid and Samsung infringed a third patent related to helping smartphone users find phone numbers. The case goes back five years, when Apple first filed a series of patent lawsuits against Samsung, alleging infringement of several Apple's iPhone design patents. In February, a panel of judges at the appeals court ruled against Apple, saying the slide-to-unlock patent and an Apple spell correction patent were invalid. The panel ruled that the third telephone-number pattern analysis patent wasn't infringed. But a full panel of judges overturned that decision. In the slide-to-unlock patent, Samsung "failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence" that Apple's claim related to an obvious invention that would not qualify for a patent, wrote Judge Kimberly Moore, for the 8-3 court majority. The patent lawsuits between the two companies have taken a number of twists and turns. In 2012, a U.S. district court ruled that Samsung owed Apple more than $1 billion in damages for infringement of design patents. The appeals court later cut the amount. Last December, Samsung agreed to pay Apple $548 million under some conditions. Neither company responded to a request for comment on the court ruling.

The first to hit Apple’s streaming music service is DJ Jazzy Jeff’s remix of Room in Here from Anderson .Paak, and as more remixes roll out music fans will have fewer reasons to use SoundCloud. Dubset deal brings DJ remixes to Apple Music Apple struck a deal with Dubset earlier this year to bring remixes to Apple Music, according to TechCrunch. Dubset scans remixes to find the original tracks and pays the rights holders accordingly. Right now Apple Music’s remixes are limited to single tracks, but mix set recordings from live shows is coming soon. Dubset’s deals with Apple and Spotify are akin to a kick in the pants for SoundCloud because now DJs and other artists can distribute their remixes through the big names in streaming music. SoundCloud can still offer remixes, but music fans will have less of an incentive to use the service since they’re likely already Apple Music or Spotify subscribers. Adding more streaming services for DJ remixes may be bad news for SoundCloud, but it’s good news for pretty much everyone else. Apple Music and Spotify get yet another way to draw in new subscribers, remix fans have more places to find the artists they like, DJs get more exposure, and rights holders get a little more money. Over 700 million people listen to remixes every month, and that’s a market Apple and Spotify don’t want to miss out on. As more remixes become available, listeners won’t need to seek out pirate music sites as often—and that fits perfectly with Apple’s original iTunes Store goal: give people an easy way to pay for the music instead of stealing it.

Home Industry Tech When Flipkart co-founder and CEO Binny Bansal turned ‘delivery boy’ for Apple iPhone 7 launch in India When Flipkart co-founder and CEO Binny Bansal turned ‘delivery boy’ for Apple iPhone 7 launch in India Adding a personal touch to its deliveries, Flipkart's Binny Bansal delivered the e-commerce giant's first Apple iPhone 7 within 30 minutes of the smartphone's launch. By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: October 7, 2016 11:31 PM Adding a personal touch to its deliveries, Flipkart’s Binny Bansal delivered the e-commerce giant’s first Apple iPhone 7 within 30 minutes of the smartphone’s launch. (Twitter/Binny Bansal) Imagine opening the door of your house, only to have Flipkart’s co-founder and CEO Binny Bansal to deliver your new Apple iPhone 7! Gaurav in Bengaluru’s HSR had this once in a lifetime experience. Adding a personal touch to its deliveries, Flipkart’s Binny Bansal delivered the e-commerce giant’s first Apple iPhone 7 within 30 minutes of the smartphone’s launch. “First happy customer – Gaurav from HSR. 30 mins after launch at his home. He is super delighted,” tweeted Binny Bansal, sharing an image of himself and the iPhone 7 owner. Flipkart customer Preeti also had the new iPhone 7, which she had ordered for her husband Gaurav, personally delivered by Binny Bansal. “Second delivery. A gift from Preeti to her hubby Saurabh. They exchanged their old iPhone 6 and got 18k discount !! #makingthe7affordable,” he said in another tweet. “99% of all the customer are getting their iPhone 7 delivered within 2 hrs of launch. Incredible job by our supply chain team !!” he said. It appears that Bansal chose to deliver the new iPhone 7 along with the Flipkart’s ‘wishmaster’. Wishmasters are actually Flipkart’s field executives. “On my way with our wishmaster Shankar to deliver the just launched Iphone 7 #deliveringthe7at7,” Bansal tweeted along with an image that suggests that he rode on a bike to make the deliveries.

Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were launched today evening in India, and companies are seeking to encash on the popularity of the smartphone series. Snapdeal has tied up with American Express to offer card members of the bank a discount of Rs 10,000 on the purchase of the iPhone 7. Tata CliQ is offering its customers Rs 10,000 deferred cashback with HDFC credit and debit cards (issued in India). Seeking to cash in on the demand for the newly launched Apple iPhone 7 in India, Reliance Jio has launched a special offer giving complimentary Jio Digital Life for 12 months. All buyers of iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone SE will get complimentary Reliance Jio Service worth Rs 18,000 for 1 year. This Rs 18,000 includes 20GB data and unlimited SMS for one year, apart from free voice calls, which is standard for all users for the network. All new iPhone users on Jio network can avail this offer from January 1 next year after their ‘welcome plan’ expires on December 31, 2016. Now, those who buy any iPhone from a Reliance Retail or Apple store and use the Jio connection will get the ‘Welcome Offer’ free till December 31 and after that from January 1, 2017 they will get the Rs 1,499 plan free for 1 year. The Rs 1,499 plan includes unlimited local and STD voice calling and national roaming, 4G Data of up to 20 GB, unlimited 4G data at night, 40GB of WiFi data, unlimited SMS and unlimited Jio Apps subscription. Reliance is not alone in seeking to lure iPhone buyers into using the Jio network. Bharti Airtel, the incumbent rival of Reliance Jio, is offering 10GB free 4G/3G data per month for one year with any Airtel Infinity post-paid plan. The free data benefit will be over and above the plan benefits, Airtel has said. Please Wait while comments are loading...

A federal appeals court ruled today that Samsung had infringed on Apple’s famous slide-to-unlock patent as well as its quick links patent, which covers software that automatically turns information like addresses and phone numbers into links. In doing so, the court upheld the case’s initial verdict, reversing a decision from three judges who had overturned it earlier this year. In an 8–3 ruling, the full panel of judges determined that the three judges acted incorrectly by considering information that wasn’t introduced in trial and by ruling on issues that were never brought up on appeal. Apple and Samsung’s other patent case goes to the Supreme Court next week "We conclude that the jury verdict on each issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record," the court writes. Later stating, "We thus reinstate the district court’s award of costs which the panel had vacated." The court also maintained a ruling against Apple, which found that it should pay Samsung $158,400 for infringing on a photo and video gallery patent, as was originally ruled back in 2014. It also sent one issue back to the initial court for reassessment, potentially increasing damages against Samsung. This ruling furthers the smaller of Apple’s two big patent cases against Samsung. The bigger of the two — the one that initially resulted in a $1 billion verdict in Apple’s favor, which has since been cut in half — heads to the Supreme Court next week for arguments over part of the ruling that covers $399 million in damages.

Nexedi develops cross-platform business apps in HTML5 that can run unchanged on Windows, Linux, and Android. On Apple's iOS, however, it runs into a problem: The browser rendering engine on iOS, WebKit, doesn't have the same HTML5 capabilities as the rendering engines used on other platforms. Among the HTML5 capabilities missing in the iOS version of WebKit are access to APIs for vibration, ambient light detection, battery status, notifications, filesystem access and the WebRTC videoconferencing protocol, according to a copy of Nexedi's lawsuit seen by the IDG News Service. The absence of those capabilities makes it impossible to use videoconferencing websites, to play videos in the WebM format on websites, or to provide offline functionality in a browser-based office productivity suite on iOS, the company said. One way around this would be to make changes to support those functions in WebKit, which is open source, then build apps or a browser for iOS using the new version of WebKit to download and run the HTML5 code. But Apple specifically forbids developers from doing any such thing if they wish to sell their software through its App Store. Only the Apple-approved version of WebKit may be used for downloading and adding functionality after an app is approved. Even Google has had to submit to this rule: It created a new version of WebKit that it calls Blink for use in its Chrome browser on other platforms, but the iOS version of Chrome still uses Apple's WebKit. The upshot of this, Nexedi's court filing says, is that it has to redevelop its apps for the iOS platform, adding costs and delays -- €210,000 (US$235,000) in additional costs and €560,000 in lost opportunities as its staff modified code to run on the iOS version of WebKit. Over the next two years, Nexedi expects adapting its HTML5 apps to WebKit on iOS will require three developer-years of work, resulting in €120,000 of additional costs and €480,000 of lost opportunities. "The primary reason for starting this lawsuit is because we hope that it will help Apple to sooner support the latest Web and HTML5 standards on its iOS platform," Nexedi CEO Jean-Paul Smets wrote in a post on the company blog.  Nexedi can't just abandon the iOS platform because iPhones are the dominant devices in some markets -- notably with the Chinese upper middle class (a large potential market for Nexedi) and with executives worldwide who pay the company's invoices, Smets wrote. At a court hearing on Feb. 4, Nexedi will be asking the judge to order Apple Europe to pay €770,000 in damages. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Brand Post Why Hybrid Cloud?

In the latest twist in a series of patent cases between the smartphone giants, the Federal Circuit Appeals judges ruled 8-3 in a rehearing of the case, reversing a panel of the same court in February. Apple's lawsuit contends that Samsung infringed on patents for "slide to unlock" and autocorrection, among others. Friday's ruling said Samsung failed to prove that some of the Apple innovations were "obvious" and thus not able to be patented. The opinion also said the court must defer to the decision of the jury when in doubt. "Even in cases in which a court concludes that a reasonable jury could have found some facts differently, the verdict must be sustained if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record that was before the jury," Judge Kimberly Moore wrote for the majority. Apple asked for an "en banc" rehearing of the case -- before all the appeals court judges -- following February's decision to toss out the award. Apple had sought some $2.2 billion at trial, only to have a jury award the California-based company $119.6 million. In February, the panel of judges ruled that Samsung did not infringe on one of the Apple patents and that the remaining two, which involved auto-correct and slide-to-unlock features, were not valid. Neither company responded to requests for comment. The case is separate from another suit in which Samsung was ordered to pay $548 million for patent infringement to Apple and whose appeal is set for a hearing next week in the US Supreme Court Samsung and Apple decided in 2014 to drop all patent disputes outside the United States, marking a partial ceasefire in a seemingly relentless legal war between the world's two largest smartphone makers. The companies have battled in close to a dozen countries, with each accusing the other of infringing on various patents related to their flagship smartphone and tablet products.

This is possible due to a cooperation with Dubset, which operates a kind of clearing service for DJ mixes and samples. One of the first remixes that’s up on both services is a DJ Jazzy Jeff remix of Anderson.Paak’s song “Room In Here.” The new version wasn’t commissioned by Anderson.Paak or his label, but is instead one of the countless remixes produced by DJs and bedroom artists without asking for permission. Usually, these songs often find their way to SoundCloud, or other music sites that allow uploading of user-generated media. But earlier this year, both Apple Music and Spotify struck deals with Dubset that will allow them to stream this kind of material as well. Dubset essentially scans songs for recognizable samples, identifies the source material, and then works out how much money the original rights holders are supposed to get. However, there’s a reason both Apple and Spotify are just dipping the toes in the water with one single track: Dubset has struck deals with music publishers, but has yet to sign up any of the major labels for its clearing service. That means that music services using Dubset won’t be able to stream user-generated remixes of Justin Bieber tracks any time soon. Last month, news broke that Spotify was pursuing an acquisition of SoundCloud, which has long allowed the upload of user-generated media. SoundCloud has struck deals with all major labels, and aims to eventually monetize user remixes with advertising and subscription fees.

This means commuters can now easily and securely pay for their tickets for New York City’s Long Island Railroad and Metro-North Railroad trains. Apple’s Apple Pay Vice President Jennifer Bailey commented on the rollout, saying that the commute is now much easier for New Yorkers. “The New York commute just got that much easier thanks to Apple Pay in the MTA eTix app. Now you can skip the line entirely to buy train tickets right on your iPhone.” With the free MTA eTix app on the App Store, users are no longer required to wait in line in order to purchase tickets. Rather, they can launch the app on their iPhone, purchase a ticket and skip the line entirely. MTA’s Long Island and Metro-North Railroad trains are the two most busiest commuter trains in North America. Both have an average of 280-300 thousand passengers per day on any given weekday. The updated MTA eTix app is now available on the App Store. Tags: Apple Pay, MTA eTix, New York About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

Up until now, Apple showed no signs of using the deal. Today, Apple Music will start supporting single-track remixes, reports TechCrunch. In addition, Spotify is also supporting single-track remixes. In a nutshell, this means that user-uploaded content that isn’t released by major record labels can now be accessed by Apple Music. This includes tons of different remixes that the artists themselves upload, but do not get published by labels due to rights issues. With Dubset’s tech, they’re able to scan and match track parts to its Mixbank of snippets. Once matching is complete, Dubset distributes the royalties to the respective artists. One problem with this system are multi-song mixes that DJs share via live gigs. However, Dubset says that this feature is “coming next” and will distribute royalties for those formats. Dubset works by scanning an entire mix and matching every part of the track to its Mixbank of snippets of official songs based on Gracenote’s audio fingerprinting database. Dubset matches the samples in a mix to these snippets, then distributes royalties for the play evenly to the original rights holders. The ultimate goal of Apple’s Dubset partnership is that both artists and listeners win. Those who own the rights get paid, DJs can share their work, and listeners can hear it all on one platform.

Unsurprisingly, even the slightest battery design error can lead to life-threatening explosions, and we've seen cars and even a house destroyed as a result. The Galaxy Note 7 isn’t the only smartphone whose battery exploded, but it’s the first one to be recalled because of a widespread battery defect. iPhones can explode too, although Apple never had to resort to such extreme measures to fix battery problems. And it turns out that Apple is studying ways to make its future batteries even more efficient while also ensuring that they remain safe. DON’T MISS: Under no circumstances should you buy a Galaxy Note 7 A new Apple patent application titled Battery Can describes technology that would let Apple create batteries that provide more energy and a longer lifespan while offering improved safety as well. Filed on April 1st and published on October 6th, the patent highlights battery enclosure technology that would ensure the safety of the user while also improving battery performance. The patent focuses on the battery enclosure rather than the battery cell, proving that Apple is very interested in creating batteries that will be less likely to explode or swell as they approach the end of their lifespan. “Battery performance and lifecycles in mobile electronic and other types of computing devices are an ever increasing concern,” Apple writes. “Particularly as mobile devices become smaller while the processing power and demands on such devices increase, the ability of the battery to provide the necessary power needs to the device increases in importance and competes with the desire to reduce the overall size of the device. Obtaining more power from the battery while restraining the overall size of the battery to fit within the mobile device is a continual challenge. It is with these and other issues in mind that various aspects of the present disclosure were developed.” The battery can design Apple proposes will provide “increased pressure on the battery stack for higher battery performance.” The battery can design could have any shape or size, giving the battery assembly “substantial form factor flexibility.” Apple also details a way of manufacturing a battery can enclosure that would reduce the gap between the battery stack and the can surface compared to traditional designs. “The reduced gap can result in a more intimate and/or constant contact between battery and the battery can,” Apple explains. “This reduction in the gap aids in resisting swelling of the battery stack during the lifetime of the battery. Such resistance to the swelling of the battery stack may increase the performance, durability, and useful life of the battery, as well as protect the device in which the battery can is mounted.” The patent specifically mentions various Apple products that could benefit from such innovations, including the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple TV, which are all specifically named in the patent application. The battery can technology described in the patent might also be used for laptops, computer accessories or anything else that might contain a battery. That said, there’s no telling which new Apple products will actually make use of this type of battery can design, or even whether or not any Apple products already contain such batteries. apple-iphone-battery-can-patent-1More apple-iphone-battery-can-patent-2More Read More apple-iphone-battery-can-patent-3More Trending right now: Some companies are threatening to fire workers who buy an iPhone 7 Leak reveals major design changes coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Samsung might actually be facing a second Galaxy Note 7 recall See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Watch Saturday Night Live’s emotional and highly unusual cold open BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech This supermoon will be extra-super GeekWire New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network
