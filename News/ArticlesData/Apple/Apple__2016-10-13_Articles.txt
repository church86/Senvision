 It's going to be an uphill slog for Apple Wolf Richter, Wolf Street Oct. 13, 2016, 6:42 PM 3,827 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla Worldwide PC shipments fell 3.9% in the third quarter from a year ago, according to IDC, thus continuing the long methodical decline of the entire ecosystem. But beneath the surface: shipments of the boring uncool brands rose worldwide and soared in the US, as shipments of cool Macs plunged. Grave injustice? Or just sign or our commoditized times and channel stuffing? Despite predictions of the sector’s death, these machines – desktops, workstations, and notebooks of all kinds, but not servers and tablets – are still the workhorses in the office environment, and their death is going to arrive only slowly and in fits and starts. Lenovo, which in 2004 bought IBM’s PC division, is still the market leader, with a 21.3% share. But its global shipments fell 3.2%; it has growth trouble in China, its home market, where it does much of its business. For Lenovo, Q3 was the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year declines. But second and third in line, HP and Dell, increased their market share, as their global shipments rose 3.3% and 6.2% respectively. For the fifth in line, Taiwanese-based Asus, shipments jumped 6.9%. The real losers: Apple Mac shipments plunged 13% and “others” plunged 13.2% year-over-year. Excluding Apple and “Others” (marked in red in the table), shipments by the remaining top four vendors rose 2% to 44.3 million units. The top three now command 58% of the global market: WolfStreet And this is what happened in the US. Apple Mac shipments plunged 13%, and shipments of “Others” plunged 19.8%, while shipments of the top three brands soared a combined 9.5%, with Dell and Lenovo picking up double-digit gains. These top three vendors now command 71% of the US market. Total US shipments rose 1.7% to 17.6 million units: WolfStreet But even for the winners, it’s not exactly a rosy scenario. The shipment gains are based on building up inventories, as hopes are now circulating for a huge holiday season particularly in the US. And a buildup of inventories is deemed essential to satisfy this sudden surge in expected demand. This is a change, after a long struggle to reduce bloated inventories, which caused the steeper shipment declines over the past year or so. But if the holiday season is not huge, and if the hopes that are circulating turn out to be false hopes once again, the period of trying to bring down bloated inventories will recommence, along with even sharper shipment declines. The report: [W]e believe the strong market performance has less to do with strengthening demand and more to do with increased appetite from the channel for inventory. We will need a strong holiday season to ensure that we don’t enter 2017 in a poor inventory situation. So classic channel stuffing in the hope that demand will somehow materialize and mop up that ballooning inventory. The fourth quarter will be key. And IDC maintains its “cautious outlook.” By Region: Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) PC shipments were stronger than forecast thanks to healthy notebook sales, while desktop sales were very much in line with the forecast. The buildup of expectations towards the year-end business (e.g. mobility adoption) and holiday season promotions like Black Friday, combined with the anticipation of price increases related to some components, pushed the volumes up in the region for notebook. The Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) PC market came in slightly above expectations, although it remained constrained with shipments declining year on year. Efforts to reduce channel inventory continued, allowing for stronger than expected sell-in in China, while the upcoming festive season led to a sequentially higher consumer quarter in India. Several corporate projects that were rolled out across the region, coupled with stronger demand from business users in China, helped alleviate the decline in otherwise soft commercial markets. The Japan PC market returned to positive growth in the third quarter, stabilizing after a substantial drop in 2015. Demand for Windows 7 systems remained a key driver as companies still using the OS purchased systems ahead of price increases. This leaves Apple Macs as the biggest loser, worldwide and in the US. Apple is going to come out with some updated and even cooler PCs. Everyone is hoping that they will be a big hit. But the PC market has been commoditized years ago, and cool doesn’t really matter anymore. What matters is price and functionality. And it’s going to be an uphill slog for Macs. Thank God for the iPhone and for the fiasco that has befallen Samsung with its exploding Note 7 smartphones, which its owners are now told to turn off. Mac sales accounted for only 12% of Apple’s total sales of $42.4 billion in the last quarter, and that share will likely fall further, as Apple continues with its transition to a company dominated by just one product. Blame the Millennials? They certainly get blamed for everything else. Read the original article on Wolf Street. Copyright 2016. Follow Wolf Street on Twitter.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s iOS 10 is the most exciting, powerful release in the company’s history. But it’s not all good. In some respects, Apple’s mobile software has taken a few steps back since last year’s update. Some of our biggest gripes with iOS still remain; the grid layout is wearing thin; you can’t replace default apps; it still takes a lot of swipes and taps to perform simple actions. These are frustrations we’ve had for years. Specific to iOS 10, Apple made usability a bit more frustrating. For example, “slide to unlock” is now a thing of the past, and by default you need to press the home button in order to unlock your phone. Control Center has also been tweaked and it looks great, but music controls have been moved over to a separate pane, which requires one more swipe than should be necessary. It’s the little things like that that can make the new update frustrating. While we’re happy with new features such as widgets and a better lock screen experience, improvements still need to be made. Check out the video above to hear more of Jon thoughts about iOS. Topics #Apple #Apple #iOS Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is reportedly gearing up to stop supporting several of its older products, according to MacOtakara.  The website named several products, including the iPhone 4, the 13-inch late 2010 MacBook Air, the third generation AirMac Extreme and the second generation Time Capsule. Apple actually tends to support its products many years longer than other companies, often issuing major macOS and iOS updates to devices that are still in circulation. The “obsolete” status, however, means Apple will stop offering hardware support, too, 9to5Mac explained. Why this matters: You probably want to regularly upgrade your phone if you want to continue getting the latest software updates and security patches. The iPhone 4 is getting long in the tooth, for example, and there are plenty of affordable options that still serve as upgrades. Or you can just wait for yours to break, just don’t expect a repair option from Apple.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Why I’m excited for AirPods By Andrew O'Hara, Oct 15, 2016 Tweet 80 Comments There has been a lot of takes on Apple’s new wireless headphones, the AirPods. Some people brush them off as just expensive and unnecessary. Others insist you’re going to lose them instantly. However, after Apple’s keynote, the AirPods may be what I am looking forward to most. To start, I’m not the average person. I test out gadgets for a living, so I already have multiple pairs of Bluetooth headphones. And while I love the cordless freedom Bluetooth affords, pairing can be a nightmare. Sometimes they don’t actually go into pairing mode. Other times, I have to go the other device they are paired with, remove it, then try to re-add to my new device. When I could be listening to something on my iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or Mac at any time, this is immensely frustrating. Til now, there has not been a good way to actually use multiple devices like this. I specifically have different Bluetooth headphones for different devices so I don’t have to go through the process of pairing them each time. I use some over-the-ear headphones on my Mac whilst I am working, and Bragi buds when I am on my phone. AirPods fix this giant issue. Once you open the case and pair them with your iPhone with a single tap, iCloud shares that Bluetooth profile with all your devices. There is no disconnecting, and re-pairing process. If I am walking around listening on my iPhone, I get to work and want to switch to my Mac, I simply go up to the audio selector in the menu bar and select my AirPods, and I’ve switched my audio from one to the other. That easy. I can then easily switch to my iPad when I get home, and to my Apple Watch when I want to exercise on my bike. AirPods aren’t for everyone. The fit still isn’t universal, but that is the case for any pair of earbuds or headphones. It does seem though, again based on early hands-on reports, that they do stay in your ear quite a bit better than EarPods ever did. The “you’re going to lose them” argument also seems silly. Why did no one say that about the Dash? Or Earin? Or the Jabra Elite Sport? Luckily, what I thought was my biggest issue with AirPods (I even said so in the video), is not an issue. That is the ability to listen to one EarPod by itself. Audio quality is also something to consider. But most people aren’t audiophiles and are perfectly fine with the beats put out by EarPods, however shallow it may sound. From early reports, It looks like AirPods may be slightly better which should do just fine. The big advantage, as it often is for Apple, is the fact no one else can do this. They have the merger of software and hardware and no other company can create that slide up card on the iPhone when you go to pair them. Or use iCloud to share the profile. Which means if you want AirPods biggest benefit, you have to choose them over any of the competition. Or one of the other Beats products with a W1 chip inside. I love my new iPhone 7, and my shiny new Apple Watch. But how easily the AirPods can fix a problem that has plagued me since I switched to Bluetooth headphones makes them the most exciting thing, for me, from Apple’s iPhone announcement. We will see the new AirPods start shipping at the end of October, hopefully alongside a new MacBook Pro refresh. Let me know your thoughts (nicely!) down in the comments below. Are you going to be picking up a pair? Or are you going to stick to your existing wired headphones? Or can you forgive the Bluetooth issues for better quality sound or fit?

Please check and see if you can use 1 airpod at a time. Cuz that way u can get twice the battery life. Thanks @Anthony Timothy They said you can, in this very article. tariq My bad. I missed it. Thanks! jaysoncopes From my understanding, it should also automatically switch into mono audio mode when you only have one earphone in, meaning that it will play both left and right tracks for you whether or not you have in both earphones. Ninja Ass I love airpods idk why ppl hate it how they lost it Jack Wong People always like to pick a bone from a chicken, which is very easy. I would tell them why don’t you create something that I/others would pay you a premium price. Rowan09 The Samsung airport costs $200 and does less than this one, so at $149 I really don’t see why this is considered premium. Jack Wong My last 2 BT earbuds are both less than 100. The one I’m using now is Anker, it’s only 25. Then someone will post I’m using Xxx brand and its 300+, I don’t see 200 is considered as premium. george Um no, the Samsung ones are for fitness and actually have features. What are you smoking? Rowan09 Please tell me the features because my wife has it? george Um 4gb storage 1k songs, activity monitor, heart rate monitor??? The airpods don’t do anything besides connect to an apple product easily. Rowan09 It does not have a heart rate monitor and how are they useful features besides 4Gb for storing music? If I go for a run I bring my phone and wireless headphones and with IconX you also need a phone which will track all those features you mentioned making all those things on the headphone useless without a phone. The Air Pods were never said to be for fitness. george It does have a heart rate monitor, do some research. Chloe Elizabeth Wade I don’t like em they’ll have shit bass and earbuds all fall out of my ears plus the airpods are over half the price of the solo3s which I think are way more worth it better bass better battery life more material so better value and they’re available in colors Jerwyn Feria isn’t the casing a battery pack for the airpods itself. so wouldn’t that allow it to always be charged when pulled out of its case? its not like when your not using the solo3s, they are charging, you require it plug it into a battery pack or powered usb outlet to charge them. if you add different color into the mix, would that be an apple thing or a beats thing? anyways isn’t the money going into the same place. airpods require any size pocket to fit in, solo3 requires big pockets for them to fit in. if you are arguing about the design and price differences. i would also say your argument would be much better if you used the beatsX instead of the solo3s cause your comparing an on ear vs an in ear headset product. Docservlet What do you mean “they’ll have shit bass and earbuds all fall out of my ears”. Not sure how you know this without trying them. Also, most reviews I read say they stay in place just fine. The Solo 3 is a completely different conversation than the airpods. You can’t compare the 2. For PREMIUM bluetooth headsets like bose, sennheiser etc most people are forking out OVER 150 bucks for ONE earpiece. These airpods are a deal. racerhomie2 I love them Chloe Elizabeth Wade Why they’re overpriced trash u can buy the new solo3 for only like $140 more u get better bass which is important for me bc I only listen to rap they’re harder to lose plus earbuds always fall out of my canals and solo3s have much better battery life and are available in colors Y2J: Keeper of the List Dude we all know you don’t like them you’ve commented like 19 times about it, get over it not everyone is asking for your opinion Vince Reedy You could also use a period or 2 Chloe Elizabeth Wade I’m lazy mickey You’re comparing on ear headphones to wireless earbuds. Your argument is trash. Docservlet Nonsense. You can’t compare the size of the Solo 3 to the airpods. They are 2 completely different applications. No one wants to lug around the Solo 3s throughout their workday. jaysoncopes “I only listen to rap” holy crap you must be so gangsta. Please, go listen to your over-bassed music on another blog that actually cares about uneducated opinions. Jamie Senior Chloe, I don’t know where you are seeing Solo3 Wireless for $140? What I am see is $299.99!!!!! Chloe Elizabeth Wade I meant $140 more than airpods which they are zebonaut Did you say you can’t use only one airpod? wongnog Yeah I’m pretty sure in the keynote they explained you can remove one airpod and still listen to music or phone conversation with the other airpod. Sebastien He did say that in the video but corrected himself in the post. You can listen to one airpod at a time iBanks I’m surely getting sets for myself and my lady. Rickey Woods they need to hurry up and ship them geez Chloe Elizabeth Wade Why they suck they’re gonna have terrible bass earbuds always fall out of my ears they have much worse battery life than solo3s and they’re over half the price for less material terrible bass Favna Honestly I’m really not sure if I’ll end up getting them. I currently have a bluetooth headset but it was a really really cheap thing that has a lot of sound delay when watching videos (as in, the mouth movement and sound are horribly out of sync) and I never really liked being corded to my phone at all. One thing is for sure however, I will be trying them out in an Apple Store before I purchase them – unlike a purchase of a new iPhone that I easily order online without breaking a sweat. Chloe Elizabeth Wade Just buy the solo3s that’s what I’m doing Blip dude Why buy the Solos when you can just get the studios for better value?? Also, not everyone listens to rap. When I actually want to listen to Classical or Jazz Beats aren’t exactly the greatest. Chloe Elizabeth Wade Maybe bc the studios haven’t been updated to have W1 yet and battery life isn’t as good Chloe Elizabeth Wade The solo3 do everything the airpods will do and more and they do it better the solo3 r the first device on the market with the W1 and they have better bass (important bc I only listen to rap) better battery life much bigger more material= better value especially since both are primarily plastic and they’re available in multiple colors whereas airpods are white only Vondrook4 I’m just worried about sound quality. I firmly believe that foam tips are the best kind of in-ear headphones, because they create a seal and actually give you bass. I’ve never liked Apple headphones, but the pairing convenience like you said, is the coolest feature. Anthony Bouchard I’m really not expecting them to sound any better than the EarPods that are already in the box with your iPhone. Some early reviews said they didn’t even sound as good as the wired counterparts. [RECON1] But don’t you always lose sound quality over Bluetooth anyways? JohnS No. But since bluetooth headsets can’t use the iPhones amplifier or DAC, and have to include batteries and wireless components all while competing with ultra cheap wired sets it’s easy to see why many manufacturers skimp on components. Unfortunately if the Amp or DAC are subpar your audio quality plummets fast. And most bluetooth headsets don’t have high quality components unless you are willing to spend hundreds on them. M_thoroughbred I’m with ya. I get the tech inside these earphones but at the end of the day if the sound is the same as the ones that come with the iPhone cause that is what’s about, the sound Matt My next pair of headphones will have a W1 chip in them. I’m actually hoping Apple licenses it, but it’s what I’m basing my purchase off. Chloe Elizabeth Wade The best option is probably the solo3 rn and even when the airpods come out Lit Is it patented? If not, I’m hoping all companies acquire it so we can do away with bluetooth audio if it truly is superior. JohnS I’m sure it is, but hopefully just like lightning connectors it will be something that Apple licenses out. If not, someone will have cloned it by next year and everyone will be offering it anyways. Matt I’m sure it is. Just like lightning. Keep in mind, you can’t do away with Bluetooth. The w1 chip simply aids the Bluetooth connection. With all that said, the Base QC35 are still calling my name. Chloe Elizabeth Wade I’m not I’m getting the solo3 instead they have better bass(important bc I only listen to rap) better battery life bigger (to me more material is better value) they’re only like $140 more and they’re available in colors(I’m getting rose gold to match my 6s+) and are harder to lose Vince Reedy You have completely ruined the comment section for this post. Go buy the solo3s and leave us alone. Californian100 go……………..away AMB_07 Not excited, i’m going to stick to wired for now. n0ahcruz3 Cook said the earpods would not fall off while doing activity… lies mwpitt52 Going to wait and look at Beats X with new Apple chip. The AirPods look to goofy and the Solo 3 too cheap. Chloe Elizabeth Wade Beats X? Really they’re like half the price of the solo3 and the solo3 look premium they just don’t feel it plus the beats X have a cord btwn them which could get annoying Vince Reedy I may just buy you solo3s so you’ll shut up Bacillus You repeated yourself 3x now about ye solo3. Please put down the volume (or do they cause memory stress ?) Ghaith Al Hami Its daimn expensive Docservlet No actually it’s not relative to other premium bluetooth devices. Ghaith Al Hami I will not pay 160 $ for that I know its great and everything but still too much for me Thanks for the heads up Endriu Andrei What about bluetooth effects on health ? Docservlet BT LE is very low energy. You’re actually better off using bluetooth than holding the phone to your ear. James G Did somebody say solo 3 yet….? lol Jerwyn Feria haha you don’t even know the half of it yet. James G Oh I do. I read through the comments. Hence the joke. lol Jon20 Wish they came in Black. Hope they do. tforet Can’t wait to try them tforet Looking forward to trying Air Pods out. Rook HD wish it had playback control tho. I don’t like the idea of talking to Siri to do such simple tasks like skipping to next song. Valinor I’m one of those haters. You know why I dont like them? The sound quality is the same as the wired pods. So basically your paying a premium price for 10 dollar earpods. Also anyone who used the normal earpods know how easy they fall out. Most other wireless earpods are in-ear and we all know thats a tighter fit with less chance to fall out. Maybe these will be a bit better than the normal earpods because of the longer bottom part but still, all you need is your hand of bag accidentally hitting your ear and they are gone. In-ears are not that easy to fall out. They should have made an in-ear version, then I would have been more excited. Jerwyn Feria Chloe Elizabeth Wade… This guy had made his argument 1. better comparison to “other” headsets that possibly in the same class as Airpods. 2. explain with an example of how easily you could lose the product. 3. Used others as a collective thought to argue that the EarPods easily falls of the ear. 4. made a suggestion best for maybe even apple to see. 5. Made an argument in one comment. Johnny Nah toooooo short batterylife in thoose ugly pods. Ill stick to my LG tone ultras 14 hours of music on one charge Thank you very much for that Jerry Yeah ok dude Volerikan When I’m not using my iMac as a personal computer, I’m using it as a media center controlling it with my Apple TV remote from across the room. Would be nice to easily connect the AirPods to my iMac so I don’t disturb the neighbors with my Netflix binge. Nuff Said This article seems to overlook the fact that with these headphones you’ll be more tethered to your phone than with any other headphones due to there not being any easy way to input commands outside of using Siri. I naturally expect this huge factor to be brushed off and nonchalantly excused. I mean isnt it the main reason we use Bluetooth can headphones so we don’t have to pull our phones out as much? lou111 These could be the best Apple product of this year. But… In situation when minijack is removed… AirPods Should be a part of the iPhone 7 as standard, not an 150$ option. jay not really excited about that. looks is wired and there is really nothing wow on them like store your music on them and go for a run no heart rate monitor… others they have that already Gastón Headphones that need to be charged? Watches that need to be charged? What’s next for Marketing geniuses? Thanks, but I’ll stick to my Bose and Casio.

Stock Rests On iPhone 7 Demand (AAPL) Investors now wait for AAPL's earnings to deliver By Michelle Jones, ValueWalk  |  Oct 15, 2016, 8:04 am EST     Popular Posts: GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Slapped With Multiple Downgrades Recent Posts: GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Slapped With Multiple Downgrades Post Election Actions to Take: Pause, Reflect, and Act Carefully Is Gold a Safe Bet No Matter What the Fed Does? View All Posts Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock has been on a nice tear of late as analysts have harped on Samsung’s (SSNLF) trash (the exploding Note 7) as Apple’s treasure. The iPhone maker’s shares finally had a tough time on Thursday, but they bounced back quickly on Friday as the countdown to the next earnings report is on. iPhone 7 sales will be a key component of Apple stock over the next several months. Apple Stock Target Upped The September quarter has just a short time covering iPhone 7 sales. This is pretty typical of September quarters, although this year’s quarter has more sale days for the newest handsets compared to the year-ago quarter with the iPhone 6s. While there are always differences in iPhone unit estimates among analysts, this year there seems to be an exceptionally wide berth where headlines are concerned. Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Katy Huberty bumped up her price target for Apple stock by $1 per share to $124 per share based on better-than-expected iPhone 7 demand. While she said that their higher iPhone estimates in the near term are already mostly baked into Apple stock, she added that she’s getting more confident that the iPhone 7 cycle will drive “meaningful” revisions to estimates and push the shares toward her $162 bull case. Indeed, the headlines here fall into one of two categories: “iPhone 7 sales are better than expected” or “iPhone 7 sales are weak.” Of course Huberty falls into the former category and has for a long time. Apple’s Estimates Also Increased The analyst increased her estimates for Apple’s fourth fiscal quarter, as she believes the features of this year’s new phones are “compelling enough” to result in a “record number of switchers and decent number of refreshers” off Apple’s current installed base of more than 600 million iPhones. She believes that the dual-lens camera on the iPhone 7 Plus and “to a lesser extent,” Samsung’s Note 7 recall are shifting the iPhone mix toward the larger of the two phones, thus boosting the average selling price and margins. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Huberty estimates that every 10-point increase in iPhone 7 Plus mix will add $20 to the average selling price, raise the gross margin 15 basis points and add 1 or 2 cents to Apple’s earnings per share. She believes the company will come in toward the high end of guidance because iPhone 7 demand appears strong but supply is limited. As a result, she bumped up her iPhone unit estimate from 43 million to 44 million and moved her average selling price estimate from a decline of 7% to a decline of 3% due to greater demand and better mix. However, she cut her iPad unit estimates. She now pegs Apple’s September quarter at $47.2 billion in revenue, $1.65 per share in earnings, and a 38% gross margin, which are in line with consensus. They’re also close to the high end of management’s guide for $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion in revenue and 37.5% to 38% gross margin. While she sees this year as shaping up well already, she called fiscal 2018 the real supercycle. While Apple bears are relatively few compared to the general bullishness that has surrounded the company for some time, they do exist. One such example is Forbes contributor Bert Dohmen of Dohmen Capital, who said that iPhone 7 sales are so poor that Apple didn’t even release first week sales as it has in the past. However, the company has said that supply is the problem rather than demand, although this is something we won’t know until we see unit numbers for the September and December quarters (but mostly December). Dohmen argues that Apple won’t end up being the main beneficiary of Samsung’s Note 7 debacle because he believes that consumers who have had a Galaxy phone won’t return to the “Apple ‘eco-jail.’” He also noted that a “relatively small number of people” use the Note, which is also a very large device. The Love Story Is Over for Twitter Inc (TWTR) As a result, he suggests that Note 7 users may be more likely to turn to other Android devices such as Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL) new Pixel phones. Apple stock edged upward by as much as 0.28% to $117.31 during regular trading hours on Friday, and closed ahead 0.56% at $117.62 per share.

Elyse Betters14 October 2016Smartwatch Pocket-lint Apple Watch Nike+ features exclusive Nike watch faces Has Nike+ Run Club app (with complication) preinstalled Comes in four different design combos (all aluminium cases) Starts from £369 for 38mm version, £399 for 42mm Launches on 28 October in US, UK, and elsewhere Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple and Nike announced in September that they revived their partnership, with the introduction of Apple Watch Nike+ during Apple's Special Event. Now we know when that sports-centric smartwatch will go on sale. Here's everything you need to know about Apple Watch Nike+, including how much it costs and when you can get your hands on it. Be sure to check out Pocket-lint's preview of the watch as well, where we said it looks great, has a sporty feel, and feels really comfortable on the wrist. Apple Watch Nike Plus is designed to be your perfect running partner Pocket-lint What is Apple Watch Nike+? Apart from the new Apple Watch Series 2, Apple unveiled a Nike+ edition of its second-generation smartwatch. Apple teamed up with Nike to make a version of Apple Watch meant for runners. It uniquely features a different strap design and specialised software to make it easier for runners to put it on quickly and make use of the device's built-in GPS. This isn't just a simple paint job. Pocket-lint What does Apple Watch Nike+ feature? Although you do get all the same features found in the Apple Watch Series 2, such as built-in GPS, a waterproof design (up to 50m), 38mm and 42mm watch case options, and a band made from the same elastomer material found in the Apple Watch Sport strap, the Nike+ edition has a new strap. Apple worked with Nike to design a perforated finish that's more durable and breathable. However, like the standard Apple Watch, you can change the straps. It's actually going to be available with four different case and strap combinations: there's a space grey aluminium case with either a black/yellow strap or a black/grey strap, and there's a silver aluminium with a either a silver/white band combo or a silver/yellow option. All of which are bright and sporty-looking. As for the WatchOS 3 software powering the watch, Pocket-lint has a round-up of all the features and changes found in the software. But the Nike+ has two additional perks: it gets exclusive Nike-themed watch faces that include a complication for directly launching the Nike+ Run Club app, which comes pre-installed and lets you track your runs, view running history, and more. Pocket-lint How much does Apple Watch Nike+ cost? The Apple Watch Nike+ costs the same as the new Apple Watch Series 2. It starts at $369 (£369) for the 38mm version and $399.99 (£399) for the 42mm one. Apple When will Apple Watch Nike+ be available? Apple quietly updated its website to confirm the Apple Watch Nike+ will launch on 28 October in the US, UK, and elsewhere. Want to know more?

Co. Ltd. May Have Just Confirmed Apple Inc. A12 Win This contract chip manufacturer may be Apple's go-to for the latter's homegrown mobile processors for years to come. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 14, 2016 at 5:22PM Image source: TSMC.  Back in 2015, it was revealed that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had decided to source the A9 applications processor that powered the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus from both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF). This was viewed as something of a blow to TSMC, as the company was previously the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's A8 chip. Since then, TSMC's execution appears to have improved. It is widely believed to be the sole manufacturer of Apple's A10 Fusion chip inside of the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It is also expected to be the sole manufacturer of next year's A11 processor, particularly in light of management's comments that it will have in excess of 70% foundry market share at the 10-nanometer node. Based on commentary from TSMC's third-quarter earnings call, it looks as though it might have won the entirety of Apple's A12 orders as well. TSMC expecting substantial share at 7 nanometers When an analyst asked TSMC's executives about what kind of share the chipmaker expects to have during the 7-nanometer technology generation, co-CEO Mark Liu had the following to say, according to a transcript from Seeking Alpha [sign-in required]: High. We'd say high. Higher than 10-nanometer. We want to do every node higher than the previous node. Based on this comment, and assuming that the A12 chip will be manufactured in a 7-nanometer process rather than a 10-nanometer one (and I believe this is a safe assumption to make), it stands to reason that TSMC has won the entirety of the Apple A12 contract. Additionally, since the 7-nanometer node is expected to be TSMC's leading edge technology until around 2020 (when it rolls out its 5-nanometer technology), Apple will likely build the A13 on TSMC's 7-nanometer technology as well. And, given that Apple is responsible for a substantial amount of revenue and unit shipments on a given technology node, it would be very hard for TSMC to have "higher than 10-nanometer" share if it weren't the exclusive manufacturer of the A13.  Impacted businesses For TSMC, this is likely good news for a couple of reasons. First of all, Apple doesn't tend to reduce the sizes of its chips much, instead opting to use the additional chip area that new manufacturing technologies bring to add features/performance. Given that 7-nanometer wafers will almost certainly be more expensive than 10-nanometer wafers (which in turn are likely to be more expensive than 16-nanometer wafers), I expect TSMC's dollar content from the applications processor within future iPhones to continue to move upward. Beyond that, though, to the extent that Apple's iPhone unit shipments grow, so too should TSMC's revenue from Apple. The main loser here is Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), which is a competitor to TSMC in contract chip manufacturing. Apple used to be a major anchor customer for Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business, but it would appear that this business is gone in the near-to-medium term -- and potentially for good. Further, if TSMC's share projections are accurate, Samsung foundry customers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) might be planning to jump ship -- in whole, or in part -- to TSMC at the 7-nanometer node. Fortunately for Samsung, contract chip manufacturing is a very small part of its nearly $40 billion chip business (IC Insights estimated Samsung's contract chip business at less than $3 billion in revenue during 2015), let alone its total business, so losing out to TSMC isn't really a "game changer" for Samsung's business or its stock price.

Well, that is all about to change. BGR has the news. “The company is rumored to be planning a press conference later this month at which it may unveil a number of updated products in its Mac lineup. The star of the show, if recent reports pan out, will be a completely redesigned MacBook Pro with a special secondary touchscreen display above the standard keyboard that will be home to a row of morphing function keys.” Concept images of 2016 #MacBook #Pro with #OLED touch panel are insane https://t.co/vkgwNIHvq9 @BGR — mark phillips (@designinternet) October 12, 2016 BGR adds that the new screen will allegedly show different keys depending on which app is being used, helping to open up a wide range of new functionality for MacBook Pro users. According to iTech Post, the new MacBook Pro display may be out of this world. “There are many rumors and speculations about the specs and features of the upcoming MacBook Pro 2016. According to them, MacBook Pro 2016 might come with a 5K display that will replace the ThunderBolt display of its predecessors. LG and Apple are rumored to work together to improve MacBook Pro’s display.” The article adds that some versions of the MacBook Pro could have a dual-core Intel Core M processor while others would have a 7th generation Intel Core i5 or a Core i7 CPU. The device may come with support for USB-C, which is rapidly becoming a standard. There is also a possibility users could get 10 hours of battery life from the new MacBook Pro. Apple’s upcoming notebook has caused a lot of excitement on Reddit. “I feel your pain. I am now cycling through my usual Apple rumor blogs on an hourly basis waiting for something new. I am beginning to worry that there hasn’t been any invitation to a keynote/event yet. If there is an event scheduled for around the 25th of October, shouldn’t an invitation have been sent out already?” asks Your_favorite_mexi in response to a poster who has been constantly doing Google searches for new MacBook Pro information. “Finally some talk about the MBP! Everything seems so iPhone focused,” says QuazyWabbit1. After months of being in a slump (at least according to the media), it appears that Apple has been pulling all the punches since the release of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September. Both phones have received great reviews. However, Apple detractors are pushing the fact that shipments for Apple’s new iPhones may come in lower this year than they did one year ago. However, as Motley Fool notes, judging iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales on that could be misleading. Despite the rumors, the iPhone 7 and — especially — the iPhone 7 Plus are still in huge demand. [Image by Daryl Deino] “With the iPhone 6S, Apple likely built and shipped iPhone 6S devices under the assumption that the then-new device would sell better in the marketplace than the prior generation iPhone 6. When it was clear that the end-demand wasn’t there, Apple wound up cutting iPhone 6S production and reducing the number of phones that it shipped to its channel/distribution partners,” says columnist Ashraft Eassa, noting that Apple likely produced less iPhone 7 and 7 Plus units this year so they don’t make the same mistake again. It appears that Apple couldn’t even keep up with the demand for the new iPhone, especially the iPhone 7 Plus. Even though the 7 Plus was released a month ago, there are still people on all carriers waiting for their desired iPhone 7 Plus, especially the Jet Black one. The excitement for the new iPhones combined with the possible release of the new MacBook Pros at the end of October could make 2016 one of Apple’s most profitable years yet.

Macy’s opened an Apple shop Friday at its Herald Square store, the first U.S. department store with a hub devoted to the brand. The shop features a range of products including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and the new Nike-branded Apple Watch. Staffed by Apple associates, it’s on the main floor in the heart of the busy cosmetics and fragrance area.

Now sources claim that they may get a killer keyboard upgrade, too. What kind of an upgrade, you ask? According to both 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews, Apple is toying with the idea of replacing all those boring old static plastic keys with a full spread of tiny E Ink displays. And it’s about more than just allowing Apple to source a single keyboard for every MacBook regardless of which country it’s going to be sold in. Yes, it’s neat that such a keyboard would allow, for example, Canadians to switch quickly back and forth between full English and French layouts — instead of having to slog on with a bilingual keyboard. The really cool part, though, is that these keyboards could be context-aware. As soon as you fire up an app — say, Final Cut Pro or  Photoshop — your MacBook could transform its keyboard to make commonly-used commands more accessible. Need to bang a boatload of numbers into an Excel sheet? No problem, just flick a software switch and light up a numeric keypad.There’s already a company making keyboards like this. No, not Art. Lebedev. Those Optimus keyboards are very cool and all, but they’re a little too pricey even for the $2499 MacBook Pro. It’s actually Sonder Designs, and a company spokesperson has acknowledged that they have indeed held discussions with Apple.That’s Sonder’s desktop keyboard there, and it’s up for pre-order at $199. Remove the healthy markup for retail and factor in the massive number Apple would be ordering if they go this way, and it’s probably not a terribly big cost to work into a higher-end MacBook Pro.

This version of Apple's second-gen smartwatch was announced at its early September event, just like the Watch Series 2 itself. Yet up until now there was no information about when it will be out. Apple has made it official today: the Watch Series 2 Nike+ will be available on October 28. This model is basically a new Apple Watch featuring special Nike sports bands, as well as dedicated software for runners from Nike. You get exclusive Nike watch faces, and a Nike+ Run Club complication. There are four styles to choose from for the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+, and all of them come with bands that scream "I'm athletic!". Regardless of the color you pick, the smartwatch starts at $369 in the 38mm size, while the 42mm model is priced from $399. Pre-orders are still available straight from Apple.

Apple cider with gin? By Lester Graham • Oct 14, 2016 Related Program:  Stateside TweetShareGoogle+Email The Apple Business cocktail mixes apple cider with gin. You won't believe how well it works. Lester Graham / Michigan Radio Listen Listening... / 2:01 Shake, shake, shake that cocktail! Tammy Coxen of Tammy's Tastings shakes the Apple Business cocktail. Cheers! Credit Lester Graham / Michigan Radio "October is my favorite month," Tammy Coxen of Tammy's Tastings said. "Do you know why? Apple cider!" Apple cider is a popular ingredient in a lot of cocktails which seem perfect for fall. Often the cider is mixed with bourbon or rum. But this cocktail, the Apple Business, is made with gin. "I chose Ann Arbor Distilling's Water Hill gin for this drink because of of the spicy garam masala note," Coxen said. The distiller's website indicates the botanicals used to flavor the gin include Croatian juniper, cardamom, and garam masala. "Each is distilled independently before being carefully blended for each batch," the company's website explains. Apple Business 2 oz gin 1 oz apple cider 1/2 oz lime juice 1/2 oz honey syrup (3:1) Garnish: apple slice Combine all ingredients in shaker with ice. Shake and strain into ice-filled rocks glass. Garnish. After thinking about it, Coxen said maybe she loved October for the donuts at the cider mill. Either way, she can't go wrong. TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content Cheers to the weekend!

October 14 AAPL: 117.63 0.65 Hands-on: Apple Watch Nike+ special features in action ahead of October 28 release [Video] Zac Hall - 1 month ago @apollozac Feature Apple Watch View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple has teamed up with Nike to create the running-focused Apple Watch Nike+. The special version of the new Series 2 models includes extra benefits like unique band designs and colors, Nike watch faces, and integration with Nike’s specialized running app. The new models begin shipping on October 28, and 9to5Mac had the chance to check out some of the special features that make Apple Watch Nike+ unique. Apple Watch Nike+ includes the same benefits as all Apple Watch Series 2 models including a built-in GPS for outdoor run and cycling tracking without carrying an iPhone, stronger water resistance that enables new swim workouts, and a much brighter display for higher visibility in outdoor lighting. Nike+ models are offered with two sizes, two aluminum finishes, with four different band colors: 38mm or 42mm displays, Silver or Space Gray casings, and Black/Volt, Black/Cool Gray, Flat Silver/Volt, and Flat Silver/White bands. Although Nike+ began shipping about a month after the standard Apple Watch Series 2, the collection features the same $369 and $399 price with larger display models costing $30 more. Apple Watch Nike+ features two unique watch faces that feature Nike’s signature font and Volt color with both digital and analog versions. You can customize the style of both Nike watch faces including how the time appears, plus there’s a permanent complication that offers instant access to the Nike+ Run Club app. In addition to two Nike watch faces, you can also use Nike’s Volt color on Apple’s watch faces including digital and analog Activity, Numerals, and Chronograph. This isn’t an option on any other Apple Watch as it’s unique to Nike products. Volt as a color option on most watch faces lets you color match almost any watch face to the Nike Sport Band. Nike Sport Band is a unique take on Apple’s Sport Band that features compression-molded perforations that offer increased ventilation during activities and a somewhat reduced weight. Black versions with Volt or Cool Gray are offered with Space Gray models while Flat Silver versions with Volt or White are offered with Silver models. The additional perforations have the extra benefit of being more customizable in terms of sizing too. Check out our hands-on video (thanks to Jordan for recording on the spot) with Apple Watch Nike+ below for additional tidbits: While you can try the Apple Watch Nike+ in select Apple Stores ahead of its October 28 release, there are still a few unknowns about the special version of the Series 2 model. The version of the Nike+ Run Club app on the demo models is different from the version of the app currently on the App Store; it’s unclear if an updated version of the app will be available for all Apple Watch owners. We know the Nike watch faces will be unique and my guess it that the app experience will be available to everyone. It’s also not clear if Nike Sport Bands will be sold separately in the future but all signs currently point to no for now. Apple Watch bands are interchangeable on Nike+ models just like any other models. [Update 10/24: From Apple’s latest press release: Nike Sport Bands are available exclusively with Apple Watch Nike+ models and not sold separately.]   You can read 9to5Mac’s full review of the Apple Watch Series 2 for more on the latest features, and check out our gallery below for more shots of the Apple Watch Nike+ ahead of its release in two weeks.

Macs & Mac OS X | 14 Oct 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (25) How to Enable “Hey Siri” in macOS 10.12 Sierra by Adam C. Engst Although Apple has made much of the fact that macOS 10.12 Sierra includes the Siri voice-driven personal assistant technology, there is one glaring omission: the capability to hail Siri with just your voice. Instead, you must click Siri’s menu bar icon or Dock icon, or press its keyboard shortcut. That shouldn’t be necessary: on recent iPhones and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and on the Apple Watch, you can just say “Hey Siri” to cause Siri to take notice of your next spoken command. (With older iOS devices, “Hey Siri” works only when the device is connected to power, rendering it significantly less useful. With the Apple TV, you must press and hold a button on the Siri Remote, which can be difficult to do in a dark room.) Happily, there is a subtle trick you can use to simulate “Hey Siri” on a Mac running Sierra. I’ve based these instructions on the coverage of Siri in Scholle McFarland’s “Sierra: A Take Control Crash Course” book — it provides a slew of additional tips, tricks, and step-by-step illustrated instructions if you’re looking for more help with Siri or other new features in Sierra. Scholle’s trick revolves around using a dictation feature to open Siri on your command. Follow these steps: Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation. Turn Dictation on and then select Use Enhanced Dictation. If it hasn’t already, your Mac downloads Enhanced Dictation, which enables you to use dictation, even when your Mac is offline. That’s not actually what we care about, but eliminating the need to parse your words on Apple’s servers also lets you use dictation commands and converts your words to text more quickly, and those features are key. Switch to System Preferences > Accessibility. Scroll down in the left-hand column and select Dictation. Select Enable the Dictation Keyword Phrase and then type Hey into the text field. Click the Dictation Commands button, select the Enable Advanced Commands checkbox, and then click the plus button. Options appear to the right of the dialog. Next to “When I say,” type Siri into the text field. Leave While Using set to Any Application. Click the Perform pop-up menu and choose Open Finder Items. In the dialog that appears, navigate to the Siri app in the Applications folder. Click Done. Try it out by saying “Hey Siri!” and your Mac should respond. There’s no option for training Siri to recognize your voice in Sierra, so you’ll need to practice a little to figure out how to speak so your Mac understands that you’re talking to it. In particular, pause for a beat after you say “Hey Siri” until your Mac beeps to indicate that it’s listening. One problem with setting up “Hey Siri” as we’ve done here is that if your iPhone is in range, it will likely answer as well. Although Siri talking to Siri can be amusing, it will likely get on your nerves. To avoid this, you can change either the voice trigger for your Mac, in Step 3 above, or the name in the “When I say” field in Step 4. Obviously, you can use whatever you like, but my recommendation is “Hey Mac.” Assuming that you’re using “Hey Siri” on your iPhone, iPad Pro, or Apple Watch already, keeping “Hey” as the trigger will make it easy to start issuing a voice command regardless of what device you’re using, and continuing to talk to “Mac” should be intuitive, given that you are talking to your Mac. “Hey Mac” is also short and easy to say, and it should be easily recognized. If your Mac doesn’t recognize you saying it, though, don’t hesitate to try other triggers or names. If you have more general trouble, make sure your microphone is selected in System Preferences > Sound > Input and restart your Mac to give it a clean slate. Give this trick a try, and let us know in the comments how you’re using Siri on your Mac, and how that is similar to or different from how you use Siri on your other Apple devices. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Sierra: A Take Control Crash Course You can head off into the wilds of Sierra with confidence when you're equipped with Mac expert Scholle McFarland's detailed what's new list. She also teaches you new Sierra features like Siri, app tabs, Desktop and Documents folder syncing, Optimized Storage, Universal Clipboard, and Picture in Picture. Still, our favorite chapter is "Discover the Little Things in Sierra," which covers the tiny changes that make a big difference.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Grant  2016-10-14 19:07 While playing with this I scrolled down further to the Dictation Commands already preset in the System. These include "Start Siri" and "Close Siri." If you set the keyword as "Mac" the command can simply be "Mac Start Siri." Both ways work. Sholle's is a bit cleaner for Siri, but you then must use "Hey" to initiate all voice activated commands on your Mac. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-14 21:17 Yeah, we saw that. It just seemed really odd that Apple would provide the basic functionality without mimicking how it works in iOS. Reply Paul Ellis  2016-10-15 06:37 Personally I'd want the opposite - a way permanently to disable Siri so that it never invokes, or asks to invoke. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-17 10:40 Then all you have to do is open System Preferences > Siri and uncheck the Enable Siri checkbox. Reply Paul S  2016-10-21 16:36 When I do this, Siri is still running in Activity Monitor. Sometimes, I also have a SiriNCService process. The only thing I see is the menu bar icon is gone and it no longer responds. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-21 17:33 There's no way to know why specific processes might be running behind the scenes even if a checkbox is turned off. But it sounds as though it's doing what you want in the sense of Siri not invoking. Reply GS  2016-10-15 17:48 Tried this awhile back on an iMac (27 inch Retina).. turned it off after having some serious Finder issues. Might be an outlier, anyone else have problems? Reply Bob Dahl  2016-10-16 17:21 I tried BUT i couldn't get it going by voice. Keyboard launching works. Have an iMac (27", 2011, so REAL old...) running Sierra. I THINK the problem for me is my iMac is hooked up by Ethernet, Not to the Wifi. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-17 10:41 Try turning on Wi-Fi, even if it's below Ethernet in the Network preference pane (such that Ethernet is still used by default). Siri likes Wi-Fi on because some queries need a location lookup, and Wi-Fi is the only way to get that on a Mac. Reply Derek Currie   2016-10-18 01:41 I've been successful using "Yo Buddy" with the natural gap between words, as per their use by native New Yorkers. I never say either word in my normal vocabulary except as humor, therefore there's no confusion by the OS. Works great! Makes me smile. Amuses others. I'm on a MacBook Pro late 2013 with 10.12.0. Reply GS  2016-10-20 16:26 Best one is John Gruber's "Hey, Dingus!" Reply mike sanders  2016-10-18 02:55 Thanks for this Adam absolutely brilliant and just took a few minutes to set up, "Hey Mac" and there she is ready to do my bidding. Reply mike sanders  2016-10-18 03:29 Spoke too soon no longer works and Siri has disappeared from the dock. Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-18 08:10 The Dock icon for Siri isn't special — it can be removed like any other Dock icon and added back by dragging the Siri app into the Dock from the Applications folder. The menu bar icon is controlled from the Siri pane of System Preferences, so check there if that goes missing. Reply Bocaboy  2016-10-18 08:21 Worked perfectly for me. Not that it makes a lot of sense, but Alfred can also start Siri by just typing it. If you don't want Siri in the menu bar area it's another way of accessing it when you want it. Reply bruceandcarol  2016-10-18 13:27 I followed the directions and it worked fine. After a shutdown and restart the next day, it doesn't work. Any ideas what to do? Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-18 14:13 Check the settings; just yesterday I had something like this happen too, and the dictation command created in Step 4 had lost track of the Siri name. Reply mike sanders  2016-10-19 04:47 Worked for a few times today but again has quit such a pity as I really liked this, nothing from Adam on what might be the problem? Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-19 09:55 I don't know what could be wrong on your Mac, but things to try include: * Check the Input preferences in Sound and make sure your mic is selected. Play with the ambient noise reduction checkbox to see if that matters. * Check the Dictation Commands list again to make sure your command hasn't gotten deleted. * Look at the microphone icon in the menu bar for dictation; click it and try choosing the Listen Without Requiring Keyword Phrase option. Toggle that on and off. * Quit any other apps that might be using the microphone. * Restart the Mac if all else fails. Reply mike sanders  2016-10-19 04:52 Switched the name back from Mac to Siri but to no avail, why does it work a couple of times and then stop working? Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2016-10-19 14:03 Seeing how much trouble some people are having with this solution just emphasizes the question of why Apple left the feature out. My first reaction was to see it as a careless oversight on Apple's part. But after giving it some though, I suspect it has something to do with the other voice recognition features in macOS. These include VoiceOver, Speakable Items, Text to Speech as well as Dictation. Now we have Siri. I always thought it would be a complex problem to solve and perhaps this explains why it took so long to implement Siri on the Mac. Maybe "Hay Siri" was a bridge too far, considering how many switches you have to toggle in this workaround. Given that the Mac is a keyboard centric device, unlike the iPhone, iPad and Apple watch, I don't find using a keyboard shortcut to invoke Siri to be an inconvenient solution. But then I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts so adding one more is not a problem. Many people don't have the keyboard shortcut habit so maybe for them it is an issue. Then again, if you are one of those who is accustomed to using menus instead of shortcuts, going to the Dock or the Menubar should fit your work habits well enough. The workaround explained here seems to create more problems than it solves. There appear to be too many opportunities for the process to break down. YMMV. Reply Jerry  2016-10-20 11:32 It can't find the microphone after changing location/network in my experience - one has to restart the computer to make it work again. It also made the computer almost become unusable until I turned off Dictation altogether ... not really going to use this function, but cool anyway and showed it off presenting Sierra on a Gotamac meeting yesterday. Reply mike sanders  2016-10-21 21:59 Thanks Adam I will try some of the options but yesterday just had to shut it down everything I said was going into emails and messages it was chaos. How does one stop dictation spreading to all other apps and just staying with Siri? Thanks Reply Adam Engst   2016-10-22 20:11 That should be a matter of the trigger phrase, which is set to "Hey" if you've followed the instructions above. If dictation is triggering inadvertently, you may need to change it to a different word. Computer is the default. Reply Jerry  2016-11-06 15:58 I have OS 10.12.1 Beta and Siri does not work with it. Apple Support could not assist me and requested I remove the Beta Version.

Is More Interested in Augmented Reality Than Virtual Reality CEO Tim Cook is taking a stand in the AR vs. VR debate. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 14, 2016 at 2:45PM Tim Cook at WWDC 2015. Image source: Apple. There are a few major tech battlegrounds looming on the horizon, including smart homes and artificial intelligence, among others, but one particularly important field will be augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) effectively kicked off the AR/VR arms race with its 2014 acquisition of Oculus VR. Being acquired by such a large company gave Oculus and its work in VR a sense of legitimacy. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions a future where people can interact socially in VR without ever having to set a foot outside their homes. As far as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is concerned, the company has been characteristically secretive, although CEO Tim Cook continues to drop hints about Apple's pipeline. Cook sat down with BuzzFeed News Japan recently for an exclusive interview, and tipped his iHand quite a bit. Augmented reality has broader use cases For now, the use cases for VR are predominantly focused on entertainment and gaming. The high cost of entry (Oculus costs about $1,500 if you include a high-end gaming PC) limits the market for the most part, and VR is currently a niche within the gaming community. Sony is taking a shot at more affordable VR experiences, recently launching PlayStation VR, a $400 VR headset for the PlayStation 4. Cook suggests that VR can potentially be socially isolating: "There's no substitute for human contact. And so you want the technology to encourage that." If you imagine Zuckerberg's vision of people sitting at home with VR headsets interacting solely in cyberspace, it does invoke dystopian connotations from science fiction. Ironically, Zuckerberg's belief in creating social VR experiences has the potential to make humans decidedly less social in real life. In the interview, Cook continued: VR has some interesting applications, but I don't think it's a broad-based technology like AR. Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it's profound. We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they're incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier. If you think about Apple's go-to market strategy, the company always targets the mainstream consumer, since that's where the volume lies. In that context, the hurdle for AR adoption is also a lot more manageable. AR can add value to consumers' lives by providing a wide range of contextual information in countless scenarios. You could even consider AR an extension of wearables, as it would likely be delivered with some type of headset that could provide an informational overlay or heads-up display (HUD). With VR, you have to completely immerse yourself into a VR world. That also takes a lot more effort to build, and the average consumer may not have much reason to enter a VR world. In contrast, an AR experience should be relatively simpler to develop, since you're not creating an entirely new world from scratch. Besides, companies have already begun using machine learning to determine contextual relevance using a wide range of user data, which currently manifests in the form of virtual assistants. You can think of AR as sitting at the convergence between wearable computing and virtual assistants. You could also consider AR a stepping stone to VR later on, once the market is ready for it. Apple has been quietly scooping up companies and talent that will contribute to its AR ambitions. Naturally, the Apple rumor mill will provide a steady stream of leaks as we approach the inevitable product launch. Until then, investors can safely say that Apple isn't all that interested in VR.

Earnings: 5 Key Areas to Watch With management expecting another quarter of declining revenue, investors will look for a glimpse of a road back to growth. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Oct 14, 2016 at 2:33PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report is less than two weeks away. After getting rescheduled because of a "scheduling conflict," Apple is now set to report the results for its most recent quarter on Tuesday, Oct. 25 instead of a previous date of Oct. 27. Since the company is expected to report its third quarter in a row of declining revenue, the pressure is on. When Apple releases its quarterly results and provides a business update for investors in the conference call following the release, here are five important areas to watch. Image source: The Motley Fool. 1. Revenue Management said in its third-quarter update that it expected fourth-quarter revenue in the range of $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion. Notably, this represents a meaningful year-over-year decline of 11.7% to 7.8% compared to the year-ago quarter. Apple's recent revenue decline has been primarily due to lower iPhone sales during fiscal 2015 as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus struggled to live up to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales. And this will likely be what may drive another decline in the company's fourth quarter. Given that Apple's guidance is usually fairly accurate, investors can rely on management's own expectations as a barometer for what to expect when the tech giant reports results. 2. Earnings per share Since Apple's year-over-year revenue declines have recently been driven mostly by declining iPhone sales, which is Apple's most profitable product segment, the company's earnings per share have been declining even more rapidly than revenue. In Apple's third quarter, for instance, earnings per share fell 23% on a 14% decline in revenue. A similar trend is likely to persist in Apple's fourth quarter. This is likely why the consensus analyst estimate for Apple's fourth-quarter earnings per share is just $1.65, representing a 15.8% decline compared to earnings per share in the year-ago quarter -- and worse than the 11.7% to 7.8% decline in revenue Apple management is anticipating. 3. Gross profit margin Apple management said in the company's third-quarter update that it expected gross profit margin in the final fiscal quarter of 2015 to be between 37.5% and 38%, down from a gross profit margin of 39.9% in the year-ago quarter. Given that Apple's healthy gross profit margin is not only critical to the company's uncanny levels of profitability, but also a key sign of Apple's ability to sell its products at a premium price to a large customer base, investors should look for this important metric to at least be in line with management's expectations. 4. iPhone sales Since iPhone revenue accounts for well over half of Apple's revenue (64% in the trailing 12 months), investors might want to check in on this critical product segment. Data for chart retrieved from Apple's quarterly SEC filings in the trailing 12 months. Chart source: Author. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly where iPhone revenue will come in for Apple's fourth quarter, particularly because Apple launched its iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with several weeks before the quarter ended, and about a week earlier than it released the iPhone 6s and 6 Plus in the year-ago quarter. But iPhone's third-quarter year-over-year revenue decline of 23%, along with management's guidance for a decline in total fourth-quarter revenue, suggest investors should brace for another sharp decline in revenue for the segment. 5. Guidance Apple's revenue guidance for its first fiscal quarter of 2017 may be the most interesting area to watch when the company releases its fourth-quarter update. It will preview what Apple expects from the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales and show whether or not revenue declines could reverse in the important holiday quarter. The number against which investors will be judging revenue guidance is $75.9 billion. This is the revenue Apple reported in its first fiscal quarter of 2016. Apple's fourth-quarter results will be released on the company's investor relations portion of its website shortly after market close on Oct. 25. On the same page, investors will also be able to find a link to the Apple's live question-and-answer session with analysts to discuss the quarter's results. The live conference call is scheduled to start at 2:00 p.m. PDT. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

 Apple is removing those clunky security cables from the iPhones in its stores Paul Szoldra Oct. 14, 2016, 4:06 PM 21,127 facebook linkedin twitter email print John Moore / Getty Images Apple has been quietly removing security tethers that keep display iPhones from being stolen from its stores, which could make it a little easier for thieves to walk out with them in their pocket. Though apparently, Apple isn't all that worried about it. The company's redesigned flagship store in London is set to reopen this weekend, and when customers walk in, the phones will be without those pesky tethers chaining them to the tables. MacRumors also reported tethers have been removed from two other UK stores and one in Canada. So, why the change? Apple told CNET that the tethers get in the way of allowing customers to hold it properly, try out cases, or see how it feels inside their pocket. And it said that any phone taken out of the store would set off alarms, and if all else fails, they can be remotely bricked. Obviously, a thief has to avoid security cameras and store employees if they are trying to make off with a phone. But beyond this, it seems possible that they could just turn the phone's Airplane Mode on, which turns off Cellular voice and data, Bluetooth, and WiFi transmissions, effectively making any kind of tracking on Find my iPhone or remote wiping of it impossible. It's not clear whether Apple's display models have some other software running in the background that tracks them, Airplane mode or not. Computers and iPads are still using the security tethers.   SEE ALSO: This Silicon Valley lab is the brains behind most of the tech innovations of the last 50 years NOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen Loading video...

As Samsung scrambles to determine what caused its Note 7 smartphones to overheat and catch fire, Google, Apple, and other manufacturers are poised to benefit from the carrier's misstep. A new survey from e-commerce firm Branding Brand found that 40 percent of people who currently own a Samsung device say they won't buy another phone from the Korean electronics giant. The majority, 62 percent, plan to go with another Android phone for their next purchase, while 30 percent say they plan to switch to the iPhone and 8 percent could buy a Google Pixel. While Apple's iPhone has always been a close competitor to Samsung's flagship smartphones, the Google Pixel is a newcomer to the high-end mobile market. Announced on Oct. 4, it will be the first device to feature Google's new voice-activated personal digital Assistant, similar to Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. The phone also boasts other software improvements unavailable to any other Android device currently on the market, and Google says its camera outperforms all the smartphone shooters it's tested. //Related Articles How to Return or Exchange Your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 That 8 percent of Samsung owners are considering switching to a competing flagship device that is not even on the market yet speaks as much to the buzz that the Google Pixel has generated as the crisis that faces Samsung. On Tuesday, the company said it was killing production of the Note 7, and asked retailers not to sell their remaining inventory. According to the New York Times, Samsung in September assigned hundreds of employees to test Note 7s in hopes of determining what is causing them to explode, but none were able to replicate the problem. Samsung has since remained quiet on the progress of its efforts to determine the cause. The company has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the US, including 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Besides 70 vendors, including some great food and drink vendors, a variety of merchandise vendors and craft vendors at Railroad Park and on Green Street, there was great music going on all day long at the Railroad Park Main Stage. We had the very talented Guy Martin and Opal doing exceptional country/pop and Mike Heckathon singing and playing many favorite classic rock songs. Saturday ended with Judd Fassbender singing and playing a nice mix of alternative rock. It didn’t end there because on Sunday, the music continued with G. J. Katz, Classic Rock Tribute OMB followed by Bumpy Worthington and Friends doing a great mix of country/blues/classic rock. It certainly made an extended stay at the tables at the Main Stage incredibly enjoyable. Twelve cars arrived for the Red Car Show. It was a good beginning for this new aspect of the Apple Festival. The cars included a 2005 Chevy SSR, 1949 Mercury Sedan, 2016 GMC Canyon, 1928 Ford A-Sport Coupe, 1967 King Midget Roadster, 1960 Porche Roadster, a 1972 Chevy L.U.V, 1960 Chevy Corvair, 1997 Chevy Geo w Trailer and a 1941 Ford. Our second place winner was James W. Baker with his 1962 Ford Galaxie 500XL, and the first place winner Rachel and Hans Kahl with their 1960 Chevy Impala Convertible completed the bright and beautiful display. Congratulations to the winners and thanks to the over 550 votes we got from the public. There were more than 900 kids who went through the Kids Zone and had tons of fun on the bounce houses. Another 75 kids tried to master the apple bobbing game, which was no easy feat. They loved it anyway and were each given a free cone at McDonald's, courtesy of Bakersfield McDonald's. We had seven entries in the Pie Eating Contest. One of them, Bryce Perry, came back to defend his first-place title from last year. Amazingly, he won again this year. In second place was Zak Kauffman, who spent time looking for a pie eating contest and drove from LA to participate in ours. There was a lot of laughter and fun as seven men stuck their faces into a pie plate. On Sunday, we had a pie baking contest. Again, seven entries arrived and each brought two pies. One was for tasting and the second was to be auctioned off with the proceeds going to Veterans Collaborative Services. We had fantastic judges, Ed Grimes, our city councilman; Eugene Suksi, chief executive officer of the Tehachapi Valley Healthcare District; Norm Clendenin, Veterans Collaborative Services; and Mike Scardello, a true apple pie lover. They judged pies on appearance, crust and flavor. The winner was a young lady, India Penner, who is 17 and came to Tehachapi from Bakersfield to enter. Her presentation was exceptional. The pies she brought had a maple leaf crust and the second one had a pine leaf crust. They were not only magnificent to look at, but, apparently were delicious to eat. The first-place pie auctioned for $100 to Buddy Cummings. Second place in the pie baking contest went to Debbie Fagen and third to Barbara Nevins. We collected $380 for Veterans Collaborative Services. The Lions Club did their famous Apple Drop (numbered rubber apples, dropped from a crane) at 2:15 p.m. Sunday and many of the thousand or so people who bought the apples, plus Apple Festival participants, were there to watch it. The closest apple to the bulls eye got 50 percent of the sales. It’s great to see the crowd get so enthusiastic in anticipation of cheering on the winner. We really want to thank our sponsors including Omni Family Health, who were the presenters of The Tehachapi Apple Festival and who offered free health screenings and flu shots on Saturday. Thanks to KGET TV, McDonald's, The Loop Community Newspaper, and to Benz, the sponsor of the Kids Zone. Thank you to Andrew Pulford of Pulford Appletree Orchard for helping us with apples so that we had plenty for sale. Plus, we thank the lovely ladies of The American Legion Auxiliary for selling them. We appreciate the businesses on Green Street for allowing us to close the street and bring so many people and vendors to Tehachapi and also the businesses on Tehachapi Boulevard. We hope that those in merchandise had an increase in sales. I heard that there were lines at many of the restaurants in the immediate area of the Apple Festival. We had a premiere staff including our announcer and master of games and contests (and so much more), James Carhart. Thanks to Caitlyn Havis who helped to direct vendors and oversee Green Street while Daniel Havis was in charge of checking in, parking and overseeing the car show. Our two Rotaract staff members, Cassie and Bethany, took charge of the ballot process at the car show. Special thanks go out to The Tehachapi Valley Wrestling Club and The Tehachapi High School Wrestling Team for their incredible work at the Kids Zone and their help overall cleaning up each evening at The Apple Festival. Many people who had never been to Tehachapi before commented on how clean and nice our town is. Everyone, including the vendors, were thrilled with the beautiful weather. Hope we see everyone next year, second weekend of October. Linda Carhart is the former president of the Rotary Club of Tehachapi.

Bixby, winner of the Apple Drop's $1,000 grand prize. Lions Club 4th annual Apple Drop to benefit seniors, diabetes research BY SUZANNE WILLIAMS Contributing writer Oct 13, 2016 Lions Club members Ric and Suzanne Williams congratulate C.J. Bixby, winner of the Apple Drop's $1,000 grand prize. The Tehachapi Lions Club successfully completed its 4th annual Apple Drop on Oct. 9 during the Tehachapi Apple Festival. Due to the generosity of others, the Lions will be able to donate funds to Christmas for Seniors in Tehachapi and the Lions Diabetes Foundation. The Lions would like to thank the community of Tehachapi for its support as well as Albertson’s for allowing them to sell tickets in front of their store. For the past two years, BSE Equipment Rental played a huge part in the success of the Apple Drop by donating the use of their man lift during the event. We would also like to thank our other sponsors: The City of Tehachapi, Carlos’ Donuts, Big Papa’s Steakhouse and Saloon, and Moats and Hebebrand CPAs. The Apple Drop was made even more successful due to generous donations of gift certificates from local businesses. The following is a list of the 2016 Tehachapi Lions Club Apple Drop winners: C.J. of Tehachapi won the grand prize of $1,000, Jon of Santa Monica won $750, Flo of Tehachapi won $500, Barbara of Tehachapi won a $50 Big Papa’s gift certificate, Laurie of Tehachapi won a dinner for two at the Steam Punk Café, Chuck of Tehachapi won a $50 Kmart gift certificate, Wayne of Palmdale won a $25 Kohnen’s Bakery gift certificate, Kathryn of Tehachapi won a $25 Henry’s Café gift certificate, Rufus of Tehachapi won three large Domino’s Pizzas, Joann of Acton won a $25 gift certificate from P-Dub’s Grille and Bar, Pat of Tehachapi won a $25 Home Depot gift certificate, Tenlee from Arizona won five Sail Thru Car Washes, and Ginny of San Gabriel and Stuart of Boron both won $20 Shed or Red House BBQ gift certificates. We would also like to give a special thank you to Shaun Murray and B.J. Kingsbury for their help in dropping the apples from the raised man lift onto our target again this year. The Lions will now be preparing for their Christmas for Seniors service project. This project serves to brighten the holidays for low-income, isolated and/or home-bound seniors in our community who have no family around to share Christmas. We are looking to expand our list of seniors. If you know of a senior who fits this criteria, contact Suzanne at 822-7583. We are currently collecting sundries items for our seniors. You can find a list of needed sundries items on the Lions Facebook page and also on their website http://e-clubhouse.org/sites/tehachapi/. Donations can be dropped off at The Loop, 204 S. Green St., or at the Tehachapi Chamber of Commerce, 209 E. Tehachapi Blvd., any time through Dec. 3. The Lions are also looking for some elves to help shop for the seniors wish list items (funded through the Apple Drop) and to deliver them. Volunteers are also needed beginning Nov. 1 at the main distribution center for Christmas for Seniors of Kern County in Bakersfield located at the East Hills Mall. Call Sandy Morris in advance if you would like to volunteer at 703-8893. We are so fortunate and blessed to live in such a caring and compassionate community. If you have the heart for service and are interested in helping in our community, the Lions meet the first and third Thursday of every month at 6:30 p.m., at the Tehachapi Senior Center. Suzanne Williams is the membership chairwoman for the Tehachapi Lions Club.

A spot check of iStockNow reveals the popular model is now at least temporarily available at a number of Apple's retail locations nationwide. Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus stock as of October 14 at 11:45 a.m. Pacific Time Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus models are currently in stock at a number of Apple Stores in several states, including major cities such as Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, and San Francisco, at the time of publication. Availability varies based on carrier, color, and storage capacity. iStockNow uses Google Maps to visualize the real-time status of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability at Apple Stores in the United States and other countries, likely based on Apple's reservation system backend. Nevertheless, placing an online reservation or calling your local store ahead of time is highly recommended. Apple Stores with Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus availability will display a green marker upon setting search filters for that model. Clicking on an individual marker opens a window with an expanded model-by-model breakdown of availability, and the time that stock was last updated at that location. Jet Black iPhones have faced a global shortage as the new high-gloss finish has proven challenging to manufacture. The models suffer from a low casing production yield rate of 60-70%, meaning that 30-40% of units do not pass Apple's quality standards and must be reworked, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple says the high-gloss Jet Black finish is achieved through a precision nine-step anodization and polishing process. When pre-orders began on September 9, shipping estimates for Jet Black models quickly slipped to November, but some iPhone 7 Plus models in the new color shipped sooner than expected. Apple's current shipping estimate for Jet Black models is 6-8 weeks for both carrier-locked and newly released SIM-free models. While in-store stock is available in the U.S. at the time this article was published, supplies will likely be depleted very quickly.

Rating: 9 Votes lcseds 4 weeks ago It's been over a month and there are so few plus units to be found. But this is the new Apple. Start preorders with little to no inventory and then make your loyal customer wait 6-8 weeks. Same thing when I purchased my 6 Plus. About 7 weeks or so before I got it. They must enjoy doing this or something. I have such a hard time believing Captain Logistics (Tim) can't get product out in a timely fashion. If Jet Black is hard to manufacture, okay. Where is the rest of the 7 plus line? It really is a joke, but the joke is on the customers. In theory, people may be halfway to a iphone refresh before getting one.

I had already ordered an iPhone 7 Plus Jet Black 256gb on September 19th with estimated shipping in November. I woke up this morning, like many mornings and checked iStockNow. Nothing, as usual. Went to work, checked the MacRumors feed on Apple News around lunch time and noticed this article. Checked iStockNow and the 256 Jet Black Plus was in stock, for my carrier, at 1/4 nearby stores. Drove 45 minutes to a mall after work, checked iStockNow again when I walked in the mall; still in stock, yes! Walked into a packed, next gen Apple Store and reserved the very last 256 Jet Black Plus for my carrier. I literally saw only "1" in stock when he selected it on an iPad. Told me I got the last one, come back in 20 minutes. I walked outside of the store, checked iStockNow and there were no more available. I couldn't believe how accurate the site was. Anyway, cancelled my 9/19 order and am restoring the new phone from backup now. Cheers and thanks MacRumors! Rating: 3 Votes ghostface147 4 weeks ago I just can't do it.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple has been relatively mum on its ambitions for jumping into the virtual reality landscape. Now we know a little more why. During a recent interview with BuzzFeed, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he values human interaction more, giving AR the leg-up. “There’s no substitute for human contact,” Cook said. “And so you want the technology to encourage that. We are high on AR for the long run,” Cook said, referring to augmented reality. “I think AR can be huge.” AR is the sort of experience that Microsoft HoloLens offers. It’s also how Pokémon Go works. It allows the user to interact with the real world without stepping away from it. VR, instead, requires you to leave this world, stepping completely into another one. “Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound,” he said.”We might… have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? Things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. You want the technology to amplify it, not be a barrier.” That’s true if we’re considering conversation, but what about immersive gaming experiences? VR, in my opinion, is better suited for that. Why this matters: Apple hasn’t talked much about its plans for VR or AR, leaving its plans seemingly up in the air. As BuzzFeed points out, however, Apple acquired has a patent for a couple of head-mounted displays. That suggests definite interest in the field. Cook suggested Apple isn’t going to rush to get products on the market, however.

Mello Jr. Oct 14, 2016 10:27 AM PT Watch out, Apple. HP on Wednesday introduced a new generation of premium computer products that could generate the kind of excitement in the market that's usually the domain of the folks at One Infinite Loop. Among the new HP offerings are a new tablet-laptop convertible, a svelte laptop, an innovative all-in-one model, and a 4k display designed for dual screen setups. "HP has absolutely raised their bar in design, quality and performance," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. The new HP machines target the premium end of the PC market, he told TechNewsWorld. "The target market for these are consumers who care a lot about design and performance and are willing to pay for it," said Moorhead. "HP has been gaining premium PC market share in U.S. retail, so they must have obviously cracked the code there." Convertible and Laptop HP's convertible offering is the Spectre x360 (pictured above), which is 2 millimeters thinner than its predecessor and now weighs less than 3 pounds. It has a 13.3-inch FHD IPS display, four speakers and is offered with either an i5 or an i7 seventh-generation Intel Core processor. It supports log-in via facial recognition and has up to 15 hours of battery life. What's more, the battery can be charged 90 percent in 90 minutes via a quick-charge function. The Spectre x360, available immediately, sells for US$1,049.99. HP's laptop offering, the Envy, offers more battery life than its predecessor -- it has a runtime of up to 14 hours -- but at 14mm thick and 3.15 pounds, it's not as thin and light. It has a 13.3-inch display with a touchscreen option and an extra-wide glass touchpad. HP Envy Laptop The Envy will be available Oct. 26 priced at $849.99. All-In-One and Monitor The Envy AIO 27 is HP's all-in-one desktop unit. It has a 27-inch QHD 3.6 million-pixel display that is just 15mm thick, because all the computing and storage power resides in the monitor's base. The display supports a "low blue light" mode for improved eye comfort. The base has a sound bar with four speakers tuned by Bang & Olufsen. Other features include a webcam that pops into the display when not in use, support for sixth-generation Intel quad core i5 or i7 desktop processors, storage on a solid state drive of up to 256 gigabytes, a hard drive of up to 2 terabytes, and HDMI in and out ports. The AIO 27 sells for $1,299 and will be available this month. HP's new monitor is the 27-inch Envy 27. It supports 4K video and has a micro-edge bezel. Its RGB color accuracy exceeds 99 percent and includes a Display Port, HDMI and USB C, which can be used to charge devices. The Envy 27 will be available Dec. 4 for $499.99. Apple Dropped the Ball The new HP offerings meet an unfulfilled need in the market, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "These are premium-looking and well-configured products," he told TechNewsWorld, "and given how Apple has dropped the ball advancing the Mac, there's an opportunity on the premium side of PCs." Sinking PC shipments have spurred computer makers to intensify their efforts to impress. "It's become more incumbent upon the companies staying in the market to drive more profit from the premium end," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst with Reticle Research. "Of course, Apple has been strong in that segment of the market," he told TechNewsWorld. However, Apple is expected to pick up the ball again at the end of the month with a refresh of its Macintosh line of computers. "It's too early to tell if HP has upstaged Apple until we see what Apple comes out with next," Moorhead said. "It does set a higher bar for Apple to cross, though." Reviving PC Market PC shipments have been declining for years, although there was a small bump up in this year's second quarter. PC shipments in the United States jumped 1.4 percent compared with the same period a year ago, reported Gartner, which includes tablets in its tallies. PC shipments climbed 4.9 percent, according to IDC, which excludes tablets. Worldwide shipments fell, however -- by 5.2 percent according to Gartner, and by 4.9 percent according to IDC's analysis. HP and others hope to create some momentum in the market by introducing new premium products capable of generating the kind of excitement that could infect the whole market. "In aggregate with what Dell and Lenovo have done, HP's new line could breathe some new life into the PC market," Moorhead said. PCs Not Dead HP also is hoping the new line can prod consumers to buy a new computer. "All PC manufacturers are trying to kickstart the replacement market," said Jack E. Gold of J.Gold Associates. "Everyone says PC's are dead," he told TechNewsWorld. "PCs aren't dead. It's just that people are holding onto them for much longer than they have in the past," Gold pointed out. "Lenovo, HP, Dell -- they're all trying to find ways to bring some excitement back into the market," he said. "They're looking at new form factors and all sorts of things to get consumers to get excited and buy upgrades. It's not a bad strategy." Will the new HP offerings excite consumers enough to trade in their old PCs? "It's always a challenge to get people to spend money for tech," Gold acknowledged, "but for those users who have not been upgrading in the past, there's a lot of stuff here to really like."

Now, the Nike+ edition of the Apple Watch Series 2 will be on sale starting on October 28 (via WatchGeneration). The Nike+ edition is different from the standard Apple Watch Series 2 in three ways. First, it’s offered in four models. Two with a Space Gray case, and two with the standard aluminum casing. Secondly, it comes with a custom florelastomer band that is able to breathe and reduce weight. Third, just like the Hermès collection, the Nike+ model will be coming with custom digital and analog Watch faces. It’s also bundled with the Nike+ Run Club app, but that can be downloaded and used on any Apple Watch.

Japanese site Macotakara is reporting that Apple will declare both of these products as obsolete by the end of the month. This means Apple will no longer offer parts or repair services for either of these products. If you own a CDMA iPhone 4, you’re already out of luck as it became obsolete last month. Owners of the 3rd-generation AirPort Extreme or 2nd-generation Time Capsule will also need to act quickly as those have the same October 31 deadline. Apple typically supports products with repairs and services up to five years after the device was release. From that point, the company declares them obsolete (or ‘vintage’ in California and Turkey as consumer law states products need to be supported for up to seven years). Apple only uses the word ‘obsolete’ after seven years. The iPhone 4 going vintage does set a precedent, however. As it’s the first Apple product with a Retina display to go vintage. Apple’s entire list of vintage and obsolete products can be found here. As always, you can go to third-party retailers to find third-party parts to replace your broken or damaged parts. Tags: iPhone 4, Obsolete, Vintage About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand. You can find him on Twitter @iPeterCao.

The new redesign will slowly be making its way across the world, but starts in Apple’s London’ Regent Street. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the store is that when it opens to the public at the weekend the devices won’t be tethered to the tables as they were previously, and are in other stores around the world. Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket. While the lack of a physical security tethers, and even CCTV cameras as CNET reports, the risk of someone stealing the display devices aren’t as high as some may think. An alarm sounds when the devices leave the store (likely with some sort of geofencing), or Apple could use its own Find My iPhone service to track the devices down if they do leave the store. Regardless, CCTV cameras are probably within the stores but aren’t visible. While most will make this seem like a thief’s heaven, it’s a smart move for Apple. This way it gives the customer the flexibility to hold the devices naturally, try on cases, and overall give the store a cleaner look.

There was just one small issue with the reveal: while the rest of the watches had solid release dates, the Apple Watch Nike+ model had a rather vague “late October” launch window. It would appear that Apple and Nike have decided to get more specific, updating the Apple Watch Nike+ landing page with an actual release date. The Apple Watch Nike+ edition will be releasing on October 28. It’s arriving a little late to the party, as the other devices in Apple Watch Series 2 launched back in the middle of September. Still, better late than never for the fitness-focused Apple Watch variant, which will be launching at the same price as its Series 2 counterparts. The Nike+ edition Apple Watch will come in four different colors, all a little more vibrant than the standard Apple Watch devices. In keeping with the fitness-centric theme, it also ships with a rubberized sports band. Additionally, the watch comes with two Nike-themed watch faces which give easy access to the Nike+ Run Club app. Read More: Apple Watch Nike Plus first-impressions and hands-onOther than those features, the Nike+ model isn’t all that different from the Apple Watch Series 2 devices. It has the same internals, which includes water resistance – not waterproofing, keep in mind – at depths of up to 50m. It also comes in 38mm and 42mm varieties, just like the other Series 2 watches. So, while there isn’t much of a difference between the Nike+ version and the rest, what the Nike+ offers might be good for someone who plans to use their watch more for fitness tracking than anything else. That’s especially true if you need motivation to workout, as the Nike+ is capable of sending you workout reminders through Run Club. If you think this is the version for you, you’ll be able to grab one starting October 28. The 38mm variant will cost $369, while the larger 42mm version will set you back $399.

Best Buy's best deal is on the iPad Air 2, which is available at a $75 discount, dropping the price on the entry-level 32GB WiFi-only model from $400 to $325. The higher-capacity 128GB WiFi-only model is available for $425, down from $500. There are decent discounts on some Mac models, but now is not a good time to buy a Mac because updates are likely coming before the end of the year. The 27-inch iMac with 8GB RAM and a 1TB Fusion Drive is available for $1,899, a $100 discount. Apple is also selling two models of the MacBook Air at a $100 discount, dropping the price of the 128GB model to $900 and the 256GB model to $1,100. Deep discounts are available on some original Apple Watch models with Sport devices available at prices as low as $189 and stainless steel models available at prices as low as $249. Customers who purchase a 64GB iPhone SE on either Verizon or Sprint will pay the price for a 16GB device thanks to a $50 discount on a monthly installment plan. For AT&T customers, Best Buy is offering a $50 Best Buy gift card with the purchase of a 64GB iPhone SE. For the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Best Buy is dropping the price by up to $300 with the trade-in of an eligible smartphone. For the entry-level 32GB iPhone 7, that drops the price from $649.99 to $349.99. Trade-in value for devices varies by model and condition. Best Buy is also offering a free $100 Best Buy gift card with the purchase and activation (with a monthly installment plan) of a 256GB iPhone 7 on either Verizon or Sprint. For more discounts on Apple products, accessories, and apps, make sure to check out our full deals roundup. Related Roundup: Apple Deals Tag: Best Buy 26 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) Traverse 4 weeks ago Love my SE. I finally made it to an Apple Store today while I was waiting on a friend. I like the new matte black of the iPhone 7, but for some reason it felt huge and clumsy. It's a little ridiculous because I owned an iPhone 6 for 1.5 years, but after 4 months with my iPhone SE I feel like the 4.7" screen is awkward. Though I know I'd adjust if the iPhone 7S/8 is as revolution as the unrealistic rumors claim. ;) Rating: 7 Votes grassright 4 weeks ago trade-in now counts as a discount/price drop? Rating: 3 Votes og1 4 weeks ago Yes. If you give an iPhone 6s 128GB perfectly new you might get the $300 discount. Exactly. A 5S in excellent condition shows $87 for trade... guessing to get $300 you have to trade in a mint 6S+... nothing to see here Rating: 3 Votes asleep 4 weeks ago iPhone SE gets $50 more lovable. :cool: Rating: 2 Votes aajeevlin 4 weeks ago Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the 7. The home button felt artificial which was surprising since Force Touch has been so great on their other devices and the display model was incredibly laggy, but I don't fault the phone for that. [doublepost=1476474648][/doublepost] Depends on what you do. I heavily use the Pencil for drawing and writing. The True Tone display makes reading tremendously more pleasant in a subtle way. The speakers are finally powerful enough for casual listening as you work. So for me, it is extremely different than an iPad Air 2. I'm just having lot of little issues with the 7 that I have never experienced with the other upgrades in the past. So far I have: Service drop out including LTE and no GPS. Yesterday my speaker made a pop sound and after that I have no sound until I restarted the phone. That happened three times. I also noticed a few graphical issues. Display offset and all. Maybe I should have just stayed with the 6 or have switched to SE. Oh well, at least I'm not paying much for the new phone after trade in. I guess that's the only good news.

Mac Rumors reports on Apple’s latest good deed when it comes to Hurricane Matthew. “Apple today added a banner to its United States website, iTunes Store, and App Store asking customers to provide donations to individuals affected by the recent devastation from Hurricane Matthew. Like its usual relief efforts, all donations collected will go to the American Red Cross.” Apple has consistently donated money to many causes. [Image by Ken Ishi/Getty Images News] The article adds that the donation tiers available include ones at $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, and $200, and will be processed as normal iTunes or App Store purchases through a user’s Apple ID. Our thoughts are with all those affected by #HurricaneMatthew. Support relief efforts by donating to @RedCross at https://t.co/2b9MLALy4L — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) October 10, 2016 Many of the commenters after the article are very critical of the donations going to the Red Cross. “Except, your donations will not go directly towards the disaster, they go into a fund. And not all the money that comes in goes the that relief effort,” says Stevet. “The American Red Cross is a terrible place to give your money. Don’t give your donation to a wasteful middle man,” says MacJonny1. The bad news is, of course, that Hurricane Matthew actually happened and did substantial damage. The good news (or better news) is that the storm didn’t result in nearly as much damage and as many deaths as people thought it would. According to NBC News, the U.S. death toll from Hurricane Matthew is 19 people in four states. “At least eight people were killed in North Carolina and three were killed in South Carolina by Hurricane Matthew’s destructive forces, bringing the storm’s death toll to 19 across four Southeastern states, authorities said Sunday morning.” The article adds that hundreds of residents were rescued overnight following floods in North Carolina. There are more than two million businesses and homes still without power along the Southeastern seaboard. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory has tried to warn residents that even though the storm had been downgraded and had moved past North Carolina, it would pose dangers for days to come. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBVqONP5C-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> According to CNN, Matthew is no longer considered a hurricane, but it is still very dangerous. “Matthew, the deadly storm that’s spread misery from the Caribbean to the Carolinas, is no longer a hurricane. But even as it heads out to sea, the storm is causing serious problems for the southeastern United States,” writes columnist Doug Criss, who adds that some people in North Carolina have been rescued in dramatic helicopter operations. Some may remember that in 2012, Apple gave $2.5 million to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts and raised additional funds through iTunes. Tech Crunch was one of the sources that reported this in November of 2012. “Apple is donating $2.5 million to Hurricane Sandy relief…The lump sum donation is in addition to the company’s collection of monetary support from iTunes customers and Apple employees.” The article added that Apple iTunes donations surpassed far what was originally expected. Tim Cook frequently shared updates, noting that “Apple employees and customers all over the world have raised millions of dollars toward the relief effort so far” before adding that Apple could always do more. Apple also made an important gesture towards the LGBT community last June after the Orlando shootings at the Pulse LGBT nightclub. Tim Cook is openly gay, and one could see from the video that the event affected him personally. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNq0l_ECPI0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> No matter how much Apple has given in to marginalized groups and situations in terms of cash and vocal support, there are still some who believe Apple should do more. However, Apple has proven time and time again that their influence extends far beyond technology.

MacDailyNews Take: Of course Apple needs that information in order for iMessage to function and would of course share that very limited information with authorities when compelled to do so via court order. To us, this “news” is unsurprising and expected. When law enforcement presents us with a valid subpoena or court order, we provide the requested information if it is in our possession. Because iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, we do not have access to the contents of those communications. In some cases, we are able to provide data from server logs that are generated from customers accessing certain apps on their devices. We work closely with law enforcement to help them understand what we can provide and make clear these query logs don’t contain the contents of conversations or prove that any communication actually took place. — Apple Inc.’s statement to The Intercept Categories: News Tags: Apple, iMessage, law enforcement, legal, Messages, server logs Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

[Jon Maples] An increasing number of old school label executives are jumping ship as they move to new digital platforms.  But the question is being raised as to how smooth the transition will be and to whether established artists and their relationships with these execs will survive the move. __________________________________ By digital music industry veteran and consultant Jon Maples Old-school record executives seem to be joining new-school digital music companies in increased intensity.  In the past few years WMG’s Stephen Bryan (Soundcloud), Interscope’s Jimmy Iovine (Apple), UMG’s Amanda Marks (Apple), super-manager Troy Carter (Spotify) have all been wooed to some of the most prestigious companies.  Last week, the big kahuna Lyor Cohen, former CEO of WMG and founder of Def Jam, joined YouTube as head of music for the company. And  it isn’t some honorary title, where he deals with artist and industry relations. He’s running the whole thing! What’s going on here? Obviously these companies all know they need to beef up their ranks with people who know the ins and outs of the music business. After all, a good relationship with your content supplier is extremely important. But it’s only one factor in building a successful music company. There are other essential skills that being a good label executive doesn’t necessarily provide the appropriate experience. Lyor Cohen knows all about how to rub elbows with artists like Elvis Costello and Diana Krall, but how will that rub off on YouTube? First let’s get something straight. All these label execs are eminently talented. You don’t get to the top of  label orgs without a herculean work ethic, serious business chops, and massive brain power. But getting to that level doesn’t  necessarily mean you can run other complex companies. After all, CBS Records’ Svengali Walter Yetnikoff might have built the company into a powerhouse, but it doesn’t mean he was qualified to do Russ Solomon’s job at Tower Records. Record companies do many things; but at its core is scouting, locating, and developing talented artists. It’s a tough job we discount too often. You have to have a great understanding of art and a finely tuned ear to what people will respond to. But digital music companies have different needs: product development, technical acumen, and a keen understanding of what users will find compelling enough to open their pocketbooks. You also must know how to lead tech teams and understand how people use and adopt new products. While there obviously is some overlap between these two diverse core skills, there’s a lot that doesn’t fit. We’ve seen this manifest when companies try to move into the other’s turf. Labels time and time again have failed at direct to consumer offerings. The efforts have gotten considerably more ham fisted as technology has played a larger role in the  industry. From its inability to secure files on CD and all the way up to the ridiculous Now! subscription service that rolled out just last week, nearly every label’s tech initiative  or direct-to-consumer offering has underperformed or been an outright disaster (Pressplay, anyone?). Likewise, digital music services struggle with artist relations, leading  to wary feelings between artists and digital services, or straight-up hostility. DNA Mismatch Both labels and digital services struggle to meld because they’re so different. At their essence, labels are about artists. Everything is built around finding and developing great artists. Talent is also the core talent of most senior execs at labels. Sure, there are probably great dealmakers, technologists, and marketing whizzes working at UMG, but ultimately, it all serves the artist. Meanwhile the digital services are all about the customer. And yes, artists are vital for services, but if push comes to shove, product development, not artist development, wins. So when labels end up going directly to consumers, they’re on unfamiliar turf. Likewise, when Tim Westergren says something that sounds awfully stilted to the artist community, it’s because he’s not capable of fully serving both sides. Ultimately, he must side with his listener. You can bring in label talent to the music services to help co-mingle the two sides. But it won’t change the DNA of the company. Free Advice Look, I’m not telling you that digital music services are the model of how to build the modern company. Spotify isn’t Jack Welch’s GE or even Reed Hastings elite-level Netflix.  There’s a tendency to rely too much on technical solutions and not enough focus on customer problems, which leads to a functional–but not a very warm–product. So if I were to give advice to say, a new executive at, say, the world’s largest free music listening service, I’d suggest following a few axioms about how to build his or her new team. Empower Product Leaders Too often we end up hiring product development professionals but don’t empower them to make decisions. Product is the core of what these companies do and to fully take advantage of this, you need great product talent in leadership positions. When you don’t own the content, you have to win on product, full stop. And yeah, I’m a product guy, so I’m biased. But I’ve seen what happens when you don’t prioritize the right talent in the right roles, and it’s not pretty. Practice Design Thinking Although tech products are much better today than even five years ago, we have a long way to go in building out thoughtfully designed products. You can tell a massive difference in Spotify versus a company where design is front and center like Airbnb. If you start with design solutions, rather than technology ones, it will resonate a lot more with your users. Cool tech is just that. Cool. Solve problems first and foremost, my friends. Different Analytics For Different Goals Labels have invested in analytics teams in varying levels. Most of these  efforts– including UMG’s exceptional data analytics team and Lyor’s start-up The 300– used data to identify artists that will perform best, which is just an evolution of what labels always have done. Spotify and YouTube have both invested heavily in solutions to solve ‘what to play next.’ While YouTube’s recommendation products are good, they don’t have the sheen of Spotify’s Release Radar, Daily Mix, and Discover Weekly, perhaps the best of all the technology centric recommendations. The lesson here: using data science and machine learning to create superior user experiences is the foundation of any successful digital music product. Market Like A Retailer If there’s been one element missing from most services, it’s figuring out how to sell them to mass audiences. At its core, the pitch seems to be “Hey, you like music. Well we’ve got lots of music. Come get some!” Okay then! The services need to get better. While it’s clear that music services are differentthan retail, the attention to detail and stronger relevance to the customer’s life would help the services define a) what they are and b) who they are for. Without that kind of definition, mass consumers will continue to pass. None of this stuff is surprising. Let’s just file it under ‘doing the basics really well.’ But the labels, and the people who built their careers with them, still seem like they are steeped in another era. Digital is different, and building an elite team that can navigate this competitive market requires a different skill set. A phenomenal product team is today’s A&R. Invest wisely.

NFL NBA CFB MLB Soccer UFC NHL WWE Golf NASCAR CBB More Trending Lab Lists Video Tickets Golden St Warriors Draymond Green's Defense of Kevin Durant Reveals a Hidden NBA Truth By Erik Malinowski , Golden State Warriors Lead Writer Oct 14, 2016 Share Tweet Next ARTICLE » Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories Noah Graham/Getty Images 174.0K Reads 340 Comments Ever since Kevin Durant announced July 4 that he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors—the same Warriors who had just knocked the Thunder out of the Western Conference Finals in seven games—the criticism has been constant and unyielding. From that day more than three months ago until now, past and present players have been coming out every couple of days to tsk-tsk Durant's decision: Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard, Markieff Morris and Tracy McGrady.  One salty remark after another. The popular storyline goes that Durant basically duped the people of Oklahoma City into thinking he was going to stay and then was peer-pressured into bolting for the allure of a team on the brink of greatness. And Draymond Green reached his breaking point Thursday afternoon. A day after Paul Pierce gave a SiriusXM interview in which he expanded on his memorable July 4 tweet and said, among other things, that today's players are not "as hungry or as competitive as my generation was," Green laid into Pierce after an afternoon practice in Denver: "Nobody complain when somebody leave Apple and go to Google," Green said, per Anthony Slater of the San Jose Mercury News. "Aren't they in competition with each other? Nobody talk junk about the CEO who leaves Apple and goes to Google. As a basketball player, you are the CEO of a business. You are a business. Kevin Durant is a big business. He is the CEO of that business. So him going to play basketball for a different team, the CEO decided to leave where he was at and go somewhere else. "But there's so many guys in this league that are so stupid they don't think like that. They don't think business wise. It happens every day in the world. But in basketball it's a problem. Aren't you competitive in your day job if you work for Apple? Don't you want to outdo Google? What's the difference on the basketball court. It's your day job. You want to do what's better for you." Durant, to his credit, has been as thoughtful and forthcoming during his transition to Bay Area life as anyone in his position could be expected to be, given the pressure he's under and the narrative that quickly coalesced in the wake of his decision.  So while Durant was clearly peeved earlier this week when comments he made during a Warriors panel discussion at Stanford were taken out of context—"Man, whatever I say is going to be twisted up," he said after practice Tuesday, "so I'm only just going to say how I feel from now on"—he's largely taken everything in stride as the season quickly approaches. But it's no accident that Green was the one to finally snap. He is the emotional leader of this Warriors team, a role that has served head coach Steve Kerr and the players to great benefit over the past two seasons. When Golden State is down by 10 or 12 at the half, it's Green who makes the locker room speech. He is the star on this team who will not hesitate to self-sacrifice for the good of another. Sometimes that emotion can manifest itself in an unfortunate (and painful) way, but this is who he is. He's been like this the second he stepped on an NBA court as a second-round pick feeling a mountain-size sleight. So after months of the Warriors' new star taking one public drubbing after another, from players who had never won a title (Barkley, Miller), never had to make a similar decision (Lillard, Morris) or were themselves the beneficiary of a manufactured superteam (Pierce), it was only natural that Green would so forcefully come to Durant's defense.  Noah Graham/Getty Images Thank goodness he did, because what Green said about today's NBA should be a model for how younger players control their own destiny. After an offseason that saw many such as Lillard, Memphis' Mike Conley and Washington's Bradley Beal sign contracts worth more than what almost every Hall of Famer made in his entire playing career, it's more important than ever that players recognize the power they possess with regard to their future employment. The emotional attachment still plays a role, yes, but the business aspect is now an integral and inescapable part of how players decide their respective futures.  Green's comparison of players to tech CEOs was perhaps correct in the sense of "branding" (ugh), but a more apt example centers on the engineers who are in such high demand at these companies. It's true that workers move all the time from Apple to Google to Facebook to Amazon and sometimes back around again to a previous company, and even all of that gets more complicated as you take non-compete clauses and other conditions into account. But Green's point is valid: Hiring managers and headhunters fight like hell to bring in the best coders and programmers, promising perks and a better quality of life to people with highly specialized skills that are hard to replicate or replace—kind of like elite basketball players. The other simple reality that so many critics seem to forget? Durant, as a free agent operating within the bounds of the collective bargaining agreement, was fully within his rights to choose his next employer. Teams, in turn, must do their duty to convince him of their merits. And yet, all the ire, especially from way over yonder in OKC, seemed focused on Durant (who made an informed decision) and not in the direction of general manager Sam Presti (who has cleverly portrayed Durant's departure as some kind of fait accompli) or team owner Clay Bennett or even Russell Westbrook (who did not attend the Thunder's sit-down meeting with Durant in the Hamptons) for letting him walk. The Warriors, let's remember, brought along not just Green but Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, in addition to several team executives. Durant, ultimately, made a many-layered decision. It was personal, moving to an environment that was unfamiliar and exciting. It was professional, considering the opportunities that awaited him in a new and larger market. It was competitive, since the chances of him winning a title with Golden State are exponentially higher than with OKC. Sure, Durant could've perhaps been more gracious in saying his final goodbye to the Thunder fans who cheered and loved him for so many years. But this was not a decision he made lightly, and there's been little public defense of his thought process—only a stream of knee-jerk vitriol from a variety of agenda-driven sources. Noah Graham/Getty Images I wager that the Warriors will be an even stronger bunch in the wake of Green's comments. Kerr is a coach who wants his players to be happy, and team ownership takes pride in cultivating a workplace that fosters open communication. In the Warriors' continuing hunt to build team chemistry with Durant, this episode may serve to solidify some long-term bonds. I can only imagine what the team group chat looks like at this very moment. The bottom line is that the Dubs figure to win a whole lot of games this season. It's no coincidence that Pierce's comments came just a week after Golden State annihilated the Clippers in their preseason home opener at Oracle Arena. As the losses pile up, the comments from opposing locker rooms may only get more bitter, but the Warriors have to expect that. They've seen a barrage of such talk for months and the season hasn't even begun. And it won't stop (Golden State hopes) until at least mid-June. There may yet be future opportunities for other Warriors to come to a teammate's defense, be that Durant or someone else, but Green did his job here. Especially after the events of last June's Finals, when Green's Game 5 suspension arguably cost the Warriors their best chance at repeating as champions, he has now reaffirmed his role on this team, as their best defender, both on and off the court. He's the guy who does what others won't do and says what others won't say.  In this case, it was exactly what Durant—and the Warriors—needed to hear.          Erik Malinowski is the Golden State Warriors lead writer for B/R.

That model has a unique strap and some built-in software features for runners, but had no firm release date beyond sometime in October. A check of Apple's website shows that a release date for this version has finally been posted. It's October 28. When first announced, CNET called out this model as a particularly interesting part of the Apple Watch S2 launch, saying: "Apple also announced a partnership with Nike for a special Apple Watch Nike+ edition that is designed for runners. It features an aluminum case and a funky silicon strap that makes the watch feel like a Nike FuelBand and Apple Watch had a little baby. There are some built-in Nike running features, but for the most part it's a normal Series 2 watch. The Nike+ model will be available for $369 in October."

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is putting a lot of trust into its customers hands. The company is stopping its practice of tethering iPhones to demo desks. The Regent Street store in London is the first Apple Store with untethered iPhones. MacRumors said Apple will do the same at its store in Toronto and at another in Yorkdale. Presumably, it will begin to untether iPhones in other locations, too. The thought, it seems, is that this will give consumers a richer demo experience while testing out a new iPhone. If it’s not strapped down to anything, consumers can use the phone like it was their own. Perhaps this will encourage sales. Why this matters: Tethering prevents theft of iPhones. Now that devices aren’t locked down, it’s possible for customers to walk out with a demo unit. Apple can use remote software to disable the devices if they’re stolen. Other products, such as MacBooks and iPads, are still on lockdown, MacRumors said.

To round off Cook's business trip this week, he enjoyed a great meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and shared with the nation's leader how important Japan is to the future of Apple. Back in 2014 PM Abe announced that Apple would be building a world class R&D center in Yokohama.   Abe's top spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press briefing held earlier today that Apple's CEO confirmed that Apple would complete its construction of a site in Yokohama, just outside of Tokyo, by December and that it would be used as a development facility.   Cook further stated that there were a number of manufacturers of all sizes here being keenly eyed by Apple as having great potential for working on future devices requiring components made in Japan.   Apple's R&D site was previously used by Japan's Panasonic Corp. and their new development plans are evidence the maker of the ubiquitous iPhone has plans connected to Japan that extend well beyond just end user sales, sources close to the matter said Friday.   Cook's visit to Japan comes on the heels of a visit to Shenzhen in China, where he announced Apple's plans to open a research and development facility there next year. Apple's CEO will leave Japan tomorrow.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The bottom image is a reflection on a glass surface. (REUTERS/Albert Gea) Apple’s MacBook line is in dire need of a refresh. But the update should satisfy the Mac faithful when it finally arrives. How dire has it become? "They should have done it a long time ago,” Ryan Smith, editor in chief of tech site Anandtech, told FoxNews.com in an email, referring to the MacBook Pro line. “Most models are full price yet years out of date, and that makes buying old models bad investments for consumers,” he added.   Which is what most product review sites have been telling readers for months. Laptopmag.com is just one example: “5 Reasons You'd Be a Fool to Buy a MacBook Now,” is the headline of an article that lists reason No.1 as: “The current MacBooks are extremely outdated.” Related: Is Samsung's loss a win for Apple and Google phones? Google takes aim at Apple and Samsung with Pixel phones iPhone 7 slammed as having 'worst' battery life compared to rivals The most decrepit of the aging MacBooks is the Pro line, which hasn’t seen a major redesign in almost five years. The tardiness of the updates is not just impacting consumers. “I'm hearing of developers considering abandoning the platform because it interferes with their [development] tools,” Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, told FoxNews.com. MacBook Pro owners are particularly sensitive to performance, another area where Apple is falling behind. “A new MacBook Pro is very much needed to catch up on GPU [graphics processing unit] performance and efficiency,” Daniel Matte, an analyst at market research Canalys, told FoxNews.com. The 15-inch MacBook Pro needs a new Intel CPU chip too: it’s still saddled with an Intel processor that’s two generations behind the chipmaker’s newest “Kaby Lake” processors. When? The most pressing question is, of course, when will the new MacBooks arrive. "Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air," Rhoda Alexander, director, tablet and notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told FoxNews.com Alexander expects the new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to launch by the end of this month. That, however, doesn’t leave much time as we’re about halfway through October now. Lots of new features expected The refreshed MacBook Air line should include new USB-C connector technology (now found on the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook), according to a report from Bloomberg in August. The redesigned MacBook Pro, meanwhile, will be thinner and have a flatter keyboard, Bloomberg said. The most widely cited (and speculated) MacBook Pro feature is a new-fangled, OLED display-based "dynamic" set of function keys that shows a virtual representation of the keys based on the task the user is doing. Other likely features for the MacBook Pros are the addition of USB-C ports and Touch ID fingerprint identity sensors, possibly next to the new function key display. Also, a new rumor – deemed “questionable” by MacRumors – cites a keyboard that uses an e-ink display underneath the keys that changes dynamically to fit the needs of the user. If the technology appears at all in MacBooks or in Mac keyboards it wouldn’t happen until later, possibly 2018. Questionable rumors aside, don’t hold your breath for Intel’s latest and greatest processor in the new MacBooks. "Given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely," IHS Markit’s Alexander said, adding that it's possible that Apple opts for previous-generation Skylake chips. Canalys’ Daniel Matte adds that Apple is likely to include an option for AMD's latest "Polaris" graphics processors in the new MacBook Pros. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Google to label malicious sites as repeat offenders 2 Tech Q&A: Running a background check, avoiding cell phone contracts 3 Swedish man's eBay offer to marry anyone leaving US after Trump win is removed 4 Keeping your secrets safe on Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix 5 Facebook glitch made it appear some users had died See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple Stores begin removing security tethers from display iPhones By Christian Zibreg, Oct 14, 2016 Tweet 16 Comments Apple continues perfecting retail experience for its customers as CNET reports today that some Apple Stores have begun to remove or have already removed security tethers from iPhone display models. Last year, Apple relegated iPods to side shelves and removed iPad smart signage. According to CNET, Apple’s flagship London Regent Street store re-opening this Saturday will feature Apple’s next-generation store design and no iPhone security tethers. Apple told CNET that it wants to let customers hold display iPhones properly in their hands, try cases on them and even see how the handsets feel in their pocket. What about security, though? Wouldn’t this lax security measure encourage thieves to steal display iPhones? Well, CNET says they couldn’t spot a single CCTV camera in the store (maybe they’re not immediately visible to the naked eye?), but cautions that any iPhone taken out of the store will set off an alarm. And of course, if not returned, Apple’s Activation Lock and Find My iPhone features will render any stolen phones unusable. Apple Regent Street will re-open this Saturday after more than a year of refurbishment. The Cupertino firm yesterday previewed the store for the press and you can see the images of it in Apple Newsroom. It’s unclear if Apple will also remove iPhone security tethers from other Apple Stores, but it’s fairly safe to assume that this change will eventually roll out to all of the company-run retail stores around the world. For what it’s worth, MacRumors notes that the company over the past few months has removed security tethers from iPhone display models at its Yorkdale store in Toronto and in one of its other stores in Canada. As evidenced by the image above, iPhone display models in Apple’s store in Toronto are now docked with only Lightning charging cables rather than being tethered to the table. “MacRumors has learned of at least two other stores in the United Kingdom where the security tethers, which activate audible alarms when disconnected, have been removed, and it appears likely the change will be phased in at other locations,” says the publication, so there’s that.

Lol sell the device on craigslist Mike M. Powell “Device locked iPhone 7+ Dev / Apple Store Locked $1000” lol Tony There’s a security measure I’m sure they built into their beacon technology that is within every Apple Store. Someone tries to leave with their device, they are alerted and or the device itself changes to demo mode/locks. But for the most part it’s extremely low risk and allows people to actually “try” their devices prior to buying. Essentially the person could buy a phone, go home and buy a case online but without really knowing anything about it.. now with the try before you buy.. you can try a case and make sure it’s exactly what you want. Apple makes extra on accessories too. Riley Freeman people buy cases from apple? $50 for a case is insane Tony Yes people buy cases from Apple. Mr.Coolfreak now people will just grab iPhone from one part of store, and leave it some where else- where they might get dropped and break. and people will goto iPhone section and may not see the model they want to look at. bad idea Jamessmooth I actually think this is a good idea. They’re not just going to unteather these things without having thought of security precautions. Riley Freeman i saw this at yorkdale when i was there buying the beats solo3. I was surprised but makes sense if they have other security measures. Trying cases on is silly if you ask me. PhoneTechJay So is trying on shoes.. not. Y2J What about when someone drops it and it breaks because you know that’s gonna happen sooner or later Jack Wong Seem that in NY Soho store few weeks ago, this is very cool!!! You can put that in your pocket and see how that feel!!! I wonder if they have a security guard to monitor all the monitors for the store and all the iOS devices in a different temperature color. Or… a mini security chip inside the phone… it would alert if someone take it out of the store. Tommy I’ve had an iPhone in my pocket for the past 7 years now. I’m so cool!!! rockdude094 Microsoft has been doing this for age… but again it’s like stealing a manual car smtp25 No, do tell?

Is it possible to build the perfect laptop? This is one of the questions that ran through the mind of Mike Nash, ‎Vice President of Customer Experience and Portfolio Strategy at Hewlett-Packard. In 2015, he invited a handful of his former Microsoft coworkers to dinner at a Thai restaurant in Redmond, Washington. Nash was intent on using information from HP's customer surveys to solve as many laptop usability problems as hardware and software tweaks would allow. With the launch of Microsoft's Windows 10 on the horizon, and with Apple gaining PC market share, this was the perfect time to open the floor to an entire laptop rethink. HP had just been knocked out of the top spot (after a six-year reign) by rival Lenovo. The time for innovation had come. "We spent all of our time looking at what made a detractor a detractor," Nash said. "It was things like Wi-Fi, battery life, the touchpad, and how fast is the system. We looked over every crazy detail about how to build a better computer. We sat down and made all the hard trade-offs in hardware versus software." The conversations between Microsoft and HP started as a weekly, hour-long meeting on Friday afternoons. After a few weeks, they spanned the entirety of Friday afternoon. "After a while," Nash joked, "you couldn't tell who was working at Microsoft and who was working at HP if they were on the phone." After 14 months of dialogue, HP and Microsoft had partnered to create the HP Spectre x360, a premium convertible ultrabook that, based off its aluminum chassis, slim design, and full-size metal keyboard, was clearly designed to one-up the Apple MacBook Air. In addition to winning an Editors' Choice nomination from PCMag, the laptop was heralded by other publications as "powerful," "sexy," and "almost perfect." The Thanksgiving Dinner The conversations and subsequent partnership between HP and Microsoft proved that Apple wasn't the only laptop manufacturer that was capable of delivering style and performance. The collaboration between HP and Microsoft continues today. Of course, Microsoft's relationship with its original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) hasn't always been Thai restaurants and Editors' Choice laptops. Microsoft (the software manufacturer) and the OEMs (the hardware manufacturers) have had a turbulent, albeit fruitful relationship. In fact, less than a year after the Spectre x360 hit the market, Microsoft, in a bold and unpredictable move, unveiled its very own convertible laptop: the extraordinary Microsoft Surface Book. Also chosen for an Editors' Choice award, and the darling of the technology review industry, the Surface Book was Microsoft's first foray into laptop hardware; it was a gorgeous, long-lasting, business-ready device capable of competing with the Apple MacBook Pro. Laptop junkies loved the Surface Book, Microsoft's OEM partners didn't. "We're not happy about that," said Marius Haas, President of Enterprise Solutions at Dell, at the time in response to a question about Microsoft's decision to enter into the already-competitive space of its OEM partners. Dion Weisler, now the CEO of HP Inc., agreed. "That was a good answer," Weisler remarked. The frustration was reasonable: The OEMs were struggling to hold their ground in a market that had been contracting since its peak (from 2008 to 2012) when manufacturers had collectively sold as many as 352 million PCs in one year according to Gartner Research. By 2015, that number had decreased to 288.7 million—and Apple's influence was intensifying. Microsoft entering the field with a device as stunning as the Surface Book could only seemingly hurt Microsoft's partners. "Microsoft and our OEM partners are like your family at Thanksgiving Dinner," Peter Han, Vice President of OEM Worldwide Marketing at Microsoft, told PCMag. "But at the end of the day, we're family. We've been together for decades and we expect to be together for a lifetime. It's hard, close, honest work together, with conversation." Han and Microsoft don't buy the notion that Microsoft's entrance into laptop manufacturing will hurt its OEM partners. In fact, through extensive collaboration, a diversified portfolio, and consistent innovation, Han said he thinks a rising tide will float all (but Apple's) boats. "We know the PC market had some issues over the last number of years but we're seeing some life in it," Han said. "We're focused on the growth niches: two-in-ones, all-in-ones, and gaming…Windows has always been the big tent computing platform. We're all about openness, innovation, and diversity. We serve up computers to people of all different tastes and walks of life. There's literally thousands of OEMs who build Windows devices. We fully understand that computers are moving more into other aspects of peoples' lives—the car, the coffee shop, the airport. We're thankful for the partners that help us serve. We don't want to get locked into a narrow definition." Today, there are more than 1,500 new Microsoft- and OEM-built Windows 10 devices on the market. Some of these niche devices include the Lenovo ThinkCentre X1, an all-in-one PC that can serve as the centerpiece for any stylish office space; the HP Elite x3, a Windows smartphone that's expandable up to 2 TB and catered toward business users; the Acer Spin 7 2-in-1, the thinnest convertible on the market; and the Acer Predator 21 X, a gaming laptop that is the first laptop of any kind to boast a 21-inch curved screen. Not mentioned here are the many computing sticks, ruggedized laptops, and mobile workstations loaded with mobile device management (MDM) and malware solutions. The Next Breed Perhaps no other OEM device deserves to bear the Windows 10 flag more than the Dell XPS 13. The XPS 13 is PCMag's recommendation for high-end desktop-replacements suitable for professional photo and video work. When fully loaded, it can feature a QHD+ (3200x1800) resolution touchscreen, an Intel Core i7-6560U processor, an Intel Iris 540 graphics card, 1 TB of storage, and 16 GB of RAM. Perhaps more importantly, the Dell XPS 13 introduced the market to the "InfinityEdge" display, which enabled Dell to cram the screen size you'd typically find on a 13-inch device into an 11-inch frame. The design provides the illusion of a borderless screen that extends from corner to corner and side to side. The XPS 13 has been heralded as one of the best laptops on the market, not only by PCMag (which selected the laptop as an Editors' Choice winner) but by virtually every other technology media outlet as well. Today, Dell is working on building a convertible version of the Dell XPS 13. The tricky part about designing a convertible with an edge-to-edge display is that, when the device is used as a tablet, the edges and corners of the screen are typically the locations where users hold the device. Without some sort of tablet-mode software solution for this issue, users will accidentally click on links and buttons at the edges of the screen. This is where a partnership between Dell and Microsoft would become a collaborative, mutually beneficial effort. Dell wants its hardware to be revolutionary. Microsoft wants its Windows 10 software to enable revolutionary, diverse, and mobile experiences. How The Relationships Work Each of the OEMs with whom I spoke schedule regular calls and face-to-face meetings with Microsoft to coordinate hardware and software needs. For the typical laptop, conversations start 12-18 months prior to its launch date. These conversations range from daily phone calls between the Windows team and OEMs when major software updates are being delivered, to quarterly executive meetings during which the top five executives at Microsoft fly to the OEM's headquarters (or welcome the OEMs to Redmond). "The [laptop creation] process is years in the making," said Han. "We're working on holiday 2017 as we speak. The devices we will bring to market started on the drawing board last year in 2015." Acer, Dell, HP, and Lenovo each told PCMag they are committed to delivering the following devices and features for CES 2017 and beyond: augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and Pen support for digital inking. In other words, the experiences Apple has yet to offer on its own desktops and laptops. The OEM partnerships grew out of a need to collectively weather a steadily contracting market while fending off a formidable and ever-advancing competitor. For Microsoft and its OEMs, it's about staying one step ahead of Apple and the consumer and business markets. This means open collaboration on avant-garde design and technological innovation but even more importantly: this means a constant give-and-take between what the software is capable of doing and what the hardware needs it to do. "In the course of a long relationship, there's always a back and forth dialogue," said Han. "Life is about trade-off and choices."

He laboured on the improved camera, extra power, the better battery life and the ‘courageous’ decision to remove the headphone jack. He didn’t, however, mention that the dimensions are identical to the iPhone 6S; you can’t charge your phone while listening to music and the brand new software isn’t unique – almost everyone can download iOS 10 for their older models. ADVERTISEMENT Not to mention that the 10 new features will end up costing customers an eye-watering £1,000 for the high-end Plus model if they want to upgrade. So has Apple pushed its fans too far, or are the phones worthy of your money? WIRED Read more iPhone sales drop sees Apple's revenues fall for the first time since 2001 iPhone sales drop sees Apple's revenues fall for the first time since 2001 By Matt Burgess Design The iPhone 7 is the most similar of the two handsets to its predecessor. The dimensions are identical but the iPhone 7 is lighter than the 6S – 138g versus 143g. The iPhone 6, by comparison, is thinner and lighter than both at 6.9mm (compared to 7.1mm) and 129g. Both the iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 have 12MP rear-facing cameras but the iPhone 7's front-facing camera has been upgraded from a 5MP to a 7MP sensor. The antenna strip has been moved to the top on the iPhone 7 and, of course, the headphone jack has been removed; leaving the Lightning port, and adding stereo speakers. The speakers are a welcomed addition, borrowing from the likes of HTC, and it’s a noticeable improvement when listening to music or watching videos without headphones. The lack of a headphone jack, on the other hand, is inconvenient to say the least. Aside from Apple’s comment about the decision being ‘courageous’, the firm stresses it made the change because listening to music through the Lightning port improves the quality.

Here's how to check yours is genuine By Amelia Heathman WIRED It does, but it’s marginal. Plus, this marginal improvement doesn’t counter for the fact that you have to carry around an adapter at all times, this adapter adds a significant bulk to the headphones when plugged in, and you can’t listen to music and charge your phone at the same time. It is unlikely you’ll be wanting to do the latter that often, but that doesn’t excuse the fact. With the headphone jack removed, there is more room for a larger battery (1960mAh up from the iPhone 6S' 1715 mAh battery) – a much-needed improvement – and the taptic engine, less needed. This taptic engine means the traditional home button is replaced by a touch sensor that responds with a vibration when you press it. This takes a little getting used to, but once you’ve adjusted to it, it’s strange going back to using a button, and the taptic response is missed. A subtle shift in behaviour which Apple excels at.

It feels similar to using a PS4 or Xbox controller but its a lot more subtle and nuanced. It’s a nice touch when using certain apps, but is little more than that. WIRED Elsewhere, the iPhone 7 offers IP67 water resistance. On paper, this isn’t as resistant as Samsung’s handsets – and Apple notes it's resistant, not waterproof – but tests have shown the iPhone 7 range can hold its own when submerged, and as a result may perform better than Apple has suggested. For existing iPhone owners, this is welcomed but for non-Apple users, it’s another feature that is playing catch-up. Apple has ditched space grey for the iPhone 7 and introduced matte black and jet black. The former adds a real sophistication to the device and we were surprised how much a simple colour can add to our opinion of a handset. The latter, conversely, seems like a good idea but scratches easily and makes the phone too slippery for our clumsy hands.

Prices start at £599 for 32GB, up to £699 for 128GB and £799 for 256GB. The phones are available across Europe, America and Canada. From October 20 they will go on sale in Egypt and Israel, Korea, Colombia, Maurice, Madagascar, Maroc Uganda and Thailand on October 21, and then Senegal and Moldova on October 28. Display Apple claims the 4.7-inch display on the iPhone 7 is 25 per cent brighter than previous models and comes with a so-called P3 colour gamut which makes colours appear richer. Both claims are accurate. Photos, graphics and games look great on the display. Not quite as bright and rich as on the OnePlus 3, but a noticeable improvement on previous iPhones. The iPhone 7 has the now-standard Retina HD display giving it a PPI of 326; the same as the iPhone 6S and 6. Elsewhere, more apps are embracing Apple’s 3D Touch and this feature feels more natural once you’re used to using the pressure-sensitive sensor home button. We’ve found ourselves gradually using 3D Touch for Citymapper, for example, or when posting to Instagram. The display on the iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus are both more responsive too. 3D Touch is not a feature we love, nor do we dislike it. Our only criticism is that we quite often enable 3D Touch actions when trying to copy a link or move an app and we’re still not used to the level of pressures needed for both.

The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection, a Quad-LED True Tone flash, and wide colour capture. iPhone 7 Plus review: brilliant battery life is almost worth the money alone iPhone 7 Plus review: brilliant battery life is almost worth the money alone iPhone 18 Oct 2016 The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP, and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K. Read more The six best apps on iOS 10's Message App Store The six best apps on iOS 10's Message App Store By Matt Burgess By comparison, the iPhone 6 has an 8MP rear-facing camera, a 1.2MP on the front, both with an aperture of f/2.2 and no front flash or 4K. The photos used as examples in Apple’s demos are staggering, yet we struggled to get anywhere near that quality. Granted we’re not professional photographers but the difference was stark. Portraits are sharp and detailed, colours are vibrant but far from how vibrant they appear in real-life and the controls are still basic. Apple said it didn’t want to overwhelm users with too many controls and the majority of the upgrades are done automatically, but we were far from blown away with the quality of photos on the iPhone 7. Especially when we recently compared shots with the Google Pixel, for example, and the iPhone 7 was found to be lacking. Hardware WIRED Read more How to use iOS 10's new emoji features How to use iOS 10's new emoji features By Matt Burgess This is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8. Apple also makes bold claims that the GPU is 50 per cent more powerful and efficient than the A9 and three-times better than the A8. These claims seemingly stood up. Not once did we have issues with overheating, nor did games lag or stutter. We could switch between apps with ease and the phone was much better at handling more than one task being carried out simultaneously, including downloading apps while streaming music and playing a game. Battery life Having used an iPhone for around five years, we are used to tolerating poor battery life, charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance. Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7 and even more so the iPhone 7 Plus. We were concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal. Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than the iPhone 6S but we would go as far to say it's better than that. In testing, we could run the iPhone 7 for, on average, four hours longer than a month-old 6S. Software Apple's iPhone 7, and 7 Plus, ship with iOS 10 installed and some of this battery saving comes from having a more efficient OS. When the latest iOS was unveiled at Apple's June developer conference, the tech giant said it was one of the largest updates to its mobile operating system in its history. Aesthetically, it wasn't as drastic a change as iOS 7 was but iOS 10 does come with features Apple fans have been calling for, for years. Others bring the software more in line with Android. For example, photos, maps, and the keyboard have been improved thanks to machine learning meaning iOS 10 can now recognise faces in photos and group them together, or give more accurate typing suggestions. iOS may be restrictive in terms of tweaks that can be made and access to non-Apple software and systems but it is still the most simple operating system to use. Elsewhere, iOS 10 comes with the ability to delete Apple's default apps – meaning Stocks, iBooks, iCloud don't have to clog up space. The update also sees a redesigned Apple News and Apple Music apps, bigger emoji, and a bedtime alarm. Explore all of the new features in iOS 10. ADVERTISEMENT Verdict The iPhone 7 is a good phone with decent upgrades. Not all the upgrades feel necessary or relevant but the handset does perform where it matters – speed and battery life. The latter being a particular surprise given the iPhone's woeful battery history. If you’re an Android fan, this phone is unlikely to make you want to switch. Especially given that some of the new features and hardware are already found on rival Android devices from Samsung, OnePlus and HTC. If you’re an iPhone 6S owner, there aren’t any features that should warrant an immediate upgrade but there are a couple of tweaks that could and should tempt you. We recommend waiting until your contract is up to make the switch. The iPhone 7 is mainly aimed at people with the iPhone 6. There are enough upgrades from its earlier predecessor for you to part with your money for the latest handset, and chances are you’re coming to the end of a two-year contract anyway and the timing is right. You’ll benefit from the better cameras, 3D Touch and boost in performance without feeling like you’re swapping like-for-like.

Read more: iPhone 7 review ADVERTISEMENT Design We can almost copy and paste our views on the iPhone 7 Plus from our review of the iPhone 7. The dimensions are identical to the iPhone 6S Plus, but the iPhone 7 Plus is lighter than the 6S Plus – 188g versus 192g. The iPhone 6 Plus, by comparison, is thinner and lighter than both at 6.9mm (compared to 7.1mm) and 129g. Both the iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 7 Plus have 12MP rear-facing cameras but the iPhone 7 Plus's front-facing camera has been upgraded from a 5MP to a 7MP sensor.

Cameras We’ve previously preferred the smaller 4.7-inch iPhones; they felt like a significant size increase when we moved from the 4-inch 5S and took some getting used to. However, we’re now ready to step up again with the iPhone 7 Plus to take advantage of its extra features, namely the dual camera. The camera bump is still extremely unsightly but the photos the phone takes are great – on the whole, at least. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection, a Quad-LED True Tone flash, and wide colour capture. Read more How to use iOS 10's new emoji features How to use iOS 10's new emoji features By Matt Burgess The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP, and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation.

On the rear is a dual, 12 MP camera with apertures of f/1.8, f/2.8, optical image stabilisation, phase detection autofocus, two times optical zoom and quad-LED, dual tone. On the front is a 7MP, f/2.2, face detection and HDR. Photos in low-light are markedly better than on the iPhone 6S. The camera lens helps capture more colour, detail and light even on a grey day, and taking photos of small objects up close is a joy. Especially a close-up shot of tiramisu – perfect for showing off on Instagram. As with the camera on the iPhone 7, we couldn’t mimic some of the effects seen on Apple’s marketing photos and the action shots leave something to be desired, but generally we’re fans of this improved snapper. Battery life The camera isn’t the reason to upgrade, however. It’s a bonus compared to the handsets fantastic battery life. After two weeks with the device, we are staggered by the battery life, in a positive way. iPhone 7 review: much-needed improvements at a cost iPhone 7 review: much-needed improvements at a cost iPhone 17 Oct 2016 For years we’ve tolerated batteries that die by mid afternoon with even a small increase in use above ‘standard.’ Working in an office with poor mobile signal, causing our phone to waste charge repeatedly trying to get onto a network, and streaming Spotify for an hour or so meant we would often have to plug our iPhone 6S Plus in by around 2pm if we weren’t going straight home from work. We found ourselves carrying charging cables and power packs on days out ‘just in case’ and got ‘battery anxiety’ if it dropped into the red. Other the past two weeks, we haven’t needed to do any of these with the iPhone 7 Plus. We’ve spent days streaming music, replying to messages, playing games on the 40-minute bus rides to and from work and making calls to contacts and the phone didn’t need to be charged at all – not in addition to the daily, overnight charge which is the norm for many modern phones. On average, the phone lasts from 5.30am – when our alarm goes off – until we get into bed at around 11pm, and even then it still sits at around 30 per cent. During tests, the longest the iPhone 7 Plus lasted was from 5.30am until 1pm the following day. It’s a shame this has to applauded so much; it should really be the norm, but anyone who has ever had an iPhone will appreciate how impressive this is. ADVERTISEMENT This may be in part due to the fact the battery is new. However, our previous 6S Plus, used as a comparison, was only a month old at the time of review so the battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus was still mightily impressive. Verdict The iPhone 7 Plus does feel massive in our hands and isn’t comfortable to use one-handed, but watching videos on the larger display is great and once you’ve used the larger handset for more than a couple of days, it’s extremely difficult to drop back down to the 4.7-inch model. In fact, it makes the latter feel like a toy phone. This extra size does add a weight increase compared to the iPhone 6S and our wrists ached, and still occasionally ache, after a long period of use; around 20-30 minutes. There is enough about the iPhone 7 Plus to warrant an upgrade, even from the iPhone 6S. The extra size allows for a larger battery and this is the standout feature of this handset. We’re not sure the boost in battery is proportionate with the amount you’ll pay for the device, but couple it with the improved camera and overall sturdiness of the device and it comes increasingly close.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Tim Cook says AR will be way bigger than VR Chris Smith BGR NewsOctober 14, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Virtual reality (VR) is exploding right now. The PlayStation VR just launched for the PS4, and there are other interesting products out there, including Facebook’s Oculus, and HTC’s Vive. But Apple will have none of it, as it thinks the future is elsewhere: augmented reality (AR). DON’T MISS: Here’s how Samsung might kill the Galaxy Note brand without actually killing it The problem with VR is that it keeps users tethered to a machine, vastly limiting their options. Apple, which makes popular personal devices like iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, would rather have technology serve you without hindering your experience, or substituting real human contact. “There’s no substitute for human contact,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told BuzzFeed News in an interview. “And so you want the technology to encourage that.” “VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR,” Cook added. “Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound. We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier.” Apple is very secretive regarding its future products, but this isn’t the first time Cook has praised AR. Apple is very likely to come up with AR features for its products, particularly the iPhone. With a massive iPhone redesign set for 2017, when Apple celebrates ten years of iPhone, Apple AR might make an official debut aboard the iPhone 8. There’s nothing official to support this year, but AR could be a defining feature for next year’s iPhone. As BuzzFeed explains, the wheels are already in motion. Apple is cooking some AR products, only it’s not clear what they are. Certain acquisitions suggest Apple is working on AR, including PrimeSense (made the motion captures for the original Kinect), Metaio (German AR firm), and Faceshift (responsible for the real-time motion capture technology used in Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Furthermore, the company has patents that reveal Apple is studying AR and VR technology. Apple has also hired several engineers with experience in AR, including Yury Petrov (Facebook Oculus), Zeyu Li (Magic Leap), and Doug Bowman (Virginia Tech Cube). And while Apple won’t comment on future products, Business Insider remarked an interesting fact about Tim Cook. He likes to tease future products. Cook was talking about the potentials of the wrist a year before Apple announced the Watch. And he did say that Apple is working on AR features “behind the curtain” before this recent interview. Finally, the technology inside the iPhone 7, the second-gen Apple Watch, and the AirPods suggests that such products would be ready for AR features. These are spatially aware gadgets that could accommodate AR features. This quote, in particular, is very telling: “We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right?” Cook said. How could two people have an AR experience during an interview that could happen practically anywhere? With the help of the devices, they’d be most likely to carry: smartphones like the iPhones, wearables like the Watch, and accessories, like the AirPods.

(GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts One of the highlights of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) September iPhone event was the announcement of a new, fitness-focused Apple Watch Series 2 model made in partnership with Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE). Source: Nike The new Apple Watch Nike+ was designed to take on activity trackers and specialized athletic smartwatches, and marked the return to wearables for Nike. The big question was when the Apple Watch Nike+ would actually be available, and now we have the answer. Apple has updated the product page to show you can order one starting October 28. Nike Bounces Back from FuelBand The Nike+ FuelBand was an early entry in the fitness tracker space. The wristband was released in 2012 and connected to an iPhone or Android smartphone to track users’ activity stats. Although it quickly sold out when it was first released, the FuelBand ran into stiff competition from the likes of Fitbit Inc (NYSE:FIT). Nike closed down production in 2014. There was speculation at that time that Nike and AAPL might be able to work together for future wearables, with the new Apple Watch providing the hardware while Nike designed the software. The 10 Best Dividend Stocks for Every Retirement Portfolio That prediction turned out to be spot on. Apple Watch Nike+ The Apple Watch Nike+ is actually a stock Apple Watch Series 2. It comes with a choice of more aggressively athletic-looking Sport Bands, there are several watch faces that are exclusive to the model and it has a complication for the Nike+ Run Club app. And the Nike logo. Given the impressive health and fitness cred of the Series 2, however, the Apple Watch Nike+ makes for a compelling sports smartwatch. There is onboard GPS, a full complement of sensors, including heart rate tracking, a bright display for outdoor use and water resistance to 165 feet for swimming. Fitness trackers remain the hottest category in wearables, but the line between these devices and smartwatches continues to blur. Fitbit has begun releasing new products like the Blaze that look like a smartwatch and offer some smartwatch functionality, like notifications. Apple and other smartwatch makers — recognizing that fitness tracking is the primary reason many people buy a wearable — have been focusing on adding more health and fitness capabilities to their offerings. One company that figured this trend out early and ran with it is Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN). It’s been pushing a line of sports and fitness watches like the Vivoactive and that focus has made it the fifth largest seller of smartwatches. AAPL is already a player in the fitness smartwatch game with the Apple Watch Sport. However, the Nike logo, Nike+ software integration and aggressive styling of the Apple Watch Nike+ have a good chance of helping the company to gain more ground. It’s possible that prominent athletes with Nike endorsement deals may be soon spotted wearing the new smartwatch, which wouldn’t just be good for Nike, it would help promote the Apple Watch as well. It’s also worth noting that Nike is a very popular brand in China. Offering a new Apple Watch with the Nike Swoosh on it could well help AAPL to move more units in that country. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Tracks Everyone You Chat With The Nike partnership could also pay dividends for Apple on the fashion front. Nike has many fans who buy the brand’s clothing and accessories based purely on the looks and the logo. For this demographic, the Apple Watch Nike+ is the wearable that complements their style. The Apple Watch Nike+ goes on sale Oct. 28, with prices starting at $369. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Orin Kerr October 14 In my recent post, I noted that a lot of the recent legal developments in the field of computer crime law are about responses to encryption. I thought I would expand on the theme of what I’ll call “the law of encryption workarounds.” Here’s the idea: In the context of criminal investigations, encryption often acts as a means of blocking law enforcement access to information about suspects. It blocks that access unless the government can crack the encryption or gain access to a place where the information is available in unencrypted form. When targets use encryption to block law enforcement access to information about them, the government then looks for workarounds. In some contexts, the government looks for ways to decrypt the communications. In other contexts, the government tries to access copies of the information in unencrypted form. Several developments in computer crime law in the past year are about the legal issues prompted by encryption workarounds. In each case, suspects used encryption to hide information that the government would have been able to access, both legally and practically, if encryption had not been used. In each case, the government tried a workaround to gain access to the information despite the use of encryption. And in each case, the debate is now about the legality of the workaround. Consider three examples: 1. Apple v. FBI. The litigation known as “Apple v. FBI” was about an encryption workaround. The government had a suspect’s iPhone and had a warrant to search it. Without encryption, that would have been enough to search it. The government initially couldn’t access the phone, however, because the phone’s operator had used Apple’s operating system to encrypt its contents. The operator of the phone was dead, so the government couldn’t get him to decrypt it. Instead, the government tried to use the All Writs Act to force Apple to take steps to facilitate decrypting the phone. The legal issue concerned whether that was allowed. The case then became moot when the government paid an outside firm to decrypt the phone. 2. Fifth Amendment limits on decryption. Pending litigation in the Third Circuit about the Fifth Amendment limits of decryption provides another obvious example of an encryption workaround. Investigators have a warrant to search the defendant’s hard drives. The hard drives are encrypted, however, and the government doesn’t know the password needed to decrypt them. The government now has an order requiring the defendant to decrypt the drives, and he is fighting the order on Fifth Amendment grounds. The legal issue is whether and when the Fifth Amendment allows the defendant to be ordered to decrypt the hard drives. 3. The Playpen warrant. Litigation about the Playpen warrant can also be understood as being about encryption workarounds. Before Tor, if the government had control of a child pornography website and wanted to arrest its users, it could log the IP addresses of users and trace those IP addresses back. Tor hides those IP addresses and thwarts the use of surveillance tools that could reveal them so that the government generally can’t trace back connections through surveillance. (It’s not only encryption that does that, but it is part of the explanation.) The government’s workaround was to obtain a warrant authorizing the insertion of malware that could try to search visitor computers for the information Tor hides. Litigation over the Playpen warrant now concerns the legality of the warrant and the techniques it authorized. As we see more use of encryption, we can expect to see more attempted workarounds and more litigation over their legal limits. Some of these workarounds are widely available to law enforcement if courts approve them, while others are technologically difficult or very expensive and so are likely to be used rarely, even if courts are on board. Either way, the future landscape of digital evidence investigations is likely to be shaped in substantial part by the law of encryption workarounds. opinions volokh-conspiracy Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Comparison Smartphone/YouTube On Oct. 7, Samsung found itself facing an unpleasant result in one of the many patent lawsuits it’s a part of: A federal appellate court reinstated a jury verdict of US$119 million against Samsung in favor of Apple. In that case, Samsung was found to have infringed three Apple utility patents on how smartphones function. The first related to a smartphone’s ability to create links automatically to webpages and phone numbers, so the user need only press the link to jump to the webpage or call someone. Another covered the “slide to unlock” screen function. The third related to the phone providing autocorrect recommendations when the user was typing. Samsung’s smartphones all incorporated these features, without Apple’s permission. But not all of the patent law news was bad for Samsung. In a different chapter of the Apple v. Samsung smartphone patent saga, the U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 11 heard arguments over a $400 million verdict against Samsung for infringing several Apple iPhone design patents. Aside from the enormous amount of money at stake, this is the first time the Supreme Court has addressed design patents in more than a century. This generally sleepy area of intellectual property has awoken. And, reading the tea leaves from the oral argument, it seems that Samsung will likely win at the Supreme Court. The key to this case, as contrasted with the other loss, is that the Supreme Court case is about design patents, not utility patents. What is the difference? Utility patents, like the “slide to unlock” patent, cover new inventions that have some sort of practical use – like the proverbial “better mousetrap.” Design patents, like those at issue in the Supreme Court case, protect the “ornamental design” of an item rather than the way a product works. Understanding design patents Design patents typically cover how things look, like shoes or furniture. The three design patents at the Supreme Court cover different aspects of the appearance of smartphones: the rectangular front face with rounded corners, the surrounding rim and the colorful grid arrangement of 16 icons on the screen. None of these has any effect on how the phones work. What is fascinating – and seemingly troubling for the Supreme Court – is exactly what happens when someone infringes a design patent. A design patent holder is entitled to get the profits made by the infringer. Specifically, an infringer of a design patent must pay to the patent’s owner “the extent of his total profit” of the “article of manufacture” found to be infringing. The lower courts interpreted this to mean that Samsung should be required to pay Apple all of the profits Samsung made from selling its infringing phones, a whopping $400 million. But, is that the right outcome? Why should Apple get all of Samsung’s profits just because the phones look the same? Surely Samsung customers bought the company’s devices not only because of how they looked, but also, to some degree, because of what they can do, like making telephone calls, surfing the internet and playing “Pokemon Go.” Those functions are not at issue in this patent case. I personally think making Samsung give up all its profits is not the correct outcome, which is why I joined a brief at the Supreme Court arguing for a different outcome. Based on how the oral argument went, I’d wager the Supreme Court thinks that outcome was wrong, too. Finding useful parallels To the lay reader, the design patent statute may seem clear: The owner of the design patent gets the infringer’s profits from what it made. It may seem harsh for Samsung, but what is the problem? Here is where the lawyers step in. The question is about what constitutes the “article of manufacture” on which the patented design is applied. Is it the entire phone, or just part of it? Think about wallpaper. The primary reason a consumer wants the wallpaper is how it looks, its design. In that context, the design and the article are basically the same thing. Infringement in this context likely would require payment of the profits for selling the wallpaper. At the other extreme, think about a patented design for a cup holder used in a car. If a car company built a vehicle with that cup holder design, without permission, what should be the remedy? The lower court’s decision in this design patent case suggests the owner of the cup holder patent should get the car company’s total profits from selling the entire car. But the product being sold – on which the profits are being calculated – is much more than a cup holder: It’s a car. How much is design worth? Those two examples are extreme, easy ones. In the argument at the Supreme Court, the justices used a somewhat more complex hypothetical about the Volkswagen Beetle. The design of the Beetle is ornamental: It does not have to be shaped that way to operate as a car. The shape has nothing to do with the engine or the interior of the car. Some people may buy the Beetle because of the body design, but others may be more interested in its fuel efficiency, or the power of the engine. Would someone copying the Beetle’s shape be liable for the entire profits from selling the car? The answer isn’t entirely clear. Nor is it in the context of the the smartphone designs at the Supreme Court. All of the parties – even Apple – agree that what’s in dispute here is not the entire phone. What, then, is the appropriate article of manufacture? Most likely the Supreme Court will send the case back to the lower courts to sort that out. We legal scholars can hope the court will give some specific guidance about how to draw the line. Once the line is drawn – once the article of manufacture is identified – the courts will have to determine the second question: How much of Samsung’s profits from the phones is a result of that part of the phone? It seems likely that Samsung will not have to pay the entire $400 million original judgment. But it is also clear that this case is far from over. And of course, Apple and Samsung could settle, as they have done before in their multiyear, multicountry battle. These disputes are not even the largest problems facing Samsung at the moment. The patent cases are about hundreds of millions of dollars, but the company is reeling from having to end production of its Galaxy Note 7 on Oct. 11 because the phone’s battery had a tendency to burst into flames. That move, including recalling devices already sold, is projected to cost the company as much as $10 billion.

So if you have a story to share, no matter how big or how small, you’ll be in the running to win a big prize. Read more here. My name is Andrew Mencher. I live in Long Island, New York. I am 27 years old. Starting the new year of 2016, like new years past, my then girlfriend, now fiancé, and I decided to begin the new year fresh with a healthy attitude. This year was different, however. I was living with the love of my life, not alone, and little did she know at the time I had been planning to propose. Starting in January, with little research and only Conventional Wisdom to guide us, we began to eat less meat as a start. This failed for me, big time. I began to eat more grains and quick foods just to fill the gap in energy levels I felt. (Side note: I am lactose intolerant so cheese and milk and other delicious nutritious items that could have filled the gap is a no-go for me). I began to bloat more and feel tired and sluggish. I gave up on that after a month and began to eat animals again. After giving up on the low meat diet I was undecided on what to do and just going about my diet as I had been before. Gastroenterologically lost, but with a hope to become healthy not just for the wedding but for the life I will spend with my future wife. I was unhealthy, but not overly. I had no underlying medical issues, I was semi-active with martial arts and irregular gym visits, and I didn’t “over” indulge in desserts and junk daily. I had an interest in health but never applied it to my life. I was frequently bloated though, and I had random pains, not medically diagnosed. I am 6’3”, my heaviest weight was 265-270lbs, though at the time I began the Primal way, though I didn’t know it was “Primal” until months later, I was around 255lbs. For me it started with podcasts. I listen mainly to comedy podcasts, and Joe Rogan is included. I had not listened to his conversation with Mark yet, but I had heard him ramble consistently on the ketogenic no-low carb diet he was experimenting with. That was the seed but not the catalyst. The real catalyst was listening to Robert Kelly’s You Know What Dude podcast. He’s a comedian who struggles with weight and in late February/early March 2016 he released an episode with a host of overweight comedians. At this time Bob Kelly was trying to lose weight and was also giving the no-low carb way a try. The whole episode was an ode to food. Listening to these overweight/obese comedians talk about food resonated with me on a very deep level, and that scared the daylights out of me. The obsession/dependency on junk and the unwillingness to change because of apathy and resignation to the addiction was disturbing because I was able to relate to it so well. It was that point that I realized that I was not healthy not because of a lack of desire, or a lack of availability, but because I didn’t know what truly healthy was and never really wanted it enough to put forth an effort to change. I had/have such an emotional attachment to food stemming from childhood memories and being the basis on which I created friendships, that I looked at food (especially indulgent food) as a source of identity; I was a food-guy. After listening to that episode I swore never to be like a guest on that podcast. I also began to listen to health and exercise podcasts. I learned later my identity as the food-guy was just self-imposed. My friends, fortunately, are good friends and never really cared that I was the food-guy. They supported me and my decisions and suffered through my diatribes and monologues on the food changes I’d made. The next day I swore off added sugar and processed carbs (with one “cheat meal” a weekend). No random candies in the office or baked goods from a co-worker. No ginger ale with dinner. No rice or pasta or bread or bagels or oatmeal or any carb I could think of. The following two weeks was met with light headedness and teeth gritting “hunger” (a.k.a. sugar and salt withdrawal). I have a constant hunger craving and I had to learn be OK with being hungry sometimes (this was the second hardest part of my change). I created my own breakfast (a banana mash which is a banana mashed with hemp seed, raw cacao, and a nut butter of choice) which I mostly stuck to with the occasional scrambled eggs with bacon if I forgot my banana at home. Lunches were salads topped with grilled chicken. Dinners were a bag of frozen veggies in a steam bag and some sort of meat/fish/poultry. It wasn’t easy and I had to creatively use spices to maintain variety, but I was/am determined to stick to it. What made it easier was changing my perspective from “I can’t eat that” to “I don’t eat that.” The first two weeks I dropped 10 lbs and the weight kept sliding off. Starting in May, after my body got used to the change in diet I kept a regular gym schedule. As time went on and I did more research Mark’s name was mentioned and it stuck with me. Rogan mentioned Mark’s book during another podcast and I bought it, and I signed up for the email newsletter. This led me hours down a rabbit hole of analyzing my food intake in terms of what was and was not natural/primal and tweaking what I could. I incorporate healthy fats and mostly removed corn and legumes. Peanut Butter was a hard one to drop, mainly because alternatives are expensive. Now, at the end of September, 7 months later, I am down to 220-225 from 255ish (I try not to put too much emphasis on weight), I exercise regularly, and I feel great; no bloating or random pains. My martial arts has improved and I am definitely lighter and more energetic on my feet. I am looking forward to focusing on losing that last little bit of belly fat and toning up; optimizing my body to the best it can be. My biggest problem now is not having the budget to replace my oversized clothes. Thank goodness for belts. Others have noticed the change. My office asked me to do a reoccurring discussion with co-workers on what I did to become healthier and lose the weight. I’m disseminating what I am learning to my family, my health conscious brother has taken note. I appreciate the scientific breakdown of why Mark decides what is and is not Primal, and that he is nuanced enough to change with new evidence and studies. Primal is great because it’s a series of broad suggestions which make the most sense rather than micromanaging food. I’d call my experience being primal a success, but it’s not yet complete, and will never be. I’m still relatively new to the whole thing so I’m looking forward to the ongoing process and slow steady progress to come.

That fits the time frame given above, and the show description on You Tube says “We have Sean Donnelly, Sean Morton, Stavros Halkias and Zac Amico! A true heavyweight classic! Things get savory as we joke about food and dining rituals.

I like the “banana mash”, that is funny and has a pretty healthy profile to boot. Neat that you were able to relate to some comedians struggling with the same issues, comedians make us laugh but sometimes their comedy masks some personal pain and it’s their way of coping. 0  |     Reply   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Jen 30 days 8 hours ago Great story Andrew, congratulations on your success!

She hasn’t drunk the primal kool-aid yet, so to speak. But it’s slowly having an effect on her. As I have become more food conscious so has she.

Fantastic. Since you enjoy podcasts, I certainly hope you are listening to Mark’s podcasts. Another one I highly recommend is “Fat Burning Man” by Abel James. It is very congruent with the Paleo way.

You are still learning. And that’s what is so exciting about this lifestyle. Even when you think you have the food thing down, there are so many other areas to explore and learn about.

Nike has also built software specific to its version of the Apple Watch that allows users to take advantage of Nike+ app features right on the device. According to the Apple website, the Apple Watch Nike+ edition will be available in Canada on October 28th, 2016, starting at $489 CAD. It’s worth noting that this is a series 2 device, meaning it features a dual-core processor and swim-proof outer case resistance.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 14, 2016 at 10:18AM Image source: Apple.  Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a lot riding on its recently released iPhone 7 smartphones. The company's iPhone product category is by far its most important, and after seeing year-over-year shipment and revenue declines during the iPhone 6S cycle, the company needs the iPhone 7 to do well. Interestingly, there have been several reports claiming that Apple's iPhone 7 shipments during the second half of 2016 might actually come in lower than shipments of the iPhone 6S in the prior year. That might make it seem as though sales of the iPhone 7 are actually worse than what the iPhone 6S was able to deliver last year. However, investors need to realize that this isn't necessarily the case at all. Here's why. Apple over-shipped last time; Apple seems supply constrained this time With the iPhone 6S, Apple likely built and shipped iPhone 6S devices under the assumption that the then-new device would sell better in the marketplace than the prior generation iPhone 6. When it was clear that the end-demand wasn't there, Apple wound up cutting iPhone 6S production and reducing the number of phones that it shipped to its channel/distribution partners. That channel inventory reduction led to Apple meaningfully reducing its own iPhone 6S shipments during the first half of this year. The initial build plans around the iPhone 7 were likely informed by Apple's experience with the peak sales of iPhone 6s. It's not surprising, then, that Apple had originally planned to build fewer iPhone 7 units during the second half of 2017 relative to what it built of iPhone 6S units in the second half of 2016. Those initial build plans don't really say much about end demand. What is telling, though, is that in light of the reduced builds year over year, Apple doesn't appear to have reached supply-demand equilibrium; instead, many models -- particularly the iPhone 7 Plus models in black and jet black finishes -- are still difficult, if not impossible, to find at Apple retail stores (and shipping times on Apple's online store are very long for these models). My bet? iPhone 7 will do better than iPhone 6S Although it's too soon to say for sure, I have a suspicion that the iPhone 7 series of smartphones will do better than the iPhone 6S did when it was Apple's flagship. Not only are the new phones more competitive than their predecessors were in terms of features and component performance, but Apple also has the benefit of many of those iPhone 6 owners (and given how successful this phone was, there were likely a lot of them) potentially being in the market for upgrades. There's also the fact that Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), arguably Apple's toughest competitor, recently canned its Galaxy Note 7 line of smartphones, which would have competed with Apple's iPhone 7 Plus. Some analysts think that Samsung's stumbles here could lead to unit shipment upside for Apple, though that remains to be seen. The iPhone 7 seems like it is good enough to allow Apple to do well over the next year while the company prepares what it widely expected to be a "revolutionary" next-generation iPhone 8.

Perhaps the most interesting feature of the store is that when it opens to the public at the weekend the devices won’t be tethered to the tables as they were previously, and are in other stores around the world. Apple says this is to allow people to hold them properly, try cases on them and even see how they feel in your pocket. While CNET notes the lack of visible CCTV cameras, the risk to Apple of anyone helping themselves to the display devices is not as high as it seems. An alarm sounds if the devices leave the store (likely triggered by some kind of geofencing), and of course Apple can use Find My iPhone or some corporate equivalent to remotely lock any devices which do go walkabout. Plus I’m sure the CCTV cameras are there, visible or not. It seems a smart move, giving customers a greatly improved experience when they handle the devices, and creating a cleaner look to the display tables. It’s likely Apple will make the same change in other stores around the world. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

However, that might not be the only device on the horizon with customisable functionality. The company is rumoured to be in talks to acquire startup Sonder Design. And any partnership on that front could result in a dynamic keyboard for all Apple computers. Australian firm Sonder is backed by Foxconn, one of Apple's main manufacturing suppliers, and builds keyboards where many of the keys are clear with E Ink screens behind them. That means you can assign whatever you want for each key, be that a letter, symbol or even emoticon. New MacBook Pro (2016): What’s the story so far? MacBook Pro OLED concept photos will make you want the rumoured feature more than ever Its current concept keyboard even looks like Apple's own Bluetooth model that is already available for Mac. The Sonder version is also wireless, so can be used on iPad, Android phones and tablets, PC and other Bluetooth devices too. It is available for pre-order on Sonder's website for $199 and this rumour could, of course, simply be a way to direct people to its availability. However, considering Apple's move towards a similar concept on its next flagship laptop, it seems like a logical next step.

October 14 AAPL: 117.63 0.65 Opinion: Apple may or may not buy Sonder, but dynamic hardware keyboards are the future Ben Lovejoy - 1 month ago @benlovejoy Feature Opinion View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following speculation that Apple may be looking to acquire Sonder Keyboard, the startup yesterday confirmed to us that it has been in discussions with Apple’s procurement board. Coincidentally or not, the company’s website was not accessible at the time of writing (that may simply be yesterday’s story driving too much traffic to it, of course). Sonder was not the first company to make a keyboard with dynamically-assigned keys. Patents for the idea go back as far as the 1970s, and the first commercially-available one was the German-made LC Board in the 1980s. The Optimus Maximus was one of the better-known examples of the technology, later superseded by the Optimus Popularis, in which each key is an individual color LCD display. At $1500, it hasn’t exactly made it into the mainstream, and other examples have come and gone. But Sonder’s approach has a realistic shot at making dynamic hardware keyboards a mainstream technology … Sonder’s use of e-ink keys has two great advantages over LCD or OLED ones. First, it’s much more affordable: the keyboard is currently on pre-order at $199, which is just twice the price of Apple’s Magic Keyboard. The cost to Apple of manufacturing something similar ought to add a relatively modest amount to the cost of a MacBook. Second, while color LCD displays are power-hungry, e-ink displays barely sip from a battery. They require no power to display their content, only to change what is displayed. That’s how a Kindle manages to run for a month or more on a single charge. So the technology would be practical for Apple to adopt, and there is plenty of evidence that the company is interested in dynamic keys. It now appears certain that this year’s MacBook Pro models will have a dynamically-assigned OLED touchscreen panel in place of physical function keys, but the company’s enthusiasm for this approach of course dates back way further than this. Apple’s most successful product was built on its early adoption of dynamic keyboards. It was the headline feature of the iPhone, which differed from existing smartphones of the time by dispensing with physical keys. The argument Steve laid out then for virtual keys on a smartphone could be applied equally to a Mac keyboard. What’s wrong with their user interfaces? They all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not. And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application. Well, every application wants a slightly different user interface, a slightly optimized set of buttons, just for it. The argument for dynamic keys on a computer is perhaps a little less compelling. Typing on them is one of the primary things we do, which was never really the case with a smartphone. But AV professionals can spend hours in front of a Mac without typing anything more than the occasional filename. That’s the reason many professionals choose to use keyboard overlays or custom keyboards for power apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro. Those dedicated keyboards and overlays exist because they are huge time-savers. The ability to have your existing Mac keyboard switch instantly between overlay patterns for different apps would clearly be vastly more convenient. And that’s not the only benefit of dynamic keyboards. Hold down a modifier key like Shift or Option and the keycaps could change to display appropriate content. Multilingual users could switch between keyboard layouts and letters. Or any one of us could choose between a white-on-black or black-on-white version to suit our tastes. Plus, you know, gadgets! Now, sure, Sonder’s implementation isn’t particularly attractive. But ask any of us to name a company with a proven ability to take existing tech and make it both beautiful and usable, and we’re not going to have to think too hard. So Apple may or may not buy Sonder, but I do think that, sooner or later, it will switch to some kind of dynamic hardware keyboard tech. And in time, dumb keyboards will come to look as dated as dumb phones.

By Alistair Charlton October 14, 2016 15:12 BST Apple CEO Tim Cook thinks augmented reality will be bigger than virtual reality.Andrew Burton/Getty Images With rumours of Apple making its own car shunted to the back burner, attention has moved once again to boss Tim Cook's growing love of augmented reality. The Apple chief executive's latest thoughts on augmented reality (AR) focus on how it blends real and virtual worlds, rather than shutting the former off completely, as virtual reality (VR) does. "There's no substitute for human contact," Cook told Buzzfeed News, adding: "And so you want the technology to encourage that...Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it's profound. We might...have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here...and so I think that things like these are better when they're incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking." Cook sees AR's ability to "amplify" face-to-face conversations rather than be "a barrier" like VR. His most recent thoughts echo comments made in July, when he said Apple has been and will continue to invest "a lot" in augmented reality. "We are high on AR for the long run," Cook said. "We think there's great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. So we're investing." Virtual reality is the more popular for now, with the likes of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive at the high-end sold alongside Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR at the sub-£100 level. But Cook expects to see AR overtake because of its ability to be more socially engaging than VR, which completely covers the user's eyes with an alternate reality. Augmented reality systems, such as the Hololens partially cover the wearer's eyes, letting them see the real world around them but also elements that are computer generated. A plumber, for example, could see the pipe he is fixing in reality, alongside instructions projected virtually onto a nearby wall. In January it was reported by the Financial Times that the iPhone maker has assembled "a large team of experts in virtual reality and augmented reality and built prototype headsets that could one day rival Facebook's Oculus Rift or Microsoft's Hololens." The secret unit is claimed to include "hundreds of staffers" who have joined Apple through poaching and buying up relevant AR and VR startups.

The product of Apple's wearable collaboration with the athletic company will go on sale on October 28, according to an updated page on Apple's website. The Apple Watch Series 2 has been available since the middle of last month, but we knew the Nike+ version would be coming sometime in October. The differences between the models are few, but important: if you purchase the Nike+ edition, you'll get the special, perforated silicone band that should be more comfortable during runs and high-intensity workouts thanks to the small holes that allow air to reach your skin. You'll also get a few exclusive watch faces that use the Nike Run Club aesthetic, showing you the time and activity information in bold, neon colors. Other than that, the Series 2 Nike+ edition is the same watch as the regular Series 2—it has all the same connected features as the regular Apple Watch, and you're not limited to the Nike Run Club app to track exercises. You can download third-party apps or use Apple's Activity app to monitor workouts—and if you have a regular Series 2 watch, you can download the Nike Run Club app to track runs. You can also buy additional watch bands and use them with the Nike+ model if you don't want to limit yourself to just the perforated band. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ are open now on Apple's website, and those orders will ship in early November. You can choose from the typical 38mm ($369) or 42mm ($399) case options, and there are four color options for the band to pick from.

READ: WATCH: iPhone 7 lands in SA, here's our rapping review A chat group on the QQ instant messaging platform had grown to 1 600 people through Friday, just two weeks after it was set up, with critics saying the phones can’t receive incoming calls from mobile networks in standby mode and slamming Apple’s customer service. Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment after being informed of the social media reports. Li Dengke, who set up the QQ group, began noticing the missed calls a week after buying a silver iPhone 7 through Apple’s store on Alibaba’s Tmall.com. After the device was tested at an authorised service center, he was given a replacement. “I received the new one on October 5, a few hours later, it is ‘out of service’ again," Li said. The term “out of service” has become a hot topic on microblogging site Weibo while users have said a way to fix the problem is to shut down its fourth-generation connectivity and rely on slower 3G networks instead. Greater China is one of Apple’s biggest markets and generates more than 20% of sales at the Cupertino, California-based company. The region has driven Apple’s spectacular growth for years, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered, and the company has dozens of retail outlets on the mainland.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile TSMC Has Enjoyed Huge Earnings and Its All Thanks to iPhone 7 By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 29Shares Share Tweet Submit It’s not just Apple that has enjoyed the fairly high demand of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Thanks to the company increasing component orders, its suppliers are also enjoying a great time generating hefty amounts of revenue, especially TSMC, who is the chief supplier for Apple’s advanced FinFET nodes. TSMC Expects a Revenue Growth That Could Mount to Twice of What It Had Expected Earlier in the Year According to sources close to the matter, TSMC expects a revenue growth of between 11 and 12 percent. Earlier in the year, the semiconductor manufacturer was only looking at a revenue growth that would be in between the 5-10 percent range. In fact, the third quarter net profit jumped 28 percent from previous quarters to $3.1 billion, beating analysts’ expectation of an approximately $2.9 billion forecast for the July-September quarter. In addition, it also set a new quarterly record for the company in the net profit category, which previously sat at $2.5 billion. Industry insiders have reported that TSMC remained the primary supplier of the A10 SoC to be placed inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Samsung was not supplier like it was last year, but looking at how both manufacturers are aiming to bring the node down to 10nm FinFET, all that might change. It is also possible that TSMC’s good fortunes have been inversely related to Samsung’s ongoing Galaxy Note 7 saga, but executives at this point are still stating that it is far too early to how business is going to play out. Advertisement Shipments of iPhone 7 units are expected to reach 80 to 84 million units in the second half of this year, and while that is a healthy demand, it is still less compared to the 85-90 million tally that the iPhone 6s devices managed to garner during the second half of 2015. Now that Samsung’s has officially discontinued its Note 7, it looks like the playing ground for Apple will be free, at least for this particular quarter. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Still Using Standard Chargers – Charging Time Still Too Long Source Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Business Technology Listen up: Podcasting has finally arrived Podcasting new intimate medium If you aren’t already obsessively tuning into podcasts, you probably will be soon. TV went from live to time-shifted, and then to completely on demand by way of streaming services. Radio — the first iteration of audio — is bound to follow suit with the decade old medium of podcasting, which is finally receiving the attention the intimate medium deserves. If you aren’t already obsessively tuning into podcasts, you probably will be soon. TV went from live to time-shifted, and then to completely on demand by way of streaming services. Radio — the first iteration of audio — is bound to follow suit with the decade old medium of podcasting, which is finally receiving the attention the intimate medium deserves. By Jennifer Van GroveContact Reporter Fox Broadcasting Company A mic sits ready to record in the audio booth used by Feral Audio, the largest podcasting booth in Los Angeles, where many podcasts from the network are recorded. ( Lara Hochuli /San Diego Union-Tribune) Two women, Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, who lounge around while discussing their favorite murders each week, have changed my life. Maybe you’ve heard of them. Their unassuming podcast, “My Favorite Murder,” has dominated the comedy category of Apple’s podcasts charts for weeks, jostling with and often beating out celebrity names — cough, Joe Rogan — and other highly produced series because, well, no really knows why exactly. It might be their great rapport, their oddball dark humor or the fact that they talk about the juiciest topic of all — murder. Whatever the case, fans, who call themselves “Murderinos” and live by the show’s catchphrase (Stay sexy. Don’t get murdered.), are totally obsessed. Started in January, the show now attracts around 450,000 downloads per episode. https://twitter.com/MyFavMurder/status/771210001390051329 “I’ve never seen a podcast perform like this,” said Dustin Marshall, founder of Feral Audio, the indie podcast network behind the show. “To put that into perspective, ‘My Favorite Murder’ in March had maybe about 20,000 downloads an episode.” The ladies’ overnight success is a sign that the podcasting industry, which has been around for more than a decade, is at a turning point, one where we could finally see the medium break out from its geeky, niche roots and become something that rivals the television when it comes to audience size and advertiser spending.  “We’re at the tip of an iceberg of a major consumer trend where people are going to discover that they have great options both in quantity and quality of audio entertainment,” said Hernan Lopez, a long-time TV exec who left his job as CEO of Fox International Channels to start the podcast network Wondery, which specializes in fictional content he calls “audio drama.” In other words, if you aren’t already obsessively tuning into podcasts, you probably will be soon. That’s because a shift in audio consumption from time and channel-based to on demand is underway, mimicking what happened with video, he says. TV went from live to time-shifted, and then to completely on demand by way of streaming services. Radio — the first iteration of audio — is bound to follow suit, especially with the growing prevalence of Bluetooth-compatible car stereo systems and smartphone-powered vehicle dashboards such as Apple’s CarPlay system. Currently, an estimated 35 million people 12 and over in the U.S. listen to podcasts weekly, representing 13 percent of the total population, according to data from Edison Research, which closely monitors the industry. That may seem unimpressive but the podcasting space is double what it was five years ago, and it’s still growing, said Tom Webster, vice president of strategy and marketing at Edison Research. “One the one hand, the medium has never grown exponentially in the way online video or streaming music has,” Webster said. “It’s grown steadily and linearly.” On the other, podcasting has never been properly promoted to mainstream audiences, so the inflection point will happen when major media outfits start showing you ads for podcasts on TV, he said. It’s not happening now, but the biggest names in media are already pumping millions into podcasting — the E.W. Scripps Company just bought podcast app Stitcher in June for $4.5 million — so it’s only a matter of time. Maybe the time is now. Apple, the largest podcast platform with about two-thirds share of the market, is preparing to celebrate a huge milestone: 10 billion global podcast episode downloads and streams in a single calendar year. So, if it hasn’t happened already, your “A Ha!” moment is just around the corner.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BLZLipgg3Ou/ Karen and Georgia — who, at this point, feel like my close and equally twisted friends — have taken me down a rabbit hole of podcast curiosity. Your audio awakening may not be with a true crime show that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Perhaps it will be “Revisionist History,” the Malcolm Gladwell series that makes you reconsider what you think you know about events past and present. Maybe it will be something more familiar from the old-school radio veterans behind “This American Life.” Or it could be “Heavyweight,” a brand-new show whose host helps others dissect and settle squabbles big and small. The point is that there is quite literally something for everybody. Apple’s inventory alone includes more than 350,000 active podcasts, along with over 12 million episodes of audio content in more than 100 languages. Of course, quality varies dramatically, meaning not all shows are created equal. In recent years, a plethora of podcast networks have sprouted up to produce must-listen-to shows and court advertisers into the fold. Networks such as Gimlet Media, Feral Audio, Wondery and Panoply aim to be the NBCs, HBOs, PBSs and CNNs of this new realm; all firmly rooted in the belief that great shows will draw large audiences — and eventually, make lots of money. Already, the listener numbers are impressive. The average show on Feral’s network attracts between 10,000 and 50,000 podcast downloads an episode, Marshall said. But “My Favorite Murder,” well, that’s going to hit more than 6 million unique downloads a month alone. While not exactly comparable to the viewership for top TV shows, the numbers are approaching the more humble audience sizes of some cable TV shows. Take AMC’s “Halt and Catch Fire,” which is averaging 337,000 viewers per episode in its third season.

And advertisers are finally paying attention. “We think the (podcasting) market is a $100 million to $150 million industry right now,” said Brendan Monaghan, CEO of the podcast network Panoply, which is part of Graham Holdings Company’s The Slate Group. “Radio is a $17 billion market.” Founder of Feral Audio, Dustin Marshall, sits in front of the audio booth, where many Feral Podcasts are recorded. (Lara Hochuli/San Diego Union-Tribune) Launched in February of last year, Panoply’s aim is, in part, to realize the financial opportunities of the podcasting medium, and help others less versed in the ins and outs of the space do the same. The company partners with familiar media brands — say Rolling Stone or The Wall Street Journal — and helps with ad sales, production or tech needs. It then shares an undisclosed percentage of revenue from ads with its partners. One of Panoply’s biggest success stories is the aforementioned series, “Revisionist History,” which was No. 1 on Apple’s podcast charts for nearly 10 weeks running. The show was a collaboration between Panoply’s team and Gladwell’s team, with the famous author supplying the ideas and the podcast network assisting with production resources and ad sales. Though Monaghan declined to share specific listener and revenue figures, he did say his network’s shows secure ad rates between $25 and $100 for every 1,000 listeners. It follows, then, that a top podcast, say with half a million downloads per episode, could be making $10,000 to $50,000 per episode. Though we’re still in the “training wheels era” of podcast advertising, as Edison’s Webster characterized it, advertisers have found podcast audiences to be more captive than audiences elsewhere. “If you watch a TV ad about a product, it may change your opinion about the product. But when you have an advertiser supporting a podcast, there is an intimate relationship between the host of the podcast and the listener,” Webster said. “There’s a different twist here. It’s not so much that the audience member thinks, I should try this product. Rather, the person thinks, this company is supporting the show that I love.” This host-listener connection contributes to what’s called brand lift, or a positive shift in consumer awareness and perception. And that means the podcast industry has finally matured beyond an experimental playground for advertisers and grown into a viable medium for the kind of brand awareness campaigns typically reserved for radio and TV. Of course, that also means an onslaught of advertisers are racing to join the podcasting fray. (Maybe you’ve noticed more ads inserted before, during and after into your favorite shows?) But advertisers presence could ruin the format by overwhelming shows with bad or excessive ads, though listeners can always fast-forward through them.  If we're successful, you're not going to turn on the FM dial. — Steve Henn Perhaps, the only other major threat to the medium is the name itself. Derived from Apple’s iPod, the term “podcast” isn’t entirely approachable to the masses some say, nor is it a name that everyone agrees should represent the whole of on-demand digital audio.  Take Apple rival Amazon, which has begun to invest heavily in podcasting, albeit by avoiding the term entirely. The company, which acquired audio book app Audible for $300 million back in 2008, has upgraded Audible to include something new called, “Channels.” Channels, according to Amazon, are audio series that can be listened to on demand. In other words, they’re podcasts. “What Audible is trying to do here is get down to the atomic level and remind you that these are just shows,” Webster said. “A podcast, technically, is a mechanism of delivery. Audible is reminding you that these are shows.” Steve Henn, a veteran radio journalist who left NPR to create 60dB (pronounced “sixty dee bee”), a yet-to-launch app for listening to super-short audio clips, has also rejected the term. “We're calling it ‘stories’,” he said. “People tend to think of (a podcast) as something that is much longer than what we're aiming to do. So we’re pushing back against that.” When it launches, 60dB will provide listeners with a personalized feed of five to seven minute audio stories spanning news, sports, entertainment, science and the like. The app’s one button, car-friendly interface is, like traditional radio, intended to make listening to digital audio something you can do with little commitment. Tune in. Tune out. “I’m doing this because I think radio, the kind of radio that I made for years, is going to be distributed in different ways,” said Henn, who believes his direct competition is radio. “If we're successful, you're not going to turn on the FM dial.” Henn, who is partnered with two Netflix alums on the endeavor, might be on to something, particularly as voice-based personal assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home enter more American households and replace the radio’s role in providing brief news updates.  So maybe the name, podcast, has, in fact, been holding back the medium for years. “If you had tried to listen to a podcast 10 years ago, you found it difficult,” said Edison’s Webster. “There was an awful lot of friction. That’s not true now but maybe you still have that association.” As the industry matures, and the major players cooperate more, he suspects we'll settle on “shows.” Call it whatever you want, just give us Murderinos more Karen and Georgia and I’m sure we’ll be happy. jennifer.vangrove@sduniontribune.com (619) 293-1840 Twitter: @jbruin UPDATES: 10:59 a.m.: This article was updated with the most recent figures on episode downloads for the “My Favorite Murder” podcast.

It’s what I wanted to hear as I’m in the market for the Nike+ edition of the new watch. Apple has said that the $369 Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ will have the same design, price and hardware features as the regular edition of the smartwatch, with the exception of special fluoroelastomer bands (available in a choice of four colors) that have perforations to reduce weight and improve ventilation. Advertised as your “perfect running partner,” Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ comes preloaded with Nike’s app which enables an elevated running experience. There are also Nike-branded watch faces and complications. The Nike app has basic and advanced mode, Siri integration, running reminders every Sunday and invitations to let you know you’re falling behind your workout regime. Owners of the device will be automatically enrolled in Nike+ Run Club, giving them access to live runs around the world. Apple’s boss Tim Cook has been a director at Nike since 2005. He is the Lead Independent Director of the Board of Directors of Nike.

JohnS At least this time around it’s a cheap watch with special features. I still feel sorry for people who bought the Hermes bands because the only way to upgrade and keep those nice watch faces (which are the best in my opinion) is to buy another Hermes watch. Sadly you can’t get the band once and then get a cheaper watch the next time and reuse your band or you loose all your watch faces. At least this way it won’t be ultra expensive to keep your features if you want them. Amid Abdul Does that mean that if I preordered it, I’m going to get it on 28th of Oct? It would be important, because its a gift. LivinArealWorld Dont plan on running without your iphone. Currently the nike app does not and cannot use the watch’s gps. Out of all the running apps out, ‘Pear’ is the only one that uses the watch’s gps. (Of course apples canned workout app utilizes the gps, but you cannot export that data to anything…aka strava). Ive used pear a couple times…after struggling to get it to recognize my sweaty finger tips, Ive sadly went back to using my Garmin with the big red stop/start button. Still like the watch though…wear it for everything but running. nova voter really? that seems directly opposed to the entire idea behind the Nike plus version of the watch. LivinArealWorld I know, Right?! My only guess and hope is maybe that’s why they delayed the release of the watch… to work out the kinks of the software. But I’m an avid runner and I tried all the apps and researched all the forums. PEAR is the only app you can run and collect gps without your iPhone. I’m confident it will only he a matter of time…I’ve read forums of people calling Nike and or strava directly and there basic response is that they are working on it. But honestly for me… until I can stop my run with 1 of the side buttons I cannot use it cause it just can’t recognize a sweaty finger.

(Garett Fisbeck) Educator Rob Davis has spent his career giving students a powerful sense of history and a look into the complexities of the past. In his Yukon High School classroom, Davis introduces students to primary sources, like historical documents, eyewitness accounts and speech recordings. He teaches Oklahoma History and Native American Expressions. Reading from a textbook couldn’t be farther from Davis’ lesson plans. Through primary sources, Yukon students gain historical perspective and approach their learning like historians, diving into the time period and grasping the issues through the voices and words of tribal chiefs, early Oklahoma settlers, past governors and more. “Yes, we can read about it,” Davis said, “but it’s better to hear about it or see it.” In recent years, classroom technology has allowed those primary sources to be presented digitally, for example on iPads, in the hands of students. According to Davis, technology and digital sources push his students to a higher level of understanding. This summer, Davis shared and compared his resources and lesson plans with other history teachers in Oklahoma. Those educators combined resources and their own classroom exercises to curate the digital textbook for Oklahoma History, one of nine courses covered in the Oklahoma Library of Digital Resources. New tool Launched in August by the Oklahoma State School Boards Association (OSSBA), the library offers free digital textbooks, lectures, activities and lesson plans for high school teachers. Housed in iTunes U, the library can be accessed at okdigitalresources.com by all 584 Oklahoma school districts at no cost. OSSBA and global technology company Apple collaborated and created the library, which can be accessed on both Apple and non-Apple products. The library ensures all Oklahoma teachers have high-quality digital resources to use while teaching in their classrooms. School board association leaders think schools can maximize their students’ learning power in technology, improve engagement and shrink the digital equity gap by utilizing the library. It could also shift state dollars from textbooks to technology. Oklahoma joins six other states in collaboration with Apple’s iTunes U to offer high school content. Currently, OSSBA and a group of middle and elementary school teachers are the first in the nation to develop a digital library for courses covering grades kindergarten through eighth grade. The library is set to go live in January. Right time When school began in August, Oklahoma educators were tasked with classroom implementation of the Oklahoma Academic Standards approved by lawmakers in the spring. Months before, a group of 40 educators began aligning resources to the new state standards. As part of the OSSBA digital library project with Apple, Oklahoma’s top high school educators selected resources to match the online courses. Teachers didn’t write the curriculum, but located, vetted and curated resources and exercises for teachers to use in their classrooms. Last month, elementary and middle teachers began to curate the digital library for younger grades. “We are making Oklahoma educators’ lives hopefully better,” said Davis, who took part in creating both digital libraries. “We are finding and categorizing by state standards. Students will find [the content] useful, engaging and even entertaining.” Ann Caine, OSSBA’s director of education leadership, heads the project. A former public schools superintendent, Caine said a majority of teachers want to integrate technology into their classrooms, but switching from traditional learning can take hours of preparation. “At the end of the day, who truly has the time to vet what is high-quality and what meets the new Oklahoma Academic Standards?” she asked. “Teachers don’t have time.” The digital library’s easy-to-use format makes it accessible to everyone, even those not entirely comfortable with using technology. New direction In the past, Oklahoma City teacher Dan Covey spent hours digging for digital resources that fit his life science courses. The 13-year educator goes beyond basic Google searches and has located science simulations created by college researchers and projects posted online by the National Science Foundation. Covey sees technology in the classroom as an important asset to prepare students for the future, especially since students are already digitally fluent. Covey said he was excited to work on the middle school science course for the digital library. The concept of a digital library utilized in the classroom connected with his approach to teaching at Belle Isle Middle School, which is part of Oklahoma City Public Schools. “The resources that we are able to access you could never put into a textbook,” Covey said. “You can click to a document, which becomes interactive. If you don’t know a word, hold your finger down and look it up. You can highlight a section and search for more information. … This is interaction where kids can go off on learning tangents, very different than putting a textbook in front of them.” In use In Yukon, Davis is one of many teachers turning to iTunes U. At the swipe of a finger, Davis and his students can hear audio recordings of influential Oklahomans, like U.S. Sen. Robert S. Kerr, Wild West entertainer Gordon W. “Pawnee Bill” Lillie and civil rights activist Clara Luper. In the moments after his students listen to a powerful speech by Luper, Davis announces his assignment. He wants his students to write a reflective piece. How did they feel when they heard Luper, the face of the Oklahoma civil rights movement, describe the social injustices she experienced decades ago in the neighboring community? “My kids love it,” Davis said. “It is not the ordinary, but the extraordinary.”   Print headline: Digital shift, Digital textbooks could change learning styles in Oklahoma schools.

By: Bloomberg | Published: October 14, 2016 6:34 PM A chat group on the QQ instant messaging platform had grown to 1,600 people through Friday, just two weeks after it was set up, with critics saying the phones can’t receive incoming calls from mobile networks in standby mode and slamming Apple’s customer service. (Source: Reuters) Complaints about call connection problems with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 models are spreading across social media in China just weeks after the devices were released. A chat group on the QQ instant messaging platform had grown to 1,600 people through Friday, just two weeks after it was set up, with critics saying the phones can’t receive incoming calls from mobile networks in standby mode and slamming Apple’s customer service. Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment after being informed of the social media reports. Li Dengke, who set up the QQ group, began noticing the missed calls a week after buying a silver iPhone 7 through Apple’s store on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Tmall.com. After the device was tested at an authorized service center, he was given a replacement. “I received the new one on Oct. 5, a few hours later, it is ‘out of service’ again,” Li said. The term “out of service” has become a hot topic on microblogging site Weibo while users have said a way to fix the problem is to shut down its fourth-generation connectivity and rely on slower 3G networks instead. Greater China is one of Apple’s biggest markets and generates more than 20 percent of sales at the Cupertino, California-based company. The region has driven Apple’s spectacular growth for years, even as smartphone demand elsewhere faltered, and the company has dozens of retail outlets on the mainland.

This will let you call 911 to dispatch emergency personnel to your current location and will alert your loved ones that you’re in trouble, in extreme bouts of danger, or life-threatening emergencies, right from your wrist. Emergency SOS is smart enough to use your current location to alert the proper emergency agencies in your local area, and it even works on an international scale, not just in the United States. When to use Emergency SOS Because this feature dials 911, it should only be used in extreme emergencies; the same kind you would actually dial 911 on your phone for. Obviously, you shouldn’t use it just because your cat gets stuck in a tree or because someone illegally parked their car in front of your driveway, as these aren’t emergencies. Most agencies have a non-emergency phone number for these alternative kinds of issues. Emergency SOS is great for the following scenarios: When you’re suffering from a major allergic reaction, health problem, or life-threatening injury, When your house or place of business catches on fire When you’ve been assaulted, kidnapped, raped, or robbed Etc… the list goes on Using Emergency SOS To access Emergency SOS, all you need to do is press and hold the side button on your Apple Watch, and you’ll see a new red “SOS” slider at the bottom of the slider list. Sliding this slider initiates a 911 call and fires off text messages to your emergency contacts within seconds. At any time during the 911 call, you can press firmly on your Apple Watch screen with a Force Touch gesture to display a button to end the call. Setting up emergency contacts You are going to need to manually specify who your emergency contacts are if you want your Apple Watch to notify anyone besides 911 when you use Emergency SOS. You might want to use this to notify your parents, children, or significant other so they can help you or at least stay updated with what’s going on. They will receive a text message bundled up with your current location any time you use the feature. To set up which contacts get notified along with 911, you’ll need to go to follow these steps: 1) Launch the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and open the General cell. 2) Next up, tap on the Emergency SOS cell. 3) Once you’re in the Emergency SOS preferences pane, tap on the orange Add SOS Contact button. 4) You will now be presented with a list of your contacts. Tap on the ones you wish you notify whenever you use the Emergency SOS feature: You can add up to three emergency contacts for this cause, but keep in mind that you can only add contacts with valid phone numbers. Contacts you only have email addresses for are going to appear grayed out in this list instead of white, and cannot be selected. Setting up Auto Call Another setting you probably spotted in the Emergency SOS preferences pane above was the Auto Call feature. With this feature enabled, you don’t even have to bother with the emergency slider. You can just hold and keep holding the side button on your Apple Watch and it will automatically dial 911 and notify your emergency contacts for you. This feature may be more ideal in situations where you can’t really spend time looking at your screen to make sure you’re sliding the Emergency SOS slider, such as if your hands are tethered or if you’re trying to be discreet. A life-changing emergency contact method Honestly, when I first heard of this feature, it sounded like Apple’s version of Life Alert. And that’s no joke, because when something happens to you, and your phone is out of reach, your Apple Watch is almost always going to be strapped to your wrist and could save your life. With this feature in watchOS 3, it’s clear Apple is working hard to make its customers feel safer and help emergency services to do their jobs more efficiently. Are you happy that you can now use your Apple Watch to quickly get in touch with emergency services? Share in the comments below!

Life Alert; (Help I’ve fallen and I can’t get up”) is waaaaay outdated. Tallrandal The hold to call option reminds me of the screen shots problem. I am always taking screenshots due to me pushing side buttons accidently. However, with the screen shots I could just delete them. This on the other hand, I would have to explain every why I called by accident and potential tie up the line for someone who truly needs it. Yeah I disabled the hold to call option. Outside of that, cool idea. eilfurz same here – the “disable screenshots” -option was really necessary – everytime i bent my wrist backward, or even just hastily pressed both buttons instead of one, i made of those “very” useful screenshots. i wouldn’t dare activate the “auto call” function. Tallrandal Just the other day I tried flipping the crown to the bottom left of my left hand. It took some getting use to, but I feel better about the buttons not always getting mashed. Yeah I hated the screenshots option. Spent more time deleting them. Josh Osborne You have to hold it down for three seconds, and it makes a fairly distinctive noise (which makes it useless for “discreet” situations, like hiding in a closet from an axe murderer, but one feature can’t be all things to all people). NetMage Actually you can only add 3 SOS contacts. Robert.Walter My mom is 83, she ordered her Apple Watch the first week they were available since I told he she could use it for emergency contact. I told her eventually an SOS feature should appear but she would be able to use the phone feature in the interim. Compared to the 60$/mo cost for a Red Cross unit, it paid itself off in less than a year and she uses it for many other things (Apple Pay, calendar, maps when driving, controlling her hearing aids, etc.) So we were happy to see the wwdc presentation on SOS. One short coming is the watch doesn’t seem to respect foreign phone numbers with +41 7.. style format. After setting it up, she inadvertently tripped it by holding the button too long and it disconnected my FaceTime call and allowed her to have a chat with her local 911 dispatch. Only my sister in PA received the notice. The sister in MI did not and I in Switzerland did not either. So this is a shortcoming that needs improvement. My recommendation to everybody is call your local police on their non 911 number and tell them you would like to test your setup (so that 911 is informed in advance) and then use this dry run to confirm all works ok. Jerry Ballard It doesn’t seem to allow you to add multiple numbers for the same contact, and seems to also only allow chosing ‘home’ if the contact has home and iphone numbers. (I tried making ‘iphone’ the top number, but still no dice… only adds ‘home’ number. scott71 Wonderful. The blaring siren should be just the thing you’re looking for when trying to discreetly call 911 during a robbery/mugging/etc. Apple needs to mute that ASAP before someone gets killed.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Wallpapers of the week: golden fields Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… Recap: the top stories of the week on iDB Rushline, Feelca B&W, Delphi, and other apps to check out this weekend AT&T to throttle streaming video next year with new ‘Stream Saver’ feature   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

It told us that the price would be the same as the standard version, at $369, but didn’t tell us when it would go on sale. As French site WatchGeneration spotted, Apple has now updated its website to reveal that the Nike+ edition will go on sale on October 28. It differs from the standard Apple Watch Series 2 in three ways … Visually, the Nike+ edition offers four combinations of case color and band, including a striking Space Gray case with black/volt (neon yellow) band. The fluoroelastomer band itself also stands out from the standard sport band thanks to perforations which Apple says are there to reduce weight and improve ventilation. Finally, you get exclusive Nike watch faces in both digital and analog versions, including a complication to launch the Nike+ Run Club app. The app itself, though, runs on any Apple Watch, and is a free download from iTunes.   Guides Apple Watch View THe Guide Apple Watch Series 2 (Late 2016) Apple's first major hardware upgrade for Apple Watch.

When announced alongside the other Apple Watch Series 2 models on September 7, Apple did not divulge a specific debut besides sometime in "late October." Anyone interested can pre-order the wearable in four models starting at $369 for 38mm and $399 for 42mm. Apple's partnership with Nike aims to help runners achieve better results while wearing the Apple Watch, with an aluminum casing similar to other Sport editions and a unique perforated band that's stretchy, light, and breathable. The changes extend into the software of the Apple Watch Nike+ as well, as Nike has designed special software for the Nike+, which is designed to motivate runners to stay active. Nike+ Apple Watches include unique Nike-designed watch faces and complications for the Apple device that users will only be able to get when purchasing the special edition of the Apple Watch. At its iPhone 7 event, Apple mentioned that its wireless AirPods would see a late October launch, so it's possible the Bluetooth headphones will also launch on October 28. More anticipated is the expected debut of new MacBooks later this month, which Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed in September by reassuring fans, saying he and the company are "very committed" to the Mac line and to "stay tuned."

The Cupertino-based tech giant has an excellent chance to establish its reputation as the leading smartphone of the year with the recently unveiled iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The move to cancel the Galaxy Note 7 will bring Samsung weeks of bad news, millions of returns to process, and a massive fiscal cost to recall and eliminate the flammable phablets. The cancellation of the Galaxy Note 7 is attributed to a series of battery fires. [Image by George Frey/Getty Images] The past few weeks have seen a worldwide exchange program taking place, but the replaced units continued to overheat and blow up. The news about the Galaxy Note 7’s sale demise is not only foreseeable but also punishing for the South Korean tech giant. In the wake of Samsung’s dwindling hopes of smartphone supremacy this year, Apple is set to come in handy and save the consumer with the recently released iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The smartphone maker has quietly been gathering resources to attract disillusioned Galaxy Note 7 users ever since the launch of the new handsets. Samsung is now left with two major options – to ride out the PR storm over the next few weeks and work diligently on the upcoming Galaxy S8, which is set to release in four months’ time. This will help Samsung to establish whether it was “Samsung,” “Galaxy,” or “Note” that has been widely involved in the reputational damage. The question may not get a precise answer until the results come out from the second quarter of 2017. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] According to a report by Forbes, chances are slim that Apple will make a direct play for Galaxy Note 7 users. Apple’s staff would consider it as “punching down,” although the company can ensure that it is prepared and eager to welcome more users from the Android world. The Cupertino smartphone maker has a slew of apps to import information from an Android device and move it onto an iOS enabled device. The process is essentially smooth, and in case users choose to make a jump, Apple is holding up a parachute in the move to iOS app. It is important to note that the move to iOS app is a popular route. In 2015, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook noted via Forbes that 30 percent of iPhone buyers were coming from Android devices. As a result, three out of ten devices sold over the entire range of iPhone were conversions from Google’s alternatives. There is no direct marketing, but the bottom line is that Apple will opt to maximize the four-month window where its main competitor has no new device to offer users. It can be remembered that Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge were unveiled in February this year, which is nine months ago. Apple augmented its orders on components by 10 percent at the beginning of September, just as the problems with the Galaxy Note 7 were becoming evident – a unique coincidence. Meanwhile, Apple is not the only manufacturer that is in the game of capturing some of the millions of Note users seeking alternative devices. Google and Huawei will also hope to get that opportunity, but experts suggest that the Cupertino tech giant could grab an extra eight million device sales in 2016. In the event the numbers turn out to be true, iPhone sales for this year will be up to a level approximately equal to the sale of last year. Therefore, the decline in new iPhone sales that was experienced in Q1 2016 would change, the speed on creativity and sales would be Apple’s, and Cook could lead the company into the tenth anniversary of the iPhone with a great victory attributed to the iPhone 7.

This number rose steadily throughout September, following the September 13 release of Apple’s iOS 10, where initially 18% of US users had opted-out. The updated operating system for iPhones and iPads enforces LAT preferences more strongly by blanking out the ID for Advertisers (IDFA) when LAT is enabled. The US ratio is now also significantly higher than in Canada (14.4%), the United Kingdom (16.5%), Japan (13.6%), Ireland (12.4%), but roughly ties the Germans at 19.3%. The highest ratios worldwide are found in African countries, whereas countries in Southeast Asia and South America shows the lowest level of user opt-outs. “When we looked at it prior to iOS 10, the global estimates could range from 13% to 15%. In this study, we’ve taken a look at the trends and at individual markets,” says Paul H Müller, adjust Co-Founder and CTO (pictured top left). “This is trending in a direction where it’s not just the tech-savvy, ad-allergic crowd any more. Marketers will face a large, distributed and worst of all ‘unknown’ segment of users, especially in places like Germany and the US.” While marketers won’t be able to explicitly target users with LAT enabled, many platforms still rely on the IDFA for essential analytics. Key metrics like return on investment (ROI) or user retention can not be accurately computed if a large proportion of users are missing. In the report, adjust aggregated the number of times the tracking solution has removed user data upon request of the user. adjust’s platform analyzes anonymous network “fingerprints” to match in-app activity to ad engagement (in addition to more deterministic techniques available when users have not opted out). The data allows marketers to understand the effectiveness of different marketing initiatives. Indicators like Limit Ad Tracking are immediately aggregated and the raw, device-level data discarded – regardless if the user has LAT enabled or not. The report was built using adjust’s latest product, “Privacy Insights.” These metrics enable app marketers to understand the ratio of users that have activated LAT by specific marketing channel, country or device type, in the adjust dashboard. The anonymized sums inform marketing teams about the preferences of their users converting from different ad campaigns. With this information, marketers can pursue broader, untargeted ad campaigns toward target audiences with high LAT ratios – and still understand the return on investment, retention and engagement precisely. Christian Henschel, CEO and Co-Founder of adjust (pictured left), said: “Privacy protection is one of our major commitments, which is not always taken for granted in mobile analytics. When we entered the space in 2012, we were the first company to pursue EU-standard privacy certifications, and has now become the standard. Analytics providers and app developers need to take responsibility and respect this outspoken user preference. People are stating their choice, and we need to forge a path for app marketers.” One user of adjust’s solution is gaming company Rovio. With “Privacy Insights,” Rovio can understand how privacy-sensitive users are reached and the return on those investments, without intruding on user privacy by broadly placing advertising on sites or within apps that attract certain audiences, like certain types of games, magazines, or niche blogs. Müller added: “This is a non-intrusive measurement, where we essentially count the number of times we’ve stopped tracking a user to respect their LAT request. Individual device IDs are not stored in the adjust platform at all. This way, we can help marketers connect with audiences in a privacy-conscious and respectful way.” As marketers face a steadily growing “unknown” segment of users opting-out of targeted ads, the critical challenge will be calculating ROI and retention; however, fortunately, adjust’s “Privacy Insights” solution to mitigate and manage the impact from this growing userbase.

Here are a few tips and tricks that will help you prepare for game day this year: • Make sure you’re ready before the game by making a list of everything you need. • Also check for tailgating rules on the stadium website. • Cook and prepare ingredients before the outing so you spend less time behind the grill. • Bring a variety of beverages for the whole crowd. Hard cider makes a great refreshing alternative to beer and wine. Angry Orchard Crisp Apple tastes crisp and refreshing, like taking a bite out of a fresh apple. It is available in 12-oz. and 16-oz. cans. Another fall favorite cider style is Angry Orchard Cinnful Apple and it’s back just in time to kick off football season celebrations. Cinnful Apple features cinnamon spice notes that add hints of cocoa and a little heat, bringing a smooth and refreshing hard cider with a dry, warm finish. At your next tailgate, amp up your classic American franks and try Pepper Jack Pigs in a Blanket with Angry Orchard Dipping Sauce with a refreshing Angry Balls cocktail. Here’s how:        Pepper Jack Pigs in a Blanket with Angry Orchard Dipping Sauce     1 cup Angry Orchard Crisp Apple   1 cup apple cider vinegar 1½ cups light brown sugar   1 slice smoked bacon   3 tablespoons butter   2 small cloves of garlic   8 ounces spicy smoked Cajun sausage or kielbasa, casing removed   4 ounces Pepper Jack cheese, cut into ¼- by 1½-inch slices 16 pickled jalapeño pepper slices   1 tube refrigerated crescent roll dough   Preheat the oven to 350° F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Chop one small clove of garlic. In a small pan over medium heat, melt the butter and stir the garlic into the butter. Cut the sausage into 2-inch lengths. Split each piece of sausage lengthwise down the middle, stopping just before you cut all the way through. Hold the sausage open and stuff with 1 slice of Pepper Jack and 2 slices of jalapeño. Remove the crescent rolls from the tube and separate into triangles. Place one piece of sausage lengthwise on the wide end of each piece of dough. Fold the ends toward the center, burrito style, and roll to completely cover the sausage. Pinch the edges of the dough closed. Place on the baking sheet. Brush each roll with the garlic butter. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve warm. To prepare the dipping sauce, place cider, apple cider vinegar, brown sugar, one clove of garlic, and bacon in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce to a low simmer and reduce the mixture to ½ the original volume. Remove from the heat and discard the garlic clove and bacon slice. Cool the mixture to room temperature and serve.   Angry Balls   Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Hard Cider 1.5 oz. Fireball Whisky   In a pint glass, combine over ice 1.5 oz.

 An ex-Googler had to shut down his London startup after struggling to raise funding Sam Shead Oct. 14, 2016, 7:04 AM 10,906 facebook linkedin twitter email print Sup cofounder and CEO Rich Pleeth (left) and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak (right). Virgin Sup, a London startup that helped you connect with friends when they are close by, has shut down after struggling to raise fresh capital. Sup's app showed people which friends were within a 5, 15 or 25 minute walk. People could send them a "Sup" to let them know they were nearby and that they wanted to hang out. It was supported by Virgin billionaire Richard Branson and described by Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak as an app that he just "had to download". But there was a big problem: it never made any money. The company, founded by former Googler Rich Pleeth, attracted over 80,000 users since launching last March but it failed to achieve the growth it needed. It is currently going through the administration process with Companies House as a result and Sup's eight employees have all been let go. "We saw growth but we didn’t see the hockey stick growth that we needed to see to actually make it a viable billion dollar business and that’s what our investors wanted to see," Pleeth told Business Insider on Thursday. "We were getting 300 downloads a day but it just wasn’t becoming this massive movement and people weren’t coming back to the app. "As a founder you have to live with the highs and you have to live with the lows," said Pleeth. "And there’s a lot of lows if you don’t succeed. "We had a team of eight and we’ve let everyone go so we’ve got no one working on Sup anymore. They all went two weeks ago. We gave them a bonus and we said thank you very much and we’re going keep in touch with them. Some of them are like 'next project, let us know.'" Sup Branson's Virgin Media Business chose Sup as one of the hottest social apps in the UK in its "Voom" awards, while Sup also fared well in The Talent Unleashed Awards, which were judged by Branson and Wozniak. Pleeth, who was flown out on an all-expenses-paid trip to Sydney, Australia, for the global finals, was invited to enter The Talent Unleashed Awards by "someone who works there" and Sup went on to be crowned an EU finalist in the "Best Startup - Tech Innovation" category. Off the back of the event, Branson's Virgin Media Business provided Sup with the following statement: "This could solve a problem for many. However, I would want to make sure that this does not cause an issue with privacy and with sending to people that they might not know that well or not know at all." Meanwhile, Wozniak, a judge at the awards, said: "I actually had to download this app. It works with Facebook and I'm worried that users may not want to blast their presence to a lot of 'friends' they don't really know. I fly a lot, like 100 cities a year, and wish for this in every city. I often forget which friends I have where." Investors, including the founders of the Innocent drinks brand, Richard Reed and Jon Wright, and Alex Chesterman, the founder and CEO of Zoopla, a property website valued at $1.35 billion (£1.11 billion), backed the Sup app with £649,000. "They did know coming on that this was obviously hugely risky," said Pleeth. "But still I felt terrible for this. I take full responsibility for it." The majority of the investor's money went on hiring people, according to Pleeth. "Hiring great developers in London is expensive," he said. Other costs included marketing, rent, and other "expenses." In terms of marketing, Sup spent roughly £14,000 from July to September as it made one final push to boost its user numbers. That money went on parties, influencer marketing, sponsorship, student brand ambassadors, stickers, and flyers, among other things, said Pleeth, who worked in marketing at Google for just over three years before joining Gett, a billion dollar taxi app that competes with Uber, as their chief marketing officer. Sup is the UK's hottest startup and in the Virgin VOOM pitch. Help us and vote. #voom #branson @richardbranson https://t.co/2dmMUJAUbq — Rich Pleeth (@Richpleeth) April 5, 2016 The company paid YouTube star Jakeboys "several thousand pound" for mentioning Sup's app in a Snapchat video and it used a team of people to paint approximately 80 Sup logos onto the streets of Shoreditch — a move that was condemned by Hackney Council. Business Insider/Sam Shead "All of our investors were great," said Pleeth. "I’ve spoken to every single one of them personally. It’s a very difficult phone call but I feel much worse for them because I have to tell them that unfortunately we’ve lost your money." Those investors that backed through the government's Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Enterprise Investment Scheme will get some of their money back, Pleeth said. Fighting for survival Sup was reluctant to admit defeat and Pleeth made a last ditch attempt to raise more money over the last few months to keep the company alive and secure the hockey stick growth he'd been chasing. "Up until the last week, when I was just like 'this can’t go on,' we were out fundraising. I was out spending money on investors at dinners to try and get them to invest. It’s really tough. A startup is like your baby and it’s like your girlfriend. You put everything into it. For the last year and a half I’ve put everything I have into Sup. It’s very sad. You have to have a bit of a mourning period where you’re saying that. In the UK a failure is not viewed as a very positive thing." Pleeth said that Brexit hindered his ability to secure more money from investors but he stressed that it would be wrong to blame the company's failure on this. "We were talking to a German fund and two other individuals in the UK [before Brexit]," he said. "We were having very good conversations and were like next week, after Brexit, we’ll be fine because the pound will go back up. After Brexit happened they were just too nervous about what’s happening. [They were saying] It’s not that we aren’t going to invest in startups it’s just that there’s too much volatility in the market." Pleeth said he expects to announce a new venture in the coming months. "Next business I would definitely focus on revenue," he said.

The move allows fans who already have an existing contract to pick up the Cupertino company’s newest handsets without committing to a new plan. Some customers in other countries have been able to purchase the iPhone 7 series SIM-free since day one, but in the U.S., Apple makes us wait a little longer for unlocked models. Fortunately, the wait is now over… kind of. SIM-free versions of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in all colors and storage capacities can now be ordered from the Apple Online Store. Prices start at $649 for a 32GB iPhone 7, and $769 for a 32GB iPhone 7 Plus. Don’t assume this means Apple has caught up with iPhone 7 demand, though. There’s still a lengthy wait for most models in all colors; those hoping to get a jet black iPhone 7 Plus — one of the most popular options this year — won’t see it ship for up to 8 weeks. When you buy the iPhone SIM-free, you have the option to use it with almost any carrier — not only in the U.S., but in other countries, too. Simply pop in your existing nano SIM when it arrives and you’re good to go.

(TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, revised its forecast upward for full-year revenue growth based on stronger-than-expected sales of Apple's new iPhone 7 series and healthy demand for smartphones in China and other emerging markets.   The Nikkei report further noted that "For 2016, TSMC said its revenue would grow 11% to 12% in New Taiwan dollar terms from a year ago, up from the previous estimate of 5% to 10%.   "High-end smartphone demand is better than we previously expected," said Co-Chief Executive Mark Liu. "For the fourth quarter, we think the demand for high-end smartphones will continue to improve and we expect the year-end inventory correction will be relatively mild."   By high-end smartphones, Liu was referring to Apple's new iPhone 7 range. Apple is TSMC's No.1 customer by revenue and the Taiwanese tech giant enjoys a monopoly over iPhone 7 and iPhone 7-plus chips."   One analyst stated that sales could even be stronger because of Samsung's Note7 misfire but thought it was too early to speculate how much higher that would translate to.   In the end, TSMC has the exclusive iPhone 7 chip contract. On that basis alone they become the best source of sales accuracy for the iPhone 7. If they're experiencing better-than-expected iPhone 7 chip sales, then it's something that you could take the bank that sales are strong.  About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

This means that Apple will, with a a couple of exceptions, no longer offer parts or repair services for these products. You’re already out of luck for the CDMA version of the iPhone 4, which lost support last month, along with three Macs. The 3rd-generation AirPort Extreme and 2nd-generation Time Capsule will reportedly meet the same fate on October 31 … Apple supports products with parts and repairs for five years after production ceases, at which point the company declares them obsolete – or technically ‘vintage,’ as consumer law in California and Turkey insists the company must continue to offer support for seven years. Apple only actually uses the word ‘obsolete’ at the seven-year mark. The notice Macotakara has seen is for Japan, but these status changes apply worldwide. The iPhone 4 marks a milestone of sorts, as the first device with a Retina display to reach vintage status. You can check out the full list of vintage and obsolete products over at Apple’s support site. You may of course still be able to find older products on eBay and elsewhere, either to replace broken ones or to serve as sources of parts.

Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Tech-Recipes: A Cookbook Full of Tech Tutorials Contact Us About Us Advertise Android Apple Windows Internet Database Programming Apps How to Get More Sleep Using Bedtime for iPhone Posted October 14, 2016 by Leomar Umpad in Apple iPhone, Apps Apple has introduced some useful features and updates with iOS 10. Some changes in Apple’s latest OS are hard to ignore. An overhaul of the messaging app now offers a more entertaining and eye-catching inbox which allows users to send messages with effects and to play games right in the conversation. Some features, however, are not that obvious and are buried deep in Settings and other apps. One such feature is Bedtime. Bedtime lets you manage your both your bedtime and wake-up times by reminding you when it’s time to go to bed and when it’s time to wake up. This tutorial explains how to manage your sleep using Bedtime for iPhone. Apple believes that going to bed and waking up at the same times every day promotes healthy sleep. Stanford University also thinks that getting up at the same time every day is important for your body clock. If you agree with both Apple and Stanford University, then getting free help to accomplish this from your iPhone should be good news. How to Enable Bedtime for iOS 10 A useful feature such as Bedtime is worthy of an app of its own. Apple thinks otherwise and thought it best to include the feature in one of iPhone’s most useful apps: the Clock app. To enable Bedtime on your iPhone, follow these steps: 1.Unlock your device, and go to your iPhone’s Home screen. 2.From the Home screen, open your Clock app. 3.From the Clock app, tap on the Bedtime tab, located on the lower part of the screen. 4.A short introduction of Bedtime will be displayed. Tap on Get Started to proceed to the next page. 5.Select your preferred wake-up time. Scroll up or down on the hour and minute indicator to adjust your wake up time. 6.Select the days of the week when you want to have an alarm. Tap on the days of the week. An orange letter means that the alarm is activated for that week, while gray icon means that the alarm is disabled on that certain date. 7.Choose your preferred number of sleep hours. Most adults sleep at an average of seven to eight hours. 8.Choose when would you like to be reminded to go to sleep. Tap on the selection. 9.Choose the music that you want to hear when you wake up. Tap on the selection. 10.An information page will be displayed telling you to keep your “Sleep History bars” by sleeping and waking up at the same times every day. Swipe to the left once you are done reading. 11.You have enabled Bedtime for the first time. You are done. How to Manage and Edit Bedtime Settings on iPhone You can edit and manage the Bedtime settings on your iPhone by following these steps: 1.From your Home screen, open your Clock app. 2.From the Clock app, tap on the Bedtime tab, located on the lower part of the screen. 3.Enable or disable Bedtime by toggling the switch. A green switch indicates that the feature is enabled. 4.Tap on the Options button in the upper-left corner of the screen to change the days of the week when the feature is enabled or disabled, the Bedtime reminder time, the Wake Up Sound, and the sound volume. 5.Tap on the days of the week to enable or disable Bedtime alarm for that day. Bedtime is enabled for those days on the color orange. The feature is disabled on days that are on color gray. 6.Tap on Bedtime Reminder option to select the time when you will be reminded to go to sleep. Reminders range are in 15-minute intervals from one hour to the actual bedtime. Tap on your preferred reminder time. 7.Tap on the Wake Up Sound option to select the type of music that will be played during the alarm. You can also opt to have the phone vibrate. 8.Change the sound volume by scrolling through the different volume levels. 9.Tap on Done once you have finished making the adjustments to the Options page. 10.Tap, hold, and drag the Bell icon to change your wake up time. 11.Tap, hold, and drag the Moon icon to change your sleep time. 12.You are done.

Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY LATEST NEWS STORIES MORE CHOICES MUSIC | MUSIC PEOPLE | MUSIC BUSINESS Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY And Finally Artist News Beef Of The Week Brands & Merch Business News Digital Labels & Publishers CMU Beef Of The Week #327: Anohni v Apple By Andy Malt | Published on Friday 14 October 2016 Artists getting into bed with brands to get stuff done is now an accepted part of the modern music industry. As are – for the moment, at least – exclusives on certain digital music platforms. Is any of this a good thing? Well, that’s the debate. Former Antony & The Johnsons vocalist Anohni doesn’t think so, saying in an interview this week that working with Apple on the video for her ‘Drone Bomb Me’ single left her feeling “like a house cat that had been declawed”. The video, which was released last month on Apple Music, features model Naomi Campbell, largely in close-up, lip-syncing to the song – “a love song from the perspective of a girl in Afghanistan, say a nine year old girl whose family’s been killed by a drone bomb”, Anohni told Annie Mac on Radio 1 earlier this year. A simple question about stage design in an interview with The Creative Independent, published this week, led to a pretty epic rant on the realities of the music industry in 2016, focussing in large part on what it’s like to work with Apple. “It’s hard to maintain your composure and your dignity, often times. I honestly don’t know what to say about it”, says Anohni. “I think it is an increasingly difficult system, the music thing. It’s just gotten worse and worse over the last fifteen years. The income streams of musicians have all been upstreamed into the pockets of computer corporations. Sound recordings are little more than free crackerjacks inside every computer or cellphone that you buy”. Of the ‘Drone Bomb Me’ video, she explains: “It was an experiment and a challenge for me. The record companies can’t afford to advance the whole cost for making the record anymore, let alone pay for an ambitious video. So after a lot of hemming and hawing I agreed to work with Apple on the video. I wanted the video to have a wider reach, and only Apple could offer me the resources to do so”. “No one got paid to do that video except the hairdresser”, she continues. “The whole thing was done basically for free, just to make a product that we were then obliged to rent exclusively to Apple for a fraction of what they would had to have paid for it if they had framed it as an advertisement, which is of course what it was, though I didn’t want to admit it at the time”. Dubbing Apple “the McDonalds of consumer high tech whose wealth was largely pilfered from what was once a biodiverse music industry”, she adds: “All of us pitching in as if we were working for a charity, and Apple, one of the biggest companies in the world, walks [away] with an ad. I felt like a house cat that had been declawed. Those are the terms of engagement now in the music industry. We really get what we deserve. I am sure we are already at a point where we are forfeiting important artistic voices as a consequence of this”. Sure, selling out is a normal part of any artists’ day now. But is it really that bad? Is there a bright side? “Vinyl sales went up 3% this year, or whatever”, notes Anohni. “But we have been played, it’s just the truth. It’s manifest destiny. And consumers have been conveniently deceived in thinking that paying musicians for their recordings is a scam. Everyone has literally bitten the Apple; no one is connecting the fact that they no longer spend any money on recordings with the fact that they give all their money to the companies making the machines that consumers use to steal the recordings. No one sits with that equation. If you even mention it you risk ostracism”. So it’s probably fair to say that Anohni is not particularly down with streaming. Though it’s not all doom and gloom. Maybe she should give the ‘Dissecting The Digital Dollar’ report a read. Was that a plug? Yeah, probably. But you’ve got to hawk your free-to-access content where you can, haven’t you? Still, says Anohni, “there are kids out there that have had viral hits that didn’t even make a month’s rent”, and all this means that “there’s a tiny clutch of people at the top who are still selling recordings, the ones with enough wealth and power to reinvent the wheel each time they release an album. But you can kiss the independent music industry goodbye”. I’m not sure the independent music industry received that memo yet. Sorry guys, it’s over for you. I liked this rant a lot more when it was all about how working with brands to fund art is a bad thing. Which it is. I know I said that was still a debate, but I was lying. A couple of days after the interview was published, Anohni released a new video for ‘I Don’t Love You Anymore’. The video could, if you wanted to, be described as a low budget version of the ‘Drone Bomb Me’ clip – featuring Anohni in close-up, lip-syncing, with none of the frills that Apple’s money afforded. I did get an unskippable pre-roll advert for M&Ms when I hit play on it on YouTube though.

Music Streaming Will End Spotify Apple, Google and Amazon will end up dominating the music streaming business By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 14, 2016, 12:05 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall Recent Posts: Why Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Ended the Free Supercharger Ride Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Is Actually a Monster Hit GoPro Inc. (GPRO) Stock Slammed by Karma Drone Recall View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is reportedly preparing to launch its own standalone streaming music service. If so, it will join Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) Apple Music, Spotify and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG) Google Play in a market that’s increasingly dominated by tech giants. The entry of Amazon seems likely to be the final blow to the era of streaming music startups, and likely spells the end of Spotify as well. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr The end of Spotify. That’s an inflammatory statement, but here’s the logic behind it. Spotify has not only withstood the arrival of Apple Music — a competing service that seemed likely to eat into its user base — but it’s continued to grow, pretty much at the same rate as Apple Music. It’s at 30 million paid subscribers at this point, after adding 10 million since Apple Music launched. 3 Stocks Already Priced For Perfection (AMZN, NFLX, TSLA) However … The End Is in Sight The streaming music business is not for the faint of heart and while Spotify is a big name, other big names have collapsed since Apple and Google entered the fray. Rdio was one of the pioneers and it shut its doors late last year, despite having founders with very deep pockets and a year-long head start in the U.S. over Spotify. Pandora Media Inc (P) has been streaming since 2000, but shares of the company have tumbled nearly 40% over the past year and it’s been under increasing pressure to put itself up for sale. Spotify itself continues to operate in the red, despite growing its paid subscriber base. Last year, Spotify revenues hit $2.18 billion, but it still lost nearly $194 million. The company has yet to make money. That money-losing business model is a big part of the problem. A startup pushing into a new market can get away with losing money quarter after quarter, so long as it shows decent revenue growth and a realistic prospect of outlasting any competitors to become a dominating — and eventually profitable — company. That was Spotify, Pandora, Rdio and dozens of other streaming music service when they launched. Investors were willing to lose money in the short term while they snapped up listeners and slowly converted them to paid subscribers. But then the big tech companies decided they wanted in, and that completely changed the equation. Having Amazon pile on would take the situation from bad to dire. Enter Amazon Music Apple and Google have the ability to put their streaming music service front and center on every mobile device they sell, the kind of placement Spotify can only dream of. Both companies have deep relationships with record labels, and because they also sell digital music, that relationship is even tighter and can be leveraged for release exclusives. They have marketing budgets far beyond what Spotify could dream of. Profitability of streaming isn’t a big concern to these giants — as much as anything, the service is just another component in a vast product ecosystem, and if streaming helps to promote something else (like hardware sales), that’s good enough. Amazon entering the fray isn’t going to kill Spotify itself, and the demise won’t happen immediately. But it will mark the point where streaming music becomes the battleground between three of the biggest companies on Earth; including one (Apple) that essentially killed the traditional record store and became the dominant way to buy music, and another (Amazon) that’s the biggest seller of physical music like CDs and vinyl. This is the point where it makes almost no sense for a startup to risk entering the market and it marks the point where competing services from smaller companies — as beloved as they may be — begin to wither.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook pours cold water on virtual reality: 'There's no substitute for human interaction' Rob Price Oct. 14, 2016, 6:22 AM 3,950 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Cook, just a regular human interacting with other humans.Andrew Burton/Getty Images Apple just dropped another major clue about its next big computing platform — and it's not virtual reality (VR). Right now, we're in the middle of a major wave of hype around VR. Sony just brought out the PlayStation VR, and Google recently announced more information about its mobile-powered Daydream headset. Meanwhile, Facebook has Oculus, and HTC has Vive — but Apple has conspicuously yet to announce anything to do with the tech. But it sounds like that's because the Californian technology giant has its eyes set on a different prize: Augmented reality (AR). "VR, I think, has some interesting applications, but I don’t think it’s a broad-based technology like AR," Apple CEO Tim Cook told BuzzFeed News in an interview. Augmented reality works by overlaying information and visuals onto the users vision via a headset that corresponds and reacts to the physical world around them. So while VR cuts you off entirely from the "real" world, AR can enhance it. You might theoretically use it to make it seem like someone thousands of miles away is in a meeting with you, or to model a product under development in 3D, or play a platforming game that interacts with your lounge. Microsoft's HoloLens is one of the biggest augmented reality products currently on the market.Microsoft "Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it’s profound," Cook said. "We might … have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they’re incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. … You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier." This isn't the first time the Alabaman executive has bigged up augmented reality's prospects at the expense of virtual reality. At a recent talk in Utah, he said that he believed AR would eventually become as ubiquitous and common-place for people as "eating three meals a day." He added (emphasis ours): "Nobody in here, few people in here, think it’s acceptable to be tethered to a computer walking in here and sitting down, few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something, because we’re all social people at heart. Even introverts are social people, we like people and we want to interact. It has to be that it’s likely that AR, of the two, is the one the largest number of people will engage with." Apple has yet to announce any commercial augmented reality hardware products. As such, Cook's statements — while vague — provide us with a fascinating insight into what the famously secretive company considers an area of interest and potential in the future. Sony's PlayStation VR headset.Sony Tim Cook was talking in theoretical terms about the potential of the "wrist" and wearable tech more than a year before Apple announced the Apple Watch in September 2014, in much the same way that he now talks about AR. "The wrist is interesting. It’s more natural. But to convince people they have to wear something, it has to be incredible… I think there are other things in the space that could be interesting. Sensors are exploding. With the arc of time, it’ll become clearer," he said back in May 2013. And Cook has teased that Apple is actively developing augmented reality tech on some level. "Yes, it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind that curtain we talked about," he said in August 2016. In short: Apple thinks virtual reality will be great — but day-to-day, it will just get in the way. Augmented reality, capable of enhancing our experiences instead of interrupting them, is where the real money's at. "There’s no substitute for human contact," Tim Cook told BuzzFeed News. "And so you want the technology to encourage that." NOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone Loading video...

Next, they're zeroing in on financial firms.

Hunt Transport was one of the last holdouts. The Arkansas-based trucking company hadn’t gotten any reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, officials told shareholder activist Brianna Murphy. And after her firm, Trillium Asset Management, filed a resolution asking Hunt to adopt policies explicitly protecting LGBT workers from bias, the company’s board recommended voting against the proposal. It was unnecessary, the company said. At Hunt’s annual meeting in April, however, an unprecedented 54 percent of investors voted in favor of Murphy’s resolution. The company revised its policy this summer. Although it manages only about $2 billion, Boston-based Trillium is one of a handful of activist investors that punch way above their weight when it comes to pushing diversity. These activists have prodded some of the largest public companies in the world to add women and minorities to their boards, to disclose data about the race and gender of their workforces, and to protect LGBTQ employees. Trillium's Brianna Murphy   Arjuna Capital's Natasha Lamb   This year, these David-size firms zeroed in on some tech Goliaths to get them to close the gap between what men and women make. While only a small number of the diversity proposals go to a vote and even fewer pass, they put companies on notice that diversity matters. “This is not only a social justice issue, it’s a business issue,” says Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital. “More diverse teams lead to better financial outcomes.” She says she targeted tech because of the “enormous gaps” between its numbers of men and women. Women make up only 25  percent of the tech workforce and hold just 11 percent of management positions, she says. Lamb filed resolutions this year at nine tech companies, including Apple and Intel. Pax World Management, which is based in Portsmouth, N.H., and oversees about $4 billion, also filed an Apple proposal. At Apple’s shareholders meeting in February, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company was paying women 99.6 percent of what it pays men in the U.S., and he added that it would take steps to address the remaining gap in its total compensation. In August, Apple announced it had closed it for U.S. employees.  EBay announced today that its study found the gender pay gap effectively closed, with women employees in the U.S. earning 99.8 percent of the total compensation of men.   Go to {ESG <GO>} to explore a selected company's environmental, social, and governance data. In all, seven of the nine companies agreed to make their pay gap public and take steps to close it. “I’d say that this was a pretty successful campaign,” says Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute, a Washington nonprofit that tracks socially responsible investing.  Small firms such as Arjuna, Pax, and Trillium wield so much clout because a growing number of investors care deeply about diversity. Filing a resolution doesn’t require a lot of assets. A shareholder needs to own only $2,000 of a company’s stock for a year to do so. In most cases, activists withdraw a proposal if a company agrees to discuss the subject. That was the case with Apple. “We’d much prefer to have a dialog,” says Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Pax. According to data from ISS Governance, proposals asking companies to share and close their gender pay gap rose to 13 this year from just one in 2015 and none before that. Eight were withdrawn after companies agreed to talk with activists. While pay proposals are relatively new, actions seeking more diversity on boards remained roughly steady at 30, reflecting the continued underrepresentation of women and minorities. Such proposals have an impact even if they don’t get majority support, according to research by Carol Marquardt, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College in New York, and Christine Wiedman at the University of Waterloo. They tracked proposals at 136 companies from 1997 to 2011 and found that targeted companies increased their female board representation from 3  percent to 8 percent on average in the two years following the proposal.     As they begin working on their agenda for the 2017 proxy season this fall, these crusaders for diversity say pay equity remains a main focus as it gains national attention. Massachusetts and California have passed legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap. And President Obama in January proposed a rule that would require all companies to include salary data along with their annual filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about the race and gender of their workforces. Arjuna’s Lamb says she’ll be looking at about eight companies in the coming year, including four of the big banks and two other financial services firms. Women in finance sometimes make up a majority of employees, but few hold top spots. Lamb has filed a resolution asking Starbucks to prepare a report on the company's policies and goals for reducing the gender pay gap and will also refile her proposals at Google and Facebook. Trillium’s Murphy is also looking at financial companies and plans to file resolutions at nine of them to get more disclosure of data on race, gender, and pay. She says she's filing resolutions at Aflac and Fifth Third Bancorp asking the companies to issue reports on workforce diversity. In addition, a Trillium proposal asks Visa to disclose its EEOC data and give details of its programs designed to boost diversity. Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim says the company has received the proposal and is evaluating it. Pax, too, is aiming to expand its pay equity campaign, and it’s petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to require all companies to disclose their pay data as material to performance. “Pay equity is no longer aspirational,” Lamb says. “It’s being implemented.”    Colby is a senior reporter at Bloomberg News in New York.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Courier Mail reported on Thursday that employees at the store were fired after they were found sharing photos of customers. SEE ALSO: Google Pixel and Pixel XL Up for Pre-Orders on Flipkart With Special Offers The Cupertino, San Francisco-based company, however, said they have not found any such evidence so far. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees," the Apple statement said. According to Courier Mail, Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim has asked for more information in the incident. "We are aware of the reports and will be making inquiries with Apple to seek further information. This is an important reminder that all organisations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities," Pilgrim was quoted as saying. Steph Doukas, 28, who gave her phone for repair, was in shock. "If it happened to me I would just be distraught. All my information was on my phone and backed up to my iCloud, and I just left it with them," she was quoted as saying. Queensland Police also visited the Carindale store to seek more information. "Any person who wishes to make a complaint is asked to contact police," a spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the senior staff at various Apple stores warned employees not to take photographs of colleagues or customers, the report added.

This year the worldwide call to action campaign is 'stronger together'. Local Apple Expert, Digicape, is proud to support organisations dedicated to educating and empowering people affected by low vision and blindness. By providing much needed technology, devices, training and ongoing support, Digicape is enabling these organisations to focus on teaching students critical skills that will ultimately help them integrate better into society and the workforce. Worldwide over 70% of blind and partially sighted people are unemployed and in South Africa this statistic sits at an alarming rate of 97%. The barriers to learning are significant, not least of which blind aids are prohibitively expensive and as a result, learners often drop out of the education system at an early age. Notwithstanding the impact this has on them as individuals, the burden is mostly carried by families and communities that are relied upon to provide lifelong support and a livelihood. One of Apple’s core values is “inclusion inspires innovation”. In July 2016 the Company received an award from the American Council for the Blind for the dedication they’ve shown in achieving accessibility for low vision and blind people, and for their approach to continued inclusion-based innovation. Apple themselves have employed blind engineers to provide first-hand insight into the tech experience for visually impaired individuals and to help them continually improve the user experience of their devices. “Apple’s commitment to working with people with disabilities, the built-in assistive features that come bundled free with all Apple devices, which are critical to the learning process, and the fact that the devices are accessible and affordable is helping to reduce barriers to learning that those impacted by blindness face,” comments Alan Goldberg, Head of Education Services at Digicape, “Through our training, we see first-hand the transformative effects of Apple technology at work. You are fundamentally a changed person once you’ve learnt something new or found a way to make a meaningful contribution to a society that largely disregards you.” Transformative Apple technology Philip Crouse, Co-ordinator at Kaleidoscope (previously Institute for the Blind), is the first blind person in South Africa to have completed the Apple Certified Support Professional Course (ACSP) through Digicape. Philip became partially sighted in 2002 and by 2004 was blind. In 2009 he started computer literacy training with the help of a screen reader and earlier this year started using Apple devices: Mac, iPhone and iPad. Philip currently trains vision-impaired N5 students at the Kaleidoscope Training College, as well as adults who enrol for their iOS course. “Using Apple’s standard assistive VoiceOver feature, Philip was able to complete every task in the course and at the end his results were amongst the highest we’ve seen. It’s certainly testimony to his strength of character and determination but once again it highlighted for us just how powerful Apple’s technology is at creating equal learning opportunities for physically and cognitively disabled students,” adds Goldberg. One of the Apple innovations that is particularly exciting for visually impaired people is the newly launched Swift Playgrounds, a learn-to-code program geared towards children, or anyone really that wants to learn how to code. The support that accessibility, specifically VoiceOver, lends to this makes it possible for blind people to learn to code, another world first. “It is a privilege and a humbling experience to be working with visually impaired and blind people through our Digicape in Education outreach. There is no question that we learn as much from them as they do from us,” concludes Goldberg.

However we should point out that Apple defines vintage products as having not been manufactured for more than 5 years but less than 7 years ago, and obsolete products as products that have been discontinued for more than 7 years ago, so there is a good chance this list could apply to the US and other markets that Apple operates in. The dates might be a bit different depending on the release, but it should still be the same. So what does this mean for users of these devices? Basically products listed on the vintage and obsolete list means that save for a few exceptions, neither or these devices are eligible for hardware service. If they are damaged or if you need repairs, you won’t be able to take them into Apple anymore, and you’ll probably have to start looking at third-party repairs, assuming that these shops will even bother with your devices to begin with.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple Reportedly Working on a Magic Keyboard with E-Ink Backing October 14, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Garmin Loads Safety Features to its Fitness Trackers Load Safety Features via Strava Instagram Makes Stories Richer with Boomerang Addition and More Apple is gearing up to wind up the final launches for the year as we head into the final months of 2016. The coming year already holds high expectations with regard to the iPhone, which will be celebrating its tenth anniversary in 2017. But it seems like Apple is in for some other surprises following the iPhone revelation next year. We are not speaking of the revamped MacBook Pro that will be packing the secondary touchscreen display along with the keyboard. Macbook Pro will be most probably arriving this year. Instead, we are putting the upgraded version of Magic Keyboard for discussion, and it could bring some real magic this time. The magic here is a new E-Ink support, which was revealed by a Redditor who has claimed to be a Foxconn insider. Foxconn, like we all know, have been the hardware partner of Apple for years, and they have been carrying out the works for the re-designed keyboard module that will get used in the new MacBook.   A prototype of the keyboard device has also been revealed through a video, which reveals each key in the keyboard being backed with a lively e-ink display.  This should be an off-the-beat feature for the Magic Keyboard, which currently serves only as a mere wireless keyboard. Similar to the OLED touch-panel, Apple’s new E-ink Magic keyboard could swing to the requirement of the users. A lively keyboard could mean that the keys could get displayed according to the app that’s been used, or according to how a user would prefer. A later revelation was also made by the insider, explaining that Apple could also work further on the prototype to add colored e-ink support to its Magic Keyboard. They have got the time after all, as the new Magic Keyboard will only be revealed by 2018.

Apple to Officially Kill Off the iPhone 4 on October 31 GO Say goodbye to one of the most beautiful iPhone models Oct 14, 2016 08:56 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is getting ready to make a change that would impact an important share of owners who stick with older iPhones, as the fourth-generation is being added to the vintage and obsolete product list. A report from Japanese site Mac Otakara and citing people familiar with the matter indicates that the iPhone 4 will thus be placed on the list together with the late 2010 13-inch MacBook Air, third-generation AirPort Extreme, and mid-2009 AirPort Time Capsule. The source refers to the Japanese market when reporting the change, but since Japan is included in the “rest of the world” category on Apple’s vintage and obsolete product list, this will obviously impact devices in other countries too, including the United States. So what does the change actually mean for iPhone 4 owners? Basically, this means that the device will no longer receive repairs in Apple stores and at partners, except for a few countries where the company is forced to offer support because of local regulations. Launched in June 2010 As Apple explains on its website, vintage products are devices that have not been manufactured for more than 5 and less than 7 years ago. Additionally, obsolete products are those that were discontinued more than 7 years ago. “Apple has discontinued all hardware service for obsolete products with no exceptions. Service providers cannot order parts for obsolete products,” the company explains. iPhone 4 was one of the most beautiful iPhone models ever released by the company, and it came with a 3.5-inch display, an A4 processor, and 512 MB of RAM. The camera was a 5-megapixel unit on the back and a VGA unit on the front for selfies and video calls. Only three storage options were offered, namely 8, 16, and 32 GB, and it was running iOS 4. The device launched in June 2010 and is no longer supported by iOS since the release of iOS version 7.1.1 in April 2014. #Apple#iPhone#iPhone 4#iPhone 7 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Workers Accused of Taking and Sharing Close-up Photos of Female Customers Apple Seeds Third Developer Beta of watchOS 3.1 Apple Watch Operating System iOS Far Behind Android Despite Strong iPhone SE Sales “Good Guy” Samsung: iPhone 7 to Sell 8 Million More Units After Note 7 Fiasco 5 Great Calendar Apps for Android HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience Motorola DROID Turbo 3 with 16MP Hasselblad Camera Leaks in Press Renders New Photo of the x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Gets Leaked KDE Neon Users Urged to Upgrade Their Systems or Reinstall the Linux Distro Budgie 11 Desktop Environment to Feature a Dock Mode for the Panel, Richer UI - Exclusive Vendetta Online 1.8.396 MMORPG Released for Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android Ubuntu Touch OTA-14 Slightly Delayed, New Task Manager Gets Fuzzy Background    The iPhone 4 was launched in June 2010 new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments More Evidence Shows iPhone 8 Could Feature Revolutionary Wireless Charging more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Comments Computerworld | Oct 14, 2016 2:01 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple iOS Virtual Reality Mobile & Wireless Apple Tim Cook iOS 9 Comments Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is hyping Apple’s augmented reality plans again, stressing his company’s goal to create solutions that “amplify” human contact. Cook talks "Augmented reality will take some time to get right, but I do think that it's profound,” he told BuzzFeed News. “We might ... have a more productive conversation, if both of us have an AR experience standing here, right? And so I think that things like these are better when they're incorporated without becoming a barrier to our talking. ... You want the technology to amplify it, not to be a barrier." These comments echo similar statements last month when Cook told Good Morning America: “There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality, both of these are incredibly interesting… But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things -- visually -- for both of us to see.” There may be some hint of how these might work in his other statement that, “Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here who's not here present but who can be made to appear to be present." Cook has referred to these technologies more than once in recent months. In July he said the company remains “high on AR in the long run” and referred to it as a “core technology” in August. These monthly references to the technology could be an attempt to deflect attention away from other unreleased Apple technologies, of course… Oh the humanity His focus on the human element suggests the company seeks to use these technologies to support existing products, such as FaceTime, messaging and educational tools, but there will be implications across its platforms. For one less obvious idea of how these solutions may work, take a look at China’s Alibaba Group’s newly introduced VR Pay virtual reality payment system that lets you shop and pay for items just by nodding your head. Imagine if this were part of a virtualized online Apple retail experience, accessed using Siri and Apple Pay. There are implications in retail, smart city infrastructure, medicine and more. The market is ripening. One report claimed 23 percent of US consumers would buy an Apple VR headset. A report from Juniper Research suggests revenues from VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, peripherals and 360º cameras will reach over $50 billion by 2021, up tenfold from an estimated $5 billion in sales this year. Strategy Analytics claims around two million (3 percent) of UK consumers will purchase a VR headset by the end of 2016, but predicts around 47 percent penetration by 2022. 89 percent of which will be smartphone-based. Big investments Apple has been making significant investments in technologies that may support its work in this space. It has acquired Emotient, Metaio, Faceshift, Flyby Media and is reported to be speaking with other companies too. The company has also seeded the market with mobile devices that carry more processing power than any other smartphone or tablet available today, meaning even iPhone 6S users would have a chance of running these solutions if Apple shipped them tomorrow. Apple continues to invest in ambient technologies that may support its plans, think how AirPods and Apple Watch may lend themselves to AR experiences, and already has a deep patent pool in related technologies, a pool that goes back decades. Hiring blitz BuzzFeed notes that Apple has also been aggressively recruiting talents that may be able to support its plans in the space. The FT recently claimed Apple has hundreds of staff “from a series of carefully targeted acquisitions” working with others “poached from companies that are working on next-generation headset technologies.” Among other hires it has hired VR research scientist Yury Petrov from Facebook’s Oculus division, Magic Leap’s Zeyu Li and Doug Bowman, the Director of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech What’s the plan? We’ve seen lots of first movers enter the VR space, everyone from Google to Facebook, the latter this week acquired Irish VR start-up, InfiniLED. Sony introduced its PlayStation VR headset that lets you enjoy 360-degree gaming experiences, but Cook’s statements suggests gaming experiences are not central to his company’s plans, despite the huge success of Pokemon Go. However, this is not just about the market. In truth this is Apple preparing itself for the next era of computing, an era in which computers become pervasive, virtual and invisible. They will be as small as your watch, visible on any display you happen to want to use, and spoken to through voice and gesture, keyboard optional. That’s the only way to see the implication of the Metaio acquisition, given that company was developing “Thermal Touch”, a system which turns nearly any surface into a touch screen. Google+?

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Lots of Law Firms Have Ganged up on Apple for Its iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’ Issue By Omar Sohail Posted 1 month ago 29Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple is under immense pressure for not providing an in-depth explanation as to why so many iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices have stopped functioning thanks to the infamous ‘Touch Disease’ issue. To make matters worse, the tech giant has also been slapped with a class action lawsuit thanks to consumers facing this issue. Lawyers Have Signed on Three Additional Law Firms to Support Their Case Against Apple for the iPhone 6 Touch Disease Last month, Apple was struck with a lawsuit where three individuals, Thomas Davidson, Todd Cleary and Jun Bai had stepped up against the Cupertino tech firm, with the following details included in the lawsuit: California’s consumer fraud statutes Negligent misrepresentation Breach of implied warranty Unjust enrichment Violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act Lawyers who filed a class action lawsuit against the company in California earlier this fall have signed on three additional law firms to support their case. Still, Apple seems unnerved at the moment because it will not perform logic board-level repairs for consumers, which requires soldering and reseating of millimeter-sized components. Another reason why Apple should be concerned about this problem is that the company has been replacing touch diseased iPhone 6 with $329 refurbished models, and some of these models have started to display symptoms of touch disease within days or weeks of being replaced. Spending $329 is equivalent to purchasing a decent spec’d Android phone so we can understand a customer’s outrage of having to face the same issue again. Advertisement According to sources close to the matter, Apple is well aware of the iPhone 6 ‘Touch Disease’, but is not disclosing details about it. If you want a detailed explanation of the iPhone 6 touch disease issue, it has been provided in the video below. Till then, Apple should gear itself against these lawsuits, because the outcome is going to be far from pretty.

Yes, today many of you will be lovingly caressing a brand new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and be contributing to Apple’s world domination. I’m an active participant, just read my ode to the excellence of the iPhone SE – Apple’s previous new iPhone. We’re all sheep, and I think that’s a good thing. To say I’m disappointed that the Cupertino-based overlords didn’t bless us with the terribly-named AirPods alongside the new handsets would be an understatement. I’m really into Bluetooth audio and am salivating at the opportunnity to try out the latest advancement in the technology. I’m also fully aware that the AirPod is actually the most important new launch. You see, Apple knows it will sell iPhones by the boat load. The new iPhones are the best iPhones yet, and the iDevice ecosystem is the most mature technology family on the planet. So what are Apple actually selling this time around? Siri. Many of my tech writing peers believe that Apple has squandered its lead in the realm of AI and Virtual Assistant. Google put on a great show with the Pixel-only Google Assistant at the company’s last product launch, but the AirPods will do more to make talking to your phone mainstream. Think about it: the wireless earbuds have no buttons. You want to turn up the volume handsfree? Ask Siri. there’s also no physical button to wake the Virtual Assistant, you have to tap the device and summon it with the prerequisite command. All your interaction with your device while wearing AirPods, at least, is done via Siri. The company stripped the headphone jack to force users to interact wirelessly and make chatting to Siri just a tiny hurdle in logic away. And that’s how the company further entrenches itself as the leader in on-device artificial intelligence. To me, that’s what Apple are playing at. The company is breaking down the barriers between the user and the device. It’s a very subtle approach, but a powerful one. And one that I fully support.  Categories: Lindsey Schutters, Tech News + Features Tags: Airpods, Apple, Apple iPhone launch, artificial intelligence, Bluetooth, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Siri, technology, wireless Related Posts - Snap judgement: iPhone 7 launch highlights edition - Apple wants a slice of McLaren technology pie - Comparing 15 iPhones from 2007 to now - rAge Cape Town ticket details announced - AlphaGo AI beats Go world champion in world first More Tech News + Features SA Invents first new TV antenna in decades Sphero SPRK Edition Snap judgement: Nintendo Switch is anti-VR POPULAR POSTS SA Invents first new TV antenna in decades Sphero SPRK Edition Huawei Matebook SUBSCRIBE TO PM’S FREE WEEKLY WEB LETTER Connect with PM Recent Comments sozizn on Win a Toyota Hilux Double Cab worth R470 000"Mine chows 9.6lt/100 bt also depends on how i press the accelerator" Posted 25 November 2014 AHM3D on Israel’s Iron Dome: the missile bubble""90 kilograms of high explosive"= They must be getting a bigger BUDGET" Posted 23 November 2014 Lawrence H on Things that go crash, boom, bang… out there – Part 2"Amazing photos.

Now, users can click the Apple Pay option on desktop sites and authenticate purchases using mobile devices. In a nutshell, Apple Pay lets mobile devices make payments at contactless points of sale, or in iOS apps. Expanded Apple Pay capabilities provide added potential for any online retailer looking to streamline the path to purchase. As faulty chip card readers and confusion at the checkout line frustrate brick-and-mortar shoppers, online retailers should work to make mobile and desktop commerce as frictionless as possible. Fortunately, Apple Pay now allows retailers to decrease the amount of clicks to purchase across all devices. While Apple Pay’s new capabilities will have a lasting impact on retailers, disruption in the existing payments ecosystem will be minimal. Today, when a consumer purchases a product, the payment gets routed through the issuing credit card bank, the merchant bank, a processor network, a credit card network, and a payment gateway. Apple Pay integrates with these systems, and only challenges point-of-sale systems, which can be easily upgraded to work with Apple Pay. What does this mean for online retailers? Of course, not everyone has an iPhone. But since iPhone users spend four dollars for every Android user’s dollar, retailers will lose out if they do not take advantage of this opportunity to make purchasing easier and faster for Apple consumers. To use Apple Pay to their benefit, retailers must follow a few steps: Add Apple Pay Option to Desktop Checkout: Since Apple Pay partnered with Demandware, IBM and Shopify during the rollout, most of the work in terms of integration for retailers that use those platforms is done. If using other platforms, retailers need to build in code that integrates the Apple Pay JavaScript API. Developers must understand the necessary integrations for software that validates taxes, addresses, standardization and other considerations. Be Strategic About Placement: Retailers must be smart about the placement of the Apple Pay button while also adhering to the Apple Pay UI and identity guidelines. Apple Pay should be easily accessible to users looking for that option, or integration is a waste of time. Don’t Forget to Register: Apple Pay requires that retailers register for merchant accounts. Retailers must also install certificates that support each account. Take care of this early to prevent delays when implementing the program. Apple Pay and its latest update certainly don’t disrupt the existing payment processing ecosystem. Rather, it adds another layer that can simplify online transactions for both consumers and retailers, and places the company more in competition with PayPal. As multi-channel interaction increases in popularity, retailers need to make efforts to give customers the most seamless, frictionless experience possible – and understanding and implementing tools like Apple Pay effectively is an important step.

Neither of those, however, are feasible on smartwatch, leaving them with nothing but PIN codes. Apple, however, may have thought of something to make future Apple Watches more secure. And it could use hardware that already exists today and can even be found in existing Apple Watches. That is, identifying people by looking at their blood vessels and their oxygen levels. It might sound a bit odd to base user authentication on veins and arteries, but that is exactly what Apple’s latest patent says. Using heart rate sensors, specifically pulse oximeters, the Apple Watch would take a snapshot of the wearer’s vascular structure and compare it to the ones stored on the device as the owner’s identifying mark. Whether those two images match or not will determine whether the wearer will be given access to the smartwatch’s functionality, including things like Apple Pay. That is definitely a more convenient way of identifying a user without even requiring them to use the other hand. Whether it is an accurate way, however, is still debatable. Existing biometric systems that rely on vasculature usually use fingers or the back of hands, where blood vessels are easier to observe and are unique enough to be used for identification. That may or may not be true for veins on the wrist. This is just one of two of the most recent Apple Watch patents that surfaced this week. The other involves using wrist movements to control the Apple Watch as well as a paired iPhone. Of course, these are simply patents that may not see the light of day. But considering how there’s very little movement going on in the smartwatch market, these innovations would definitely be more than welcome.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Apple Apple’s next MacBook may sport ‘magic’ e-ink keyboard Apple Apple’s next MacBook may sport ‘magic’ e-ink keyboard By Bindu Nair - Apple’s MacBook and iMac are in for a massive overhaul in the keyboard department if a new rumor is to be believed. The standard unit may be getting replaced by a ‘magic keyboard’ which changes dynamically according to the user’s preferences. The speculation began with the arrival of a Reddit post which alleged that Apple was looking to acquire an Australian startup called Sonder. The user, whose identity was verified by Reddit moderators, apparently attended a Foxconn event in Beijing where she saw the new MacBook keyboard module design and Apple’s prototype for an e-ink Magic Keyboard. The Guardian has now added another layer of authenticity to the claim. A representative for Sonder told the publication that its CEO Francisco Serra-Martins attended the event and confirmed it was in talks with Apple’s procurement board. The report also asserts that the latter’s CEO Tim Cook met with the startup’s head in China. Also Read: New MacBook Pro may feature Touch ID power button, OLED function keys This does have a ring of truth to it given the fact that Cook is currently touring China and Japan. As for the smart keyboard itself, the product can be customized to switch to any language or custom icon, potentially making way for something like dedicated emoji keys and social network shortcuts. The Sonder Keyboard takes advantage of the same e-ink technology used by Amazon’s Kindle e-readers. The company even put up a video a few days ago showing off its skills. The unit in the footage is of an early prototype. The newer Apple one’s display apparently updates straight away with no sluggish transition between modes. Sonder’s own Bluetooth-compatible keyboard will go up for pre-orders later this year priced at $199. Apple’s version of the device could be making its way to MacBooks and iMacs by 2018.

Added by Duncan McLeod on 14 October 2016. Saved under News, Top Tags: Apple, Core Group, Hugo Barra, iStore, Lei Jun, Mobile in Africa, RJ van Spaandonk, Xiaomi Tweet RJ van Spaandonk Xiaomi distributor Mobile in Africa plans to open stores in South Africa focused on promoting and selling the fast-growing Chinese smartphone brand, its head, RJ van Spaandonk, said on Thursday. Mobile in Africa, which is a sister company of South African Apple distributor Core Group, plans to emulate the success of Core Group’s iStore retail chain in launching the Xiaomi-focused stores, Van Spaandonk said in an interview with TechCentral. News of the planned retail chain comes as Core Group opens its 22nd iStore in South Africa, in the Mall of Africa near Midrand in Johannesburg, this week. Van Spaandonk said iStore is a premium brand, which has a different target market to Xiaomi. “iStores have worked extremely well for us and for Apple,” he said. Mobile in Africa is still looking for the right locations and “working out the right concept” before opening its first stores in South Africa, he said. Xiaomi — pronounced “shao-me” — was founded in April 2010 by Lei Jun. It released its first handset in August 2011. By October 2013, it had become the fifth most used smartphone brand worldwide. The launch in sub-Saharan Africa, through Mobile in Africa, is the first time Xiaomi has expanded outside Southeast Asia. Former Google executive Hugo Barra heads up global expansion. Van Spaandonk said Xiaomi emerged with a high-quality but affordable product just as the Chinese market was moving from feature phones to smartphones. “Prices [of other brands] were just too high for many Chinese people. Xiaomi introduced a smartphone at an affordable price, with an operating system and a set of services optimised for the Chinese market.” He hopes Xiaomi will be able to replicate its success in China in Africa as consumers migrate to smartphones. Core Group, which has worked with Apple for more than 15 years, secured the rights to represent the iPhone in more markets across Africa, but the company soon realised that affordability was a significant barrier in countries where people couldn’t get phones on contract. “In emerging markets, where credit rating systems are not good enough to take out risk and credit recovery mechanisms are difficult, operators do not offer contracts,” he said. “People have to pay cash upfront for their devices. We realised that to keep growing our business, we had to sell smartphones [at a lower retail price].” Although Mobile in Africa is a sister company to Core Group, with the same shareholders, the companies are separated by a Chinese wall, and have their own marketing and sales teams. They do, however, share warehousing space. “We felt we couldn’t miss out on Xiaomi, given they are such an innovator in the smartphone space,” Van Spaandonk said. The companies reached an agreement in mid-2015, with the first phones going on sale in South Africa at the end of last year. For now, Mobile in Africa is focused on the key markets of South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. “The products obviously end up in surrounding countries, through partners,” said Van Spaandonk.  — © 2016 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet MelcolmX Will never support companies that steal ideas from other companies! Enough of Chinese imports. InTheCube.co.za Your comment is very short sighted. The whole tech industry is built on the copying (stealing is completely the wrong word) of other people’s ideas, tweaking them, improving them and allowing for the next player to copy it and do even better, and thank God for that. We would still be stuck in the stone age if ideas could not be copied by others. And the tech industry is where it is today thanks to advances in mass manufacturing by the Chinese (amongst others) at very low price points. Almost every piece off tech you own will either have components manufactured in China, or would have been completely manufactured there.

The Apple Distinguished School designation is reserved for programs that meet criteria for innovation, leadership, and educational excellence, and demonstrate a clear vision of exemplary learning environments. “It’s an honor to be recognized as an Apple Distinguished School,” says Director of Educational Technology Dr. Anna Baralt. “Shorecrest students don’t simply learn how to use technology, but rather use technology to amplify their learning.” Headmaster Mike Murphy adds, “Our faculty take a very thoughtful, student-centered approach to technology. We’re proud of our innovative learning environment the faculty has created here.” Walk into any classroom at Shorecrest to see technology supporting student success. For example, in the Center for Medical Sciences applied sciences track, Upper School students use iPad and the 123D Sculpt+ app to create 3D models of organs to be printed in the school’s makerspace. The 1:1 iPad Program allows students access to class content anytime, anywhere. In fact, 70 percent of the course materials in the Middle and Upper Schools are in digital format, providing different learning options for students and minimizing the school's environmental footprint. Even the youngest of Shorecrest’s students use technology to support their research and in-depth project work. For example, Junior Kindergarten (4- and 5-year-olds) students utilize the augmented reality app Popar® World Map and a class iPad to explore and research animals up close. This allows for experience via technology when literal hands-on experience is unavailable or unrealistic. As technology and pedagogy continue to evolve, Shorecrest maintains faculty professional development as a top priority, ensuring teachers have the resources, skills, and habits of mind to best serve their students. About Shorecrest: Founded in 1923, Shorecrest Preparatory School is a PK(3) through 12th grade coed, nonsectarian independent school located in Tampa Bay. By offering its families choice, support, and balance, Shorecrest graduates empathetic, independent thinkers who succeed at the university level, pursue their passions, and lead purposeful lives.

Apple products on the vintage and obsolete list are no longer eligible for hardware service, beyond a few exceptions. Apple defines vintage products as those that have not been manufactured for more than five years but less than seven years ago, while obsolete products are those that were discontinued more than seven years ago. Each of the products added were released between 2009 and 2010. The report specifically pertains to Apple's vintage and obsolete products list in Japan, but the new additions will more than likely extend to the United States, Australia, Canada, and the rest of the Asia-Pacific and Europe regions. Apple already obsoleted CDMA models of the iPhone 4 around the world last month, while the late 2010 MacBook Air joins the mid 2009 iMac, 2010 Mac mini, and mid 2010 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro among Apple's recently obsoleted notebooks. macOS Sierra remains compatible with the late 2010 MacBook Air, while the iPhone 4 cannot be updated beyond iOS 7.1.2.

 10 things in tech you need to know today James Cook Oct. 14, 2016, 2:39 AM 2,419 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chris Rock.Kevin Winter/Getty Good morning! Here's the technology news you need to know before the weekend. 1. Apple employees have been fired for allegedly stealing photos from customers' phones. The Australian Privacy Commissioner is looking into the alleged covert photo-sharing ring. 2. Samsung says the Note 7 debacle will cost $3 billion (£2.4 billion) in lost sales. It expects most of the lost sales (about $2.2 billion [£1.8 billion]) to hit the bottom line next quarter. 3. Verizon might be trying to back out of the Yahoo deal. "I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact," a Verizon lawyer said in a statement. 4. One of Apple's most important technology partners is suffering a brain drain — to Apple. Apple is hiring a lot of talent from British chip designer Imagination Technologies, the company that provides the graphics processor for the iPhone 7. 5. Soylent is telling customers to throw away their meal replacement bars after they made some people vomit. Multiple people who ate the new meal replacement bars started to complain that they had caused repeated vomiting. 6. Four media companies including Thrillist, TheDodo, and NowThis have merged — and Discovery just poured $100 million (£81 million) into it. The new entity is called "Group Nine Media." 7. Google added a fact-check feature to help you tell if news stories are accurate. Tagged articles will show up in the new story box on news.google.com, as well as in the Google News and Weather app for iOS and Android in the US and UK. 8. Chris Rock made a groundbreaking $40 million (£32 million) deal for two Netflix specials. The first one will tape in 2017. 9. Two key metrics show the perception of Samsung's entire brand has tumbled over its exploding phones. Samsung's recommend score has dropped in the US from 46 back in June to 29. 10. Tinder can now automatically figure out your hottest photo to get you more matches. The feature works by continuously varying which of your photos appear first, then examining the results.

I talked about this before, but, essentially, with the vast majority of my favorite apps storing data in the cloud, starting with a clean installation of iOS is mostly a matter of redownloading and rearranging apps now. In the process, a fresh install of iOS allows me to re-evaluate which apps I actually use and which ones can go – something that helps me keep my devices lean and with plenty of storage available.1 There's one aspect that bothers me every time I decide to install iOS without a backup, though: losing my Health data. In previous years, I was okay with backing up subsets of information to external web services such as Lifesum or the excellent Gyroscope: over time, however, the inability to look at my complete health history in Apple's Health app has become a problem that made me reconsider my stance on not restoring from a backup every year. Fortunately, Dan Loewenherz has come up with a solution that will allow me to continue my no-restore strategy for the foreseeable future. Loewenherz created Health Importer, a simple $2.99 utility that does exactly what you'd expect: the app restores a backup of the Health database, keeping old entries with every data point logged from your iPhone, Apple Watch, or third-party apps. Exporting a backup of the Health app was possible before, but, in my experience, no utility ever imported an old database into Apple Health as quickly and as reliably as Health Importer. The first wave of Health restore utilities relied on workarounds such as conversion from XML (Apple's export format) to CSV, which were slow and prone to errors. Loewenherz told me that he's spent the past few months reverse-engineering Apple's XML backup format – which isn't documented anywhere – and he was able to create a system that should import nearly every data type2 stored in Health. Combined with Health Importer's straightforward approach, the app feels like something that Apple should offer for users who don't want to deal with encrypted backups and full system restores. Here's how Health Importer works: open Apple's Health app, tap the profile icon in the top right corner, and choose 'Export Health Data' at the bottom. Health will prepare an export file (a .zip archive) that you can save into iCloud Drive using iOS 10's new Add to iCloud Drive extension. Then, open Health Importer and tap Import. The app will bring up the iCloud Drive document picker interface; if you saved your Health backup file somewhere else, you can switch between document providers as usual. Pick your backup file, and Health Importer will start scanning it for samples that need to be imported. Confirm which data points you want to import, give Health Importer access to your Health categories, wait a few seconds, and old Health data will be restored on your new iPhone. I tested Health Importer with a year of data from my iPhone 6 Plus (over 453k data points), and it worked flawlessly. In the Health app on your new iPhone, you'll notice that old data points will appear slightly different than the old device. The associated icon of the app that captured them will be Health Importer's, for example. If you open a single data point's detail screen, you'll also see that Health Importer's process writes new Source and Date Added fields, but keeps the Original Creation Date and Original Source intact. Because of this, old data points will look like they were captured by Health Importer, but their metadata will show details for the original dare and capturing device or app. Selecting data sources with Health Importer (left) and old entries as they appear in Health (right). Health Importer is the app I wish I had when I moved from the iPhone 6 Plus to the 6s Plus last year. Loewenherz did a terrific job with parsing Apple's Health backup format, and Health Importer is going to be extremely useful for all those who want to switch iPhones without performing full iCloud restores. Health Imported worked perfectly in my tests and I'm going to use it again as soon as I switch to an iPhone 7 Plus. Health Importer is available at $2.99 on the App Store. I don't particularly mind losing my Messages and Phone history logs. ↩︎ The app won't migrate exercise minutes and stand/roll hour data. Unfortunately, that's a HealthKit limitation the developer can't fix – third-party apps can't write data for those categories into the Health app. ↩︎ Tags: health Join Now Like MacStories?

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Area Roundup 10-13-16: Serrano inches closer to MRL volleyball title Thursday Oct 13, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 13, 2016 at 11:02 PM Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — The Serrano girls volleyball team moved within a game of clinching its sixth straight Mojave River League title after beating Apple Valley 3-0 on Thursday. While the teams played a tight, five-set match earlier this season, there was only one close set this time around. Serrano survived 25-23 in the first set and easily won 25-13 and 25-15 in the final two sets. Now the Diamondbacks (7-0 MRL) can clinch the MRL title with a win Tuesday on the road against Sultana. The win improved Serrano to 13-3 overall, but Serrano coach Ross Hansen said the team is starting to peak as of late. “We just kind of had a good rhythm and everything was going well,” Hansen said. “We are not where we need to be yet but we have definitely gotten better.” Joelle Battles had a big night with 14 kills and six digs for the Diamondbacks.

The Brisbane Courier-Mail [paywalled] reports that employees at the city's Carindale mall Apple store were using iGizmos to take pictures of women and sharing the images among themselves after giving each picture a score between one and ten. It was claimed that some of the images may have been selfies and other private pics copied from customers' handsets that were brought in for repair while others are snapped in store. "Apple believe in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not ­tolerate behaviour that goes against our values," the fruity flinger told the Beeb. "We have met with our store team to let them know about the investigation and inform them about the steps Apple is taking to protect their privacy." The 3.5mm jack-offs are investigating the creepy surveillance and said several workers have been sacked. The story emerged after one of the paper's employees noticed a technician looking through photos on a returned phone in the shop. One of the other employees said that similar photo-snooping rings could be operating in other Australian stores. "We are aware of the reports and will be making enquiries with Apple to seek further information," said Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim. "This is an important reminder that all organizations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities." ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 25 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Courier Mail reported on Thursday that employees at the store were fired after they were found sharing photos of customers. The Cupertino, San Francisco-based company, however, said they have not found any such evidence so far. "Based on our investigation thus far, we have seen no evidence that customer data or photos were inappropriately transferred or that anyone was photographed by these former employees," the Apple statement said. According to Courier Mail, Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim has asked for more information in the incident. "We are aware of the reports and will be making inquiries with Apple to seek further information. This is an important reminder that all organisations that collect and manage personal information need to embed a culture of privacy and ensure employees understand their responsibilities," Pilgrim was quoted as saying. Steph Doukas, 28, who gave her phone for repair, was in shock. "If it happened to me I would just be distraught. All my information was on my phone and backed up to my iCloud, and I just left it with them," she was quoted as saying. Queensland Police also visited the Carindale store to seek more information. "Any person who wishes to make a complaint is asked to contact police," a spokesperson said. Meanwhile, the senior staff at various Apple stores warned employees not to take photographs of colleagues or customers, the report added. "Apple believes in treating everyone equally and with respect, and we do not tolerate behaviour that goes against our values," the statement further read. --IANS na/py/ Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Ad Ad Most Read Benami properties, gold next: PM Modi After demonetisation, benami property holders the next target: PM Modi Day 4: Chaos at banks, ATMs, trade collapses in small towns New series of Rs 500 notes issued Sunday sees no let up in rush at ATMs; banks to be closed tomorrow More From Current Affairs 2 killed following powerful tremor in New Zealand Kolkata: Sack full of banned Rs 500, 1000 notes found in garbage bin Vergara flaunts figure in bodycon midi dress ATP World Tour Finals: Djokovic survives Thiem scare Chinese shares open lower [ more ] Top Stories Demonetisation: Dear PM, please don't mock the people in the queues Tata Sons has stooped to a new low: Cyrus Mistry Donald Trump vows to immediately deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants Markets closed on account of Gurunanak Jayanti Demonetisation won't curb fresh generation of black money [ more ] Markets Markets closed on account of Gurunanak Jayanti Macro data, Fed comments among 6 events that will set market tone this week Agriculture mandi comes to halt due to liquidity crisis Govt likely to put curbs on jewellers Commodity picks: 14 November, 2016 [ more ] Companies Tata Sons has stooped to a new low: Cyrus Mistry Ester targets three-fold growth in five years, riding on specialty polymers Tata Steel boardroom drama: How independent directors did a flip-flop Paytm hits record 5 mn transactions a day Bengaluru tech talent crucial for our success: Nadiem Makarim [ more ] Opinion Demonetisation won't curb fresh generation of black money Preparing for the promise of Trump Managing complexities in corporate governance SC harmonises debt recovery laws Worsening bankability [ more ] Latest News Tata Sons has stooped to a new low: Cyrus Mistry Donald Trump vows to immediately deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants Markets closed on account of Gurunanak Jayanti Will take $1 a year as US President, says Trump Demonetisation won't curb fresh generation of black money [ more ] Today's Paper Tata Sons has stooped to a new low: Cyrus Mistry Day 4: Chaos at banks, ATMs, trade collapses in small towns ATMs to dispense Rs 2,500; banks to exchange Rs 4,500 per day Tata Steel boardroom drama: How independent directors did a flip-flop Benami properties, gold next: PM Modi [ more ] News you can use Be wary of buying and selling in secondary market Some relief for home buyers as more rate wars are in the offing Real estate law: Too soon to celebrate Free lounge access, movie tickets and more: Credit cards offer benefits but don't miss the caveats Home gym in your budget Getting justice in cyber crime is difficult [ more ]    X Share Box Permalink http://mybs.in/2TIQSuC Home Today's Paper Top Stories US Election 2016 Latest News Market News Market Data Companies Economy & Policy Opinion Finance Personal Finance Current Affairs Politics Technology General News International Management Weekend Portfolio Have Your Say Ask Expert Photo Gallery Columnists Videos B2B Connect Live Chat Top Stories Market News Market Data Companies Opinion Economy & Policy Finance Jobs Politics Technology Personal Finance Current Affairs International Management Weekend B2B Connect General News General Photo Gallery Latest News Today's Paper Videos About Us Sitemap Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions Copyrights © 2016 Business Standard Private Ltd.
