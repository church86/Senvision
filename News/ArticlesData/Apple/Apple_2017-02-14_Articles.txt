 A $20 billion investment firm dumped its huge trade in Apple — and bet on Alphabet and Microsoft Rachael Levy Feb. 14, 2017, 4:02 PM 11,093 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Getty Images/Stephen Brashear Billionaire Chase Coleman's Tiger Global exited its big Apple bet last quarter while making a $148 million bet on Alphabet and investing $132 million in Microsoft. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the firm made a $1.1 billion bet on Apple, and over the course of 2016 started shedding the shares, regulatory filings show. Tiger dropped $407 million in remaining shares of Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, filings show. According to the 13F, Tiger made the following moves during the fourth quarter: It increased its stake in Priceline by 36%, holding a $1.84 billion stake at the end of the quarter It increased its stake in JD.com by 37%, holding a stake worth $1.16 billion It took a new position in Fiat valued at $481 million It took a new position in Alphabet valued at $147.5 million It took a new position in Microsoft valued at $131.6 million Bloomberg analyzed the data based off of a regulatory filing that the $20 billion investment firm filed February 14. The quarterly filing, called a 13F, lists the long stock positions of investment firms. The positions are current as of 45 days prior, so it is possible that Tiger Global has since changed its positions.  Tiger Global Management invests in private and public markets and manages about $20 billion firmwide. The firm managed $5.9 billion in hedge fund assets as of mid-year 2016, according to the Hedge Fund Intelligence Billion Dollar Club ranking.  SEE ALSO: A partner at $20 billion investment firm Tiger Global has left NOW WATCH: This behavior could kill your chances in a Goldman Sachs interview Loading video...

 The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter Kif Leswing Feb. 15, 2017, 6:09 PM 2,574 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Last year, an Apple shareholder introduced a diversity resolution that would require Apple to "increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." Apple shareholders voted down the resolution 94.9% to 5.1%.  But the person who introduced the resolution, investor Tony Maldonado, reintroduced a version of the resolution again this year, and he even recruited up a "socially responsible" investment firm, Zvin Asset Management, to cosign the resolution. In an interview with The Verge, Maldonado explained why he's pressing to change Apple's recruitment practices, especially with respect to diversity. It turns out, Maldonado is not your typical diversity advocate. In fact, he's a President Trump supporter.  From The Verge: "Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?"" But despite his political views, Maldonado still sees the lack of diversity on Apple's leadership team to be "racism, plan and simple." Ultimately, he says, this racism will make Apple a less successful business.  In Apple's most recent diversity report, it said 68% of its global employees are male, and 56% are white. Black and Hispanic Apple employees make up 21% of its workforce, although that includes Apple's retail operation, which offers lower salaries than Apple corporate.  The resolution is unlikely to pass. It will need to receive 6% of the vote to be resubmitted next year, according to Maldonado. Apple will hold its shareholder's meeting on February 28.  Apple opposes the proposal. "Apple believes it is better to focus our efforts on actively supporting our communities than to divert time and resources to the preparation of a report that would have limited value to shareholders," it wrote.  Read the entire interview over at the Verge. Below is the entire shareholder proposal:  Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt an accelerated recruitment policy requiring Apple Inc. (the “Company”) to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors, two bodies that presently fail to adequately represent diversity and inclusion (particularly Hispanic, African American, Native American and other people of color). Stockholder Supporting Statement The tech industry is characterized by the persistent and pervasive underrepresentation of minorities and women in senior positions as detailed in a 2014 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission report. According to a USA Today analysis of 2014 Computing Research Association data, “[t]op universities turn out black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them.”1 The Company is at an advantageous position to be a leader in promoting diversity in senior management and its board of directors, based on its size, breadth and position as one of the largest companies in the world. Shareholders are concerned that low levels of diversity at the Company’s senior management and board level, as well as painstakingly slow improvements, are a business risk. According to the Company’s website, “Diversity is critical to innovation and it is essential to Apple’s future.”2 Further, the Company has stated in multiple Proxy Statements that it is “committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which board nominees are chosen.” Shareholders believe that companies with comprehensive diversity programs, and strong commitment to implementation, enhance their long-term value, reducing the Company’s potential legal and reputational risks associated with workplace discrimination and building a reputation as a fair employer. Equally, shareholders believe the varied perspectives of a diverse senior management and board of directors would provide a competitive advantage in terms of creativity, innovation, productivity and morale, while eliminating the limitations of “groupthink”, as it would recognize the uniqueness of experience, strength, culture and thought contributed by each; strengthening its reputation and business. This is confirmed by McKinsey & Company, which found companies with highly diverse executive teams had higher returns on equity and earnings performance than those with low diversity, and a May 2014 study found gender diverse teams were better at driving “radical innovation”. “Diversity helps companies react more effectively to market shifts and new customer needs.” SEE ALSO: Apple’s 'vision' for its next big thing convinced a big company to sell itself for cheap More: Apple Diversity shareholder proposals facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter The activist shareholder trying to make Apple more diverse is a 'diehard' Trump supporter Last year, an Apple shareholder introduced...

Heres the thing about Apple Pay and banks Posted on 16-Feb-2017 12:27 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: News : Bill Bennett Apple insists banks don’t pass on Apple Pay charges to customers. Banks accept this in most countries. But not in Australia and, by extension, New Zealand.1 Wrangling over the issue slowed Apple Pay’s progress in both countries. Three of Australia’s four big banks asked that country’s regulator for permission to negotiate with Apple as a group.2 The fourth bank, ANZ, has its own agreement with Apple. On Monday Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank took fees off the table. In return they want Apple to open up the NFC chip in iPhone. That will allow them to run their digital wallets in direct competition to Apple Pay. The dispute is almost academic. Digital wallet take-up rates are miniscule. For now digital wallets are a rounding error in transaction statistics. Yet everyone involved thinks they will soon be huge. The Australian reports ANZ completed 10 million Apple Pay transactions since launching nine months ago. This compares to seven billion credit and debit card transactions in a year. Banks and phone makers expect digital wallets to take off when they add other features. Driver’s licences, loyalty cards and membership schemes are at the front of the list. So are public transport cards. Both Apple and the Australian banks hope people will one day no longer carry conventional wallets. Both want the game to play out their way. The key to understanding the dispute is that both sides are big, powerful semi-monopolies. Both want control and both want to clip the ticket on every transaction. It can mean rivers of gold. The Australian banks argue that opening up the iPhone NFC chip will allow innovation to flourish. Apple argues customers will get a better digital wallet experience if it retains control. Among other things it means customers can run cards issued by different banks from a single app. Banks elsewhere might be as uneasy with Apple Pay, but few banking markets are as tight-held as Australia and New Zealand. This gives the local big banks a clout that, say, US banks don’t have. Customers want them all to get on with it. A handful of geeks have swapped to ANZ to use Apple Pay. If that trickle was a flood, the other banks would soon change their tune. That’s because Australia’s dominant big four banks are also New Zealand’s largest banks. ?? Good question. I’m glad you asked. In normal times it is illegal for competitors to collude with each other. Regulators fear this can lead to bad things for customers. ??Here’s the thing about Apple Pay and banks was first posted at billbennett.co.nz.

Easy enough for your iTunes movies, not so straightforward if your content's on a Windows laptop or an Android tablet. Here's how to get almost anything streamed to your Apple TV. Image: Gizmodo We won't take you step-by-step through getting iTunes content up on your Apple TV as you can no doubt figure it out yourself — try the built-in TV shows or Movies apps if you're stuck. In fact, getting anything from another Apple device is super straightforward because your Apple TV acts as a big AirPlay receiver. If you're not using Apple hardware or buying from Apple's store then the key is to pick the right app. With limited access to the tvOS file system (thanks, Apple), third-party apps are the key to getting your content up on the big screen, and these are the best ones for the job. YouTube Image: Screenshot We'll start with an easy one: YouTube. If you just can't figure out any other way to get your videos to an Apple TV, upload them to YouTube and watch them that way (you can keep clips private to your own account if you don't want them seen by the whole world). There's more though — the YouTube app for Apple TV gives you access to any TV show or movie you've bought through Google Play Movies & TV. There's no official Google Movies & TV app for Apple TV, but you can find all your purchased content in the YouTube app: go to My YouTube using the top menu then scroll down to Purchases to find your shows and films. Alternatively use the Google Play Movies & TV app on an iPhone or iPad and AirPlay your purchased content over that way. Plex Image: Screenshot We're huge fans of Plex and once again the app can work wonders when it comes to getting your music, movies, photos and everything else from a non-Apple device to an Apple TV. Sign up for a free or premium account, build a library of content on your machine (it works for Mac, Windows, and Linux), and the Plex app will stream it to your Apple TV for free — as long as you leave the computer on. Alternatively pay up for a Plex Pass and you can store all your shows and movies in the cloud rather than on a local machine. The Plex app for Apple TV is slick and straightforward and works a lot like your personal Netflix. Anything you've added on the server side at the other end will show up and can be streamed straight to your Apple box. AllCast Image: Screenshot If you fork out for the premium version of AllCast on your Android device then you can beam pretty much anything from your Google-powered phone or tablet to an AirPlay device — in this case the Apple TV. Besides videos you can get your music and your photos up on the big screen (there's no Google Photos app for Apple TV as yet), and if you want to test the waters first then try the free version of the app, which comes with a five-minute playback limit. The best part of AllCast versus other options is that there are no technical menus to wade through and you can be up and running in minutes. You don't need anything installed on your Apple TV either. It just pops up as an option when you launch the AllCast Android app. Once the connection is made you can beam over anything stored locally on your device as well as content from linked services like Google Drive or Dropbox. AirParrot 2 Image: Screenshot If you're interested in getting content from a Windows computer on an Apple TV without dealing with a server installation as you would with Plex, then AirParrot 2 is definitely worth a look — it will set you back $US12.99 ($17), but there's a free trial available if you want to see if it suits you first. Again there's little in the way of setup. Once it's running on Windows, choose the local Apple TV as a receiver, then choose a media file from disk, and it's streamed straight to the Apple device. You can adjust quality settings in the program preferences but we didn't notice any glitches in our testing. The application can also do a straight mirror of your screen, so an exact copy of your Windows display shows up on the Apple TV. There's a version for macOS as well, plus an extension you can use on Chrome OS. Meanwhile the accompanying iOS app lets you use your iPhone as a remote control for whatever you're watching on your TV. VLC Media Player Image: Screenshot VLC Media Player for the Apple TV — like the versions for every other platform — does a great job of playing audio and video content in pretty much any format in existence. It supports a whole host of network protocols, including Windows shares, UPnP and FTP, so wherever your movies and TV shows happen to be stored, chances are that VLC can get at them. It also works with Plex if you need it to. As with the desktop clients, there's support for multiple audio tracks and subtitles, and you can also stream any video link you can get ahold of the URL for. VLC is the most finnicky of the bunch as it takes a little bit of technical know-how to get videos up and running on it, but it's not particularly difficult to do, there's plenty of documentation on VLC's site to get you started, and once your files are in place then using VLC is a breeze. You can also use a connected web interface on an iOS device or a desktop browser and just drag and drop the files you want to play. Comments Bob Dobbs Guest Feb 16, 2017, 12:05pm Airparriot 2 is in the current humble bundle so you can get it for as little as 1 dollar right now. Reply 0 Lammie Guest Feb 16, 2017, 2:00pm Infuse Pro is great for video—plays pretty much any format locally off the ATV — so no need to transcode on the fly—which is the downside to Plex. You can stream all your files straight from a NAS or computer. It can source subtitles directly from Opensubtitles.org and the interface is almost as slick as Plex (and it also downloads metadata for all your files such as cover art, synopsis, etc).

Name: Subject: Message: What would a return to China mean for the Google Play Store? Newsby Andrew Grush9 hours ago 2 159 4 “Google Play is coming to China” – we’ve all heard that line before. Ever since it first pulled out of the Chinese market back in 2010, there have been occasional rumors stating its possible return. With China’s smartphone market exploding, and Chinese OEMs slowly gaining global power, many suggest it’s only a matter of time before a return. I’ll admit I’ve written about this subject twice now. First I wrote a detailed feature in 2014, then in 2015 I wrote a short news piece on the matter. In 2016 other members of our team also covered similar new claims about Google’s moves towards returning to China. It’s hard not to be a little skeptical after all this time, but could 2017 finally be the year that this long rumored return actually happens? First, let’s break down the latest rumor. So this time around The Information reports that Google is in talks with NetEase to bring Google Play, and potentially other Google services, to China. To their source’s knowledge, no deal has been inked yet. It’s just talks. That’s pretty much the rumor in its entirety. Obviously, that means that even if a deal is reached, it could be awhile before Google Play gets released in China. It also means that the chances of it happening are currently 50/50 at best. That said, NetEase does have a history of working with western markets to bring apps and services to China, including StarCraft II, Diablo 3, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Minecraft. All of these services are games though, and partnering with Google for an app store would certainly have its own unique challenges. Would China even allow Google back? While Google technically was the one that left China, the breakup was kind of mutual, and so would the Chinese government even support a deal to bring back the Google Play store? It’s hard to say for sure, but the good news is that they don’t even need to sign off on the arrangement necessarily. As long as Google plays by Chinese rules when it comes to censorship and other net practices, Google doesn’t need express permission to return. The fact they are working with a local Chinese internet company would make it even easier for Google to get past any barriers keeping them out. As long as Google plays by Chinese rules when it comes to censorship and other net practices, Google doesn’t need express permission to return. Of course, Google would have to bend to China’s philosophies, which go completely against what the company typically stands for. As they say though, money talks. If Google wanted to ease up on censorship? It would have to strike a pretty impressive offer to get the Chinese government onboard, and honestly we don’t see that happening. So for Google, it’s choice is to continue losing out in China or to yield to the Chinese government. What would a Chinese Play Store look like? Aside from obvious language localization, the Chinese Google Play store would likely look quite similar to what we get in other markets, at least on the surface. A good precedent to turn to is the Apple AppStore. The Chinese version of the Apple AppStore still functions essentially the same as it would elsewhere, other than Apple is even stricter when it comes to the app approval process, ensuring that they closely follow all Chinese rules and regulations. The result of this is that Apple regularly removes apps at the behest of the Chinese government, with a higher profile example being the New York Times app back in 2015. Apple even removed some of its own services for movies, books, and the Apple News app that was introduced in iOS 9. The Chinese Google Play store would require a much deeper level of moderation than Google currently employs. The idea of Apple controlling app approvals and removals tightly is nothing new, but Google has historically had a much more lax hand. While they have turned to slightly tighter procedures in recent years, the Chinese Google Play store would require a much deeper level of moderation than Google currently employs. It is hard to say whether this would be handled by Google, NetEase, or both. It would require some pretty big changes though from Google Play’s normal operations. China is also notorious for malware, and so Google would have to greatly improve its approval processes to ensure that its store doesn’t become yet another malware-infested Chinese app store. Hell, even Apple has had some malware drama in China, and typically malware isn’t as much an issue for Apple.  As for the kind of apps you’d find? Again using Apple as an example, you’d find a healthy dose of both Chinese language and English language releases. That includes a number of higher profile apps and games that are currently not available officially in China. How Google and its partners would benefit from a Chinese Play store release The smartphone market has largely reached a point of saturation in many western markets. Sure, there’s still money to be made, but growth is much slower than it was in years past. In contrast, the Asian markets are booming and while Google is actively involved in India, China is a key piece of the profit puzzle and one that they are currently missing. According to a January report from Accenture, nearly three out of four Chinese consumers polled said they would buy new smartphones in 2017, up from 61% in 2016. Considering how large of a population is represented by China, this presents a huge opportunity for both OEMs and for Google itself. The more new phone owners out there, the more app interest. A highly controlled Google Play experience would also raise the quality of apps and services available for Android in China. For Google, it’s pretty obvious the money is there, if they can pull off creating a quality app store experience in China that stands apart from the competition. A highly controlled Google Play experience would also raise the quality of apps and services available for Android in China. This in turn would improve Android’s reputation in the country, giving Google and its OEMs an opportunity to steal further thunder away from Apple. According to IDC, Apple shipped 14.9 million units in Q4 2016, making it the 4th most successful vendor in China. A large part of the reason for Apple’s success in China is its position as a status symbol. That said, its reputation for greater security is an equally important motivator for Chinese buyers that fear the malware-ridden world of China’s Android app stores. Granted, not all of China’s Android app stores are unsafe, but it’s hard to deny that many of these storefronts have pretty mixed reputations. Considering Google already has partnerships with many Chinese OEMs like ZTE, Huawei, and OPPO, it would make sense that Google would attempt to extend this relationship into China. And by having Google Play’s (hopefully) more secure app store bundled out of the box, these OEMs would likely receive a boost when it comes to perceived security. This could help set these OEMs apart from Chinese smartphone makers that don’t play ball with Google, and could also eat away a little of Apple’s market share potentially. For app developers, Google Play’s presence in China also represents a huge opportunity. It is no secret that there are tons of app stores in China that are playgrounds to pirated apps. Consumers turn to these for a few reasons. First, it is sometimes the only way to get certain apps in China. Second, Chinese consumers tend to prefer free (or free to play apps), and so many of them will head to these seedier stores in order to get premium apps for free. If Google Play was in the equation, however? Knowing there was a safer, secure location to get these apps would possibly be enough to get Chinese consumers to buy them from official sources. Google could also work with these app developers to make specialized versions for China that either are cheaper or perhaps rely on in-app purchases instead. Obviously this is all speculation, but the point is that having a more official Android app store would have positive effects for developers that originate outside of China. The same goes for Chinese developers, as they’d had a more secure playground to place their apps. How would a Chinese Play store affect the Android ecosystem as a whole? The effects of having Google Play in China depend largely on how connected (or disconnected) the Chinese store and its developers are to the rest of the world. For example, this change could potentially give smaller Chinese developers the opportunity to release versions of their apps localized for other markets outside of China via Google Play, bringing new apps and experiences to those in the western world. Beyond that? If the Google Play store caught on in popularity, it could help to reduce the amount of malware floating around the web as lesser app stores shut down under the increased pressure from Google and the other more trusted Chinese app stores. This in turn would positively affect Android’s reputation globally as well. Additionally, smartphone manufacturers that partner with Google in China could enjoy a small boost in support or trust from global buyers, which would be especially important to companies like ZTE and Huawei, both of which are trying very hard to break into the western market in a big way. But is there even room for another app store in China? There are over 200 app stores in China. In the top ten positions you’ll find Myapp (Tencent), 360 Mobile Assistant, Baidu Mobile Assistant, MIUI App Store (Xiaomi), Huawei App Store, Oppo Store, Vivo, Wandoujia, HiMarket, and Anzhi Market. So can Google Play even stand out? It all comes down to the partnerships it is capable of forming. On one hand, OEMs like Huawei, ZTE, and OPPO have a history of working closely with Google. On the other hand, most major OEMs already have their own store front, and Huawei and Oppo’s stores are both among the top ten most popular. Would they really sacrifice advertising and promoting their own stores in favor of Google? It depends largely on what Google would offer them in return. Would OEMs really sacrifice advertising and promoting their own stores in favor of Google? It depends largely on what Google would offer them in return. First, if Google could brand their store as the most secure and carefully curated “Android app store” in China, there’s the potential reputation boost as already mentioned. Beyond that, Google could offer these OEMs perks that affect their operations outside of China like helping promote them to western markets or offering lower licensing fees for Google services in markets like the US. If Google Play could also serve as a stepping stone to eventually delivering other quality Google services (Drive, Gmail, etc), these drivers could also help Google stand out. Ultimately, we have our doubts that Google would be able to establish itself as king of the Android app stores anytime soon — if ever. The good news is that Google doesn’t need to. Even if Google merely established themselves in the top 25 within a few years, they’d be opening a massive market that currently they have limited interaction with. They’d also be opening the doors for tons of developers who currently don’t have relationships with any existing Chinese app stores. What do you think, should Google return to China?

New patent shows designated button on smart keyboard  'Emoji' key appears beneath the Tab button on the smart keyboard Would bring up a library of the pictographs to share in posts and messages A 'Share' key is shown in the image that activates social media sites and email By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 18:22 EST, 15 February 2017 | Updated: 18:26 EST, 15 February 2017 e-mail 2 View comments Emojis debuted in the late 1990s and have turned into a popular way for the world to communicate. Now, Apple wants to make it easier to share the pictographs while using a laptop and could add a designated button to a smart keyboard. The Cupertino firm has received a new patent that shows an 'Emoji' key below the 'Tab' function that would pull up a library of the colorful icons and let users share them in messages or posts. Scroll down for video  Apple has received a new patent that shows an 'Emoji' key below the Tab function that would pull up a library of the colorful icons and let users share them in messages or posts. There is also a Share key that would activate a window with social media sites and email APPLE'S NEW PATENT  Apple's latest patent was filed in August 2015 and illustrates a smart keyboard unlike anything the firm has ever produced. The application shows an image of a smart keyboard with a designated 'Emoji' by placed just beneath the Tab key. This suggests users could press the button and pull up a complete library of the icons to share in messages and posts. The keyboard also has a Share button.  And when pushed, it brings up different social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and email could also appear in a designated window.  Apple's latest patent, entitled 'Users interface for a touch screen device in communication with a physical keyboard', was filed in August 2015, which illustrates a smart keyboard unlike anything the firm has ever produced. And the patent was first spotted by MacRumors.   Although the pages make no mention to the Emoji button, the drawings make it very clear that the firm has the idea to add it to the futuristic keyboard. The firm's current smart keyboard does offer a globe key in the bottom left corner that activates an on-screen Emoji keyboard, but the patent images appear to have thrown it out of the design. In addition to an Emoji key, the patent suggests that Apple could add a Share function to the keyboard as well. To the right of the space bar, in the drawing, sits a button labeled 'Share'. And when pushed, it brings up different social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and email could also appear in a designated window. 'There is a need for electronic devices that provide efficient methods and interfaces for using a keyboard to view, create, edit, and share content.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The robot bee that could pollinate the Earth's plants:...

Share this article Share 'In some embodiments, a key on a keyboard (virtual or physical) performs different operations depending on the context in which the device is operating,' reads the patent published by the US Patent & Trademark Office. 'In some embodiments, rapidly tapping or holding down a key increases the rate at which an operation (e.g., scrolling) is performed.' 'Such techniques can reduce the cognitive burden on a user and may allow a user to perform certain tasks (e.g., viewing content or composing a text document) more efficiently, thereby enhancing productivity.' Although the pages make no mention to the Emoji button, the drawings make it very clear that the firm has the idea to add it to the futuristic keyboard (pictured is a concept drawing of what the smart keyboard could resemble) Apple unveiled a radical overhaul to its MacBook in October, which tossed out the traditional USB ports and functions keys replacing them with smaller USB-C ports and a smart touchscreen - and it came just weeks after the firm killed off the headphone socket in the iPhone 7.  Different buttons appears depending on the app being used, and it even doubles as a fingerprint sensor. 'We haven't been using them for a long time, so we mapped other functions to them,' said Apple's Phil Schiller. THE BIRTH OF EMOJIS  Shigetaka Kurita invented Emoji in 1998 while working for DoCoMo, a large Japanese mobile communication company.  Emojis debuted in the late 1990s and have turned into a popular way for the world to communicate The goal was to develop a way for mobile phone users to send pictures back and forth without using much data.  It all started in Japan, when users started to send pictures as a way to communicate.  This was a time when mobile phones were young, so providers were already struggling to to support 80 million users.  The idea was to create a one character 'code' that would display as an icon on the other person's device. DoKoMo i-mode, a mobile provider in Japan, was the first firm to allow users to add pictures of common used emoticons to their text messages. Source: CityMac  'Now, we are replacing them with the touch bar'. The touch bar is a small touchscreen, which changes depending on the app being used. Apple unveiled a radical overhaul to its MacBook in October and it included an Emoji bar across the top of the keyboard that users can select the icons by simply pressing them It also has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. And it included an Emoji bar across the top of the keyboard that users can select the icons by simply pressing them. However, if the patent is true, adding a designated button on the keyboard would give users access to the entire library of Emojis.    Read more: The History of Emoji | CityMac United States Patent Application: 0170038856 Apple Explores Smart Keyboard With Siri, Share, and Emoji Keys - Mac Rumors Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos Moment ISIS suicide attacker detonates bomb near Syrian rebels Dog CRIES after being told off for chewing sofa into pieces Redback spider catches brown snake in it's web and attacks it Terrifying moment deadly Chicago ambush captured on Facebook live Shocking moment a model poses on the ledge of very tall skyscraper Final moments of radio broadcast before Dominican Rep DJ shot dead Social Experiment: Would you breastfeed a stranger's baby?

Read more about the stories in today's news: Oracle Revives Java Copyright Infringement Dispute With Google Apple to Mark Smartphone Anniversary With 'iPhone X' Premium Handset RSA Conference Panelists Split on Question of Paying Data Ransoms Microsoft Enhances Security on Windows, Office and Azure Cloud       Here are your top news stories from eWEEK. Today's topics include Oracle’s revival of a copyright infringement lawsuit with Google, market speculation that Apple is planning to introduce three new iPhone models in 2017, the cyber-security recommendations of a panel of experts to defend against ransomware attacks and Microsoft’s security enhancements to its Windows, Office and Azure Cloud applications. Oracle has revived its long-standing Java copyright dispute with Google in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a massive 155-page appeal on Feb. 10, Oracle alleged that the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California repeatedly undermined its side of the story during a jury trial last year. The jury in that trial had concluded that Google’s Android operating system did not violate Java copyright. According to Oracle, the jury only reached that verdict because Oracle was prevented from presenting evidence at the trial showing all the markets where Android and Java overlapped. Apple is preparing to release three new iPhone models this fall, including a premium device designed to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, according to a leading mobile industry analyst. Apple will release two updates to the iPhone 7 and a new phone which may be called the iPhone 8 or it may be called the iPhone X, according to the leading analyst for Apple products, Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities. The iPhone X is expected to be a new premium phone that comes with a lot of innovations, including wireless charging, according to Kuo. The other two models are expected to be the typical second year updates of the features included in the iPhone 7 under the brand names iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Ransomware will continue to cause pain for companies in 2017, but there continues to be no single successful strategy to prevent or reduce the damage caused by this disruptive malware, according to a panel of security experts at the RSA Conference in San Francisco. For many companies, backups will provide a reliable fall-back measure if the company’s data is encrypted via ransomware. Yet, recovering data from backups is expensive and not always successful, panel members asserted. There is no single measure to prevent a ransomware attack and no single product at the conference that will save a company from a ransomware infection, Gal Shpantzer, CEO of Security Outliers, told attendees. The IT industry's attention is laser focused on security this week as the RSA Conference 2017 conference gets underway this week in San Francisco. Just before the event kicked off, Microsoft announced on Feb. 10 several new offerings and product updates aimed at helping its customers fend off hackers and keep their data safe. Examples include the forthcoming addition of Windows Hello, the biometric login technology in Windows 10, to environments that take an on-premises Active Directory (AD) only approach to user identity and access management. Microsoft also offers Azure AD for cloud-based and hybrid-cloud implementations. The forthcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will also feature a Dynamic Lock function that automatically locks a user's PC when they step away from it. Customers seeking to secure their Azure hybrid cloud environments will soon have new Azure Security Center and Operations Management Suite options. Thanks for watching.

CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Less than a month after being served a $1 billion lawsuit from Apple, Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf says he wouldn't want to have to argue the iPhone maker's side of the case. Apple claimed in January that Qualcomm is receiving royalties for mobile technologies that "they have nothing to do with." One-third of Qualcomm's revenue comes from licensing its communications standards to other companies, smartphone makers in particular. Mollenkopf said on Wednesday that Qualcomm has 300-plus licenses, including 120 signed in China in the last two years. "It's tough to come in and say that this is not a solid business," Mollenkopf said at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco. "I'd hate to be on the other side of that argument." Qualcomm has been through this in the past. Mollenkopf highlighted a similar dispute with Nokia a decade ago. The big difference with Apple is that it's a much bigger and more dominant company than Nokia ever was. However, so is Qualcomm, which in addition to being a key component in practically every smartphone, is making a play for the broader world of connected devices and Internet of Things. show chapters Qualcomm tanks on Apple suit    Monday, 23 Jan 2017 | 5:41 PM ET | 03:01 "It's pretty difficult to look at Qualcomm and say I don't want to work with them some time in the future," Mollenkopf said. In the end, Mollenkopf said he prefers that the matter be settled out of court, as was the case with Nokia, and he expects that's what will happen. He also said we shouldn't expect to read too much about the case as it develops, at least not from the Qualcomm side. "You're probably not going to see us argue this out in press," he said.

Tech Culture by Alfred Ng February 15, 2017 11:04 AM PST @alfredwkng by Ben Fox Rubin February 15, 2017 11:04 AM PST @benfoxrubin Apple CEO Tim Cook last year fought the FBI's orders to unlock a terrorist's iPhone. One year later, there's still no clear winner. James Martin/CNET The Loch Ness Monster. Roswell, New Mexico. And the Apple-FBI dispute. All unsolved mysteries, but we're only talking about the last one on today's podcast. It's been a year since Apple's dispute with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over unlocking the San Bernardino terrorists' iPhone. The fight ended thanks to a third-party firm that offered to hack the phone instead. Because the battle is shelved, there's still no clear answer on whether or not Apple is legally obligated to undermine privacy in the name of national security. Also on the podcast, we chat about HTC's launch into mobile VR sets, and what it's like to go rock climbing enhanced with augmented reality.

D-Link on Wednesday unveiled its new Omna 180 Cam HD (DSH-C10) camera that lets users monitor their homes when they're away. The device is the first HomeKit-enabled device from D-Link's Omna line and the first HomeKit-compatible security camera in the market at all. The camera, with its 180-degree wide angle lens, costs $199.95 and is for sale immediately on Apple's online store. It will be available in Apple's physical stores around the world later this month. See also CNET's roundup of smart home product compatibility Apple's Home app makes it easy to control your home from your phone. Finally Apple CEO Tim Cook shares his HomeKit routine "Omna's HomeKit integration allows users to be 'always home' and includes advanced security features with end-to-end encryption and authentication between the camera and an iPhone or iPad," D-Link said. When the camera detects activity, it sends a notice to the owner's lock screen (delivered via the Apple Home app) and shows a live feed from the camera. Users can access the camera remotely to see what's happening in their homes in real time. The home is viewed by many as the next big battlefront for tech companies. Apple first talked about HomeKit at its developer conference in 2014. The feature allows developers to integrate controls for door locking, light dimming, and other home automation gadgets and features in iOS apps for the iPhone and iPad. That means users can control various connected devices from one spot -- even using Apple's digital voice assistant, Siri -- rather than switching back and forth between different apps. Apple was early to talk about smart-home technology, but rival Amazon, with its Alexa voice assistant, has lately dominated the market. The number of Alexa-compatible devices outnumber HomeKit products, and fewer HomeKit devices have been released than expected.

Famously, Apple’s tends to shy away from large corporate acquisitions, with the company’s $3 billion purchase of Beats a few years ago standing as a lone exception. That notwithstanding, the report relays that Apple’s own arrogance and “take it or leave it” attitude might be precluding it from successfully inking similar large-scale acquisitions. Don't Miss: The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan Per the report, many of Apple’s acquisitions are spearheaded by engineers who routinely meet with Apple’s M&A guru Adrian Perica to discuss attractive new technologies and companies that might help advance the company’s product roadmap. So while identifying potential acquisition targets isn’t a problem, Apple’s penchant for believing that a) it can do everything on its own and that b) companies should be flattered to be swallowed up by Apple has sometimes led to a few standstills. As a quick example, Apple clearly bit off a lot more than it could chew when it decided to explore researching and developing its own electric car many months ago. This is arguably problematic because by the time Apple realizes it can’t do something, potential acquisition targets may become too expensive to pick up. Using Tesla as an example, the company’s $44 billion market cap all but makes an Apple acquisition a non-starter. However, Apple could have picked up the company at a bargain back in 2013 when shares of Tesla were trading in the low $30 range. Even when Apple isn’t intent on going it alone, their hubris can sometimes leave potential targets uneasy. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Interestingly, there’s a famous story detailing how Apple was very close to acquiring Dropbox. As the story goes, Steve Jobs called Dropbox a “feature, not a product” and made a relatively low-ball offer for the company. When Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said no, Jobs insinuated that Houston might want to reconsider because Apple was going to go after the company’s user base with a rival service. Of course, as it all played out, Apple’s own iCloud offering hasn’t exactly done much of anything to stymie Dropbox’s growth. While the allure of working under the Apple umbrella certainly works sometimes, that’s not always the case. Indeed, the cowboy-esque manner in which Apple tends to carry itself in negotiations isn’t exactly suited for large-scale acquisitions, something which some analysts believe Apple needs to be more open to in the future. All that said, Tim Cook is on record as saying that Apple is “open to acquisitions of any size”, an interesting take given previous indications that Apple last year explored picking up Time Warner.

Inside TidBITS | 13 Feb 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (3) Introducing the TidBITS Content Network for Apple Consultants by Adam C. Engst Apple consultants are some of our favorite people because they share our desire to help everyday users solve problems and work more efficiently with their Macs and iOS devices. That’s one of the reasons we like diving into technical topics in TidBITS — we know that consultants will be able to translate our knowledge into real-world solutions for their clients. We’ve now come up with a new service to help consultants, resellers, and other businesses who need to communicate with Apple users. As a bonus, it will also expand our capacity to teach normal home and office users how to make better use of their Macs, iPhones, and iPads. We call it the TidBITS Content Network, or TCN for short. We designed TCN to provide content that Apple pros can use to stay in touch with their clients. Consulting — and business in general — is often as much about maintaining relationships as it is about providing a service. But in today’s hectic world, the best way to maintain contact is with practical, helpful information. Each month, TCN provides professionally written, edited, and illustrated tips and articles that its members can use to update their blogs, create a vibrant social media presence, and power email newsletters that people will actually read. To be specific, TCN publishes four short tips and four 400- to 600-word articles each month, complete with featured image photos, carefully composed screenshots, and Facebook and Twitter teasers for each article. Everything we write for TCN is targeted to the everyday Apple user and focused on providing useful guidance. The key to TCN is that it’s syndicated content, so everyone who subscribes to TCN gets the same tips and articles. That works because almost no consultants have overlapping audiences. If a TCN member sends an email newsletter with one of our articles to her clients in Boise, there’s little chance that people who work with another TCN-subscribing consultant in Tampa would ever see the same article. It’s like the Doonesbury comic strip — it’s the same in every newspaper, but few readers ever see it in multiple places. Unlike Doonesbury, though, TCN members are welcome to modify the tips and articles however they wish to add a personal touch. Or, if they want, they can publish them unchanged as a guest post. If you work in a field where you’d benefit from publishing Apple-specific tips and articles for your clients or customers, check out the TidBITS Content Network site, which has pricing details, sample content, frequently asked questions, and an introductory video. And if you’re more on the user end of things but know any Apple consultants, resellers, or techs who could use TCN content, I’d appreciate you passing on the news. After all, if your consultant subscribes to TCN and publishes our content, you’ll get to read it! Thanks!   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS! Put your company and products in front of tens of thousands of savvy, committed Apple users who actually buy stuff.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-02-14 11:09 Good luck with this new venture. I hope it doesn't detract any further from the attention you devote to TidBITS, which has seemed a bit lean in recent years as more of everyone's time has gone into your Take Control books. As a paid subscriber to TidBITS I hope it doesn't become any more vestigial than it already is. Reply Adam Engst   2017-02-14 12:16 Sorry if you've had that perception, but it just isn't borne out by reality, as you can see in this chart of TidBITS issue sizes over time. I can't see any way to call what we're publishing in TidBITS each week "vestigial." http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/574336/TidBITS-Sizes.png Plus, apart from me, the people who work on Take Control are largely unrelated to TidBITS, so it's again not true that Take Control has taken significant time away from TidBITS for anyone but me. Regardless, the fact is that we need to earn a living. As much as TidBITS memberships have enabled us to be able to afford to continue publishing TidBITS, with fewer than 15% of subscribers supporting us, revenues basically pay for Josh as managing editor, Agen's work on the TidBITS Watchlist, articles from external authors like Julio, and a small amount for my time. If we had 85% of our current readership contributing, things might be different, but as it stands, Take Control Books and the TidBITS Content Network are what we live on. Reply Josh Centers   2017-02-14 15:15 Given that I spend the majority of my week finding, editing, and writing content for TidBITS, I disagree that it's vestigial. :-) However, we do stay highly focused on technology. Just about every other tech publication has a few "hobbies" — pop culture, coffee, design, politics, sports, or whatever — that fill in the gap when tech news is slow. We have a pretty good sense of what our readers want from TidBITS and we try to stay laser-focused on that. But we're always open to suggestions. Reply  Search   Cached.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 16 February 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Smartphone maker Huawei catching up on Samsung, Apple: study Gaining ground: Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9% in 2016 from 7.3% a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5% and Apple’s contracted to 14.4% from 15.9%. — AFP PARIS: Chinese smartphone maker Huawei managed to gain ground on Samsung and Apple in terms of market share last year, following the problems encountered by the two sector giants, the Gartner consultancy group said.  Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7%, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3%, Gartner said in a study.  As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9% in 2016 from 7.3% a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5% and Apple’s contracted to 14.4% from 15.9%.  ”Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann told AFP.   Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo.  ”We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent,” Zimmermann said.  ”Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added.  In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9% or 77 million units sold.   Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8%, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5%.  ”Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said.  With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7%, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9% of the market. — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Brazil judge rules Uber drivers are employees, deserve benefits Clash of Clans maker profit up despite Pokemon challenge Stand up to cancer Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ introduces series-first Season Pass Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely Others Also Read Man United will give Europa tilt full focus, says Mourinho Places to go on a weekend Spanish giants to host coaching clinics at college in Negri Sembilan advertisement Latest News Ukraine says Russian state hackers using new viruses for attacks Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Pokémon Go: The universe expands Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Most Viewed in Tech Pokémon Go: The universe expands Nokia 3310 on the comeback trail: report Tired of screen addicts, Vienna café says phone juice costs extra Stand up to cancer Canada’s Shopify reports bigger loss as expenses soar Huawei said to plan its own voice assistant for smartphones Lenovo’s profit misses estimates after PC rivals erode lead Apple struggles to make big deals, hampering strategy shifts China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Yahoo notifies users of sophisticated breach methods Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The patent application, titled User Interface for a Touch Screen Device in Communication with a Physical Keyboard, primarily concerns itself with “user interfaces for viewing, creating, editing, and sharing content on an electronic device” in relation to accepting multiple inputs — both on the touchscreen surface, as well as in conjunction with a physical keyboard. Much of the information outlined in the patent application reflects techniques already in use by Apple, such as finger gestures, focus selectors, and use of cursor keys and key combinations. However, the patent notably outlines new keys, such as a dedicated Share key that would bring up the iOS share sheet, an Emoji key that would presumably activate the on-screen emoji keyboard, and a magnifying glass key that could be used to bring up the Spotlight search window and/or activate Siri. As with most Apple patent applications, of course, it’s unclear whether any of the new features illustrated here will ever come to fruition.

The 86-year-old, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple late last year, raising his company’s holding from 15.2m shares to 57.4m. The iPhone maker’s shares hit a record high yesterday of $136.27 (£109.49) making his stake worth £6.3bn. Planning ahead: Warren Buffett, worth an estimated £60bn, nearly quadrupled his stake in Apple His firm Berkshire Hathaway also offloaded £723m of Walmart stock – a shift some will view as an admission the industry is in decline. The American dubbed the Sage of Omaha has focused on the threat from online retailers such as Amazon. Buffett told shareholders in Omaha last year: ‘It’s a big force and it has already disrupted plenty of people and it will disrupt more.’ The tycoon also upped his stakes in airline companies, including £1.7bn in each of American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines and United Continental Holdings.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 135.51 +0.49 +0.36% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▲ 1,500.00 +100.00 +7.14% BOE Technology Group Co Ltd 000725 ▲ 3.27 +0.02 +0.62% Sharp Corp SHCAF ▼ 2.92 -0.01 -0.34% Apple’s been testing BOE’s active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn’t decided if it’ll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country’s largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it’s unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said. If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan -- a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co. Apple declined to comment, and BOE declined to comment on talks with customers. The display is one of the most expensive components of a smartphone. OLED screens are more difficult to produce, making Apple beholden to suppliers still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities. The world’s four biggest suppliers of smartphone displays -- Samsung Display Co., Sharp Corp., LG Display Co. and Japan Display Inc. -- are said to have insufficient capacity to equip all new iPhones this year, a constraint that may persist into 2018. That means Apple may be forced to adopt OLED in just a single version of its device this year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone’s debut. “It’s an opportunity for BOE as Apple is known to seek multiple suppliers for one component,” said James Yan, research director for Counterpoint Research in Beijing. “But it’s unlikely to challenge Samsung because it is able to roll out high-quality screens at a steady capacity.” BOE’s shares had climbed 1.3 percent in Shenzhen by midday, outperforming a mostly unchanged benchmark A-share index. Universal Display Corp., which licenses and sells technology to makers of OLED screens, rose as much as 9.7 percent, the most since November. Founded in 1993 after employees took over an ailing producer of electron tubes, Beijing-based BOE is the world’s largest manufacturer of LCD panels by market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BOE, which started out as Beijing Orient and enjoyed the support of a government keen to champion local technology players, is now building a 46.5 billion-yuan flexible AMOLED plant in Chengdu.  While it’s ramping up capacity, it’s likely to miss the next iPhone. That sixth-generation factory won’t crank out a single screen till the summer, while new iPhones typically go on sale in the fall. When that plant is up to full capacity, it’ll be able to put out 48,000 glass substrates a month, BOE said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the thin surfaces from which screens are carved out. Another plant in Mianyang with the same capacity and investment is expected to start production only about two years later. The company currently operates only a small OLED factory in remote Inner Mongolia. Eventually, when its two plants are up and running, it expects to be able to manufacture 1.6 million square-meters of flexible AMOLED glass substrates a year, slightly more than researcher IHS’ estimate for total global production in 2016. Apple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they’re unveiled, usually in September, as it did with 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All iPhone 7 models have liquid-crystal display screens.  The U.S. company and Samsung have an exclusive OLED supply deal covering 2017, people with knowledge of the agreement have said. Yet that doesn’t guarantee the South Korean technology giant can make enough displays to sate iPhone demand, particularly given Samsung needs to outfit its own slate of upcoming gadgets. Some analysts estimate that Apple could sell as many as 90 million iPhones in the last three months of 2017 alone.

"Just roll with it. If there's a little danger, what the hell, you're not going to live forever anyway."Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues.He has been Buffett's right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly $410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad.Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N).On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the "joke" that Munger said airlines once were. Berkshire is now Apple's fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines."The nice thing about the game we're in is that we can keep learning," Munger said."He's changed when he's buying airlines, and he's changed when he's buying Apple," he said of Buffett."I don't think we've gone crazy," Munger added. "I think we're adapting." Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake.Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job.Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted. "The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn't recognize it," Munger said. "I don't think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo."He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co (AXP.N), saying people would be in a "state of delusion" for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade.Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's (VRX.TO) business practices, including the Canadian drug company's model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher.Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant's growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half."It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in," Munger said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK: Charlie Munger, the billionaire vice chairman of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , said some of U.S. President Donald Trump's ideas may prove constructive for the country, tempering comments a year ago suggesting that his fellow Republican was not morally qualified for the White House. "Well, I've gotten more mellow," Munger said during Wednesday's annual meeting at the publishing company Daily Journal Corp in Los Angeles, which he chairs. "He's not wrong on everything," said Munger, referring to Trump. "Just roll with it. If there's a little danger, what the hell, you're not going to live forever anyway." Munger, 93, spoke for nearly two hours to investors and students on a wide range of issues. He has been Buffett's right-hand man for decades, helping the 86-year-old build Berkshire into a roughly US$410 billion conglomerate with more than 90 companies including insurers, utilities, food producers and a railroad. Berkshire also has large investments in dozens of stocks, including iPhone maker Apple Inc and the four biggest U.S. carriers: American Airlines Group Inc , Delta Air Lines Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and United Continental Holdings Inc . On Tuesday, Berkshire revealed multi-billion-dollar stakes in all five companies, marking a reversal of its longstanding aversion to the technology sector and antipathy to the "joke" that Munger said airlines once were. Berkshire is now Apple's fifth-largest investor, and the largest or second largest investor in the four airlines. "The nice thing about the game we're in is that we can keep learning," Munger said. "He's changed when he's buying airlines, and he's changed when he's buying Apple," he said of Buffett. "I don't think we've gone crazy," Munger added. "I think we're adapting." Munger downplayed the impact of the recent scandal afflicting Wells Fargo & Co , in which Berkshire is the largest investor with a roughly 10 percent stake. Wells Fargo was caught flat-footed by the public outcry after it settled regulatory charges that workers created as many as 2 million sham customer accounts to meet sales goals. The scandal cost longtime Chief Executive John Stumpf his job. Munger said the bigger problem for Wells Fargo was not its sales culture, but how it reacted. "The mistake there was that when the bad news came, they didn't recognize it," Munger said. "I don't think that impairs the future of Wells Fargo." He was less definitive about the outlook of another big Berkshire holding, American Express Co , saying people would be in a "state of delusion" for thinking they could project the state of the payments system in a decade. Munger also defended his earlier faulting of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc's business practices, including the Canadian drug company's model of acquiring rights to drugs and driving prices higher. Criticism and regulatory probes have caused Valeant's growth plan to unravel, and its share price to plunge more than 93 percent in a year-and-a-half. "It was really interesting how many high-grade people that took in," Munger said. "It was too good to be true."

According to The Australian Financial Review, the policy will be formally announced in the May budget and will not apply to shares and other investments.

More videos PM has the final say Malcolm Turnbull has made his views clear on whether there'll be company tax concessions. The report follows a year of consistent Coalition attacks on the Labor Party's proposal to limit negative gearing and halve CGT concessions, which have been framed as policies that "punish mum and dad investors". But Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann dismissed the story. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Treasurer Scott Morrison with Finance Minister Mathias Cormann at the release of the MYEFO in December. Photo: Andrew Meares "Don't believe everything you read in the newspaper. The story on the front page of the Financial Review today is wrong, there is no such proposal before the government," Senator Cormann said. "The government has absolutely no intention of reducing the capital gains tax discount or making changes to negative gearing. Advertisement "The Liberal-National Party Coalition is the party of lower taxes. We want to be able to deliver lower taxes so we can strengthen growth and create more jobs but we do need to get the budget back into surplus." Mr Turnbull said "we do not support the Labor Party's plans to increase capital gains tax or indeed their plans to outlaw negative gearing". SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison during question time. Photo: Andrew Meares One change flagged to the capital gains tax would see the concession reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, or a similar amount. An alternative model would see the concession increase the longer the property is owned, reaching 50 per cent after several years. In recent days, the government has threatened that tax hikes could be necessary to bring the budget into balance and fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme if $13 billion worth of spending cuts continue to be blocked in Parliament. Treasurer Scott Morrison told Fairfax Media the government would "exhaust every option we have to deal with the expenditure problem we have" and then finalise the 2017 budget measures. The priority is to reduce the deficit and hang onto to Australia's AAA credit rating.  According to the Grattan Institute, halving the CGT concession would bring in $3.7 billion a year and have a small impact on house prices.  Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said the opposition would look at the proposal "if it's a step in the right direction" and accused the government of hypocrisy and a "scare campaign". "Be in no doubt you cannot allow the situation to continue where the government is giving more help to somebody buying their tenth home than to a first home buyer," Mr Burke told Sky News. "Labor has been arguing this now for more than a year. If the government's getting closer to the mark, that's good, but no one should pretend that Scott Morrison emerged with any credibility."

Ogg February 15, 2017 10:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) has released its public equity holdings as of December 31, 2016. While the stock picks and holdings of Warren Buffett and his portfolio managers are always followed closely, the number of changes for the 2017 portfolio was massive. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway’s investments for years now, and the top issue here is that the changes actually look larger than they have ever been in any quarterly report. Buffett and his team of portfolio managers had public equity holdings of $147.9 billion at the end of 2016. This was up almost $20 billion from the $128.8 billion counted at the end of the third quarter of 2016, and it is even higher than the $115.46 billion counted as of December 31, 2015. Buffett is considered to be the ultimate “whale watch” by investors who like seeing what hedge funds and activist investors are buying and selling. After all, he is considered to be the best investor of modern times. One key issue to consider here is that Ted Weschler and Todd Combs obviously have been given an expanded role in running the Berkshire Hathaway stocks. 24/7 Wall St. has shown the full Buffett holdings, and the reality is that there are 13 major changes that need to be considered by investors. Again, the total volume of changes looks larger than anything ever seen from Buffett and his team on a quarterly basis. While Buffett doesn’t care about analyst reports and price targets, the consensus analyst price targets from Thomson Reuters have been included so investors can see how these match up against the current share prices. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become a much larger holding for Team Buffett, and it was selected by one of the Buffett portfolio managers in 2016. The new Apple stake at the end of 2016 was 57,359,652 shares, up from just 15.227 million in the prior quarter. It seems quite fortunate for Berkshire Hathaway that Apple shares just hit a new all-time high on the same day that this higher stake was revealed. Does it seem odd for Buffett’s team to be buying up Apple shares when Buffett is good friends with Bill Gates, and considering that Buffett has pledged his estate to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation? If Berkshire Hathaway’s stake remained static, it was worth $7.7 billion in mid-February. Didn’t Buffett hate airlines for many years? His portfolio managers feel the opposite way now as they have grown their stakes to a sector bet worth over $9 billion. Maybe they now have a good model for the likes of Buffett. They have a wider moat to defend their business with fewer legacy carriers to compete against. Airlines also get to gouge their customers with any fees they can think of, and airline prices now have pricing power. Some airlines are even paying dividends. American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) was a new stake at the end of September, and the portfolio managers more than doubled the stake. Berkshire Hathaway’s end-of-year stake in American Airlines was 45.54 million shares, up from 21.77 million shares just a quarter earlier. That stake would be worth some $2.1 billion in current terms, and with shares above $47, the consensus analyst price target of $54.33 would still indicate upside ahead. United Continental Holdings Inc. (NYSE: UAL) was a much larger stake of 28.95 million shares at the end of 2016. This had been listed as a new stake of 4.533 million shares at the end of September. If this stake has remained the same, it was worth more than $2.1 billion as of mid-February. At $75.50, United Continental shares have a 52-week range of $37.41 to $76.80, and they also have a consensus analyst price target of $85.44. Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL) was listed as a new stake of 60.02 million shares, up sharply from the prior stake of 6.333 million shares. With Delta’s stock at almost $51 after the filing was disclosed, this stake would be worth some $3.06 billion at current share prices. Delta’s 52-week range is $32.60 to $52.76. Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) was also an airline stake that was taken at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett told CNBC that he bought this one after his portfolio managers bought the other big three airlines. The actual stake was not known when Buffett made that announcement a quarter earlier, but the new size of the stake was just over 43.2 million shares. Southwest’s post-filing share price was last seen at $56.50, in a 52-week range of $35.42 to $56.91, and with a consensus price target of $62.07. This Southwest Airlines stake would be worth more than $2.4 billion at current prices. 24/7 Wall St. 11 Crucial Issues for Investors to Consider in Value Stocks Pages: 1/2 « Is This the Turnaround Groupon Has Been Looking For?

Thankfully, the circus has been saved—it found a buyer, and will come back in time for its 40th anniversary next fall. An NYC institution since 1977, the Big Apple Circus began struggling financially around the economic downturn in 2008, and suffered even more in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Last summer, they tried to scrape up $2 million for fundraising to stay open, but fell over $1 million short of their goal, scrapping their 2016-17 season. But yesterday the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York okayed a $1.3 million auction bid from Big Top Works, which is an affiliate of a Florida-based investment firm. THEY'RE BACK, BABY. Big Top Works will have to maintain the Big Apple Circus's various programs and special performances for low income and special needs children, as part of the court-ordered action. It's unclear whether they'll hold next season at Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, as it has done for the last few decades. The Big Apple Circus won't have the same competition when it returns—the Ringling Bros. circus will shut down after May thanks to a massive drop in revenue.

What was created, however, was a market for inexpensive wireless headphones that don't cost hundreds of dollars. Even Apple's own offerings, both through its Beats brand and under the Apple name, are over $150. While I still think the Apple AirPods are some of the best tech I've used in years (they truly do "just work"), I've been using the IFROGZ Impulse Wireless headphones off and of for a few weeks, and you know what? At $60, I don't think you can find a better wireless experience. Specs Drivers: 40mm Resistance 32hms Sensitivity: 120dB +/- 3dB Frequency: 20Hz - 20KHz Listening time: 12 hours Standby: 58 hours Charge time: 2.5 hours via microUSB Connectivity: Bluetooth and 3.5mm headphone jack In the box, set up Jason Cipriani/ZDNet In the box you'll find the headphones, a microUSB charging cable, and a 3.5mm cable. Unfortunately, a small travel bag or carrying case isn't included. Latest review Battle of the Android flagships: HTC 10, LG G5, and Samsung Galaxy S7 All three of these phones are outstanding and are priced lower than a comparable iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Read More Before you use the headphones with a Bluetooth device, be it your Mac, iOS device, Android device, or PC, you will need go through the pairing process. To put the Impulse Wireless headphones into pairing mode, you hold in the power button for roughly five seconds, and then connect to the headphones through the pairing menu on your phone, tablet or computer. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 A moment later, you'll hear a tone in the headphones and the pairing process is complete. Design Jason Cipriani/ZDNet The Impulse Wireless headphones are available in black with red highlights, or white with tan highlights. The majority of the housing is made of plastic that doesn't necessarily evoke thoughts of high quality, but it doesn't feel extremely cheap made either. A pair of "AreoFoam" pads rest against your ears, providing comfort during long listening periods. I found my ears would begin to hurt around the four-hour mark, but after a short break, I was able to continue listening. As someone who hasn't worn on-ear headphones in awhile, the discomfort isn't necessarily this particular pair of headphone's fault. The same type of foam is used to line the top band that rest against your head, again providing comfort. IFROGZ claims the pads also work as a means for passive noise cancellation. I found that claim to be true, but only for every day environmental sounds (example: typing on a keyboard, someone walking down the hall, etc). I wouldn't expect the passive noise cancellation to block out a screaming child or a chatty traveler in the row behind you during a flight. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet On the left side is where you'll find a 3.5mm jack, for use when the battery is dead, and the power button. On top of the right side is a volume rocker, with a play/pause button found on the bottom next to the microUSB charging port. Each side of the headphones fold into the middle of the footprint, decreasing their overall size and making it a breeze to throw in a backpack or purse when traveling. Battery life One of the biggest drawbacks to any Bluetooth device is battery life. Apple's AirPods, for example, can last five hours before they have to go back into the charging case. Samsung's Gear IconX last under two hours. IFROGZ touts the Impulse Wireless headphones as having a battery life of 12 hours. I wasn't unable to test these headphones for 12 hours straight, but I did keep track of various listening sessions, and I feel confident in saying the IFROGZ estimate is possible. That's what's so appealing to me about Impulse Wireless. As someone who frequently travels for work, walking through airports, sitting on a plane, and waiting for an Uber all while listening to music, battery life is of the utmost importance. Sound quality Jason Cipriani/ZDNet When it comes to headphones under the $100 mark, you usually have to make concessions on battery life, sound quality, or both. With the Impulse Wireless headphones, battery life isn't one such concession. However, sound quality isn't necessarily one either. I would put the sound quality of Impulse Wireless just below that of Apple's AirPods, yet above the included wired headphones Apple puts in each iPhone box. Unless you're an audiophile accustomed to hearing everything high, low, mid, and in-between, there's little to complain about in regard to sound quality with the Impulse Wireless headphones. Conclusion After a few days of use, I told my wife when it comes time to buy our children wireless headphones, they are getting Impulse Wireless headphones. Not only does the battery keep going, but they are comfortable and sound quality is a non-issue for my kids. Oh, and the $59 price tag makes it a bit easier to deal with the inevitable stolen or broken pair of headphones. If you want wireless headphones without spending a fortune, the Impulse Wireless headphones should be near the top of your list.

Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7.

It's been two years since Apple topped the global smartphone vendor ranking but its lead is small with only 256,000 units difference. "The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus," said Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner. "This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones — the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; it also benefited from the weakened demand for Samsung's smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea." Another notable tidbit from Gartner's report is the decline of BlackBerry's market share. The company captured 0.0% of the smartphone market in 4Q16 as it turns its focus towards software. At the time of the iPhone's launch 10 years ago, BlackBerry was a dominate force in smartphone arena. Notably, TCL recently acquired the rights to design, manufacturer, and sell BlackBerry branded devices. Can the BlackBerry brand make a comeback?

Reply · Like · Mark as Spam 1 lepaka - 41 minutes ago I would not say it so easily. First impression, we can say it yes Samsung did sh*t and those users flipped to iPhone, but usually the normal long time users are not anymore switchers, one good reason is the Operating System, once they are connected with one platfform they will stick on it. lets just admit that both iOS and Android are good OS systems, we buy our Apps and if we migrate to the other OS, mostly we loose the Apps and we have to buy them again :( if you look careful to the sold quantities, you see big increase from the Chinese branches (Huawei and Oppo), there are the flippers, they can use the same OS as before and get the same level of Phones for much lower price. Those Phones are selling like chipps all over the world for such cheap prices (supermarket promotions), even the Chinese are not buying them.

And then it all came crashing down. He had revolutionized personal computing and created an iconic brand – only to be forced out of the company he had built into a billion-dollar colossus. "I was out -- and very publicly out," he recalled in a commencement speech at Stanford University. "What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating." He added, "I was a very public failure." History is filled with trailblazers who stumbled before finding success. But Steve Jobs' career followed a different arc: a meteoric rise, a humbling fall, and then one amazing comeback, perhaps the most spectacular second act of all time. PHOTOS: Steve Jobs Through The Years "He co-founds Apple Computer when he is 21, and by the time he is 23 he's a millionaire. He becomes legendary. And then, at 30, he has this humiliating defeat," said Alan Deutschman, author of "Change or Die, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs." "But he persists, he has this incredible tenacity. He holds on and he comes back with triumph after triumph, driving this company to new heights, creating the greatest corporate success of our time. It's a unique story." Steve Jobs 'Devastated' When Fired By Apple The founding of Apple Computer is by now legendary. After dropping out of Reed College, Jobs and his buddy Steve Wozniak launched the company from his family's suburban California garage in 1976. In 1981, Apple Computer went public. Just two years later, Apple cracked the Fortune 500 and Jobs recruited John Sculley, the head of Pepsi-Cola, to be its new chief executive. "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?" Jobs famously said. Jobs was Apple's chief visionary, a role that put him in charge of the team developing Apple's next revolutionary product, the Macintosh computer. The Mac debuted in 1984 to rave reviews but disappointing sales, putting a financial strain on the company -– and fraying Jobs' relationship with Sculley. "Jobs basically created his own team to create his own product, the Macintosh. His team actually had its own building. He even flew the pirate flag there. He said, 'It is better to be a pirate, than to be in the navy.' He had this company-within-a-company that became pitted against other parts of the company that actually made money," Deutschman said. The Jobs-Sculley relationship was further strained by complaints from workers on the Mac team about their demanding boss, according to William Simon, co-author of "iCon: Steve Jobs, the Greatest Second Act in the History of Business." Jobs "demanded so much from the people who worked for him. That was part of his greatness," Simon said. "But he drove people too hard. … being gentle and polite was not part of his demeanor." A power struggle erupted between Sculley and Jobs. In the spring of 1985 Apple's board sided with the CEO, removing Jobs from his command of the Macintosh group.

Well, someone like Steve Jobs could not sit in Siberia," Deutschman said. "Jobs told his closest friends and colleagues that it was a betrayal." Jobs left Apple and spent the summer of 1985 in a "midlife crisis, deciding what he wanted to do with his life and flirting with all kinds of possibilities" from entering politics to becoming an astronaut, Deutschman said. Steve Jobs Firing Was Best Thing That Happened to Him In his famous 2005 Stanford speech, Jobs admitted he "really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me." He added, "I even thought about running away from (Silicon) Valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. And so I decided to start over." The day after Labor Day, 1985, Jobs dialed up a former colleague and together they launched a new computer company, NeXT. Jobs also launched Pixar Animation Studios. "I think he wanted to prove his early success at Apple wasn't a fluke, that he wasn't a kid who got lucky and was in the right place at the right time," Deutschman said. "He still had a lot to prove. He still had a chip on his shoulder." In 1996, Apple Computer, by now struggling, acquired NeXT, returning Jobs to the company he helped to create. And the following year Jobs became Apple's CEO, driving the company to its greatest successes, from the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. "The conventional wisdom was that Steve Jobs was a great visionary but not a good businessman," Deutschman said. "But in his second time at Apple he wasn't just a visionary. He made a point of learning how to be a great businessman." Jobs put it this way in his speech to Stanford graduates: "I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter into one of the most creative periods of my life," he said. "I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love." 0 Shares Email Star Comments When Steve Jobs Got Fired +Steve Jobs' Health: A Timeline +Steve Jobs: The World Reacts China carfentanil ban a 'game-changer' for opioid epidemic AP NewsAlert Colorado's 834 million dead trees threaten to worsen fires Gene editing patent ruling sways fortune of biotech hopefuls Yahoo issues another warning in fallout from hacking attacks Yahoo warns users of potential malicious activity on their accounts between 2015 and 2016 Swedish supermarket tests lasers to label organic produce French president calls for more cybersecurity for election " Ohio zoo's polar bear moves to Chicago to find romance " House Republicans seek investigation into potential illegal DOJ leaks " Trump's secretary of labor pick Puzder withdraws nomination " Guilty plea expected involving San Bernardino terror attack Democrats and some Republicans want to stop Trump from lifting Russia sanctions

Those states include Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Wyoming. But manufacturers and carriers like Apple and AT&T don’t think it’s such a good idea. According to a report from Motherboard, Apple representatives plan to be on hand in Nebraska to tell them that repairing your phone is dangerous. Meanwhile, lawmarkers in other states like Illinois and Tennessee are actively considering similar legislation that would allow smartphone owners and third-party repair shops access to parts in order to repair their own smartphones. An Apple lobbyist will be on hand to testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln starting March 9. AT&T was also reported to have been a part of arguing against this bill, but an AT&T representative reached out to state they are aware of the law but won’t be pursuing it. “The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire. Motherboard is protecting the identity of the source because they are not authorized to speak to the press.” This isn’t the first time that a manufacturer has opposed a Right to Repair bill, either. Lobbyists have said broken glass could cause cut fingers when a similar law was put forward in Minnesota last year. local_offer    Apple   Right to Repair   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (13) stars Further Reading Google and others team together to fight the immigration ban Samsung takes a backseat to Apple in smartwatch shipments Samsung's marketshare drops below 20%, first time in 4 years Demand for smartphone components increases The Apple v Samsung patent saga will continue stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertGet a free pizza from T-Mobile and Papa John's closeGet some free pizza courtesy of Papa John’s and T-Mobile Tuesdays Starting on February 14th, and lasting for 4 weeks, T-Mobile has partnered with Papa John’s to give T-Mobile Tuesday users a free large pizza and 25% off regular menu orders. 2 more_vertThe Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirety closeThe Moto G5 Plus has been confirmed after showing up via an online retailer The upcoming Moto G5 Plus has been leaked in its entirely after the device was published through an online retailer.

Wednesday, February 15, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Swift and Objective-C Forever? Jeff Johnson (Hacker News): When Swift became public in 2014, its creator Chris Lattner seemed to claim that Swift and Objective-C would coexist indefinitely. […] The problem is that nobody believes this. And of course Lattner has now left Apple, so he won’t be there to take the criticism is his claim turns out to be false. The consensus among developers is that Apple will eventually deprecate Objective-C, and Swift will become the sole first class language for Cocoa app development. […] You only have to review the history of Apple developer relations to see the long string of deprecations, disappointments, suffering, and broken promises. Objective-C garbage collection, 64-bit Carbon, the Cocoa-Java bridge, Yellow Box for Windows, Dylan. Need I go on? I could go on. Apple evangelists will tell you that Swift is the best programming language ever and then turn around and tell you that we’ve always been at war with Swift. […] The people who think Apple will deprecate Objective-C, how do they think Apple can handle it? Some people suggest that Apple will deprecate Objective-C externally, but they will continue Objective-C development internally and indefinitely. However, I think these people underestimate the problem. Given the amount of Objective-C code Apple has, and the constraints they’re working under, taking the slow road internally to a Swift future would be a very slow road indeed. I don’t see Apple dropping Swift. The technology seems to be sound, and Apple has really put its reputation on the line in a way that it didn’t with the other canceled projects. Plus, unlike those, Swift already has massive adoption outside of Apple. That said, I expect that Objective-C, while not being deprecated, will decline in popularity the same way that Carbon—also officially a first-class coexister—did. I don’t think that Apple will maintain sample code parity for much longer. Johnson is right that there are many open questions about how Apple will manage this transition—if that’s what it is—both internally and externally. It will affect the OS itself, Apple’s apps, the public APIs, and Apple’s own staffing. It’s got to be difficult for Apple to hire and retain WebObjects programers for its internal services, and it could face similar issues, to a lesser extent, if developers continue to switch to Swift.

Apple is currently doing opposite, pushing back against shareholders who are calling for the company to accelerate its efforts. A small group of shareholders led by investor Tony Maldonado have submitted a proposal to Apple asking the company to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy...to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If the proposal is approved, it would require Apple to make diversity a priority when hiring at the top levels of the company. The timeline and initiatives put in place would be up to Apple, the proposal would just get the ball moving a bit faster. Maldonado has suggested tying executive pay to diversity goals—a move that Intel and Microsoft have made—or adopting a policy that would require the company to regularly search for potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. According to the company’s 2016 report, 87 of its 107 executive or senior official positions are held by men, and 88 of those seats are occupied by a white person. It is the second year that Maldonado has submitted his suggestion to increase diversity, though he has additional support in his effort this year thanks to backing from Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that emphasizes what it calls “socially responsible investing.” Related Stories Tech Industry Trails Behind When It Comes To Diversity, New Report Shows Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Despite the support, Maldonado’s suggestion is unlikely to pass, thanks in large part to opposition from Apple. The company has advised shareholders to vote against the proposal, according to a filing from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Apple told shareholders in the letter that it is already exploring diversity efforts across its workforce and has made progress in attracting “more women and underrepresented minorities.” According to Apple, Maldonado’s proposal is “not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple has made strides in its diversity efforts. The company has reportedly removed pay disparities among its employees and has made some progress in its diversity hires. However, much of the changes have happened at the retail and non-tech parts of the company. Maldonado may not get the policy passed this year, but he doesn’t need the full support of shareholders to continue pushing his initiative. Last year the proposal got just over five percent support among shareholders, which was above the three percent threshold required to allow him to submit the idea again this year. He’ll need six percent support to be able to submit again in 2018. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Apple, the richest company in technology, is finally moving into original video content. Apple said at a conference this week that it would introduce its first two television-style video series on Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, in the spring. Other original videos, including scripted dramas, are planned over the next year as the Cupertino company tries to build Apple Music into a cultural platform, said Jimmy Iovine, who heads the $10-a-month service. “There are a bunch of projects. We’re in it. This is what Apple Music is going to be,” Iovine said in an interview. “Apple Music will have video and other things that I can’t talk about. We’re going to be aggressive about it.” Most Popular 1 Concrete wall threatening to fall from SF high-rise stabilized 2 United’s 4-hour flight to nowhere 3 2,000-pound concrete slab threatening to fall from SF building Apple is still primarily a smartphone company. And despite sitting on $246 billion in cash and marketable securities, it insists it has no short-term plans to directly challenge streaming-video giants like Netflix and Amazon, which are increasingly commissioning high-quality original shows to attract and retain subscribers. “We’re not out to buy a bunch of shows,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president for software and services, said during an onstage interview at the Code Media technology conference in Southern California. But Apple does intend to use original video to help distinguish Apple Music, which began in June 2015 and has attracted than 20 million subscribers, from competitors like Spotify. “We’re trying to do things that are unique and cultural,” Cue said. Much like MTV did in its heyday, that means going beyond music. Apple aired a trailer for the first show, “Carpool Karaoke,” at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. The series, a spinoff of James Corden’s running sketch on “The Late Late Show,” will be available to Apple Music subscribers in April. The second program, “Planet of the Apps,” is a reality TV series about iPhone app developers competing to build the next great app. In the show, developers will make 60-second pitches, receive mentoring from musician Will.i.am, actresses Jessica Alba or Gwyneth Paltrow, or social media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk to develop their ideas, then try to persuade a venture capital fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, to invest in them. The winners will get prime billing in Apple’s App Store. “What does it take to be an app developer? Who are they?” Cue said, showing a trailer of the show with Ben Silverman, the veteran TV producer who brought the project to Apple. “Customers are going to love it.” Iovine said that Apple Music was also working on other video projects that are “so opposite” to the first two. “We’re doing dramas,” he said. “They just take much longer.” Also under consideration, he said, is a way for musicians to interact with their audiences. “We’re still experimenting,” he said. Iovine was a successful record producer before joining Apple in 2014 when he and musician Dr. Dre sold headphone-maker Beats Electronics to Apple for $3 billion. At Beats, Iovine said, “I didn’t see a stand-alone model that was going to work.” Apple, by contrast, had vast resources to invest in building a music service. Discussing Apple’s broader video ambitions, Cue said that the company was currently focused on two problems: how to make it easier to discover already-available content, and how to make it easier for video creators to innovate. He dismissed suggestions, however, that Apple wanted to compete with cable and satellite companies by bundling a group of video channels and selling subscriptions to its users. “We are happy doing the things we are doing today,” he said. “Where it goes, we don’t know.” Vindu Goel is a New York Times writer.

The Privacy Enthusiast's Guide To Using An iPhone Thorin Klosowski Feb 16, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple editor's picks ios ios 10 ipad iphone iphone downloads Share Your privacy is important, and now more than ever, it seems like everyone is trying to put eyes on your personal data. That might include advertisers, governments or some weird voyeur in your life. The good news is you can do a few things to your iPhone to make it more secure and privacy friendly without ruining the experience. Illustration by Jim Cooke. First things first: This is an Apple device and it's a smartphone, so you'll never hide yourself completely, but you can do a few things to shore up holes to make sure you're not making it easy for someone to collect your private information. We don't want to give you a false sense of impenetrable privacy here, but the below tips and various apps will at least lock down information as much as possible without disrupting your daily activities. The System Settings You Want to Change for Privacy First, you'll want to go through your general system settings and change a few things. Here's what we recommend, but pick and choose whichever features matter most to you: Set a strong, alphanumeric passcode: Head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and make sure you have a passcode. An alphanumeric passcode that includes both numbers and letters is usually seen as more secure than a numeric one. Don't use Touch ID: Touch ID is great for convenience, but it's a mess when it comes to privacy. Laws are still unclear about this, but right now in the US, police can force you to use your fingerprint to unlock your phone, but they can't make you cough up a passcode. To turn Touch ID off, head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode, and disable the toggle for iPhone Unlock. Delete any widgets that display personal info: iOS 10 introduced lockscreen widgets, which are great, but they also potentially display all kinds of information you might not want easily accessible. Swipe to the right on the lock screen, then tap Edit to remove any widgets you have installed that display private data you don't want a stranger seeing. Disable certain home screen features: Head to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode and look for "Lock screen access". Remove anything that gives someone access to your personal info, like the Today View, Siri and Wallet. You might also want to disable Reply with Message here, since someone could reply to an incoming message without unlocking your phone. Disable tracking: Head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services > System Services and turn off Frequent Locations. This is a Maps feature that tracks where you go often under the guise of improving search. Turn off contact, photo, email, calendar or location access in apps that don't need it: Head to Settings > Privacy. Here, you'll see a list of a bunch of different system services, including location and contacts. These are the iPhone services you can grant apps access to. There might be some apps in here you don't remember authorising or you just don't want any more. Tap a service, then go through and disable any app you don't want to access that service. Remove notification previews: Chances are you don't want to disable notifications completely, but you might want to hide what those notifications display on the lockscreen. Head to Settings > Notifications and then disable previews for Mail and Messages. Turn on two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication is the best way to lock down your accounts so a stranger can't access it, even if they know your password. You can set it up for your Apple ID here. You should use two-factor authentication for all your other accounts as well. Enable Find My iPhone: Find My iPhone is a bit confusing from a privacy standpoint, but most people will benefit more from using it then not. With Find My iPhone enabled, you can track a lost phone using iCloud, and you can wipe your phone remotely. Apple will have access to the same information, so it boils down to whether you want to keep the data out of Apple's hands (in which case you shouldn't use an iPhone at all) or out of a thief's hands. Turn off iCloud backups for select apps: iCloud backup is insanely helpful, and while an extreme privacy nut would disable them in order to keep that data off of Apple's servers, an easier solution is to just turn off certain apps. If you head to Settings > iCloud > Storage > Manage Storage > Backups, you can choose which apps back up to iCloud and which don't. Disable any apps that hold sensitive data. Tweaking a few settings on your iPhone is part of the process. The apps you choose to use are important too. The Productivity Apps That Protect Your Privacy Most productivity apps completely disregard your privacy for the sake of convenience. This isn't a bad thing, as cloud syncing and smart organisation features are exactly the features you want from productivity apps. Still, you might not want all your data to somehow end up public, which is where these security-focused apps come in handy. Some, like a web browser or password manager, are useful all the time, and others, like an encrypted notes app or VPN, are only useful for certain things. None of these apps will keep your data private if you have a corporate managed iPhone with Mobile Device Management set up. If that's the case, get a separate phone and do not use your work phone for anything other than work. Web Browser: Brave or Firefox Focus You'll find a ton of different web browsers in the App Store that claim to protect your privacy, but the two we like the most are Brave and Firefox Focus. By default, Brave uses HTTPS Everywhere. It also blocks scripts, cookies, phishing and pop-ups. You can turn any of those features off and back on again on a per-site basis, which makes it easy to troubleshoot any problems or whitelist sites. Brave's desktop apps have an odd payment system to pay out publishers, but it doesn't seem to be in place on mobile. Brave can be a replacement to Safari, and has the features you need in a browser, like bookmarks, history and password manager support. Firefox Focus is very similar to Brave, but goes a step further. It blocks trackers, social media and cookies. Firefox Focus also makes it easy to wipe your browser history with a couple of taps, remove all passwords and delete any cookies. Firefox Focus doesn't feature tabbed browsing, so Firefox Focus is best as a supplement to Safari when you want to keep your browsing off the record. HTTPS Everywhere Updates To Keep You Secure On Thousands More Sites Chrome/Firefox/Opera. Using HTTPS is essential for keeping your personal information safe, especially when browsing on public Wi-Fi. Free extension HTTPS Everywhere recently updated with thousands more rules, ensuring HTTPS is enabled on as many sites as possible. Read more Email: ProtonMail or Gmail Email is a little harder to tackle from a privacy angle and what you do here depends on why you're concerned about privacy. If you don't want anyone looking at the emails you're sending, then you'll want to set up an email address with ProtonMail. You cannot use the ProtonMail iOS app without a ProtonMail account, but it is the most secure and private app out there. ProtonMail encrypts every message you send, which means the company can't even read your emails. If you send messages between two ProtonMail accounts, this happens automatically. If you send an email to someone not on ProtonMail, they will get a link to the message that needs a password in order to read it. If you need to keep email messages private and secure, ProtonMail is the app you want to use. For everything else, keep on using the Gmail account you've always used. Despite Google's data mining, the Gmail app does a good job of keeping your private data out of the hands of anyone else. Every email is over SSL, Gmail encrypts email from sender to receiver and two-factor authentication can secure your email in case you lose your device. Of course, Google has its eyes in there, but if you're concerned about some random person finding your phone then Gmail is a solid bet. Aside from a service like ProtonMail or running your own server, there's no great way to keep email private, at least on your phone. In that case, Gmail's at least a secure option. Messaging: Signal or WhatsApp When it comes to secure and private messaging, you have two popular choices in Signal and WhatsApp. Both feature end-to-end encryption, neither stores messages on their servers after they're delivered, both have voice-calling as well as messaging and both are super easy to use. Which app is better for you depends on where your contacts are, because both parties in a chat need to use the same app. Signal does have a few added security features over WhatsApp. Signal doesn't store metadata, but WhatsApp does. This means while WhatsApp doesn't know the contents of a message, it does know who the messages are between and records the data, which it could then hand over to law enforcement with a warrant. Signal does not store any of this. If you back up your iPhone using iCloud, Signal will not store your messages in the backup, but WhatsApp will. Your iCloud backups are encrypted so this shouldn't matter, but you'd typically want to keep this data local when possible. None of this matters to most of us, but it's all worth noting nonetheless. Password Manager: LastPass or 1Password The best way to keep someone out of your various online accounts is to have a good, strong password. The best passwords are too complicated for most of us to remember them, which is why you should use a password manager. We like LastPass and 1Password. Your password manager generates random passwords for all your sites, which makes it pretty hard for anyone to get into your accounts to snoop around. This has the dual benefit of security and privacy, since you won't know the passwords to your accounts, making it harder for anyone else to get to them. LastPass is free and syncs data across platforms. 1Password is $5.99/month if you want syncing, but can also store your password vault locally if you don't want that data on a server. Lifehacker Faceoff: The Best Password Managers, Compared You have lots of options for password managers, and when it comes to your security, you want the best possible tool for the job. Let's take a look at some of the most popular password managers and compare them side-by-side so you can pick the one that's right for you. Read more VPN: Hideman, Tunnelbear or NordVPN A VPN is an easy way to secure and encrypt your basic web usage. When you connect to a VPN, all your traffic is secure, which is most useful when you're on public networks. When you're at a cafe and on their Wi-Fi, you can connect to your VPN, then secure your traffic on a public network. This way, nobody can snoop on your traffic. You have a ton of options for good VPNs, but when it comes to basic usability, we like Hideman, NordVPN and Tunnelbear on iOS. All three require a monthly fee if you use a lot of data, but they also give you some free data, which is plenty for the occasional public web browsing at a coffee shop, hotel or airport. Why You Need A VPN (And How To Choose One) You might know what a virtual private network (VPN) is, but the odds of you actually using one are low. You really should be using a VPN — ultimately, you may end up seeing it as just as vital as your internet connection. We'll tell you why, explain how to choose a VPN provider and list five that are worth considering. Read more Notes: Keeply To be clear here, if you have sensitive data you want private forever, you shouldn't keep it on your phone. You also should not store it on a cloud service like Dropbox or Evernote, since no cloud storage is completely secure unless you go through and encrypt all your data ahead of time. If you have some stupid photos or notes you just want away from prying eyes, then Keeply is a good app to protect your data. Keeply gives you the option to link it up with Dropbox or keep data on your phone and lets you set up a special PIN to lock the app. Keeply stores notes, photos, passwords and credit cards. I'd stick to only using it for notes and photos personally, but alongside the PIN protection is also encrypts all data, so it should be pretty safe. What matters here is the data in Keeply never leaves your phone (unless you turn on Dropbox sync), so there's no chance it will end up online. Cloud Storage: SpiderOak Cloud storage is a bit tough to do securely and privately, but your best bet is SpiderOak. SpiderOak's "zero knowledge" privacy policy makes it so encryption takes place locally, so they have no idea what you're storing with them. The service doesn't have free tier like Dropbox or Google Drive, but the service is priced to compete, with $US5 ($7)/month getting you 100GB of storage. The Best Cloud Storage Services That Protect Your Privacy Cloud storage is easy to come by. Dozens of services shovel lots of free space to you just for signing up. But which of those services are looking at the files you upload, and which services encrypt your personal data? Let's take a look. Read more The iPhone app isn't nearly as robust as something like Dropbox, but it does maintain SpiderOak's level of security. If you need a secure online storage option to sync files up and make them accessible from your phone, SpiderOak is your best bet. With that, your normal iPhone usage should be generally private and secure from people both online and who access to your phone. There are often ways around all this, but at least you won't be making it easy for people to track you. Comments Jamie @jamie_parris Feb 16, 2017, 8:40am Turn off iCloud backups for select apps Not really privacy related, but it is also worth turning off apps here to save some space in iCloud. Having read this article, I noticed I only had a small amount of space left in iCloud due to iPhone and iPad backups. Most apps these days have their own login e.g Your Optus/Telstra Usage App, Various Shopping Site Apps, Betting Apps, Your Bank Account Apps... why do they need to be backed up? Answer is they don't. At most you might loose an app preference on restoring from backup. Reply 0 Daniel McCormack @reaidstar Feb 16, 2017, 9:02am Ensure that when you Turn On Two-Factor Authentication that you keep your Trusted Phone Number up to date, and Trusted Devices on hand. Apple has no control over Resetting your Password if you've forgotten it, and leaves it to an Automated System to Verify your Identity and Recover your Password if you don't have any of the requirements to Reset the Password, that can take a minimum of 3 business days, with no specific deadline for Recovery Also note, the GPS for allowing or disallowing a sign-in can be drastically inaccurate, and is usually based on where your Reception Tower, or Wi-Fi Exchange is coming from.

By Emily Bary Feb. 15, 2017 1:39 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large PayPal turned Visa and Mastercard into its partners, instead of its “frenemies.” Illustration: Getty Images PayPal has a strong track record of diffusing threats within the payments industry, and that has one analyst feeling optimistic that mobile wallets like Apple Pay won’t be a problem for the company. More from Barron’s Next Under Armour’s Worst Days Could Be Behind It Why a T-Mobile Merger With Sprint Looks Less Likely Today When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare Merchants can now add buttons for Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other digital wallets to their sites, but it’s hard to get people to change their behaviors. PayPal has been around since the late 1990s, much longer than all of the newcomers, and it has about 200 million users who already store payment information with the service. “There’s a difference between competition and disruption,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg tells Barron’s Next. “None of these competing solutions have brought compelling enough value propositions to get consumers to switch.” The company’s latest quarterly results didn’t show any indication of Apple Pay hurting its business, even as Apple itself touted strong growth for Apple Pay. PayPal likely doesn’t have to worry about Visa or Mastercard either, he says. In the beginning, the company tried to get users to pay in ways that bypassed the credit-card networks, but it’s since changed its tune. PayPal and the card companies went from being “frenemies with undertones of real resentment” to partners. That’s key, says Kupferberg, because it means Visa and Mastercard aren’t waking up every day trying to destroy PayPal. It also means less friction on the consumer end, making people more willing to use the service. Another thing working in PayPal’s favor: its Braintree payment-processing platform. Even when consumers do choose to use Apple Pay, their payment may go through Braintree. That doesn’t bring the company as much money as having someone pay directly with PayPal, but it’s something. Kupferberg called PayPal’s $800 million purchase of Braintree in 2013 “one of the best acquisitions in modern payments history.” It’s probably worth far more today, given that smaller rival Stripe is now worth $9 billion. Braintree powers payments for major startups like Uber and Airbnb. With 70% to 80% of global transactions still done in cash, there’s a big opportunity for digital-payments companies to gain traction. Looking ahead, as far as winners in the industry, Kupferberg told us PayPal “is at the top of the list.” He thinks shares can hit $52, 25% above a recent $41.70. Big Picture: The overwhelming majority of transactions are still made via cash, and PayPal is still poised to benefit from a shift toward more digital payments.

Joe Mullin - Feb 15, 2017 8:01 pm UTC Enlarge / Various versions of the Apple Watch are displayed at a December 2016 press conference in an Apple store in Saint-Germain, Paris. Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images reader comments 30 Share this story A patent troll that has sued more than 80 companies by laying broad claims to Internet-connected "wearables" may be nearing the end of its road. The patent appeals board at the US Patent and Trademark Office has agreed to reconsider 16 patent claims owned by Sportbrain Holdings, LLC. The Patent Office's decision comes just three days after Sportbrain filed a lawsuit against Apple (PDF). Taking on its highest-profile target yet, Sportbrain claims that the Apple Watch violates US Patent No. 7,454,002, titled "Integrating personal data capturing functionality into a portable computing device and a wireless communication device." Further ReadingUnified Patents files legal challenges against top three patent trolls of 2016In dozens of lawsuits, Sportbrain's lawyers have argued that its patent entitles it to collect royalties on a huge range of devices and software products that gather user fitness information. Beginning in January 2016, Sportbrain unleashed a torrent of lawsuits against companies with connected watches and other wearables, like Garmin, Fitbit, Pebble, and Nike (PDF). It also sued tech companies like Apple, Samsung, and HP, and watchmakers including Timex, Tag Heuer, and Nixon. It has sued over software, too, filing cases against popular fitness apps like Strava and even Aetna (PDF). Sportbrain argues that the health insurance company infringes its patent with its "Get Active" online platform. “We will slingshot our IP at the offenders” Sportbrain Holdings, LLC follows a familiar track for patent-holding companies—a demise after the first dot-com bust and then a reincarnation more than a decade later as a patent enforcement company. In the year 2000, SportBrain Inc. launched a kind of early wearable, a smart pedometer called the SportBrain tracker that connected to a computer via a special "SportPort." "We believe the SportBrain personal fitness assistant (PFA) should become an essential part of everyone's lives," said Andreas Bibl, SportBrain CEO and cofounder, in a press release sent out that year. "As a nation, we need to get moving." SportBrain's website in 2011 advertised a kind of smart pedometer. Today, the company has shut down and turned to patent enforcement. www.sportbrain.com via archive.orgBy 2001, Bibl's company, which filed the '002 patent application, was out of business. After an apparent change in ownership, the reformulated SportBrain Inc. released the iStep X1 pedometer at the end of 2004. There's no apparent press coverage after 2005, however, and there's no evidence that the SportBrain pedometer made any inroads in the smartphone era. The owner of the second incarnation of SportBrain appears to be a man named Harry Heslop, who's a co-defendant in the inter partes review just instituted at the Patent Office. Patent Office records show that Heslop moved the patents from SportBrain Inc. into Sportbrain Holdings LLC in January of 2016, when the campaign of lawsuits began. Heslop couldn't be reached for this story, and the attorney for SportBrain Holdings didn't respond to a request for comment. The lead inventor of the '002 patent, Deane Gardner, also didn't respond to a call requesting comment. "As one of the first to market, successfully traded for 10 years, and then [to be] squeezed out by a plethora of Goliaths was unquestionably devastating," Heslop told Law360 when his litigation began last year. "As the 'David' in this story, we will slingshot our IP at all the offenders and unleash the full extent of the law until justice is served." The “Anti-Troll” A petition for inter partes review (IPR) against the '002 patent was filed last year by Unified Patents, a defense-oriented patent company that bills itself as "The Anti-Troll." It was part of Unified's campaign to challenge the "three most prolific patent trolls" of 2016: Sportbrain, Shipping and Transit, and Uniloc USA. The case against Sportbrain Holdings has passed a key hurdle, with the Patent Office agreeing last week to institute an investigation over all 16 of the claims in the '002 patent. In its decision (PDF), the Patent Office finds that it's likely that two earlier patents teach "collecting, storing, and compiling performance data at a web server." A Nike patent filed in 1999 by designer Albert Shum, now at Microsoft, describes collecting use information for a product, "such as an article of footwear," and offering "rewards" based on the level of use. In 1998, a company called Liquid Spark filed for a patent on a GPS-based performance monitor. IPR proceedings, created as part of the 2011 America Invents Act, have proven effective at knocking out patents at lower costs than traditional court proceedings. Most IPRs that are instituted by the Patent Office result in some or all of the patent claims being thrown out. "This is a great example of a patent that we believe is invalid, and never should have issued in the first place," said Unified Patents CEO Kevin Jakel in an interview with Ars. "We're happy the USPTO instituted the IPR, and the patent is well on its way to ultimately being canceled."   Joe Mullin Joe has covered the intersection of law and technology, including the world's biggest copyright and patent battles, since 2007.

At a Goldman Sachs conference yesterday, Apple’s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, responded to a question on manufacturing by indicated that Apple’s focus is on creating jobs in other sectors. “One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade,” Maestri said. “We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country — in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain.” “It’s very, very difficult to speculate at this point.” Maestri says that “it’s very, very difficult to speculate” on Apple’s actions given that the Trump administration is yet to implement any changes that would encourage US manufacturing. But his comments still suggest that Apple is hoping to discourage talk of shifting manufacturing operations to the United States, which would be a difficult and expensive change. Though Trump hasn’t brought it up since taking office, he’s been calling out Apple for building products outside the US even since before he stepped onto the campaign trail. In November, after the election, Trump said he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook about the issue. He mentioned the issue up again, briefly, in January, just days before his inauguration. “I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” Trump said during a speech last March. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” There’s been some indication that Apple is at least looking into bringing more manufacturing to the US, though nothing firm so far. Apple has also been assembling its Mac Pro computers in the US since 2013. This is a subject Apple has addressed and deflected for a long time. Steve Jobs is said to have once told President Obama that that manufacturing jobs “aren’t coming back.” And Tim Cook has said that the US just doesn’t have enough specialized workers. “You can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in,” he told 60 Minutes in 2015. “In China, you would have to have multiple football fields.” Asked for comment, Apple directed The Verge to a New York Times article about US jobs it’s created. That article contains a statement similar to Maestri’s remarks, saying that Apple has created 2 million US jobs since the launch of the iPhone. The company also said it made “the unique decision to keep and expand” its call centers in the US. “We plan to continue to invest and grow across the US,” the statement concluded. Maestri confirms that Apple is a fan of lower taxes At the conference, Maestri was also asked about another favorite subject of Apple’s: bringing foreign cash back to the US. Maestri repeated a position we’ve heard from Apple again and again, that it believes taxes are too high. “Hopefully, there is a good chance that something is going to happen this year,” he said. Maestri also discussed Apple’s view on a potential border tax, which is something that’s been floated by the Trump administration. Noting that it was hard to comment without seeing any legislation, Maestri said that “it is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would be good for the US economy because it is a tax that would end up burdening the end consumer.” More From The Verge The Hawai’ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google’s Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google Homes Lady Gaga opened her Super Bowl performance with a protest anthem Trump is turning Elon Musk into a crony capitalist Why the sounds of eating make some people so angry Now Trending I've been doing Windows screenshots wrong this whole time Exclusive: The Caavo streaming box is built on game-changing machine vision for TV Nokia’s legendary 3310 rumored to return at MWC This Article has a component height of 15.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Shutterstock Tim Cook: Augmented Reality is as big of a technology as the smartphone Yoni Heisler @edibleapple February 12th, 2017 at 1:30 PM Share Tweet While Apple is typically very cautious when discussing upcoming products and technologies, the company’s interest in augmented reality is hardly a well-kept secret. In addition to some notable hires in the AR space, Tim Cook seems to wax poetic about the potential of AR every single time the topic comes up. While it remains to be seen if Apple’s interest in AR will ultimately manifest in a pair of AR-powered glasses or perhaps an iPhone with some intriguing built-in AR capabilities, it’s probably only a matter of time before we see what Apple’s engineers and researchers have been cooking up over at 1 Inifinte Loop. Underscoring the degree to which Apple views AR as an incredibly important and powerful technology, Tim Cook, during a recent interview with The Independent, boldly claimed that AR is as big of an idea as the smartphone was way back when. “I’m excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out,” Cook explained, “AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently. Most people don’t want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can’t do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.” Notably, this isn’t the first time that Cook has championed AR at the expense of VR. This is particularly interesting given some calls for Apple to enter the VR space, especially now that other high-tech companies like Facebook, Samsung, Google and others have entered the space. Incidentally, we’ve seen a handful of reports claiming that Apple will release a pair of AR-powered glasses by 2018. Articulating why he believes that AR is as big of an idea as the smartphone, Cook’s enthusiasm was hard to miss: “The smartphone is for everyone,” Cook added, “we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge. I get excited because of the things that could be done that could improve a lot of lives. And be entertaining. I view AR like I view the silicon here in my iPhone, it’s not a product per se, it’s a core technology. But there are things to discover before that technology is good enough for the mainstream. I do think there can be a lot of things that really help people out in daily life, real-life things, that’s why I get so excited about it.” All in all, it’s starting to look like the next two years may include a few watershed moments for Apple. Aside from Apple’s ongoing interest in AR, the upcoming 2017 iPhone 8 is starting to look like it will be worth every bit of the $1,000 that Apple will reportedly price it at.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Beyond the 160 Million OLED Displays already Secured with Samsung, Apple is now in Talks with China's BOE | Main | Apple Set to Fight 'Right to Repair' Legislation in Nebraska » February 15, 2017 Apple's Need for Slave Labor Clearly Overrides their Argument that a U.S. Plant is Impossible due to Supply Chain Issues   There have been many articles written about Apple's iPhone slave labor camps in China over the years and at the bottom of today's report I've listed a few in a random list. The BBC had announced on December 15, 2015 that they had created a documentary called "Apple's Broken Promises." You could review the full BBC documentary here. Below is just a snippet of that documentary.   Patently Apple wrote a damning report against the BBC report titled "The BBC Report About Apple is Motivated by Politics and Unions." At the end of that report I listed a series of other reports that I had written on the matter to that date – all pro Apple.   At one point I had read in a report (which is verified in one of the reports listed below) that Apple's CEO Tim Cook actually made the argument that making iPhones in China had nothing to do with slave labor but rather the fact that there was a sophisticated supply chain in China that couldn't be reproduced in the United States. No supply chain, no plant. Great argument. Two thumbs up.   But that myth was obliterated with Apple's decision to open a plant with Wistron in India. The battle royale with the Indian governement to date has been centered on a series of concessions with the leading one being that Apple will make iPhones in India but be allowed to import parts from China without penalty because there's no supply chain to speak of India and there won't be one for well over a decade, if ever.   To make this point crystal clear, this very subject just happened to come up again yesterday when Apple's CFO Luca Maestri spoke at Goldman Sachs investor conference. The Financial Times reporter stated in his report that Maestri suggested that it would be difficult for Apple to increase its manufacturing base in the US, which is one of President Donald Trump's key policies. Maestri stated that "Essentially the supply chain for the tech industry is not in the US today." Apple's propaganda continues.   So why is Apple racing to open a plant in India and fight it every inch of the way in the U.S. even with all-new tax breaks for Apple by the Trump administration. If it's not really about a supply chain as proven in India, then what's the hold back? One of the main reasons is the need to tap into slave labor just as the Chinese unions have been arguing for years.   By refusing to open an iPhone plant in the U.S. Apple knows all too well that the iPhone is likely to be hit with a huge import tax that Trump has promised. On that subject Apple's CFO Maestri stated yesterday that "It is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would be good for the US economy. It is a tax that would end up burdening the end consumer."   Well, it'll only be a burden Mr. Maestri because Apple refuses to open a U.S. plant. So whine away Mr. Maestri, because Apple can't have their cake and eat it too.   It's hard for me to believe that Apple is openly willing to play political games on this issue leaving U.S. Apple fans to eat the penalty tax. Of course Cook will make it Trump's fault, but we know better.  I love Apple the company, but I won't pay a 40% tax on an iPhone over politics and I suspect millions will feel the same way. Who knew that Apple's CEO was a fan of Russian Roulette and willing to play with consumer and Wall Street loyalty like that? That's a game Mr. Cook may surprisingly not win.   If anything, their stubborn stance could open a huge door for a competitor like Microsoft to open. Not all iPhone users are purists and cultists. For many young fans its about the 'cool factor' and it's not going to be cool to get hit with a huge consumer tax courtesy of Apple's CEO. A local company making a quality smartphone could be a big winner here.   In the end I'll continue to cheer Apple on as always, applaud their patented ideas and laugh at Samsung and their competition whenever possible. But after years of swallowing Apple's take on slave labor, I give up. China's unions may have had it right all along and I was defending the undefendable. It seems to be more about slave labor than I could have ever imagined. The supply chain argument sure sounded good, didn't it? But recent moves by Apple have proven it all to be a myth. And you can't put the Genie back in the bottle once you see a lie for what it is.   Will Apple's CEO surprise us all with news of a U.S. Plant later this year or did Apple's CFO just take the wind out of that balloon? I suspect it's the latter.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

While Apple has been hard at work putting the finishing touches on the campus, which is slated to open later this year, Minecraft player Alex Westerlund has been building a Minecraft version of Apple's second campus. According to Westerlund, building the campus in Minecraft took him 232 hours over the course of a year. He used construction plans along with topographical maps to create an accurate rendition of the campus, down to the land it's built on. As can be seen in the video, the ring-shaped main building has been faithfully recreated, with its curved glass windows, massive doors, solar panels, window awnings, and more. Westerlund says the main building is "absolutely massive" at 469 blocks across, with every hill, path, and orchard placed according to construction plans. The courtyard of the building includes trails, two cafes, a cafeteria patio, cherry trees, a fitness center, and a fountain, while the interior features atriums and a huge cafeteria built to match a publicly released rendering. Apple's real second campus is nearing completion. According to the latest drone video, construction crews are hard at work on landscaping and are wrapping up work on solar panels and a nearby research and development facility. The campus is expected to be finished in 2017, but exactly when employees will move in remains unclear. Westerlund tells MacRumors that as Apple continues work on its campus, he'll continue to flesh out his virtual version, putting in up to four hours of active building time per day.

 These ‘smart’ headphones let you listen to music and charge your iPhone 7 at the same time Jeff Dunn Feb. 15, 2017, 2:01 PM 3,497 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Pioneer Rayz Plus earphones. Pioneer It’s been five months since Apple omitted the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone 7, and if Apple’s latest sales figures are any indication, the world seems to have gotten over it. That doesn’t make its removal any less annoying, though. Case in point: On its own, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus do not allow you to charge your phone and listen to music simultaneously. If you’re, say, on the go, and your phone is running out of juice, you can’t plug the device into a portable battery and listen to your playlist at the same time. There are ways around the conundrum today: You can either buy a pair of wireless headphones — and Apple has plenty to sell you — or pay for an appropriate dock or dongle. Apple sells one of the former for $50, though there are third-party options that go for less. Either way, it’s an extra step. With its new Rayz Plus earphones, though, electronics maker Pioneer is building one of those dongles directly into a pair of headphones. They still connect to an iPhone via a Lightning connector, but toward the end of their cable is a small adapter with its own Lightning port, into which you can plug a charging cable and pass power through to the iPhone itself. The pass-through charging is only available with the $150 Rayz Plus, but Pioneer is selling a $100 Rayz model too. There’s a handful of fairly smart features on both, including a programmable “smart button” that lets you open select apps, noise cancelling tech that’s supposed to adjust to your ears and environment, a “HearThru” mode that lets in ambient noise as your music is playing (a la the Bragi Headphone and others), and an AirPods-like feature that automatically pauses what's playing once you remove an earbud from your ears. Pioneer says it’s able to do all of this thanks to a new chip from Oregon-based semiconductor company Avnera that is said to conserve more power than usual. This would get at the big concern with Lightning headphones: All the tricks that a digital connection like Lightning can provide still need power. If you don’t want to bulk up a headphone with a separate battery pack, then that power needs to come from the phone, which can then deplete the phone’s battery life. Exactly how much power the Rayz chews up from the iPhone, and whether or not its smart features are even worth it, will be unclear until we’re able to test the device further. None of this gets at how good the earphones actually sound, either. And the fact that "charging while listening" is now a problem that needs solving is still strange. But if nothing else, they may address one of the more irritating side effects of Apple’s decision to kill the headphone jack. Pioneer has not specified a release date for either model just yet.  SEE ALSO: The 11 best wireless headphones you can buy NOW WATCH: 7 hidden iPhone tricks that only power users know about Loading video...

Apple will amaze us one again this September with an iPhone like never before. The iPhone 8 is expected to consist of various updated features, technical improvements, and will celebrate Apple’s 10th anniversary. Though the new features may be rumors because nothing is concrete yet, the expected features will include an OLED (light emitting diode) display, a glass body and a faster A11 processor. It will also have an edge-to-edge display, no home button and wireless charging. These features are dissimilar to the past iPhones and demonstrate the uniqueness and pronounced upgrade of the new phone. This iPhone is specifically distinguished from the iPhone 7 because it may lack aluminum and will instead be stainless steal. The design of this iPhone is also dissimilar from the past iPhones considering it will be touch ID and the camera might be built directly into the display. With that being said, there will be no home button and it might appear as a mere piece of glass. Additionally, the flexible plastic OLED will make for a thinner device and fortunately, consume less battery power. Other exciting features may include more water resistance, long-range wireless charging like we’ve never seen before and even a dual lens camera. Furthermore, the iPhone 8 is expected to consist of biometric additions like iris, facial, or gesture recognition. Clearly, this 5-inch premium model is going to go viral with these distinctive features if the rumors are true. Though many of these features may be rumors, Apple’s iPhones hardly ever disappoint and we are excited to see what’s in store at the Apple Store this fall.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is a patent for a new smart keyboard. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Wednesday. Smart Keyboard: Apple has filed a patent for a new smart keyboard, reports MacRumors. The new smart keyboard that appears in the patent seems to be designed with social media in mind. The patent shows that it includes “Share” and “Emoji” buttons. The smart keyboard also includes a “Magnifying Glass” key that could serve multiple functions. This includes a short press for searches, two short presses for shortcuts and holding it to bring up Siri. South Korea: An Apple Pay launch in South Korea is still in its early stages, AppleInsider notes. While the tech company has met with some officials in the country to explain how the system works, it hasn’t been taking part in detailed discussions, yet. A recent report also claims that it still hasn’t set up a schedule for any meetings of this nature. A card company in South Korea has confirmed that this is the case and says that it has only had early talks with AAPL. Right to Repair: A new report claims that Apple is planning to fight “right to repair” legislation, reports Motherboard. Nebraska state legislature is considering the bill and an inside source claims that AAPL will step up against it. The legislation would make it so that customers would have access to repair parts and service manuals for the company’s devices. AAPL has fought against similar bills in the past.

The Right to Repair movement is gaining momentum, lobbying companies to let consumers fix their own devices. Right to Repair legislation has recently been drafted in the state of Nebraska. If it becomes law, Apple and its rivals would need to supply repair manuals and official parts to customers and third-party repair shops. Consumers with the necessary technical expertise would be able to repair their own devices, without having to return them to the manufacturer. Electronics teardown specialists like iFixit have been helping people to mend their own gadgets for years. Recently, companies including Apple have made it harder to dismantle products though, using screw types that cannot easily be removed. Internal connectors have also become more complex, making it difficult to correctly reassemble devices. The right to repair movement argues consumers shouldn't have to pay retail prices to fix broken devices. Led by Repair.org, a body of independent repair shops, supporters are vocally critical of tech companies who make it difficult to mend new products. Manufacturers are lobbying lawmakers with counterarguments though, including claims that customers could hurt themselves while repairing devices. Last year, lobbyists in Minnesota suggested users may cut their fingers on broken glass if attempting a smartphone screen replacement. Motherboard reports that one of the U.S. phone companies plans to contest the new legislation in Nebraska by implying repairs could cause batteries to ignite. Apple plans to attend the same hearing, according to the news site's sources. The company will send a representative or lobbyist to testify against the bill, likely also working along the lines of personal injury and trade secrets. Manufacturers have expressed concern that service manuals could detail the inner workings of their products, despite teardowns being widely available online. More than anything, the right to repair movement represents consumers demanding more control over the products they buy. The days are now gone of being able to mend anything and everything with a basic set of tools. Apple and other industry leaders are quick to suggest the best repairs are done in-house but often the same work can be done a lot cheaper elsewhere. Nebraska is now one of eight American states where right to repair bills are being drafted. Last month, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas and Wyoming announced similar legislation that could force companies, in and outside of tech, to open their products to customers. Repair.org is intending to push bills in as many states as possible, making it harder for manufacturers to simply knock down the lobbyists.

The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

Trump's Android Phone a Hack Risk? Next Article > Encrypted Messaging Service 'Signal' Introduces Video Calling in Beta By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Users of the Signal encrypted messaging and voice calling service, famously employed by National Security Agency (NSA) contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, can now also use the app for encrypted video chats. Open Whisper Systems, the software company that developed Signal, announced new public beta support for encrypted video calling yesterday. The release for both Android and iOS is built on "an entirely new calling infrastructure" that should also improve the voice call quality of the service, the company said. First released in 2014, the Signal app is based on the Signal cryptographic protocol, which is also used for secure messaging by Google Allo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Such encrypted services are often used to provide secure communications for news tips and conversations between sources and journalists, among other purposes. 'Entirely New Calling Infrastructure' Being rolled out in stages to enable feedback about its performance, the latest version of Signal also brings together what were once two different Open Whisper Systems applications, one to support texting and one designed to enable real-time voice calls, company founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote yesterday in a blog post. "This represents an entirely new calling infrastructure for Signal, and should increase voice call quality as well," Marlinspike said. "We think it's a big improvement, but we're rolling it out in stages to collect feedback from people with different devices, networks, and regions in order to ensure there are no surprises when it's enabled for everyone by default." The new encrypted video calling will only work between two Signal users who have both enabled the beta application. iPhone users will also be able to take advantage of new capabilities introduced with last year's iOS 10 update so they can answer incoming Signal calls with one touch directly from the lock screen. Encryption Controversies Back in the News Media organizations, including The New York Times, use Signal to encourage encrypted news tips from readers and other sources. The application has also been endorsed by Snowden, who in 2013 provided journalists with a large cache of classified documents detailing the widespread use of surveillance by the NSA. The mainstream use of encryption to protect electronically transmitted information has long been a source of frustration for many in the intelligence, law enforcement and political communities. FBI Director James Comey and former CIA Director James Woolsey are among officials who have pushed for security backdoors that would allow intelligence agencies to bypass encryption protections. Controversies about encrypted communications have also erupted again in the news recently. For example, BuzzFeed reported yesterday that two Republicans in Congress have called for an investigation on the Environmental Protection Agency's use of encryption. Meanwhile, other news outlets reported this week that some White House staffers have been using an encrypted chat app called Confide that automatically deletes messages after they are received and read.

BOE would be the first display manufacturer outside of Japan and South Korea to supply displays for an iPhone, and they’re also working on a flexible AMOLED display. The report states that Apple is looking for “next-generation displays for future iPhones” from BOE and is currently testing the displays. Apple is reportedly testing OLED panels with BOE as it struggles to source the tech for the upcoming iPhone 8. Though, it’s highly likely that BOE will miss the launch of the iPhone 8 this year, but will continue to work with Apple for the 2018 iPhone. BOE is currently in the process of building out two OLED display factories in Sichuan, according to today’s report. The company reportedly spent $14.5 billion in order to build out these factories.

Motherboard reports that Nebraska will have a hearing next month with Apple formally opposing the bill. According to the source, an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln on March 9. AT&T will also argue against the bill, the source said. The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire … It’s unknown what arguments Apple will be using, whether it’s safety concerns or the complexity of their devices in recent years. Nebraska is reportedly one of the eight states in the U.S. that are considering passing this bill. However, Apple has successfully lobbied against this bill in New York in the past. Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, says that safety concerns is something that lobbyists have used in the past and that she plans on poking fun at the idea during the hearing. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gordon-Byrne. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and “plans to bring band aids.” Repair.org believes that if one state is able to pass the bill, manufacturers will just give in to the idea, citing similar outcomes in the car industry years ago. In 2012, a Massachusetts law guaranteeing the right to repair automobiles became de-facto national legislation after car manufacturers decided to comply with the law nationwide rather than continue to fight burgeoning legislation in other states.

But the lead is razor thin. Apple shipped about 77.04 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, Gartner estimated, just ahead of the 76.78 million shipped by Samsung. That means Apple has 17.9 percent of the global smartphone market share, narrowly above Samsung's 17.8 percent. It's the smallest difference Gartner has recorded. This time last year, Samsung had nearly 21 percent of the market — but the massive global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 device slowed down sales in the third and fourth quarters, said Gartner research director Anshul Gupta. Samsung, unlike Apple, has a wide range of high- and low-end phones and has used that variety to dominate the global market. Now that Apple has had better-than-expected sales of the high-end iPhone 7 Plus, the companies are closer than ever, separated by 256,000 units, according to Gartner. The data square with research from other firms that track the industry, like Counterpoint Research. Tweet: Huawei, Oppo & Vivo (HOV) registered stellar growth in 2016 together shipping 300 million+ smartphones Apple and Samsung face mounting competition from Chinese smartphone brands Huawei, Oppo and BBK, which grew their collective share by 7 percentage points in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner. "Huawei is poised to reduce the gap further with the No. 2 global smartphone vendor," Gupta said. Huawei shipped about 40.8 million phones in the fourth quarter, according to Gartner, and announced a U.S. launch in January. Huawei hopes the launch will propel it to No. 2 within two years, Richard Yu, director and CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, has said.

 Apple’s 'vision' for its next big thing convinced a big company to sell itself for cheap Kif Leswing Feb. 15, 2017, 1:18 PM 5,443 facebook linkedin twitter email print Reuters Apple CEO Tim Cook said last week that augmented reality can be as big as the iPhone.  It's not the first time that Cook has talked up Apple's plans in AR, a technology that integrates computer graphics and internet information with the real world — think of a next-generation Google Glass or "Pokémon Go," or the fun face filters on Snapchat.  Whatever Apple ends up doing in AR, it's likely to include Metaio technology. Apple bought the company in 2015, as one of the first AR companies it purchased in a mini-run of AR acquisitions.  In fact, Apple may have gotten a deal on Metaio because of its vision for the technology, Bloomberg reports in a longer story about Apple's M&A strategy.  From Bloomberg: That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. This raises the question: What's Apple's vision for the technology, and why did it allow them to get a good price for a company that had been around for over a decade and had active clients, including major companies? A German document confirming Apple's purchase of the company suggests that Apple paid a euro per share, or roughly 30 million Euros for the company, although that may only have encompassed part of the price of the company. There are other signs that Metaio could be critical to Apple's AR products or strategy. Metaio's former CEO, Thomas Alt, changed his job title last summer to "Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team" at Apple.  Since the Metaio deal closed, Apple has bought other AR startups including Flyby Media and Indoor.io. Apple has also looked at other AR technologies, but no other deals have yet surfaced.  Here's a video of what Metaio technology was capable of before it was purchased. What's Apple's vision for this technology? Did you work for Metaio? Know anything about Apple and AR?

Image:  MARCIO JOSE SANCHEZ/ASSOCIATED PRESS By Kerry Flynn2017-02-15 18:11:33 UTC Apple should be working faster. Not on building the next iPhone, or even creating the next hit TV show, but rather, on increasing the diversity at the company.  That's what a small group of shareholders, led by vocal investor Tony Maldonado, have been pushing. Later this month, Apple shareholders will vote on a proposal to increase the racial diversity of executives and board members through an "accelerated recruitment policy."  Apple's advised shareholders to vote against the new proposal, stating that it has programs to address the issue throughout the company.  But one point that Apple doesn't emphasize—and one reason for its current lack of racial diversity at the top—is how hiring works within Apple. To become a senior-level VP or a C-suite exec at Apple, you most likely have worked at the company for decades. And decades ago, diversity hiring practices weren't nearly as important or scrutinized as they are right now. Therefore, if you have seniority at Apple, odds are, you're a white male. Image: apple And Maldonado's specific accusation is, uh, spot-on: Apple's senior leadership? All-white.  To be sure, Apple's diversity numbers overall are actually some of the best in the tech industry, especially when you look at the percent of new hires who are women and underrepresented minorities. The proposal specifically addresses racial diversity in senior leadership, but Apple also has unique cred in diversity: Tim Cook was the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company.  It isn't the first time the call for racial diversity at the top has been made. A similar proposal was considered at Apple's 2016 shareholders' meeting, and received 5.1 percent of the vote—not enough to be accepted but enough to be reconsidered.  "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership—but not senior leadership—as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado told The Verge. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Out of the 11 people who in a C-level position or a senior vice president, all are white, and there's only one woman.  Apple's board of directors has eight members. Two are female. One of those women is Asian, and the other's white. One member, James A. Bell, is a black man. The other five members, or 62.5 percent, are white men.  "Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he told The Verge. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” Maldonado does have point. There are definitely people in this world with sufficient qualifications who could serve on Apple's leadership. But a reason for why diversity is low among those top ranks relates how Apple's senior hiring process works.  The vast majority of Apple's senior leadership positions are made via promotions at the company, rather than external hires. Let's look deeper:  Tim Cook, CEO* — 1998, joined as SVP of operations Angela Ahrendts* — 2014, joined as SVP of retail Eddy Cue — 1989, content stores  Craig Federigh — 1996, from NeXt  Jonathan Ive — 1992, designer  Luca Maestri — 2013, control controller and vice president of finance   Dan Riccio — 1998, VP of product design  Philip W. Schiller — 1987, marketing  Bruce Sewell* — 2009, joined as general counsel  Johny Srouji — 2008, senior director of handheld chips Jeff Williams — 1998, head of worldwide procurement  So, three of Apple's 11 members of senior leadership joined at that level.  Things look slightly better when you take a step down the ladder: Image: apple Apple's seven VPs include two women, both of whom also bring underrepresented minority representation to the team.  If Apple sticks to its habit of promoting from within, the diversity picture at the top of the company might soon start shaping up.  Apple reported 32 percent of its current employees are women, 9 percent are black and 12 percent are Hispanic and over the last year 54 percent of new hires are minorities: Image: apple Meanwhile, there are other tech companies that refuse to release any data on diversity, whether it be hires or current employee count.  Snapchat soon to become a publicly-traded company has not shared any diversity statistics about its 1,859 employees. Uber has more than 9,000 office employees and has not met diversity advocate Jesse Jackson's request for a report by mid-February.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Feb 15, 2017 at 11:19AM It's been three full months since reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would be adding organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays to only one of its three new iPhone 8 models sent shares of OLED specialist Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) stock tumbling 5% in a day. But this week, the momentum is reversing. On Tuesday, news broke that Apple has gone ahead and signed a licensing deal with Samsung to order OLED displays for its iPhones. While the rumor doesn't extend to whether Apple will be putting OLED displays in all models of the iPhone 8 or just one, investors are taking the bait either way. Yesterday, Apple stock hit a new all-time intraday high of $135.09 -- and it's pulling Universal Display stock up alongside it. Here are three things you need to know about that. OLED screens -- and OLED stock -- are in focus today. Image source: Getty Images. 1. Susquehanna hails the news It's well-known that Universal Display is a supplier of OLED technology and OLED materials to Samsung -- which we now know will in turn supply OLED screens to Apple. So naturally, Universal Display shares shot 3.6% higher in Tuesday trading, and were up a further 4% on Wednesday morning. Helping to keep the momentum train moving was a new initiation of coverage on the stock from Susquehanna. As reported on StreetInsider.com around about midnight last night, Susquehanna has initiated coverage of Universal Display stock with a "positive" rating and a big, round price target of $100. 2. Stay tuned for more news Susquehanna's new rating implies a one-year profit potential of nearly 50% on Universal Display stock, which currently sells for just $67 and change. That's a big return for just one year's investment, and we'll get our first clue as to whether it's a realistic hope next week. On Thursday, Feb. 23, Universal Display plans to release its financial results for fiscal Q4 and full-year 2016. 3. What analysts predict Here's what Wall Street analysts are telling investors to expect from that report: Profit growth of 8%, from $0.39 per share earned a year ago to $0.42 in profits for Q4 2016. And sales growth of only 10%, with $68.6 million in quarterly sales expected. If these modest numbers seem like pretty slim reeds to be supporting Susquehanna's expectation of a 50% surge in stock price at Universal Display -- well, they may be. Based on its most recent reported results, Universal Display stock currently sells for nearly 79 times trailing earnings, and 46 times trailing free cash flow. But these numbers could be shrinking soon, as Universal Display's sales (and earnings) increase to meet the new demand for OLED smartphone screens. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, analysts are looking for Universal Display stock to earn only $0.88 for fiscal 2016 as a whole. But that number is expected to jump 40% to $1.23 in fiscal 2017, then rise to $2.08 in 2018, and $2.80 in 2019. Put it all together, and forecasts currently call for a compound annual earnings growth rate of 47%. What it means for investors And I think you'll agree -- if Universal Display can hit the numbers Wall Street is laying out for it, then 47% annualized growth should be sufficient to support a stock selling for 46 times trailing free cash flow. Whether Universal Display stock can hit and maintain Susquehanna's new $100 target price though, and the even richer valuation that implies, is anybody's guess. It probably depends a lot on whether Universal Display can both achieve the growth rates Wall Street is already expecting -- and then keep those rates growing further.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Should Apple and other tech companies have a responsibility to play a more active role in filtering out fake news from their platforms? Or should it be solely left up to the reader? If you ask Apple CEO Tim Cook, tech companies do have a responsibility, and executives from the company also hinted this week that Apple is already working on it with its Apple News platform. When asked about the fake news problem during an interview last week, Cook said “all of us in technology and services own a responsibility for it. We don’t have all the answers by any means. We need to work on it.” And Apple’s Eddy Cue echoed those comments in a separate interview this week, hinting that Apple is already working on it with its approval system for Apple News allowing it to “vet and be sure that the Apple News providers are legitimate.” But another camp, from which many voiced their opinion in the comment section on Ben’s piece earlier this week, would say that it crosses a fine line into possible censorship and that it should instead be the reader’s responsibility to discern real news from fake news. Where does that leave satire sites that walk a grey area between what might be considered fake news to some and comedy to others? Should platforms that deliver content be responsible for making sure the reader knows they are reading a parody or determining what qualifies as fake news? You had a lot to say earlier, so we are continuing the conversation in today’s poll… Are you behind Apple’s view that tech companies should do more to combat fake news?

Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies TV Politics Business MWC 2017     Apple-Shaped People At Higher Risk Of Diabetes Posted: Feb 15 2017, 10:47am CST | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Latest Science News   Getty Images Apple-Like Fat on Belly and Chest could increase Chances of Becoming a Diabetic   It is a hard fact of science that apple-like fat on the belly and chest could increase chances of becoming a diabetic for many individuals. Research proves that having an apple-shaped body (instead of a pear-shaped one) could predispose people to cardiac disease and type 2 diabetes. Thus one’s genetic code may determine the onset of such degenerative diseases of civilization. Don't Miss: The Funniest Super Bowl 2017 Commercials The areas on the human body where fat is stored may include the belly or the hips and thighs. The risk for apple-shaped individuals was definitely there as far as type 2 diabetes and heart disease were concerned.  While previous studies also looked into this matter, they fell short of reaching conclusions or offering recommendations. Half a dozen studies from 2007 to 2015 were examined by the experts. A grand total of 400,000 participants were involved in these studies. Their genomes were gauged with scrupulosity. In erstwhile times, over 48 gene variants were identified that were associated with waist-to-hip ratio. Thus the genetic risk score was pretty high for apple-shaped individuals. Those with higher waist-to-hip ratio had high lipid levels, insulin resistance, excess of glucose in the bloodstream and partial hypertension. Besides these, the risk of contracting cardiac disease and type 2 diabetes was high as well. Abdominal adipose tissue has an effect on the metabolic and cardiovascular systems. The extraneous factors of a bad diet and smoking were accounted for. So it is the excess fat on the tummy that is in particular dangerous for individuals. Maybe in the future, some precision-based drugs could be made to counter this tendency of fat accumulation around the middle which is the scourge of so many middle-aged men.   Comments The Author Sumayah Aamir Sumayah Aamir (Google+) has deep experience in analyzing the latest trends.     Advertisement Latest News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago January 2017 Is third-hottest on Record: NASA 2 hours ago Invasive Species are on the Rise Worlwide, Study Finds 11 hours ago, 2:46pm CST Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition 2017: Bianca Balti is Rookie of the Year 41 minutes ago Facebook new Video App for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV Announced 2 hours ago BlackBerry now has virtually No Market hare 2 hours ago Agatha Christie's Disappearance and the Mandela Effect - Did She Ever Return? 2 hours ago 2017 Toyota TS050 Hybrid LMP1 Endurance Racer Teased 5 hours ago Aston Martin AM-RB 001 Will Have a Cosworth V112 and Ricardo Gearbox 5 hours ago Citroen SpaceTourer 4X4 E Concept Revealed 5 hours ago NES Classic Reseller Prices on the Rise on Rumors That Nintendo Stops NES Production 11 hours ago, 3:13pm CST NES Classic In Stock Updates: Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, ToysRUs and GameStop 11 hours ago, 3:13pm CST Ford Focus Production Model Spied 13 hours ago, 1:01pm CST Lamborghini Recalls 12 Venenos Supercars along with 5900 Aventadors 13 hours ago, 12:58pm CST Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Featured News Nintendo Switch Pre-order and Launch Day Sales Updates NES Classic Reseller Prices on Amazon in Free Fall   NES Classic In Stock Updates: Amazon, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, ToysRUs and GameStop Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2017 Cover Model is Kate Upton Latest Science News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago January 2017 Is third-hottest on Record: NASA 2 hours ago Invasive Species are on the Rise Worlwide, Study Finds 11 hours ago, 2:46pm CST More Latest Science News Stories Latest News Harvard and MIT Win CRISPR Gene-Editing Patent Fight Against UC Berkeley 5 minutes ago Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition 2017: Bianca Balti is Rookie of the Year 41 minutes ago UAE Plans to Build First City on Mars by 2117 57 minutes ago Facebook new Video App for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Samsung Smart TV Announced 2 hours ago More Latest News Your Deals on Amazon The Latest ...

Her latest one-off vocal adventure came via a pair of covers she dropped on Valentine's Day of Frankie Valli and Stevie Wonder songs recorded with an Instagram-famous senior citizen. And not just any 69-year-old Instagrammer, but Lili Hayes, the streetwise, Supreme-loving mother of artist/director Kevin Hayes, who has racked up more than 33,000 followers thanks to her hilariously hip posts. Following on the heels of her President Trump-bashed originals and a recent take on a classic SWV hit, Apple hooked up with Hayes for a cover of Valli's 1967 hit "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" and Wonder's 1984 gem "I Just Called To Say I Love You."

(NYSE: BRK-A) can now claim to be a top 10 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) shareholder. Buffett, who has characteristically shied away from tech investments, reported a relatively small stake (at least by Buffett's standards) in Apple of around $1 billion last year. Buffett's Apple holdings more than tripled in the fourth quarter alone to 57.4 million shares worth just shy of $8 billion. However, the investor that earned his fame for value plays didn't get much value this time around, according to Gadfly's Shira Ovide. Related Link: Apple Investment Strategies: As Icahn Sells, Buffett And Einhorn Load Up Ovide noted when Buffett's firm first made its Apple purchase, the stock was trading at a forward earnings ratio of 10.4, notably below its five-year average of 12. Maybe at that point Buffett got a good deal, but fast forward to the final three months of 2016 -- the time period when Buffett was most active in accumulating shares -- the stock was trading at an average price-to-forward earnings ratio of 12.4, now above the five-year average. Today the stock is trading at around 14.4 times its estimated forward earnings, which is an even steeper price to pay if Buffett's firm continues to hit the buy button. Apple's valuation on its forward earnings peaked at 15.1 in late 2014. On the other hand, Buffett does deserve some recognition. After all, he first started buying Apple's stock when it was south of $100 and for an investor that's known for not trying to time the market, he's doing just fine.

Register for an Exam Today> Apple May Replace iPhone Home Button with Fingerprint-Scanning Screen By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 15 2017 Apple is working on fitting fingerprint scanners beneath the screen of its iPhone, removing the need for a separate home button, a newly published patent has revealed. The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent : “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather -- they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.

Qualcomm Hit with More Apple Suits Next Article > Apple's Original TV Production To Begin Small By Meg James PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 14 2017 Apple Inc. isn't looking to spark a revolution with its foray into original television production, but rather with modest ambitions that seem to belie the ethos of the tech giant. The company is planning to start with just two shows exclusive to the Apple Music service: "Carpool Karaoke" -- a spinoff of a segment on CBS' "Late, Late Show" that has become a viral sensation -- will debut in April. Apple later will add "Planet of the Apps," a contest-reality show, in which would-be entrepreneurs pitch their concepts for new mobile apps with the hope of winning funding. Many in the TV industry were expecting the Cupertino company to use its clout to immediately take on the titans of premium TV -- including Netflix, Amazon.com, HBO and Showtime. But Apple plans to begin with small bites. "Look, we are just starting out," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, said Monday night at the Code Media conference in Dana Point, trying to downplay expectations. "These shows bring something to customers that they haven't been seen before," Cue said. "We are trying to do things that are unique and cultural." Apple has flirted with the notion of playing a starring role in television several times before, only to retreat in the face of roadblocks or opt for smaller and more surgical moves. The tech company plans to use the original productions as a way to attract and retain users to its Apple Music service. The TV shows will help differentiate the service from Spotify, Google Music Play and other subscription services. "We think video can be a very important part of Apple Music," Cue said. Apple, he said, is hoping to field to shows that are relevant to pop culture. The two new shows that will debut this spring are loaded with celebrities: will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba will serve as the mentor judges on "Planet of the Apps." "Carpool Karaoke" will bring together unlikely celebrities to spend time together and sing karaoke. CBS' "Late, Late Show" host James Corden, who turned the sketch into a popular feature on his TV show and YouTube, will appear in only a handful of the episodes for the Apple series. Still, at the Orange County conference sponsored by Vox Media, some members of the audience seemed skeptical about Apple's strategy. Cue was asked why Apple didn't just go out and buy an entertainment company or blow up the TV industry by offering existing TV channels a la carte rather than in a big bundle. But Cue didn't take the bait, and instead promoted the two shows. "This is new for us. We've never done anything like it before," Cue said, at one point adding, "We know what we don't know." He said the two shows likely would be the first of many original shows for Apple. "But how fast, and how much, remains to be seen," he said. "Planet of the Apps" comes from Propagate Content, the TV studio managed by former NBC Entertainment chairman Ben Silverman and his longtime business partner, Howard Owens. About two years ago, the two executives, along with will.i.am, were pitching the show to the big broadcast networks. The unscripted show takes a Silicon Valley twist on ABC's "Shark Tank," in which would-be inventors pitch their projects to potential investors. Before making a deal with one of the networks, will.i.am brought the concept to the Apple executives, who also were intrigued and eventually bought the show. It is expected to be different from a TV series because it will have interactive components. For example, viewers can pause the program to learn more about the contestants or various elements of the app development process. Silverman, at the conference, said he was happy with the way things worked out. "A show about apps doesn't work unless you are partnering with Apple," Silverman said. "And it will also be an app, which is very meta and cool." Image credit: iStock. © 2017 Los Angeles Times under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media. All rights reserved.

This Is Why Your Phone Shuts Down When It's Cold Outside By Nina Godlewski On 02/15/17 AT 12:38 PM Close Picture this: You’re out enjoying a walk in the snow, or a day on the slopes, and you take your phone out to snap a picture of your surroundings, you open the camera, and your phone promptly shuts off. Sound familiar? This was happening to me on a far too frequent basis for my liking so I decided to look into it. Related Stories Apple iOS 9 Extends iPhone Battery Life A quick search resulted in an Apple page that outlined the optimal conditions under which to use an iPhone (these rules also apply for iPods and iPads). The devices should be kept between 32 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit it said and warned that “Low- or high-temperature conditions might cause the device to change its behavior to regulate its temperature.” That change in behavior could mean anything from the screen dimming or going black, camera flash not working, or the device turning off completely. This made sense. The batteries used in iPhones, iPads, and iPods are all lithium-ion batteries. According to Apple, it uses these batteries because they charge faster, and last longer than other types of batteries. But with those perks come the downside of the battery being somewhat temperature sensitive. That’s why Apple recommends keeping your devices within that temperature range. Exposure to extreme heat, as well as charging the device in extreme heat can lead to permanent damage to the battery’s capacity. Next I turned to Apple Support to make sure there was nothing wrong with my battery. I used the chat function on the site to connect with a support representative who remotely ran a diagnostic test on my phone. The test showed that the battery in my two-year-old iPhone 6 is still functioning at full capacity. However, the rep told me that my battery is breaking down a bit since I’ve charged it over 625 times, and the average is usually only about 500 full charges. They also recommended that I update my software. However, they never mentioned the fact that lithium-ion batteries fail in the cold sometimes. So I turned to Reddit and Apple forums, I checked threads for anyone else having the same issues as me, within the temperature range recommended by Apple. Sure enough there were others like me. But after looking through most of the posts it seemed there was one clear answer, one user put it simply, “this isn’t iPhone problem...it’s just the nature of the Li-Ion battery chemistry. ” I never have the chance to check the precise temperature when my phone dies in the cold because, well, my phone is dead. But if I had to guess I’d say most times it’s been below 40 degrees, pretty close to that lower range of temperatures Apple recommends. A number of factors like duration in the cold, where the device is stored, and even what type of case is on it can impact the battery performance in these tricky temperatures. So next time your phone shuts off seemingly for no reason, note the temperature, and know you’re not the only one struggling to post that perfect pic to Snapchat on a snowy day.

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 9:40 am Wed Feb 15, 2017 Source tells Motherboard that Apple will testify against Nebraska's "Right to Repair" law From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Motherboard says a source told them that "an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify" against the state's Right to Repair bill, which requires companies to make it easy for their customers to choose from a variety of repair options, from official channels to third parties to DIY. report this ad Apple has previously taken versions of this position before US government agencies (for example, it repeatedly objected to proposals before the US Copyright Office to let electronic owners unlock their devices without risking civil and criminal reprisals under Section 1201 of the 1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act), so it's not a stretch to imagine that they would take this position in Nebraska, as well. Five states are pondering versions of Right the Repair legislation, but Nebraska is the only one holding public hearings on it. Manufacturers of motorcycles, ATVs and trikes have already weighed in on the Nebraska proposal, saying that bikers shouldn't be trusted to fix their own hogs. AT&T is also reputed to be testifying at the hearing (AT&T notoriously took the position that only equipment rented from the company could be connected to the phone network, banning modems, fax machines, answering machines, and even a tin can you put over the phone receiver to stop sound from leaking to eavesdroppers). They're joined by John Deere, the tractor maker who told the US Copyright Office in 2015 that farmers only licensed their tractors, and could never be said to truly own them, because of the presence of copyrighted software in them -- thus, farmers would have to comply with the license terms on the software and only get their tractors repaired by authorized John Deere agents. The idea that it's "unsafe" to repair your own devices is one that manufacturers have been promoting for years. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and "plans to bring band aids." "They should want to give people as much information about how to deal with a hazardous thing as they can," Gordon-Byrne said. "If they're concerned about exploding batteries, put warning labels on them and tell consumers how to replace them safely."

Next Article > Bring Your Own Device: Weighing the Business Benefits and Risks By Sue Tabbitt PUBLISHED: JANUARY 24 2017 A major advantage many small businesses have over larger companies is that they are more agile; less encumbered by rigid systems and processes. For example, they are more likely to let employees use their own laptops, tablets, or smartphones for work: an initiative known as BYOD (or Bring Your Own Device). This helps keep costs down, and feels more natural to users than carrying a second device -- which means they’re more likely to have it with them when it counts. But there are some important considerations that go with this. Who pays the bill for calls and data charges, for example? What happens if the device is damaged, lost or stolen? How does the company keep sensitive work-related information from falling into the wrong hands? Having the right employee agreements in place, and using centralized or cloud-based software and services, can help in setting expectations and keeping control of privileged content. Here, three small businesses discuss what they’ve learned from their BYOD experiences. More Freedom Through Greater Control Harrison Associates provides a range of professional services for people with life-changing injuries and conditions. It has a team of 50 people -- primarily remote associates, from occupational therapists, nurses and social workers, to speech and language therapists and specialist physiotherapists. The firm has always practiced BYOD because it fits the way people work. But it had run into a number of issues because it wasn’t managing this in a consistent way. Users had multiple logins to different systems. There was no provision for mobile devices beyond laptops, and even then users had to have Windows-based systems. “It wasn’t a real BYOD platform,” business support manager Merlin Diavova admits. Harrison Associates doesn’t supply the equipment used by its team as many of its specialists are self-employed. But equipping them with decent IT access is critical to retaining the best talent. This has led the firm to adopt a more formal BYOD solution more recently, in the form of Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS). Diavova describes this as a cost-effective alternative to Citrix (software that runs and manages shared systems on a centralized server, accessible to users in a controlled, secure way via a browser on any device). It has ironed out all the old frustrations and created some new opportunities to help people be more efficient, he says. Support calls and downtime have been reduced. “It has also given us the ability to provide a ‘one-stop shop’ for all applications and shared documents, which wasn’t possible before,” Diavova says. Feedback from remote workers has been particularly good. “It has been a better experience for them: they can now see all applications in one area.” The switch was relatively easy too: the whole process of choosing and installing the software took about six months. Happy Users Work Harder Independent mobile games developer Hutch employs 50 people across two UK locations. It took a BYOD stance from the outset, to ensure people had the flexibility to work wherever they are “with the least possible friction”, says ceo Shaun Rutland. A lot of its decisions were influenced by the founders’ previous experiences working at large, international companies, where technology seemed to restrict rather than make life easier for staff. Hutch’s head of technology based the company’s plan around cloud services with good security, including Google Apps for Business, Dropbox, GitHub, Slack and Atlassian. “We have no internal servers in the business,” Rutland notes. “Because these cloud services offer their own enterprise levels of security and management, no matter what device they are used on, we’ve been able to offer maximum BYOD flexibility.” The beauty of doing everything from scratch, and via the cloud, meant that it only took a month to set everything up. The benefits have been “huge”. A lot of the firm’s talent is dispersed around the world and over 50% of the team commute long distances. The firm’s BYOD setup allows them to stay productive and connect and share information as needed, Rutland says. Better still, people can choose the tools and devices they prefer. Although Hutch has specified Macs as desktops, employees can use any mobile device and their favorite calendar, mail and productivity applications. All of this helps make work enjoyable: staff turnover is less than 3%. “The bigger picture is about enabling people to work better in a world where it’s increasingly hard to focus,” Rutland says. “That goes beyond which devices they use.” Loss of control can be a concern BYOD isn’t for everyone, though. Ipswich-based online professional insurance broker PolicyBee has toyed with it, but remains unconvinced. The firm provides insurance to freelancers, consultants and SMEs, employing 29 people in the UK, one in mainland Europe and 10 at a sister firm in the US. “We thought BYOD would be a good fit because we like flexible working,” explains head of IT David Pitt. “We always have people working remotely, and for cost and convenience it made sense for them to use their own equipment. It also meant they would be able to hotdesk easily when in the office.” But after experimenting “loosely” with BYOD, PolicyBee concluded that it was too difficult to support. “As an employer, how do you make sure every device can actually do the job your employee needs it to do? If it’s the employee’s property, you can’t reasonably ask to poke around and see what’s on it, or insist the device has certain minimum operating standards and software,” he notes. “And if it hasn’t, who pays?” (PolicyBee had to buy a new laptop for one employee because her own wasn’t up to the task. The whole saga took a lot of time and money to sort out). BYOD is “a bit like herding cats” concludes Pitt. “There are numerous security and suitability issues to overcome, because an employee’s device is not the company’s property,” he says. “That makes it difficult for an IT department to make sure essential updates and scans are performed regularly. Plus there’s the added grey area of what’s on an employee’s device in the first place. Is it harboring a virus? Could it be a weak entry point for a wily hacker?” In the end, PolicyBee reevaluated. “We ditched BYOD,” Pitt says. “We’re happier putting our resources into hardware and software we know and trust, and which we control.” Tips from an Axpert: The Legal Angle Even if they have not formally specified that employees can use their own devices or software for work, companies need to be aware that this may still be happening and protect themselves -- by specifying what’s allowed and making sure it’s manageable. Sheraz Akram at DJM Solicitors, warns, “Having a formal BYOD policy is always advisable, as our changing use of technology continues to blur the lines between our professional and personal lives.” This should set out the employer’s expectations (and any potential disciplinary implications), and be integrated with existing policies on remote working, or ‘acceptable use’ of company IT systems and networks, he suggests. Terms can be tailored to include specific devices and specific job roles, and any security or confidentiality requirements (for example if an employee is using cloud based systems to save sensitive materials), Akram adds. “Employees should be asked to sign an acknowledgment form, confirming that they have read and understand the policy.” © 2017 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

 Here's a giant image of Putin caressing a pregnant Trump projected on a New York Apple store Avery Hartmans Feb. 15, 2017, 12:10 PM 203,929 facebook linkedin twitter email print Anyone visiting the Apple store in New York's Chelsea neighborhood got an unusual surprise on Tuesday night: a giant projection of Russian President Vladimir Putin caressing a very pregnant Donald Trump. Hater The image was projected on the side of building on the corner of 15th Street and Ninth Avenue, which is the location of Apple's Chelsea retail store. The Valentine's Day stunt was coordinated by the app Hater — a Tinder-style dating app that matches you with other users based on things you both hate. The illustration of Trump and Putin appeared next to Hater's upside-down-heart logo and a hashtag with the company's tagline, "Love Through Hate." As it turns out, nearly 80% of Hater's more than 200,000 current users say they "hate" Trump. "There's a lot of tension out there, regardless of which side you're on," Brendan Alper, Hater's founder and CEO, told Business Insider in an emailed statement. "We're just trying to make people laugh. Through humor, hate can turn into love." The Chelsea projection wasn't the only one — Hater projected the same image elsewhere in New York City. Another appeared at 14th Street and Eighth Avenue, on the side of a CVS right next to a subway stop. Hater A third was displayed at North Sixth Street and Wythe Avenue in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.

During the last three months alone, Apple’s share price has shot up by 26%, reaching a new all-time closing high in the process. And just today, Apple shares reached an all-time intraday high after trading at $135.58 earlier this morning. Don't Miss: The biggest caveats in Verizon’s new ‘unlimited’ plan While some big name investors such as Carl Icahn have abandoned Apple in recent months, other prominent investors have actually increased their holdings in the company. Most notably, Warren Buffett, widely regarded as the world’s most successful investor, almost quadrupled his stake in Apple last quarter. In a filing made with the SEC this week, it was revealed Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway fund picked up more than 40 million shares of Apple, increasing its overall stake to 57.4 million shares overall. As a result, Buffett’s iconic Berkshire Hathaway is now one of the top 10 biggest stakeholders in Apple. While some investors like to get in and out, Buffett is unique insofar as he tends to buy stocks for the long haul. That said, Buffett’s increased stake in Apple strongly suggests that the Oracle of Omaha believes Apple’s stock price will ascend even higher in the months and years ahead. Hardly a unique opinion, a number of analysts in recent weeks have come out with increased price targets for Apple shares. Earlier this week, for example, Goldman Sachs issued a research note raising its 12-month price target on Apple from $133 to $150. Meanwhile, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich issued a research note arguing that Apple’s services unit is severely undervalued and that Apple shares should easily be a good 10% higher.

Switch’s anchor tenant in Reno is eBay. The Las Vegas-based data center provider is known for building facilities at massive scale, using bold, flashy interior design and ex-military armed guards. Reno was its first expansion outside of Las Vegas, but sites in Michigan, Italy, and Thailand are now also under construction. True to form, its first Reno facility, dubbed Tahoe Reno 1, is 1.3 million square feet large and can support up to 130 MW of power. Switch’s design for the 2,000 acre campus calls for up to 7.2 million square feet and 650 MW of power total, the company said in a statement. Read more: Switch Claims Reno Site Will be World’s Largest Data Center While Reno has not historically been a major data center market, the Switch and Apple campuses may change that, as Switch customers and Apple continue expanding capacity. The location has strong data center market characteristics, such as availability of low-cost energy, low taxes, and proximity to Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Switch said it buys energy in bulk at about $0.05 per kWh and offers customers 10 Gbps connectivity at 4 millisecond latency between Reno and San Francisco Bay Area. Its customers in Reno — like its customers in Las Vegas — buy telco services through a purchasing cooperative the company has set up, which enables them to take advantage of bulk deals with more than 50 carriers. Read more: eBay May Build Reno Data Center Beside Leased Space at Switch The campus is fully powered by renewable energy, thanks to a recent deal Switch struck with the local utility and state utility regulators after years of legal battles, in which the company was fighting to be allowed to exit the utility’s near-monopoly and make power purchase deals with renewable energy producers independently. This year, Switch for the first time was mentioned in Greenpeace’s Clicking Clean report, which gave it the highest marks for renewable energy use and advocacy among data center providers. The company has committed to powering all of its data centers with renewable energy.

News RELATED STORIES Apple to build iPhone in India this year Westwood leads, McIlroy struggles Samsung to buy car tech firm Harman for $8bn Apple moves ahead with the new Macbook Pro Apple sued over unresponsive iPhone 6 touchscreens Pedestrians pass in front of an Apple store in New York. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. Text Size: A A A Bloomberg/San Francisco “We are always looking at acquisitions,” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook told analysts last month. “There’s not a size that we would not do.” It’s a message he’s increasingly stressed over the past year as investors question how the world’s most valuable technology company plans to use its $246bn cash pile to meet ambitions sales targets and expand into new markets, such as transportation. But Apple has struggled for years to pull off bigger deals because of a series of quirks: an aversion to risk, reluctance to work with external advisers like investment banks and inexperience in closing and integrating large takeovers, said people who have worked on acquisitions with the company. They asked not to be identified speaking about private merger and acquisition deliberations. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things” rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Apple’s biggest deal in its 41-year history was the $3bn purchase Beats Electronics in 2014, followed by the $400mn acquisition of NeXT Computer in 1996. In Facebook’s 13 years, it has made three acquisitions of at least $1bn, including its $22bn WhatsApp purchase. Google, founded in 1998, has done four such deals, while Microsoft Corp has completed at least 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Instead of closing big deals, Cook has so far focused on growing Apple’s services businesses, including Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud. That’s beginning to work, with the company recently forecasting that annual revenue from those operations will top $50bn by 2021. But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50bn target, the company must find an extra $13bn in services revenue over the next four years – beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix ended 2016 with sales of less than $9bn, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Other potential blockbuster Apple acquisition targets include Walt Disney Co and electric carmaker Tesla, Baird analyst William Power wrote in a recent note to clients. “They’re going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition,” said Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, which holds Apple stock among its $55bn under management. The presidency of Donald Trump may spark tax reforms that free up more Apple cash to spend on takeovers. But so far, the company has tip-toed around the edges of some of the biggest transactions re-shaping the technology industry. When AT&T agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85bn in October, the telecom company was concerned Apple might make a competing bid, people familiar with AT&T’s thinking said at the time. Apple had held tentative talks about a year earlier, but when the AT&T deal emerged, a person familiar with the technology giant’s thinking said it wouldn’t be able to pull together a competing proposal quickly enough. Last year, the company considered buying luxury carmaker McLaren Technology Group Ltd, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg at the time. Apple also had takeover talks with chip designer Imagination Technologies Group, but said last year it wouldn’t make an offer. Apple’s deals team is composed of about a dozen people under former Goldman Sachs banker Adrian Perica, and most acquisitions take place at the behest of the company’s engineers. Product managers usually meet every month with Perica’s team members to identify targets with attractive technology or talented engineers, according to a person familiar with the process. Microsoft’s deals team is not significantly bigger, and it still hired investment bank Morgan Stanley for its $26bn acquisition of LinkedIn last year, beating rival bidders including Salesforce.com and Facebook. At Google, the corporate development team often works on potential acquisitions with strategy experts working under Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler, not just technical staff. Other deals are carried out at the behest of founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Apple often refuses to work with investment bankers appointed by the seller, preferring to deal directly with company management, according to people who have been involved in such negotiations. Apple also dictates terms and tells targets to take it or leave it, betting that the promise of product development support later and the chance of appearing in future iPhones are alluring enough, the people said. That was the case when Apple acquired Metaio GmbH in 2015. Bankers appointed by the augmented-reality firm to negotiate weren’t allowed in the room, and while Metaio executives felt the offer was low, Apple’s vision for the technology convinced them to sell, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Apple’s current M&A strategy works well for acquiring startups developing new technology that can be added to existing Apple products. It bought 15 to 20 companies per year over the last four years. But buying larger companies presents a different challenge, particularly if there are rival bids. Bankers often diffuse tension between bidders and targets, but Apple’s approach can make that process difficult. “There’s a swagger – you may call it arrogance – about the culture there,” said Risley of Architect Partners. “They’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics.” For Apple’s acquisition of Beats, neither party used an investment bank. Apple struggled to integrate the team, and when the initial Apple Music offering emerged from the combination, it got lukewarm reviews. Later versions of the service improved. However, Apple’s lack of a successful track record integrating big acquisitions puts off sellers, according to a person who has negotiated with Apple’s deals team. Large acquisitions can also go wrong in big ways. After buying Nokia Oyj’s handset business for $9.5bn, Microsoft had to write down $7.6bn of that value in 2015. Failures like that helped forge Apple’s caution on larger deals, according to one of the people familiar with its thinking. That attitude may need to change, according to some investors. After the AT&T-Time Warner deal, analysts’ focus shifted to Netflix as the next target, even as the video streaming service says it’s not up for sale. However, that company’s shares are up about 60% in the past year, giving it a market value of more than $60bn – 20 times the cost of Apple’s biggest deal. “There are certain opportunities that they should probably be pursuing and if they wait too long they risk ceding ground to the first movers,” Victory Capital’s Maronak said. 0 COMMENTS There are no comments.

One of the best deals is a 13″ Apple MacBook Air for $749.99. The model typically sells for $999, and as you know Apple products are rarely discounted by a lot, if at all. But the savings of $250 allows buyers to purchase optional Apple Care and maybe an accessory or two. They’ve also got the upgraded 13″ Apple MacBook Air for $949.99 with double the amount of Flash storage at 256GB. The model typically sells for $1,199, so here’s another opportunity to save $250 bucks. Both MacBook Air laptops feature an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and Thunderbolt 2 connectivity. In addition, Best Buy is selling an Apple 21.5″ iMac with 4k Retina display, Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM Memory, and 1TB hard drive for 1,299.99 (a discount of $200 off the list price of $1,388.99).

Credit: Apple More like this 20 ways to hate Windows 10 less How to get rid of iCloud calendar spam How to fix iCloud sync in seconds Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell iCloud Drive is Apple’s essential connection between all your devices, Mac, iPhone, iPad, even your Windows PC. While it is expensive in comparison to other online storage services it works natively across all your devices, so you should know how to get the best out of it. How iCloud Drive works You can store documents, keep files and folders up-to-date across all your devices, work on items and access them from anywhere using iCloud Drive. Changes applied to a copy of a file on one device will automatically sync across all your other systems. iCloud Drive is a real file system, so you can create and save items to your own self-created folders, which useful if you work across multiple devices. (You must use a Mac to create your own folders). If you use iCloud Drive across multiple Macs then changes made to the Documents and Desktop files on both Macs will sync. The Mac you activate last will create its own folder for the contents of its Documents and Desktop, and this will also sync. Setup iCloud Drive iCloud Drive is automatically setup on any current Apple device running the latest operating system. (More information is available here). Apple’s macOS Sierra will automatically save files saved to your Desktop and Documents folders to iCloud, making all these files available across all your devices. That’s useful but will eat your online drive capacity, particularly as (at 5GB) Apple still doesn’t provide sufficient free drive space. You can buy more storage if you like, or disable the feature in System Preferences>iCloud>iCloud Drive Options – Uncheck Desktop & Documents folders at the top of the list. Hint: iCloud Drive will sync data using your mobile connection unless you tell it not to do so. That’s fine if you can afford the data, but (particularly) if you travel abroad you may want to disable this. To do so open Settings>iCloud> iCloud Drive and at the bottom of the next page toggle ‘Use Cellular Data’ to Off (it’s Green – On – by default). Online and on device If you use Desktop & Documents then you will find everything you file there on iCloud Drive on your Mac or iOS device. You can also access these files online through your account at www.icloud.com, which means these files can easily be edited on a Windows PC. Windows Apple also offers iCloud for Windows, which makes photos, videos, mail, files, and bookmarks are accessible on both your Windows PC and iOS devices. Any changes you make on any of these files on any device, online,  Windows or Mac, will be replicated across all your other devices. Files over 15GB in size are not supported. Hint: You can also access these files from a Mac that is not running macOS Sierra. Open a new Finder menu, click the Go menu item and select iCloud Drive. If you work on files don’t forget to manually save those changes to the iCloud Drive, as they will not save automatically as they do on macOS. iCloud Drive FAQs   Controlling apps Many third-party apps want to use iCloud Drive to store their own data. This is useful for some apps you plan to use across all your systems, but may not always be what you want. To control which apps can store data to your online drive: On iOS: Open Settings>iCloud>iCloud Drive and switch any app you don’t want accessing your drive off (toggle to white). On Mac: System Preferences>iCloud> choose iCloud Drive Options.. and uncheck the apps you don’t want to support. Time Zones If you notice that emails and calendar entries have begun showing the wrong time zones its possible your account settings are incorrect. To check, login to your account online at www.icloud.com and tap Settings. At the top of the next page you should see Time Zone/Region which should state where you are. If it does not you can change this and the time zone problem will be resolved across all your devices. Reclaim deleted files If you accidentally delete something stored on iCloud Drive you can easily get it back again from iCloud.com. All you need to do is login to the account, check Settings>Advanced and click Restore Files. Wait a few moments and you will be presented with a list of files that you have previously deleted in the Restore Files window. Tick the box beside the file(s) you want to restore and tap Done. Files are only available in this way for 30-days. Version conflict If you have files open on two devices at once modifications made on one device may be out of sync. iCloud Drive should warn you when this kind of version conflict takes place. When it does you can double-clock a version’s thumbnail to see its contents, and delete the other one. I do hope this report helps you get more out of using iCloud Drive on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Windows PC.

Expensive, poorly made, badly conceived (and that's just the article). Gadgets and gizmos that are just, well, shit By Matt Egan | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Products that are usefulness challenged All too often the latest gadget is a solution looking for a problem that doesn't exist. You won't believe (we still can't believe) the piece of utter rubbish at number one in our list of the most useless gadgets of all time. We've listed the products in only a rough order (although our #1 most useless product is an absolute belter), and we've given each a uselessnes score out of 5 in which 1 could be conceivably of some use, and 5 is a chocolate tea pot. And, yes, we are more than happy to say that the Apple Watch makes the list - you are of course entitled to disagree. Enjoy the list and let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Most useless products of all time #17: Gear 2 Face facts, Samsung fans. Samsung has a unique way of reacting when a new product category appears (or when Apple hints that it might make a new category device). It floods the market with products of various flavours, sees what works and then concentrates only on the winners. And so it is with smartwatches. The Gear 2 is a sound piece of engineering, well designed and built. It offers a decent feature set. But it is close to utterly useless. For one thing it runs the Tizen OS. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but now that Samsung has committed to making only Android Wear smartwatches, Tizen is unlikely to gain much in the way of apps or new features. And then there is the fact that the Gear 2 is fully compatible with only a couple of Samsung phones and tablets. So not only will you be shelling out £200 for the watch, you'll need a £600 phone to go with it, and the likelihood is that when you upgrade your phone you'll need to find a new smartwatch. It's not that it is bad, just expensive and extremely limited in terms of compatibility and software support. And that's useless. (See also: best smartwatches.) Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #16: Amstrad E-mailer Next time you marvel at Sir Alan Sugar's business acumen as he fires another hapless apprentice, consider the fact that the company with which he made his name was responsible for some utter turkeys. The E-mailer (or [email protected] ' as Amstrad would have it), was chief Turkey. As with many useless gadgets, the principle was good. Execution and pricing, terrible. The [email protected] was a wired telephone with an LCD. As the name suggested it acted as an email messaging machine, as well as a dialup web browser. The idea of accessing email through a mobile phone was wildly exciting in 2000, so the concept of being able to browse electronic mail from the telephone table made some sense - even though it tied to a fixed point global internet messaging. The real problem was in the 'pay as you use' business model. It didn't cost much to buy the [email protected] , but it was hugely expensive to use. Internet and email access were made via a premium-line phone number that went through Amstrad's own email servers. Checking email was not only tied to one spot in the house, but the [email protected] made a free thing expensive. Oh, and just to top it off, you had to watch adverts on the LCD between your emails. It wasn't a great service, and the tech itself was horrible. We had one that caught fire in our test lab (insert your own 'You're fired' joke here). It looked cheap and nasty, and very far from the cutting edge tech it was meant to be. Indeed, so bad was the [email protected] that rumour suggested Amstrad CEO Bob Watkins fired himself rather than continue to labour to meet Sir Alan's vision. Too expensive to use. That's useless in our book. (See also: Amstrad - A British PC legend?) Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #15: Xybernaut Poma Where do we start. The Poma, from troubled wearables maker Xbernaut, was a wearable PC. The equivalent of a low-spec 2002 PC distributed about your person - and it looked like it. When Xybernaut introduced the Poma wearable computer at the 2002 CES, it got an inexplicably good reaction. Running on the useless Windows CE, this utterly useless PC cost $1,500. It made you look like an idiot, did almost nothing of any use, and couldn't be worn outside in the rain. And remember, this is a long time before wireless internet was widely available. In fact, all it was good for was attending fancy dress parties where you weren't sure how much effort people were going to make. Expensive, rubbish, bad looking. Useless. Uselessness rating: 5/5 Most useless products of all time #14: Withings Hair Coach Designed in collaboration with cosmetics brands Kérastase and L'Oréal, the Withings Hair Coach is one of the ultimate examples of a solution to a non-existent problem.  Coming out in autumn 2017, this $200/£160 hair brush is billed as the "future of hair care," and provides a "holistic hair assessment," something I'm sure you'll agree we're all in dire need of. It boasts a microphone, gyroscope, and accelerometer among other sensors, so that it can observe your brush technique and even listen for split-ends, vibrating to warn you that you're brushing too hard. It then uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to sync to a dedicated smartphone app, from which it can give you an assessment of your hair health, track your brushing progress in a series of graphs, and recommend specific hair care routines for you. We're torn here. On the one hand, we're sure there's a market for this, and while £160 sounds like a lot for a hairbrush, it's not as eye-wateringly expensive as some of our other most useless gadgets (and we gave five stars to a £300 hair dryer, so we can't really talk). But still: smart hairbrush. Just say that to yourself a few times and try and pretend it's something you need. Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #13: Nokia N-Gage Another one to consign to the pile of 'a good idea done wrong'. We now know that there is a market for portable gaming devices that are also smartphones. Nokia's mistake was to add phone capability to a games console, rather than gamifying a smartphone. The result was useless: pretend to make a phone call on your Wii and you will get the idea. The N-Gage cost £75 more than Nintendo's Game Boy, had few titles available to play on it, and looked awful both as a console and as a smartphone. Awful, and useless. (See also: Rethink for Nokia's N-Gage platform.) Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #12: DivX Enhanced DVD Players An example of good tech ruined by bad policies. DivX means something benign these days, but back in 1998 the Digital Video Express moniker was originally appended to an effort to create 'disposable' time-limited DVDs that could stop DVD rental discs being pirated. DivX players may have had a chance if they were free, or at least cheaper than standard DVD players. But no, DivX 'enhanced' DVD players costs a lot more than standard DVD players, and required you to attach a telephone line in order to play a rental disc. This was enough to kill DivX at a time when most households needed their phone lines to make calls. What made it a fate worse than death was the early privacy concerns customers had about faceless corporations tracking what they watched. Why worry about that, huh? How would you describe something that costs more to hobble a standard product? One word: useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #11: Datawind PocketSurfer2 My personal favourite. And another idea poorly executed, and very badly timed. Picture the scene: it's mid-2007, and the internet is primarily a desktop affair. Plenty of people are still on dial-up, and even those with home broadband tend to be tied to a desktop via ethernet cables. And even getting a web connection to your home was a complicated and expensive business. Tech-savy mobile communicators tend to carry BlackBerries, and the mobile internet consists of scratching around for football scores and cinema listings via [shudders] WAP. The PocketSurfer2 offered a solution to these problems. A phone without the ability to make phonecalls, it was a mobile cellular internet device. A smartphone-sized pocket book with a qwerty keyboard that proported to offer the full internet on the go, as well as a dedicated email device. Websites were crunched through a special caching process that meant they required very little data to be pulled down. Better yet there were no contracts entered into, DataWind said. You simply paid a one-off fee, and accepted adverts when you booted and shut down your PocketSurfer2. In a world in which the mobile internet seemed positively futuristic, it was an impressive pitch, so what went wrong? Well for one thing the device failed to live up to expectation. I had one for a year and it was replaced – free of charge, I grant you – no fewer than three times. The third time it fell to pieces I chucked it in a drawer and forgot about it. I might have persisted, but there was another problem: in order for cellular connectivity to be free forever DataWind needed sufficient users of the devices to make the advertising model work. And, well, it didn't have them. So in order to keep pocket surfing I needed to shell out for a subscription. Frankly, the experience simply wasn't worth it. Anyone who used a PocketSurfer2 rapidly came to the conclusion that whatever it was - and it *was* a decent emailer - it was nothing like the full internet. What it was might have been enough, however, were it not for the timing issue. Because the PocketSurfer2 launched just after the iPhone. We forget now just how big a deal was the iPhone, so let me remind you. It may not have added much to the market in terms of pure technology, but the iPhone offered a great web browsing experience in a desirable, touchscreen device. If it ever could have, now a clunky device with a physical keyboard could not compete. And although it limped on for a year or two, the PocketSurfer2 was finished. A big promise unfulfiled. An iPhone rival that was anything but. Poorly made, awful to use. Useless. Uselessness rating: 1/5 Most useless products of all time #10: Umbrella Drone Look, we get it. Britain is a soggy place and everyone has, at some point in their life, gotten fed up with having to carry an umbrella round with them, taking up a valuable hand that could be used for carrying bags, smoking cigarettes, or clutching your smartphone. But has anyone ever been so bothered by that problem that they'd be willing to spend more than a thousand pounds to solve it? Announced at CES 2017, the umbrella drone received a mix of disbelief and adoration from tech pundits, though we can't imagine why anyone was excited about it. Currently priced at a whopping £1,299 - and that's with £200 off, mind - this must surely be one of the most expensive umbrellas ever produced, and it's not even gold-plated or studded with cheap diamonds (more on that later in this list).  What it does do is hover slightly above your head (you hope) and follow you around using GPS synced to your smartphone. That sounds great for about five seconds, until you start to think about all the ways it can (and will) go wrong. What about when you want to get on a bus or train? What about when some passer-by decides to grab it or swat it out of the sky? What about when it inevitably fails to track your GPS and just veers off on its own course, leaving you scrambling after it in a vain attempt to stay dry? Fortunately, because it doesn't have a camera the Umbrella Drone at least doesn't fall foul of UK drone laws, but good luck explaining that to every police officer you pass on your commute - if you ever dare bring this over-priced brolly into work. And the other good news is that it has a "long battery life" - a massive 30 minutes, so keep your walks short unless you want it to crash into your head, leaving you soaking wet, bruised, and clutching a broken piece of £1,299 tech. Brilliant. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #9: NEC Pro Mobile 200 The history of Microsoft and mobile is a peaon to the useless. Lest we forget Microsoft touted the tablet form factor long before the iPad was created, and it has been trying to get mobile Windows of the tarmac for a decade or more. The NEC Mobile Pro 200 was one of nearly two dozen Windows CE 1.0 devices launched in 1996. Not only did the NEC Mobile Pro 200 and its brethren not support Microsoft's newly released Outlook, they didn't work with any non-Microsoft PIM or email client. Win CE 1.0 handhelds were quickly rendered obsolete by Win CE 2.0 devices, which eventually turned into Pocket PCs and Windows Mobile phones. The NEC Mobile Pro 200 is one of many useless devices, but useless it was indeed. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #8: Microsoft Mira Sticking with Microsoft, here's its Mira wireless touchscreen display, which Microsoft unveiled with great fanfare at the 2002 Consumer Electronics Show. (Between the Xybernaut Poma and the Mira this must have been a great show). The idea may still come to fruition. Microsoft wanted consumers to mount these LCDs on the walls of their homes and use them to remotely access their computers. Not for the first time execution didn't match ambitious invention. The Mira cost $999. It also ran business Windows - an odd choice for a digital home product. And it looked awful. Overpriced and underwhelming. Useless. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #7: Denso Vacuum Cleaner Shoes In a sign that there may be a god after all, this is only a concept product that will almost certainly never see the light of day. But still: vacuum cleaner shoes.  We have Japanese auto parts manufacturer Denso to thank for this one, who should probably just go back to making car components to be honest. It's a prototype developed as part of a biannual company competition to allow employees to "foster their creative and innovative design concepts," and if this was one of the finalists, we dread to think what the losing entries looked like.  The 'Ecology Shoes' boast vacuum cleaners inside each over-sized sole, meaning you can hoover the floor as you walk. Each step powers the vacuum's motor, so at least you shouldn't have to worry about the battery dying, but you do have the new concern of having to empty the miniscule dust box out of your shoes. We can only imagine you also have to drag your feet around in a slightly awkward shuffle to get any effective cleaning done too, so that's your self-respect out of the window.  Speaking of, I've got to take a moment to talk about shoes' very particular aesthetic. The giant platform soles we understand - the vacuum cleaner has to fit in somewhere after all - but why the half-checkerboard upper? Or the pink and black laces? Who on earth is expected to ever actually wear these things out of choice? They're heavy, they're ugly, and we can't imagine they even work very well as hoovers. Useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #6: Sony Vaio Mouse Talk What were they thinking? Of all ill-conceived tech products, the Sony Mouse Talk is certainly one of the more memorable. It was launched back in the glory days of VoIP (that's Skype to you and me) when USB-connected "internet" phones were all the rage. Instead of using your desktop speakers and a microphone connected to your PC's sound card, you could pretend you were on a real, wired phone. Never mind that the call quality (as it was back in 2006) made it sound like the person on the other end was close to drowning a swimming pool. The Mouse Talk, however, took things a step too far, by combining a VoIP handset with a mouse. One minute you could be clicking around in Windows, the next on call with a relative in Australia. On paper, the VN-CX1/B sounded reasonably good. Sony said it would "control desk clutter while adding a touch of style and ingenuity to your workspace". But ingenious it was not, since the Mouse Talk could only perform one of its functions at a time. When on a call your mouse would be out of action, leaving you unable to check a website or look up a phone number to pass on the information to your caller. Either that or you had to lean your head sideways with your ear almost touching the desk and attempt to use the mouse by feel alone. Just as a smartphone with a built-in shaver would be a retail disaster, the Mouse Talk quietly disappeared from PC World's shelves. It was useless. Uselessness rating: 4/5 Most useless products of all time #5: Nintendo Virtual Boy This 'portable' 3D gaming system may have been the biggest disaster to come out of Japan since Godzilla. Virtual Boy fans had to press their eyes into the machine's goggles to get the 3D effect, while simultaneously holding the unit steady and manipulating the unit's six-button control pad. The Virtual Boy chewed through AA batteries like a hungry virtual goat, displayed monochrome images only, and offered a paltry 22 games (14 in the US) before getting pulled from the market a year later. And did we mention that using the Virtual Boy made some people ill? Nintendo advised users to take breaks every 15 to 30 minutes to avoid eyestrain, headaches, and nausea. Impossible to use, and nauseating. Useless. Uselessness rating: 3/5 Most useless products of all time #4: USB Finger Dance Mat With the USB Finger Dance Mat, you could have a party on your desk with everyone invited - though discretion might have counseled you to think twice about demonstrating the digital skills you developed over many painstaking hours of practice to, say, your boss. To use the device, you just plugged it into your PC, slipped your digits into the cardboard finger character (two choices: Disco dude or Flashdance chick), and tapped your fingers in time to the flashing lights on the 4x4in dance floor. It was fresh, it was funky, it was totally embarrassing if anyone ever caught you doing it. Which, apparently, few did, since the Dance Mat was discontinued shortly after it debuted. Still, it was a fun way to take a break between cleaning out your desk and picking up your P45. Job-losingly useless, but fun. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #3: King of Key King of Key arrived in the offices of our publisher IDG in 1999 – and its sheer brilliantly hilarious awfulness has stayed with us ever since. It manages to be crap in so many ways, it's almost a field guide for newbie reviewers on what makes a product terrible: its concept is ludicrous, its construction is tacky and it's pretending to be something it's not. The £80 King of Key was the laptop equivalent of a gold tooth from a West Ham dentist. It's a replacement for the then-cutting-edge Apple Powerbook G3's 'Home' key that's gold and has a diamond in the middle of it – a diamond that will bring you luck apparently *cough* bullshit *cough*. The gold turned out to be flaky paint, and the 24-carat diamond – which was accompanied by an authenticity certificate – was valued by a nearby Hatton Wall jeweller as being worth less than a tenner. Unfortunately the luck brought by the King of Key didn't rub off on the company who decided this is really what British Mac owners needed to own – MyGate went bust in 2001. Century Corporation, the Japanese company who made King of Key, went on to produce an iMac stand called 'Dance with i' that it promoted with the immortal words: "can be handled easily – even by a lady!!". Totally, utterly, useless. Uselessness rating: 6/5 Most useless products of all time #2: Apple Watch Okay. The Apple Watch is clearly not the most uselss product of all time. It has some uses. But it gains points for hype and cost. And the fact that otherwise sensible people (the editors of Macworld UK) are convinced that it is a good thing, when it is clearly a joke that has got out of hand. The problem is that our Samsung Gear 2 entry notwithstanding there are *some* things for which smartwatches are useful. It is good, for instance, to be able to view emails as they come in without pulling out your smartphone. And, you know, telling the time is a useful function. It's just that the Apple Watch is the culmination of all of those annoying things about Apple. There's the smug way in which the few Apple Watch users demonstrate features long available in Android Wear, and before that on the excellent Pebble. The true believers' habit of describing something that clearly looks like a piece of shit as a design classic. Seriously: look at the Moto 360 and tell me that you *love* the way the Apple Watch looks. More recently I have been told by more than one Apple Watch user that although it is at first tricky to use, over time it becomes - I quote - "intuitive." This failing to understand the meaning of the word intuitive. The Apple Watch is massively over-priced, coming in at least half as much again as a comparable Android watch. It is at its cheapest twice as expensive as the ugly but very-far-from useless Microsoft Band. That's right: Microsoft has made a more useful and reasonably priced smartwatch than has Apple. Microsoft, you say? The company that makes phones which iPhone users criticise for lack of apps. A problem criticial in the smartphone world, but not a problem at all for the very much app-challenged Apple Watch. (Why you would need an app for your watch defeats me, but you must do because Apple tells us you do.) Apple fans will never understand any of this. Nor will they care. Not least because Apple has strived to ensure that the Apple Watch is the only smartwatch with which you can reasonably pair an iPhone. So value becomes a moot point: Apple wilfully restricts the number of peripherals with which you can pair your iPhone, so at any point from 0 to 1,000 pounds the Apple Watch is the best deal you can get. Which may be just as well. Now that Google has managed to get an Android Wear app on to the iTunes App Store, the Apple Watch looks like a very poor deal indeed. And that in turn may start to chip away at the 'iPhone is best' mantra that hasn't been true since 2012. It isn't entirely useless. But when you ponder the gap between hype and reality, and look closely at exactly how much use you get for your money, Apple's smartwatch is fully deserving of a place on our list of infamy. Uselessness rating: 2/5 Most useless products of all time #1: NoPhone Zero The name might give you a clue as to the piece of total rubbish at number one in our list of the most useless gadgets in history. The NoPhone Zero is most definitely no phone, and it is zero good. It is in fact a rectangular block of plastic that does absolutely sod all. It's the same size as the iPhone 5, but with none of its features. Unbelievably, 130 people pledged a total of $1,239 to make NoPhone's Kickstarter dream a reality, and the Zero entered production and sold for $5 each. The theory behind the Zero is that it serves as a sort of comfort blanket for phone addicts - they'll feel that familiar weight in their pocket, shape in their hand or black device on the table in front of them, but they won't be tempted to pick it up and play with it because, well, they'd get bored pretty quickly.  NoPhone says: "The NoPhone Zero is a plastic rectangle that replaces the need for smart rectangle device interaction." Except it doesn't. Because for all the unneccessary number of times people pick up their phones to check their Facebook news feed or glance at the clock, there are also times that you actually need a phone that works, and NoPhone can't help you then. We don't know if we're more upset by the sheer utter ridiculousness of this product or the fact that it's not the first. The original NoPhone, which is still available at $10, and with bulk buy discounts for couples and families, comes with cutouts and grooves to simulate the feel of a real smartphone with home button, camera and screen. There's also a $15 NoPhone Selfie version, which has a mirror strapped to the front, and perhaps most astonishingly of all, a $5 NoPhone Air which is literally just an empty piece of packaging.

We round up all of the rumours about a new MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals Last updated to include rumours that Apple is manufacturing more of its own chips for use in Mac laptops New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event; after all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. But it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Apple is joining the likes of Netflix and Amazon and making its own TV shows for distribution on the Apple TV, and it is likely that you will be able to start streaming Apple's shows this spring, as long as you subscribe to Apple Music for £9.99 a month. Apple's head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled two trailer for two shows at Recode's Code Media conference in February. You can watch these trailers below. The shows will be distributed via the £9.99 a month Apple Music subscription service. Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine confirmed that Apple has plans to offer original video content via its Apple Music service back in January 2017. Speaking at a Television Critics Association event, Irvine said that Apple is working towards creating "an entire cultural, pop cultural experience, and that happens to include audio and video," via the Apple Music service. What TV shows is Apple making? The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Apple has been talking to producers about creating premium programming and movies, but so far we know that the following programmes are being made for Apple's streaming service: Carpool Karaoke A popular spot on CBS's The Late Late Show and staring James Corden, 16 episodes of Carpool Karaoke will be available to stream via Apple Music. Apple head of internet software and services Eddy Cue unveiled a trailer for the show at Recode's Code Media conference in February. The show will start streaming in April. Planet of the Apps Hosted by Will.i.am this is a sort of Dragon's Den for App developers. It will feature celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba mentoring app developers. App developers have the length of a escalator ride to pitch their apps. As yet a date hasn't been revealed but it is expected that the show may be made available in June coinciding with Apple's Worldwide Developers conference. Apple posted this trailer: Vital Signs Backed by Apple, Dr Dre's semi-autobiographical six-part series was rumoured to be in production in February 2016. However, little has been revealed about this show since those reports appeared regarding it. Will Apple's shows only be about music and apps? Apparently Apple doesn't intend to limit content. The programmes won't be limited to music or app themes, according to Apple Music head Jimmy Iovine. "If South Park walks into my office, I am not going to say you're not musicians, you know?" he said, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. When will I be able to watch Apple's TV shows in the UK? We expect that the programmes will be available on Apple Music in the UK at the same time as they go live on Apple Music in the US, so expect to be able to watch Carpool Karaoke in April. How can I watch Apple's TV shows? The shows will be available for Apple Music subscribers for £9.99 a month. As of February 2017 there are 20 million paid subscribers to the service. Subscribers will be able to stream the shows on their Apple devices including the newest Apple TV model, the iPhone and iPad. Will Apple stream shows for free? It is thought that the shows will only be available to Apple Music subscribers, so it is unlikely that you will be able to watch the shows without paying for an Apple Music subscription. Apple is unlikely to offer an commercial based model in order to cut the cost to consumers, speaking at Recode in February, Apple's Eddy Cue said of such models: "I'm not saying we'll never do it.. I don't think it's the direction we should be going. I don't think that's what our customers are asking for." There is no indication that the shows will be made available to purchase separately on iTunes either. However if you don't yet have an Apple Music subscription you could take advantage of the three month free trial to watch the new shows when they come out. Is Apple trying to take on Netflix with an Apple Streaming service? There have been rumours for years that Apple planed to work with the networks to distribute content via its own streaming service. Back in 2015 Apple was said to be negotiating deals with networks. At the time, ESPN's boss John Skipper confirmed that he was working on a deal with Apple for its rumoured streaming service, but revealed that Apple was having more trouble convincing other networks to join in. However, it appears Apple hit a bit of a brick wall with the negotiations because by August 2015 talks with CBS, Fox, and NBC were said to have stalled. And then, in December 2015 it was claimed that Apple was putting its plans for the streaming service on hold because the cable companies and networks were proving too resistant to the idea. By February 2016 CBS CEO Les Moonves had confirmed that talks with Apple had stopped following months of conversations with content providers: "We had conversations awhile back, and we haven't had recent conversations with them," Moonves said.  Why did Apple fail to come to an agreement in these negotiations? One report claimed that Apple was looking to collect a 30% fee from all subscriptions and the network operators weren't happy about this. Having failed to negotiate content deals will Apple instead seek to acquire companies that have content available for distribution? There are claims that the company could buy Disney, for example, more on that below. For now the company seems to be distancing itself from the idea. Speaking at Recode, Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple isn't "trying to buy a bunch of shows," indicating that Apple isn't planning to make any content acquisitions, and back in June 2016 Apple's Eddy Cue said that Apple wasn't interested in becoming a Netflix competitor. Is Apple going to launch a television? The short answer: no. Rumours that Apple would launch a TV were circulating for some time, spurred by the fact that Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs seemed to hint in his biography that he intended to reinvent television. This spurred a long running rumour that Apple would launch an actual television set. Jobs told his biographer Walter Isaacson: "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use… It will have the simplest use interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it." Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to share Jobs' TV dreams. Over the years he has suggested both that the TV experience needed to be bought up to date, and that Apple might revolutionise television. He stated back in September 2014: "Think how much your life has changed, and all the things around you that have changed, and yet TV, when you go into the living room to watch TV or wherever it may be, it almost feels like you're rewinding the clock and you've entered a time capsule and you're going backwards. The interface is terrible, I mean it's awful. You watch things when they come on unless you remember to record them." Analyst Gene Munster was probably the most vocal in his predictions that Apple would launch an actual TV, he may even have been correct, as there were reports that Apple did have a team working on an actual TV, but it appears that the company eventually ditched the idea. Instead of launching an actual television, the company launched Apple's tvOS and the re-imagined Apple TV in 2016, both of which could be seen as the culmination of Steve Jobs vision for TV. However, those who were hoping for the reinvention of television, with a fancy TV set and a Netflix-style streaming service were disappointed. Read our review of the 2015 Apple TV here: Apple TV (fourth-gen, 2015) review. Could Apple buy Disney? Apple could probably buy a whole country if it wanted to, it has so much money in the bank. As to whether it might buy Disney, there are reasons to think that such a deal wouldn't be completely surprising: to do so would bring content, excellent co-branding potential, and a 30% share of Hulu. There is also the fact that Steve Jobs was Disney's biggest shareholder following his sale of Pixar to the company, and the fact that Disney CEO Bob Iger sits on Apple's board. With all that in mind, it's hardly surprising that the rumour has been circulating. However it would make Apple a conglomerate and we don't think that becoming such a diverse organisation would fit  with Apple's DNA. Could Apple buy Netflix? Another rumour doing the rounds is that Apple could buy Netflix. However, Apple's Eddy Cue has quashed that rumour by saying that Apple isn't looking to buy a content company: "We might be better buying somebody or doing that, but that's not what we're trying to do," Cue said at the Recode conference in February 2017. Could Apple buy HBO? Time Warner? There was a rumour that Apple was considering buying HBO, the home of Game of Thrones as part of an acquisition deal with Time Warner. Back in early 2016 a New York Post report even claimed that Apple might even buy Time Warner, Inc. That purchase would include HBO, CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network. However, no such deal emerged. Tags: Apple , Rumour , Apple TV Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Should You Follow Warren Buffett And Load Up On Apple Inc. Stock? February 15, 2017 11:54am Nasdaq:AAPL ShareTweet According to recent regulatory filings, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Should everyday investors follow suit? In the fourth quarter of 2016, Berkshire bought a massive 42.1 million shares of Apple. That move brought its total AAPL holdings to 57.4 million shares, or 1.09% of the company’s total stock. Owning 1% of a company doesn’t sound like too much, but that position was worth about $6.6 billion at the end of 2016. Still, that’s only a fraction of Berkshire’s entire portfolio, which is valued at approximately $155 billion. For those of us lacking that kind of money to invest, does it make sense to follow suit? First, let’s examine why Buffett made the investment to begin with. According to notes posted by Dr. David Kass, Buffett himself probably didn’t even make the investment. Instead, it was a couple of his trusted employees that are largely in charge of Berkshire’s technology investments: “Ted (Weschler) and Todd (Combs) each have about $9 billion to invest. One or more invested in Apple. With Apple, people get hooked on things that they like. [Buffett] has a competitive edge within his circle of competence (which does not include tech companies). His circle grows wider over time but outside of his circle tech people know better than he does. [Buffett] mentioned that he did not invest in Microsoft even though it had no cost of goods sold and was earning a ‘royalty on the world’ since the world needed its operating system.” The fact that Buffett himself didn’t make the investment shouldn’t worry anyone, however. The Oracle has the final say on every move the company makes, and he gave his seal of approval to allocate billions into Apple shares. Buffett loves companies that have a competitive advantage like he does. Apple certainly falls under that category — its massive installed user base for its devices (on which it books huge margins, by the way) opens up many doors for future growth. Apple is also extremely cash rich — another quality Buffett admires. That’s because a company with tons of cash can afford to be very generous with share buybacks and dividends, not to mention grow via acquisitions. Historically, Apple has shied away from too many big purchases, preferring to absorb smaller firms whose technology it can leverage in its own products and services. But that doesn’t mean it’ll operate like that forever. In fact, there are many potential major acquisitions out there for Apple, all easily attainable given its cash position and creditworthiness. There simply isn’t another company in the history of the world that can match Apple’s size, reach, margins, cash, and customer affinity. With the iPhone 8 reportedly on the horizon this year, we may be entering the firm’s next golden age. And all of these things mean that the stock is absolutely worth following Buffett into. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading at $135.17 per share on Wednesday morning, up $0.15 (+0.11%). Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 16.71%, versus a 4.80% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Seven West Media is still grappling with the fallout of the relationship between CEO Tim Worner and former employee Amber Harrison.  "I interpret [the resignation] as being a discomfort either with the lack of transparency around the release of the [investigations firm] Allens report or some other aspect of the process the board had undertaken," Paul Redmond, a law professor and associate director of the Centre for Corporate Governance at the University of Technology Sydney, told Bloomberg. Sitting besides Mr Worner on the conference call, Mr Stokes also said his chief executive officer "continues to have the full confidence of the board" and praised the way Mr Worner has handled himself since the company became aware of the affair in 2014. "At the time it arose, I told him he must have nothing to do with this issue and the people involved. And that's why he's been able to focus on what he's done," said Mr Stokes, speaking of Seven's industry leading results. Mr Worner also addressed the issue. He referred to Ms Harrison as a "former employee" and said: "I have apologised for what did happen and do not want to give any more oxygen to things that did not happen." Mr Stokes did not hold back when it came to what he thought of Ms Harrison and the barrage of allegations she has made against the boss of Australia's top television network. "The facts of the matter are there were significant amounts of our money taken by her," said Mr Stokes. He also expressed dissatisfaction that the board had had to launch another investigation into "irrelevant allegations that have no substance at all". Ms Harrison is effectively gagged from making any sort of reply to Mr Stokes' comments after the company obtained an interim court injunction on Monday. It stops Ms Harrison from releasing documents the network says she has no right to hold, access or release. Ms Harrison is expected to respond when the matter goes before the NSW Supreme Court next week. Follow CBD on Twitter.

Rumours of curved handset heat up as OLED display deal discussed Report claims Apple in talks with Chinese display company for iOS smartphone of the future. By Oliver Cragg February 15, 2017 17:20 GMT Apple could be eyeing an all-OLED future for its iOS smartphoneLeon Neal/ Getty Images With rumours swirling that Apple's iPhone 8 could pack a Samsung-made OLED display, a new report has suggested that the Cupertino giant is looking to another display maker for its OLED iPhones from 2018 onwards. The supplier in question is BOE Technology, a Chinese company that is upscaling its display output by investing $14.5bn to build two OLED plants in Sichuan, China with the aim of providing backlit, flexible AMOLED displays. According to a Bloomberg report, Apple is eyeing said displays as a long-term solution and is currently testing its output ahead of a potential agreement that would see future iPhones carry BOE's panels. Of particular note is the suggestion that BOE hopes to produce 1.6 million square-metres of flexible AMOLED glass each year – a number that dwarfs production estimates from other companies – although it is unclear how much this depends on it securing Apple's stamp of approval. Apple is expected to reveal an OLED-sporting high-end iPhone later this year in celebration of the smartphone's 10th anniversary. While at least one other variant is also rumoured to be in the works with an LCD panel, it has been suggested that the premium edition will feature an AMOLED screen produced by Samsung Display. A shipment of over 100 million units of OLED displays has reportedly been agreed between the Samsung's subsidiary company and Apple for the 2017 iPhone. But while those could eschew the type of curved form factor seen on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, BOE's batch could see the entirety of Apple's future iPhones with OLED displays, perhaps even ones with curved edges or a flexible design? Conflicting rumours have previously suggested that Apple could be turning to Micro-LED technology as a long-term OLED alternative. The iPhone maker invested heavily in Micro-LED in 2014 when it acquired LuxVue Technology – a company that has previously filed multiple Micro-LED patents.

 Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Kif Leswing Feb. 14, 2017, 12:38 PM 29,230 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Music Apple is breaking into original TV content, and the trailer for one of its first shows, "Planet of the Apps," was released Monday evening. And by a large margin, Apple fans — and even some employees — seem to hate it. The concept for the reality-TV show is something like "Shark Tank" meets "The Voice." App developers come up with ideas for apps, choose a celebrity mentor such as Will.i.am or Jessica Alba, and eventually win $10 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners as well as premium placement on the front page of Apple's App Store. "Developers, they're the rock stars of right now," Will.i.am says in the trailer while wearing gold boots. One contestant gives the one-liner, "We're eBay for the Snapchat generation." The show will air exclusively on Apple Music. You can watch the trailer at the bottom of the page. Here's what the Apple world is saying about it: Paul Haddad, the developer of popular iOS apps including Tweetbot: I can’t wait to see https://t.co/50qeVJsNkW doing code review. “You’ve got an unsatisfiable layout constraint, look at my gold shoes!” — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) February 14, 2017 Sam Soffes, who previously developed popular apps including the top Bible app: Got an email from Apple asking me to apply for this. So glad I passed. https://t.co/pOU0QTMMvB — Sam Soffes (@soffes) February 14, 2017 Realmac Software founder Dan Counsell: Apple should be producing amazing content like Netflix Originals does. Not this garbage. I am disappointed. — Dan Counsell (@dancounsell) February 14, 2017 Renaud Lienhart, the Home app developer at Apple: Today, I am ashamed to work for Apple. This is embarrassing, and not what we work hard for.https://t.co/9O5mjEGElm — Renaud Lienhart (@RenaudLienhart) February 14, 2017 Apple blogger and Instapaper founder Marco Arment: I’m sure Planet of the Apps will be a great show for all of those people who bug developers with their awful ideas. https://t.co/PORl3y4t1Y — Marco Arment (@marcoarment) February 14, 2017 Jake Frey, an app designer at Frey Labs: Devs: Hey the App Store has a few problems and its hard to be discovered. Can you take a look? Apple: Uh nope but that would make great TV! https://t.co/IjYAc58XLF — Jake Frey (@frey) February 14, 2017 Dermot Daly, the founder of Tapadoo, an iPhone app studio (Daly also wrote a Medium post): “Planet of the Apps. No. Just No”. https://t.co/Z67aaLH5xu (Typos, etc on a postcard to me please). — Dermot Daly (@dermdaly) February 14, 2017 But some are defending the show, pointing out that perhaps Apple fans and developers are not its target audience. Apple blogger Rene Ritchie: Planet of the Apps: Not intended for “us” but for the mainstream. Or, now “we” know how cooks have felt about Hell’s Kitchen for a decade. — Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) February 14, 2017 Watch the full trailer below:     SEE ALSO: Apple is at an all-time high More: Apple Apple Music Planet of the Apps Marco Arment Rene Ritchie Will.i.am Jessica Alba Lightspeed Ventures Lightspeed Venture Partners facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple is breaking into original TV...

More videos China's coal revival At the centre of China's fluctuating coal prices is Yanzhou Coal Mining's Dongtan mine. The Financial Review's Lisa Murray was lucky enough to be given a tour. Mining restrictions last year by President Xi Jinping's government aimed at easing a glut resulted in a 9.4 per cent drop in production and a surge in prices, snapping at least four years of declines across Asia. To cool the market, officials reversed some measures to boost production ahead of winter. A resumption of restrictions now may support prices again if demand growth is sustained, according to Argonaut Securities (Asia). "The policy will effectively set a floor for coal prices," said Helen Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Argonaut. "Reinforcing the 276-working-day restriction, even partially, will have an immediate impact to supply recovery and market sentiment." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link China is considering reinstating coal output restrictions to avoid the return of a glut after easing limits during winter.  Photo: Nick Moir The NDRC is considering reinstating the production limits for six months, with some mines and areas possibly excluded, said the people. No decision had been made yet, they said. In late trading in London, shares in BHP Billiton gained 3.2 per cent. Shares in Rio Tinto slipped 0.6 per cent, Glencore fell 0.7 per cent. Advertisement Thermal coal futures traded on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange reversed earlier losses and added 0.7 per cent to close at 535.2 yuan a tonne. Coking coal futures in Dalian fell 0.9 per cent to settle at 1214 yuan a tonne after earlier rising as much as 0.5 per cent. Teck see lower realised prices "Sellers of seaborne coking coal are banking on the recent drop in prices to encourage more buyers to make spot purchases and stem the decline," market participants told Metal Bulletin. Coking coal prices, which have been trending downwards since December, saw the pace of their decline accelerate this week. Metal Bulletin's cfr China premium hard coking coal index fell $US1.66 to $US159.23 per tonne on Wednesday, its lowest since early September. "The ample supply is affecting market sentiment and demand is really just moderate at best," a seller source told MB. Canada's Teck Resources, the largest producer of coking coal in North America, said overnight that customers appear to be drawing down inventories following a fourth-quarter buying binge, sparked by global supply worries that were ultimately unfounded. Teck forecast steelmaking coal sales of approximately 6 million tonnes in the first quarter, down from 7.3 million tonnes in the fourth quarter. It has reached agreements with the majority of its coal customers for the first quarter, based on a quarterly benchmark price of $US285 per tonne.  Teck expects an average realised price in the first quarter of about 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the $US285 per tonne benchmark. Teck's fourth-quarter realised price was $US207 a tonne. The company forecast 2017 steelmaking coal production of 27 million to 28 million tonnes, but said output may be adjusted depending on demand. NDRC seeks to avert renewed glut "The NDRC probably expects a decline in coal demand as the winter heating season ends and so they are attempting to limit supplies so a new glut doesn't emerge and knock down prices," said Laban Yu, head of Asia oil and gas equities at Jefferies Group in Hong Kong, "The policy is likely flexible and NDRC may change it again according to supply and demand." The NDRC wants coal prices in a range of 500 yuan to 570 yuan a tonne, according to Yu. Spot coal with an energy value of 5500 kilocalories per kilogram at the port of Qinhuangdao, China's benchmark grade, was at 605 yuan a tonne as of February 13, down almost 14 per cent since the start of November, according to data from the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association. Prices rose 73 per cent in 2016. Separately China rejected a shipment of coal from North Korea a day after the country testfired a ballistic missile in violation of international sanctions, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported. A load of around 16,295 tonnes of North Korean coal, estimated to be worth around $US1 million, was not allowed to be unloaded at a seaport in Wenzhou in China's Zhejiang province on Monday, and will be returned to the North Korean western port of Nampo, the agency said citing unidentified sources. The rejection was due to a higher-than-permissible level of mercury contained in the coal, the agency said. The move came a day after Pyongyang's test of the intermediate-range ballistic missile on Sunday, its first direct challenge to the international community since US President Donald Trump took office on January 20.

Wearable Tech by Matt Elliott February 15, 2017 7:00 AM PST @themattelliott The next time you want to go for a run -- or just a walk -- you can leave your iPhone behind and bust a move with your Apple Watch. All that's required is a pair of Bluetooth headphones and a little upfront work. Step 1: Sync a playlist Unlike your iPhone, your Apple Watch can't stream music from the internet, so you'll need to download music to the watch. To do so, grab your iPhone and open the Watch app. Next, tap Music from the list of apps and then tap Synced Music. From this screen, you can pick a single playlist to sync to your Apple Watch. Enlarge Image Screenshots by Matt Elliott/CNET Two things need to be in place for the sync to happen -- Bluetooth needs to be turned on on your iPhone, and your Apple Watch needs to be on its charger. Also, you'll need to exercise patience; even short playlists took a while to sync to my Apple Watch. Side note: You can set a limit for music storage on your Apple Watch using the Watch app on your iPhone. Under the Synced Music option in the Music section, you can choose between 100MB and 2GB (about 15 to 250 songs). Step 2: Pair headphones to your Apple Watch To pair your Bluetooth headphones, put them into pairing mode and then grab your Watch and go to Settings > Bluetooth. It should see your headphones and show them under Devices. When it does, tap on your headphones to pair the two. (Apple's AirPods or another set of headphones with Apple's W1 chip, such as BeatsX, will pair automatically with the Apple Watch if the headphones are already paired with your iPhone.) Step 3: Let the music play With your playlist synced and your headphones paired, tap to open the Music app on your Apple Watch. Swipe down to reveal the menu that lets you choose a music source and tap the icon for the Apple Watch. Next, scroll down and tap Playlists and you'll see one playlist listed under the header, On My Apple Watch. Tap to let the music play.

Really Double Its Services Business in 4 Years? Investors are excited about Tim Cook's pronouncement that Apple aims to double its services segment revenue in the next four years -- but some analysts doubt that Apple can pull this off. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Feb 15, 2017 at 10:35AM About a year ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) began spending more time discussing its services business during its quarterly earnings calls. It's pretty clear why it decided to do so -- the services segment is the only aspect of Apple's business that is still growing consistently. On the first quarter earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an ambitious goal of doubling the company's services revenue in the next four years. That's a big reason why Apple stock has rallied more than 10% in the past few weeks, reaching a new all-time high. Apple YTD Stock Performance, data by YCharts. Plenty of analysts and other pundits are skeptical that it will be feasible to double the services business in four years, barring a big acquisition. But here are three reasons why doubling the services business might not be so hard after all. Services growth is accelerating First, the services segment's growth trajectory is better than it seems. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, Apple reported an 18% year over year increase in services revenue, down from 26% growth a year earlier. These figures make it seem like Apple's services growth is already slowing. Considering that Apple needs to grow its services revenue at a 19% compound annual rate to double it in four years, this would be an ominous sign. However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple benefited from a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent infringement lawsuit. Excluding that patent revenue, Apple's services revenue grew only 15% in Q1 2016, but surged 30% year over year last quarter. Thus, Apple doesn't even need to maintain its recent services growth rate to hit its target. The App Store is gaining scale A second factor working in Apple's favor is that the App Store has recently become the largest contributor to Apple's services revenue. App sales have been growing at a fast clip for many years, but Apple only reports its net revenue from the App Store. The portion of App Store sales that goes to developers -- which ranges from 70%-85% -- doesn't show up in Apple's financial statements. Apple earns an extremely high profit margin on App Store revenue due to this accounting policy, but the growth of this revenue stream hasn't been very material until recently. Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Apple's net App Store revenue reached $7.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year that ended last September. That would make it the largest piece of Apple's services segment, ahead of iTunes, which faces secular revenue declines. Furthermore, the App Store continues to grow at a phenomenal pace. Last month, Apple reported that developers' earnings rose more than 40% year over year during 2016. The pace of growth is sure to slow over time, but App Store revenue is on a trajectory to more than double in the next four years, providing a good chunk of the services revenue growth Apple is targeting. The iPhone Upgrade Program could lift AppleCare revenue Growth of the iPhone Upgrade Program is a third factor that could contribute to increases in Apple's services revenue. For as little as $32.41/month, this program allows customers to get a new iPhone every year by trading in their old one. Purchases under the iPhone Upgrade Program include AppleCare+ enhanced warranty coverage, which is worth $129. The iPhone Upgrade Program is boosting AppleCare+ revenue. Image source: Apple. Many iPhone fans have already enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Apple could potentially expand the program to more countries. It could also consider creating similar programs for other devices like the Apple Watch. These Apple-operated upgrade programs can drive significant services revenue growth because AppleCare+ is part of the bundle. Very few of these customers would be buying AppleCare+ if it were still sold separately. A big reason for optimism Apple's services business produced more than $24 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016, up from less than $20 billion a year earlier. This allowed it to surpass both the iPad and Mac product lines to become Apple's second-largest segment by revenue. Even if Apple misses its target of doubling its services revenue by 2020, it will certainly get a meaningful amount of revenue growth from that segment. With strong services growth ensuring that Apple's non-iPhone revenue will rise consistently in the years ahead, Apple will be well positioned to return to strong earnings growth as the next iPhone sales cycle heats up.

Over the year as a whole, Huawei saw its sales leap by 26.7 percent, while the South Korean and US rivals both suffered a sales decline of 4.3 percent, Gartner said in a study. As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 percent and Apple’s contracted to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent. “Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large,” Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said. The other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo. “We’re seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent,” Zimmermann said. “Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year,” she added. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top position in the market with a share of 17.9 percent or 77 million units sold. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 percent. “Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it’s remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system,” the analyst said. With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone manufacturers, commands a market share of 81.7 percent, while Apple’s iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 percent of the market.

CBS News Logo CBS News News Latest US World Politics Entertainment Health MoneyWatch SciTech Crime Sports Shows Video More In Depth Photos Mobile Radio Local Shop Log in/out Search CBSN Toggle video By Shara Tibken CNET February 15, 2017, 12:07 PM Apple vs. FBI one year later: Still stuck in limbo Apple CEO Tim Cook last year fought a request to develop software that would help the FBI break into an iPhone used in a terrorist attack. James Martin/CNET Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email It’s been a year since Apple fought the FBI over data privacy, and we’ve barely heard a peep from either side on the issue. So everything’s fine, right? Uh, no. The FBI’s attempt to force Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist set up a grand legal battle between security and privacy. On one side is a massive tech company envisioning a future similar to the setting in George Orwell’s “1984” (which, coincidentally, has become a bestseller again after President Donald Trump’s inauguration). On the other is the world’s most powerful government dangling the threat of a terrorist attack if it can’t get access to vital information. The stakes were sky-high. Cybersecurity experts said the dispute could have far-reaching implications for everything from how private our personal photos are to how tech companies operate in other countries. Both were poised to head to court, and then a funny thing happened: The FBI suddenly said it didn’t need Apple’s help, and the whole affair just faded away. But that doesn’t mean everything is hunky-dory. Play Video CBS Evening News How did the FBI break into the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone? The FBI has successfully broken into the San Bernardino terror attacker's iPhone without the help of the manufacturer Apple. John Blackstone take... Because the battle never went to court, we never got an answer on whether security or privacy takes priority. A year later, the only thing that’s clear from the public battle is just how hazy everything still is. And the conflict isn’t going away anytime soon, especially if there’s another terrorist attack. “This past year was kind of a missed opportunity to work this thing out,” said William Snyder, visiting assistant professor of law at the Syracuse University College of Law. “It hasn’t gone away. The question is whether you deal with it now when things are calm or later when the stakes are high.” The FBI referred CNET to comments made by FBI Director James Comey in April, when he talked about how the US has always balanced privacy with public safety and how encryption has upset that balance. “The logic of strong encryption means that all of our lives, including law enforcement’s life, will soon be affected by strong encryption,” he said. “The notion that privacy should be absolute, or that the government should keep their hands off our phones, to me just makes no sense given our history and our values.” Apple CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, has continued to champion strong encryption and Apple’s efforts to protect customer data. Last week at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, he said that “it wasn’t that we were being activists; it’s that we were being asked to do something that we knew was wrong. And so we had a choice to just blindly do what the institution said to do, or to fight. And we just fought.” What happened again? Here’s a quick refresher: In early 2016, the FBI wanted Apple to create software to unlock an iPhone 5C used by Syed Farook, who weeks earlier had killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Apple helped pull data from Farook’s iCloud account, but some dates were missing. And the FBI couldn’t get into the phone because it didn’t know the passcode. Play Video Saturday Apple isn't backing down on iPhone privacy battle A CBS News/New York Times poll suggests Americans are divided over whether Apple should unlock the encrypted iPhone of one of the San Bernardino ... On February 16, 2016, US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ordered Apple to create that software for the FBI. Apple refused, with Cook arguing that the order went too far and would threaten the security of all iPhone users. Bypassing the iPhone’s password meant creating a “back door” in its iOS mobile software that could then be used to access every other iPhone, he said. The two sides battled over the following weeks in legal filings and public comments. The fight ended with a whimper on March 21 -- the day before a slated court hearing -- when the FBI found a third party to unlock the phone. It turned out the government didn’t need Apple’s help after all. A separate case in Brooklyn, New York, that involved a confessed drug dealer ended in a similar fashion, with the FBI dropping its request for Apple’s help after finding another way into the iPhone. In both instances, the FBI initially said Apple was the only organization that could get into the iPhones. But both times, the bureau ended up being able to access the phone with the help of third parties at the 11th hour. The government didn’t specify in either instance who helped it get into the iPhones, but reports later named Israeli security firm Cellebrite as the company that helped the FBI in the San Bernardino case. Cellebrite earlier this year was hacked, something Apple had worried about. “I would characterize this as the opening volley in what’s going to be a very long-term conversation,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former Department of Homeland Security official and founder of cybersecurity company Redbranch Law and Consulting. The encryption debate What the fight came down to was the encryption used on Farook’s iPhone 5C. The technology scrambles data and requires a passcode before letting you have access. If investigators copied the hard drive, the data would remain scrambled. And if investigators entered the wrong passcode 10 times, the iPhone’s data would be wiped. Tech firms and privacy advocates argue that encryption is essential to secure personal information and communications. The government and law enforcement officials counter that encryption hurts their ability to investigate criminal and terrorist activity. Apple’s battle with the FBI got the average consumer and Congress thinking about the once wonky topic of encryption. It spurred others to act. Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption in early April, which means it doesn’t have access to those messages and can’t be forced to surrender them to the authorities. The same time Apple was battling the FBI, draft legislation leaked for a possible encryption bill from two US senators, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California. The bill would have given federal judges the authority to order tech companies like Apple to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data. Tech companies essentially would be legally required to build back doors into their products, the very thing Apple fought against. “The consensus among security and privacy and legal experts was that was a terrible idea,” said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. “It would mean the end of any actual privacy protection.” In late May, that bill -- which was never actually introduced to the Senate -- died. No other encryption bill has been proposed since. As of January, more than half the volume of internet traffic is now encrypted, according to Firefox browser maker Mozilla. Then what? While Apple may not have been back in court over this issue, others have. Microsoft and Google faced legal battles over giving law enforcement access to data stored in their cloud services, and law enforcement has asked Amazon to send recordings made by its Echo smart speaker that relate to a murder in Arkansas. Microsoft has prevailed in court with its argument that it shouldn’t have to hand over data held in an Irish data center until Ireland gives approval. Google, though, wasn’t as lucky. Earlier this month, a US judge ruled that Google has to give the FBI emails stored overseas. “It’s a question about information stored in the cloud that isn’t encrypted, but the government wants to get through the Stored Communications Act,” said David Opderbeck, a professor of law at Seton Hall University Law School. It’s an issue that could pop up more, he said. Apple, meanwhile, continues to beef up the security of its devices. In August, it introduced its first “bug bounty” program for outside researchers to find vulnerabilities in its software. That’s long been a common practice for other tech companies, but Apple previously performed its checks internally. It now offers up to $200,000 for any flaws found and reported to the company. The Trump card The wildcard in all of this is President Trump. He’s expected to take an even tougher stance than President Barack Obama when it comes to strengthening law enforcement access. “I can only expect the new administration ... to go even further than the Obama administration did in terms of data collection and the expectation that even private companies are going to be compelled to share private information with the government,” said Charley Moore, CEO of online legal technology company Rocket Lawyer. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed Apple for not helping the government hack the iPhone. “Who do they think they are?” he asked at one time. Another occasion, Trump called for a boycott of Apple’s products until the company helped unlock the device. That never happened. Play Video CBS This Morning From iPhone encryption to fake news, a look back at tech in 2016 The tech industry saw a lot of ups and downs this year. Facebook promised to fight fake news on its social network and launched its live video fe... “They have to open it up,” Trump said in mid-February 2016. “I think security -- overall, we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense.” Some of Trump’s early moves have butted up against the technology industry. His ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations caused an outcry joined by Apple, Microsoft and dozens of other companies. His pick for the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, will likely dismantle net neutrality, which most of the tech industry favors. Trump also withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had a provision that would ensure no company from a member state had to provide access to its software source code as a condition of entering the market another member state’s market. “That provision would have gone a long way toward avoiding the parade of foreign horribles that Apple raised in its opposition to the FBI warrant,” said Joshua Rich, a partner at law firm McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff. “But because the US withdrew, other TPP member states will not be required to extend those protections to US companies.” Trump made Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state a key campaign talking point. And in late January, he was slated to sign an executive order on cybersecurity but canceled those plans without explanation. With Trump in the White House and with Congress controlled by the Republican party, pro-law enforcement legislation is likely. The hope among cybersecurity experts is that anything related to encryption or privacy that happens takes place soon, not in the aftermath of an attack as was the case with the Patriot Act. That post-Sept. 11 law increased surveillance powers and caused major privacy concerns. “The pendulum swung wildly to the national security side because we suffered through a catastrophic attack,” said Daniel Rosenthal, a former counterterrorism official with the National Security Council who currently works as an associate managing director at Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk consulting firm. “If we suffer through another [attack], there’s a good chance the pendulum swings again, away from the privacy and data security side.” Special Reports: CNET’s in-depth features in one place.

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Facebook Set to Launch New Video App for TV (FB, GOOG) By Gayatri Sapru | February 15, 2017 — 6:47 AM EST Share In a move to further its dominance across platforms, Facebook Inc. (FB) has announced a new app for set-top boxes that will allow users to stream videos on their televisions. This includes saved videos, Facebook's recommended videos, videos shared by pages or friends, and top live videos from around the world. The app will roll out soon to stores for Amazon's (AMZN) Fire TV, Samsung Smart TV, and Apple TV (AAPL), with more platforms to be announced soon. "A lot of people when they’re watching video in news feed during the day will save it for later, because they don’t have time to watch," said VP of Partnerships Dan Rose at Recode's Code Media conference. "Now it's easy to watch on your TV if you want to do that. We want people to be able to consume content wherever they are – whether it’s on their phone, whether it’s on their computer — and TV is just another screen for that." In October, the company added a feature to its smartphone app that let users hit a button to stream videos on Apple TV and Google's (GOOG) Chromecast. (See also: Apple Offers First Look at Its TV Shows) The company also announced other video features in the blog post. Users can now stream videos in a corner of the screen as they continue scrolling through their newsfeeds. Videos will also autoplay with sound as a user scrolls down and vertical videos will expand to fill the screen. The Wall Street Journal had reported last month that Facebook was developing a 'video-centric' app for TV and that it was negotiating licensing deals for TV-quality programming. The report also said that the new content may include longer videos and even commissioned scripted shows alongside sports and entertainment videos. On a Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg did indeed confirm that Facebook is looking toward developing episodic content, amongst other things. (See also: Is Facebook a Future Competitor to Netflix?) "I see video as a mega trend on the same order as mobile," Zuckerberg said to investors in a conference call this month. "That's why we're going to keep putting video first across our family of apps and making it easier for people to capture and share video in new ways." Facebook has been actively pushing users to try out its range of video offerings, including Facebook Live and Instagram Stories which it launched successfully last year. This latest move pits Facebook directly against rivals like Google's YouTube and Hulu, both competitors to traditional broadcast television. Facebook will be able to compete with television for ad dollars if it can get its user base to use the TV app. It's not clear yet if Facebook plans to monetize users accessing the content it develops, so we can keep an eye out for news on that.

Interestingly, Apple’s frenemy Samsung is going to be the sole supplier of OLED displays for Apple’s best iPhone this year. But Apple is looking to fix this OLED “problem” in the years that follow, mostly since Samsung alone won’t be able to fulfill Apple’s iPhone needs. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best Various reports have revealed that Samsung and other display makers including LG and Japan Display will invest heavily in OLED factories now that Apple is moving from LCD screens to OLED. Now, a new report from Bloomberg adds massive Chinese conglomerate BOE Technology Group Co. to that list. BOE has already sent OLED screens to Apple for testing, but it’s unclear whether they’ve been deemed suitable for the next-gen iPhone — that’s the 2018 iPhone, not the iPhone 8 coming out this year. BOE is one of China’s largest display panel makers, and it’s looking to invest $14.5 billion building two AMOLED plants in Sichuan in anticipation of future business. The iPhone is one of BOE’s targets, and that shouldn’t surprise anyone. Apple’s OLED adoption will convince many other smartphone makers to follow suit, numerous reports have suggested, even though OLED screens have been around for years. That means even if you’re not an iPhone user, you future smartphones might pack high-quality OLED screens thanks to Apple. Apple reportedly ordered some 160 million OLED screens from Samsung this year, but that won’t be enough to equip all 2017 iPhones with OLED displays. Instead, only the iPhone 8 will get the OLED treatment, while the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will stick to LCD screens. Samsung is also setting aside about 60 million OLED screens for its Galaxy S8 phones. In the future, Apple will want all of its iPhones to have OLED displays, and the same probably goes for other products it sells. Android device makers, in turn, will likely move to OLED displays as supply increases and OLED screens become even more affordable. Samsung Display, which has 95% of the OLED market according to the same report, will see tremendous competition in the coming years. BOE alone is expected to mass-produce 1.6 million square meters of flexible OLED glass substrates per year once its two factories come online, which is slightly more than what researchers from IHS estimate for this year’s total global OLED production.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 09:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

Mobile phones have arguably become a necessity in the modern world, we all need texts, calls, internet and emails, but what happens when humanity’s love of wanton excess takes over? When practicality and efficiency give way to mindless decadence? Sure, you can send emails from it, but does it need to be made of diamond and gold? For some people that answer is yes, so here is a look at the top seven most expensive mobiles in the world.   1. iPhone 5 Black Diamond At a whopping £10 million, the iPhone Black Diamond has been dubbed ‘the worlds most expensive phone’. British designer Stuart Hughes, who will be mentioned again in this list, is known for his luxury modifications of Apple products but this one is on another level. The phone itself is made of solid gold dotted with some 600 solid white diamonds, the home button has been replaced by a single 26 carat black diamond, while the Apple logo on the back is made up of another 53 small diamonds. You’re probably asking who could afford such a thing? The answer is an unnamed Chinese businessman.   2. iPhone 4s Elite Gold Also one of Stuart Hughes’ more opulent creations, the iPhone 4S Elite Gold has a market value of £6 million and was also the previous record holder of ‘worlds most expensive phone’. If the 500 flawless diamonds, a 24 carat gold Apple logo, and a solid platinum chest wasn’t enough, the chest also contains pieces of actual Tyrannosaurus Rex bone. Yes, this phone is made from dinosaurs. Only two of the phones were ever made and it’s quite easy to see why, dinosaur bones aren’t exactly the most common material in the world.   3. Amosu Call of Diamond iPhone 6 At £1.7 million, the Amosu Call of Diamond version of the iPhone 6 has more than earned it’s place in the expensive phones hall of fame. This phone comes from noted luxury designer Alexander Amosu, who in 2009 sold the world’s most expensive suit worth an incredible £70,000. The phone itself is a not so standard Apple iPhone 6 with an 18 karat solid gold chassis, which is then smothered in a maddening 6,000 small diamonds, and one large 51 carat diamond cut into the shape of the rear logo. The entire design process takes roughly two months to craft a single phone. If the diamond version is too expensive then there’s always the plain old solid gold  version for £2000, which all of a sudden doesn’t seem like such a ludicrous decision.   4. GoldVish Le Million As well as being one of the more garish looking phones on this list, the GoldVish Le Million, as it’s name suggests, is worth just over £1 million. Goldvish SA, the Swiss manufacturer, has made a name for itself in the overly lavish phone business, however the Le Million was their first and certainly most expensive. The phone boasts a solid gold body studded with diamonds, something that at this point is becoming fairly run of the mill. Perhaps most interestingly, because the phone was produced way back in 2006 for the ‘Moscow Millionaire Fair’ it’s functionality is probably pretty limited despite being worth more than most houses.   5. Gresso Luxor Las Vegas Jackpot With a price tag almost as long as it’s name it’s easy to see why this £800,000 phone made the list. In a refreshing change, this device goes slightly easier on the amount of gold used and instead most of the body is actually made from 200 year old African Blackwood, which may or may not be worse depending on how you look at it. The keypad is also made up of 17 etched sapphires, though the bulk of it’s price comes from the diamonds which cover most of the front. There is also a £15,000 version available if you want to save that extra £785,000 for a rainy day. Though at that reduction you’ll have to forego the diamonds.   6. Vertu Signature Cobra Significantly cheaper than the previous entry, the Vertu Signature Cobra will still set you back by about £250,000, and you’re not getting much for that. The phone was designed by french jeweller Boucheron in a limited run of eight phones and as the name suggests the handset has a pear cut diamond cobra surrounding the casing. In terms of materials, this one boasts an obscene 439 rubies and two emerald eyes for your new Cobra friend.   7. Black Diamond VIPN Smartphone Just slightly cheaper, at £240,000 the Black Diamond VIPN is one of the ‘classier’ looking phones you could buy for an outlandish price. Rather than diamonds embedded in gold, African Blackwood, or diamond snakes, the VIPN has just two diamonds on show, one on the back and one serving as the joystick, which certainly shows the phones age. However, if you’re looking for exclusivity, it’s worth noting that only five of these phones were ever made.   Tags iPhone mobile Previous ArticleHow to be more ‘Google’ with talent analytics Next Article5 most expensive drones in the world Most read CASB Explained Ellie Burns 15th February 2017 IBM, Hortonworks tackle big data in Hadoop analytics partnership Ellie Burns 14th February 2017 Business collaboration software: Tech for the sake of tech or vital enterprise tool?

"Following" : "Follow"}} February 15, 2017 11:27am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Apple, Alphabet, Panera, Tesla: Fast Money Picks For February 15 Paul Singer's Latest 13F Shows Big Changes In Apple, Western Digital Dow Strikes New Record High As P&G Rallies, Apple Keeps Rising (Investor's Business Daily) Plenty of investors follow the smart money during 13-F filing season. If the managers running billion-dollar hedge funds are all buying or selling the same stock, it may serve as a strong indication that retail investors should be doing the same. However, sometimes the smart money doesn’t necessarily all flow in the same direction. The latest 13-F filings have revealed several of the biggest names on Wall Street still don’t seem to see eye-to-eye on the world’s largest company. Apple In April of 2016, Icahn Enterprises LP (NASDAQ: IEP) chairman Carl Icahn revealed he sold out of his massive 46 million share stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL). At the time, Icahn said he was concerned about Apple’s inability to deliver sales growth and its challenging prospects in China. Related Link: 13F Roundup: Apple, Bank of America And Other Stocks Hedge Funds Love/Hate However, several other Wall Street giants apparently saw Apple in a quite different light. The exact same quarter Icahn sold his stake in Apple, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A)’s Warren Buffett and Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn and were both buying shares. “We believe there is tremendous value in Apple’s brand and growing global customer base that periodically buys new devices and increasingly buys additional services,” Einhorn said at the time. This time, at least, Buffett and Einhorn picked the right side of the trade. Apple shares are up 23 percent since the beginning of April 2016, outpacing the S&P 500 by about 10 percent.

The feature is only available at Shell stations starting in the UK, but Jaguar says it “will become available later this year in other markets.” Rather than using a card at the pump, or waiting in the service station, owners who install the Shell app can simply drive up to any pump at a Shell service station (initially in the UK and then globally) and use the vehicle’s touchscreen to select how much fuel they require and securely pay using PayPal® or Apple Pay®. Android Pay™ will be added later in 2017. In-car fuel payments are available as part of the Shell app on 2018 Jaguar F-PACE, XE and XF models according to the announcement. You still need to pump your own gas, but you do avoid insecure credit card readers. Jaguar says in-car payments for fuel is only the beginning as they want to add parking and food order payments in the future. It’s unclear exactly how Jaguar’s new in-car payment feature will work with Apple Pay, however, as the current description sounds a little more ambitious than what we’ve seen as possible to date. While Jaguar describes the feature as a first, it may work a lot like ExxonMobil Speedpass for Apple Pay specifically. Speedpass is an iPhone app that lets you authorize payments for fuel at Exxon and Mobil gas stations using Apple Pay. Some gas stations support Apple Pay at the pump with updated payment terminals, although these aren’t as common in the U.S. yet. While Jaguar’s implementation here may not be as exciting as described, it does point to something Apple could do with CarPlay in the future with Apple Pay. We’ll update our coverage if we receive clarification on how Apple Pay will work with Jaguar’s new feature.

"We have a billionaire battle we don't talk about enough. Carl Icahn, when he sold the stock, he really made it clear that Apple's best days were behind it and they had problems with China. Buffett clearly did not believe that scenario," Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." When asked what he thought about Icahn's comment, Cramer said, "I do have to say that when you say that China was the problem, you got mainland China. Mainland China is very strong for Apple." Cramer's comment came after Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway nearly quadrupled its stake in Apple and increased its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines, according to a fourth quarter regulatory released on Tuesday. Cramer said that perhaps Buffett "got in on another wave of when the Street was believing that perhaps that airlines are no good again." Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple's 16.6 percent stock price gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone, according to Reuters. Separately, Buffett revealed last month that he beefed up his stock portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway after Donald Trump's election. In an interview with talk show host Charlie Rose that aired last month, Buffett said, "We've, net, bought $12 billion of common stocks since the election." Buffett added it was "in large part" his decision. Icahn, Trump's special advisor, increased his holdings in Herbalife and Hertz Global Holdings in the fourth quarter, and exited Voltari in the fourth quarter, according to Reuters.

Source: Apple Will Fight 'Right to Repair' Legislation Apple representatives plan to tell Nebraska lawmakers that repairing your phone is dangerous. Apple is planning to fight proposed electronics "Right to Repair" legislation being considered by the Nebraska state legislature, according to a source within the legislature who is familiar with the bill's path through the statehouse. The legislation would require Apple and other electronics manufacturers to sell repair parts to consumers and independent repair shops, and would require manufacturers to make diagnostic and service manuals available to the public.  Nebraska is one of eight states that are considering right to repair bills; last month, Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Massachusetts, Kansas, and Wyoming introduced legislation. Last week, lawmakers in Illinois and Tennessee officially introduced similar bills.  According to the source, an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln on March 9. AT&T will also argue against the bill, the source said. The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire. Motherboard is protecting the identity of the source because they are not authorized to speak to the press. So far, Nebraska is the only state to schedule a hearing for its legislation. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Update: A representative for AT&T said the company is "familiar with this legislation but [has] no plans to attend or testify." The spokesperson said that the CTIA, a wireless industry trade group that includes members such as AT&T and Verizon, is "working to find a viable solution." Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens Manufacturers have lobbied hard against right to repair legislation in the past. Last year, a bill headed through the New York statehouse was killed in part due to lobbying from Apple and IBM, among other manufacturers. But nationwide, the legislation appears to have much more momentum this year as more states introduce right to repair bills. Last month, the American Farm Bureau Federation, an influential political organization representing farmers, officially endorsed right to repair legislation. The bills nationwide are being pushed by Repair.org, a trade organization made up of independent repair shops who say that their companies have been harmed by an attempt by manufacturers to gain a monopoly over the repair business. Even without readily available repair parts or service manuals, a healthy DIY repair hobby has thrived thanks to online crowdsourced instruction manuals on sites like iFixit and grey market parts that are available directly from factories in China or can be salvaged from recycled devices. The idea that it's "unsafe" to repair your own devices is one that manufacturers have been promoting for years. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and "plans to bring band aids."  "They should want to give people as much information about how to deal with a hazardous thing as they can," Gordon-Byrne said. "If they're concerned about exploding batteries, put warning labels on them and tell consumers how to replace them safely." We need to keep adding bills because manufacturers can keep playing whack-a-mole with lobbyists if there's only one or two states It should be noted that iPhone 7 batteries do have a warning label that says there is a "potential for burning" if punctured. The label also says they should only be replaced by an "authorized service provider"—either Apple itself or a company that pays Apple a fee to become authorized. Tractor manufacturer John Deere has also come out vehemently against right to repair legislation; a letter the company wrote opposing the Kansas right to repair bill says the company wants to prevent "unintended alterations" to the tractors it sells. The company also said that such bills should be shot down "to protect consumers' significant investment in equipment," which it says can only be retained by servicing the vehicles at authorized John Deere repair centers. The full letter is embedded below. The goal of Repair.org is to get at least one bill passed this year, the hope being that manufacturers won't want to deal with a patchwork of laws in different states around the country. In 2012, a Massachusetts law guaranteeing the right to repair automobiles became de-facto national legislation after car manufacturers decided to comply with the law nationwide rather than continue to fight burgeoning legislation in other states. "We need to keep adding bills because manufacturers can keep playing whack-a-mole with lobbyists if there's only one or two states," Gordon-Byrne said. "But if there's 10, 12, 16 bills—that level of pressure is going to be hard to ignore."  John Deere letter by MotherboardTV on Scribd

According to sources who have worked with Apple in M&A, the company struggles repeatedly to pull off big deals "because of a series of quirks," including a refusal to work with investment bankers, inexperience with large takeovers, and an "aversion to risk." Apple is more interested, and more confident, in building its own services rather than outright purchasing them from a competitor, with occasional exceptions like the 2014 acquisition of Beats and later launch of Apple Music. “The first step in M&A is having some conviction about what it is you want to do,” said Eric Risley, managing partner at Architect Partners LLC who has negotiated deals with Apple. “Apple probably more than most feels that they’re very capable of building things" rather than buying them, he added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. According to analysts and investors, Apple's next big move should be the acquisition of an online video streaming service. The company has began making strides towards beefing up Apple Music's original video content division, with Carpool Karaoke: The Series and Planet of the Apps coming this spring, but analysts believe it needs something "akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Video." In order to reach a forecast of $50 billion revenue in its services business by 2021, Erick Maronak, chief investment officer at Victory Capital Management, said that the company is "going to have to pursue something bigger than a Beats-like acquisition." This might include other possible "blockbuster" acquisitions like Walt Disney Co. or Tesla Inc, according to Baird analyst William Power. Netflix is also mentioned multiple times as a logical acquisition target for Apple, with multiple investors and analysts saying the company "needs at least one big acquisition in online video." But even here, some analysts and investors argue for a big acquisition, especially in online video streaming. Apple has started distributing videos through the Music service, and pooling other providers’ video in its mobile TV app, but it has no service akin to Netflix or Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Video. On Friday, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple needs at least one big acquisition in online video. To reach its $50 billion target, the company must find an extra $13 billion in services revenue over the next four years -- beyond what it can generate itself. Netflix Inc. ended 2016 with sales of less than $9 billion, so even buying that business may not be enough, the analyst said. Looking behind the scenes at the process Apple goes through to acquire a company, the Apple deals team is said to be made up of around a dozen people and led by Apple's head of M&A Adrian Perica. Most deals "take place at the behest of the company's engineers," so the team meets with Apple engineers who advise them on which potential acquisition targets are attractive and include talented engineers that would add value to Apple. Its acquisition strategy works well for smaller startups, which it acquires frequently, but the company faces a challenge for bigger deals. Apple refuses to work with investment bankers in an attempt to work directly with the other company's management teams. This results in an air of arrogance, according to Eric Risley, who has negotiated deals with Apple, further stating that "they’re used to being able to muscle their way in and get attractive economics." The company's overall attitude "puts off sellers," as well as its inexperience with integrating larger companies. Some analysts point towards the "lukewarm" launch of Apple Music after the Beats acquisition as proof of this struggle. Still, some investors remain adamant that for Apple to succeed, particularly in its attempts at creating and producing original TV, a big acquisition has to happen soon. Many of those have been pushing Netflix as an attractive target, despite Netflix saying it's not for sale. Read the rest of Bloomberg's report right here.

Can you define what it is you expect Apple to be releasing? I can't help anyone that thinks the TouchBar is "exciting". The touch bar signifies everything wrong with Apple. Junk products not thought out. Think about typing in a word processor. The touch bar gives you suggested words.....but your typing so you are looking at the screen and not the keyboard....sooooo. I tried to type a document with it in the Apple Store and discovered it was quicker to just type and use spell check than use the touch bars auto-correct and recommendations. By something like 3-4x faster. That is a products that solves a problem that nobody had. It also is dim and feels very cheap just like the MacBook Pro it's in. It is just not a good idea or product.

The drawings show that pressing the "Share" key would bring up a share sheet on the iPad Pro with options to share through apps such as Facebook, Mail, and Messages. There is no description of how the "Emoji" key would function, but pressing it would presumably bring up the on-screen Emoji keyboard on the iPad Pro. The current Smart Keyboard already has a globe key in the bottom left corner that can bring up the on-screen Emoji keyboard, but this key is not visualized in the patent drawings. There is a non-existent "Fn" key in its place. The third key, labeled with a magnifying glass, would serve multiple purposes. A single press, for example, could bring up a search field for searching within apps. A double press could bring up shortcuts for Messages, Photos, Calendar, Camera, Notes, Settings, and other apps. Long-pressing the key would invoke Siri. Since this is not a design patent, Apple's drawings are not entirely accurate, but rather just basic visualizations. The "Share" key is located where the right-side Command and Option keys would normally be, for example, while the "Emoji" key is included in lieu of Caps Lock, which is an essential key. Nevertheless, we roughed up a quick mockup of what the new Smart Keyboard could look like based on the same layout of the new keys as Apple's drawings. Apple is rumored to launch a trio of new iPads as early as March, but possibly not until later this year, including an all-new 10-inch range iPad Pro with an edge-to-edge display. The other models are expected to be updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models with faster A10X processors. A so-called "Smart Keyboard 2" could accompany the new iPads and perhaps the so-called "Apple Pencil 2" rumored to launch this year. The current Smart Keyboard was released in November 2015 and costs $149 and $169 for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro respectively. International versions such as British English, Dutch, Korean, Spanish, Italian, German, Swedish, French, and Arabic were released in August 2016.

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Apple has currently contracted with Samsung to provide 160 million OLED displays for its 2017 iPhones, but people familiar with the discussions said Apple is considering adding BOE to its list of suppliers moving forward to offset the chances of experiencing an OLED display shortfall. BOE is building new OLED plants in China in anticipation of ramping up production in the hopes of becoming Apple’s first display provider outside of Japan and South Korea. LG is also set to begin supplying foldable OLED screens to Apple starting in 2018. Comments « Apple to fight Nebraska ‘right to repair’ bill Daily Deal: Keezel Online Security & Privacy Solution.

Nebraska is one of eight states considering legislation that would force Apple and other electronics manufacturers to provide the public with diagnostic and service manuals so they can do their own repairs, but Nebraska is the first state to schedule hearings for the proposed law. A source within the legislature said “an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist” will testify against the bill during the March 9 hearing, arguing that customers trying to make their own modifications could cause the device’s lithium battery to catch fire. Apple declined to comment on the story, but the company has successfully lobbied against similar legislation in the past, most recently last year in New York. The bills gained new steam this year after being backed by the trade organization Repair.org and endorsed by the American Farm Bureau Federation.

What does US$250,000 get you at Berkshire Hathaway? Warren BuffettGeorge Soros Wednesday, 15 February 2017 (18 hours ago) It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach an all-time highest closing level. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election which he had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing fee can almost be justified in Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NYSE:AAPL). At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his half a century or so at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known has ploughed into airliners in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV)in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NASDAQ:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, Buffett – now 19 – enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm Berkshire Hathaway in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks and he’ll point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock which that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occassions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988 which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the purchase almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private auto insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Recent related news What does your Horoscope have in store this week?

Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services, said original series is “one of the differentiating factors we can add to Apple Music. He said the music service now has more than 20 million users. Apple is also setting the release of another original, Carpool Karaoke: The Series, which will also be distributed by Apple Music.  Planet of the Apps, a series about apps and their creators features Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am, and is produced by Propagate Content chairman and co-CEO Ben Silverman, the former co-chairman of NBC Universal and Universal Media Studios, who joined Cue on-stage. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was seeking to form a new business focused on high-quality original TV shows and movies and to start offering scripted content by the end of this year. But rather than using that strategy to go after OTT video giants like Amazon and Netflix, the content strategy is to center around Apple Music as it continues to grapple with rival music streaming service Spotify. RELATED: Apple Ramping Up Plan for Original TV Shows, Movies: Report "We're not out trying to buy a bunch of shows, we're trying to do some things that are creative, that can, we think, move culture and that Apple is adding some value to" he said. Cue said the move into original TV content doesn’t mean Apple is gearing up to buy a big media company like Lionsgate or Time Warner. RELATED: Cook: Apple ‘Open to Acquisitions of Any Size’ “We are trying to do something that’s unique, takes advantage of our platforms and that really brings culture to it,” Cue said. “Right now, we think we can do that with partners like Ben, and we don’t see that anywhere else.” Last year, Apple hired former Time Warner Cable exec Peter Stern in a VP role focused on the company’s subscription services, including Apple Music.

Rumors suggest that there will be three new devices with the more basic devices being the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. The third device is expected to be a very high-end and feature packed smartphone called the iPhone 8 to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone launch. A new rumor circulating today suggests that the iPhone 8 may be the only new iPhone of the trio that is fitted with a glass and steel body. We reported yesterday that the iPhone 8 has also been tipped to get a curved OLED screen made by Samsung Display. Apple ordered up another 60 million screens recently according to reports. Apple may finally lure those folks who haven’t seen a worthy upgrade in more recent iPhone devices to finally upgrade to the iPhone 8. The catch is that the cost for the iPhone 8 has been rumored at around $1,000. With carriers no longer offering subsidies on phones, if the price rumor is accurate your phone bill will go up significantly to cover the cost of the new smartphone. A large chunk of that cost is said to be the screen. There will be users of the iPhone 4 out there that remember that glass and steel bodied smartphone that was able to crack on the front and back if you dropped it. Hopefully the iPhone 8 won’t have this issue thanks to modern glass. The steel body might be needed to help facilitate wireless charging.

Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 14:45 15 Feb 2017 The answer is one share, but there’s more to it than that Buffett's estimated to be worth US$75bn It was Valentine’s day yesterday, but if you’re a Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) shareholder, you won’t be remembering it for the over-priced dinner at the local steakhouse. Instead, 14 February 2017 will be remembered as the day that the Berkshire share price edged over US$250,000 to reach its all-time highest close. No, you haven’t read that wrong nor is it a typo. A quarter of a million dollars is now the going rate for one Berkshire Hathaway Class A share. At the head of this ultra-exclusive club is Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and (depending on your source of information) the second richest person in the world worth a cool US$75bn or so. His company has surged more than 12% in the months following the US election, which ironically he reportedly had hoped would be won by Hillary Clinton. It might not stop there either. Analysts reckon insurance firm Geico – taken over by Berkshire in 1996 – is likely to post improved results at its next quarterly earnings report. Wall Street reckons the cash pouring in from the likes of Geico and other wholly-owned subsidiaries such as NetJets and Fruit of the Loom could see the Berkshire cash pile hit US$100bn later this year. The astonishing price tag on the company's shares can almost be justified by Berkshire's returns over the past 50 years or so since Buffett took the reins. The per-share book value of the company rose by more than 1,800,000% between 1964 and 2015. Upsetting the Apple-cart The company might be about to make another sizeable return on investment thanks to a certain tech company called Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well. At the ripe old age of 86, if Buffett can still cartwheel there’s a good chance he’s done one or two over the past couple of weeks. The billionaire has tended to avoid tech stocks in his time at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, following the principle of "invest in what you know", but the company began to pile into Apple this time last year. By September, Berkshire had 15.23mln shares in the California-based group. The share price then began to fall away towards the end of the year but rather than follow the likes of George Soros and pull out from Apple altogether, Buffett went the other way and loaded up even more. By the end of the year, Berkshire owned a little over 57mln shares in the tech giant. Assuming its stake has remained the same during the first six weeks of the year, that stake is now worth in the region of US$7.75bn; or around US$1.1bn more than it was at the end of 2016. Airliners get the backing of Buffett Alongside Apple, the ‘Oracle of Omaha’ as he’s affectionately known, has ploughed into airlines in recent times. Berkshire more than doubled its stake in American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ:AAL) to 45.5mln shares as of 31 December, while its investment in Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) increased almost tenfold to 60mln shares. Berkshire also bumped up its stake in fellow airline companies United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) in the last few months of 2016. Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON) and Sirius XM Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:SIRI) were also on the list of Berkshire investments at the end of 2016. All of these companies, without exception, gained in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Others like Walmart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) – which Berkshire either sold off completely or reduced – were all down this morning. Warren Buffett: A brief history The son of Congressman Howard Buffett, the future billionaire was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska (hence the nickname). He had a penchant for making money from a young age, with various stories of him selling chewing gum, delivering papers and working in his grandfather’s grocery shop. When he was still only 15, Buffett and a friend put a games machine in a barber shop. Within months the pair had installed a few more machines in other shops and sold the business shortly after for US$1,200. After being rejected for Harvard, the 19-year-old Buffett enrolled at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University, earning a master’s degree in economics. Following a few successful partnerships and fairly well-paid jobs as a broker and salesman, by 1962 Buffett was a millionaire. He started buying shares in a relatively unknown textiles firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the same year, before completing the takeover of the group in 1965. Berkshire eventually moved away from its textiles roots, with Buffett instead choosing to use it as a holding company for other investments. The company has gone on to make numerous investments in the likes of Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), while it has also bought outright several businesses including Geico and Fruit of the Loom. The millionaire became a billionaire in May 1990 when Berkshire Hathaway began selling Class A shares, with the market closing at US$7,175 a share on the first day of trading. Value investing Savvy investments have been key to Buffett’s success, and if you were to ask Buffett where he learned most of his tricks he’d likely point to his old Columbia Business School professor Benjamin Graham. Graham first came up with what is now called ‘value investing’ back in the ‘30s, a theory which he then passed on to many students, including the young Buffett. The professor, and now his ex-student, has argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. For example, a stock that trades at a discount to its book value, or has low price-to-earning multiples might be considered to be a value investment. Value investing doesn’t mean buying cheap stocks though. As Buffett has explained on several occasions: “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price.” Greatest hits Buffett's investing methods have paid off handsomely on numerous occasions, and the world famous drinks brand that is Coca Cola is up there with one of his greatest ever buys. He purchased a 7% stake in the firm for US$1bn back in 1988, which Berkshire still holds to this day. That same stake is now worth upwards of US$12bn. One of his early deals, way back in 1964, was to buy shares in American Express after the bank’s share price collapsed to US$35 following a fraud scandal. While Wall Street moved its money out of the company, in came the Oracle who snapped up a 5% stake for US$13mln. Only a few years later and the share price was back up to US$180, netting him a tidy US$20mln profit. Another smash hit for the world’s second richest man also came in his earlier days. In 1976 when insurance firm Geico was facing bankruptcy, Buffett started buying stock at US$2 a share before completing the takeover almost two decades later in 1996. Under Berkshire’s leadership, Geico has become the second largest private vehicle insurer in the US. A couple of misses, too It hasn’t all been plain sailing though. Buffett admitted a couple of years ago that “thumb sucking” with regards to selling its stake in UK supermarket Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) cost Berkshire US$444mln; one of the biggest losses in its history. Buffett refused to pull the plug on his investment despite the grocer issuing four profit warnings and becoming embroiled in an accounting scandal back in 2014. Another error of judgement came in 2007 when Buffett, without consulting his right hand man Charlie Munger, bought US$2bn of bonds in the utilities firm Energy Future Holdings. Buffett had expected gas prices to rise but they took a dive instead. Buffett threw in the towel in 2013 and sold the bonds for just US$259mln for a total loss of almost US$900mln.

 Apple Music gets into the TV business BI Intelligence Feb. 15, 2017, 10:11 AM 1,001 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Facebook makes a play for music Google reshuffles its music products Most Americans will have more than one streaming video subscription by 2018 This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Digital Media Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Apple officially unveiled its first two TV series, “Planet of the Apps” and a series version of “Carpool Karaoke,” at the Recode Media conference on Monday night. Both shows will be available on Apple Music, an imperative segment for the future growth of Apple as it looks to differentiate itself from competitors, according to Apple SVP of Internet Software and Services Eddy Cue. The company is also rumored to be planning the launch of a six-part mini-series produced by Dr. Dre, though Cue gave no mention of additional developments in that project. Original TV content is a way for Apple Music to differentiate itself from Spotify. As of December 2016, Apple Music logged around 20 million subscribers, and while this is just about half of those paying for Spotify, it took Spotify double the amount of time to reach 20 million paying subscribers as it did for Apple. To continue this growth, Apple will need to continue to innovate, and securing original TV shows and movies is one way to do that, especially as mobile online video is expected to comprise roughly 75% of all mobile data by 2020, according to Cisco. However, Cue was hesitant to compare Apple’s business to that of Netflix and Hulu. Cue made it clear the company is not at the point where it is swiftly increasing spend on video via content licensing or acquisitions, according to a Recode article. It’s important to point out, though, that Apple is sitting on over $200 billion in cash, which it could use to invest heavily in original or syndicated content. By comparison, Netflix plans on spending $6 billion on original content in 2017. The company has also undergone a set of TV-related initiatives within the last few months. Most recently, Apple hired Timothy Twerdhal, the former the head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, as a vice president to lead Apple TV product marketing. And last fall, Apple debuted a TV app that serves as a unified platform for video content. The app seeks to improve the film and TV search discovery and viewing experience. Apple’s new TV app hopes to do away with the inconvenience traveling from app to app when searching for content. Growth of subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services in the US has slowed considerably over the last year as competition in the online video streaming space intensifies. Heavy hitters like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are increasingly squeezed by new competitors with exclusive content and niche video offerings.   International markets, and specifically, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region will be paramount for both established SVOD players and new entrants looking to establish themselves in the successful video space. The SVOD market in the APAC region is poised for explosive growth over the next five years due to increased mobile adoption, amplified broadband expansion, and enhanced purchasing power. Dylan Mortensen, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on subscription video on-demand that explores how slowing SVOD growth in the US will lead to a surge in the APAC region. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: While SVOD services are increasingly rooted among US households, growth is beginning slow. Growth in North American SVOD subscriptions is set to fall from 30% in 2014 to 4% by 2018. The best opportunity for continued growth lies in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The region had nearly 42 million SVOD subscribers in 2015, but could have up to 158 million by 2021. The increasing adoption of smartphones and mobile data is propelling growth in mobile video viewing across APAC, which is poised to outpace the rest of the world. Rising purchasing power in APAC underlines the opportunity for online video services. China and emerging Asian economies represent nearly two-thirds (63%) of global economic growth. Content creators and marketers stand to gain from SVOD’s push into the APAC region. Content creators can benefit from the surge in short-form video, while marketers can capitalize on advanced product placements. In full, the report:  Forecasts SVOD subscribers in the APAC region. Explores the factors behind SVOD’s slowing growth in the US. Breaks down reasons why APAC is ripe for massive online video growth. Discusses who will benefit from SVOD growth in APAC.

A front-facing 3-D scanner could replace the home button, which could be phased out if Apple goes with a full-glass front this year, Hall wrote in a research note this week. Biometric facial scanning would be more secure for Apple Pay and could work better in "wet conditions" if the iPhones are more water resistant, JPMorgan wrote. Other industry watchers, like Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, have speculated that Apple is likely working on an augmented reality platform using 3-D sensors in phones. While this may eventually be true, JPMorgan expects the feature is more likely to be used with clothing sizing, home improvement measurements and scanning for 3-D printing. CNBC has reached out to Apple, which rarely announces product features before a new version is officially unveiled. Facial scanning would put Apple in the race with Google's Android platform, which has a "trusted face" security lock setting. It would cost about $10 or $15 per phone, Hall said, squaring with other analysts who have predicted it would be costly. Apple's sensor technology is also a valuable part of its intellectual property, Hall said. On Tuesday, Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri said that chips and sensors are among the most "strategic" and "important" Apple investments. — CNBC's Mack Hogan contributed to this report Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change AAPL --- Binge 'Walking Dead' a megahit, thanks in part to white-knuckled binge-watchers By: Marc Gilbert, senior producer, CNBC Walking Dead producer: The phenomenon is no accident    Walking Dead producer: The show isn’t about zombies    Terminator writer sounds alarm on AI    Walking Dead producer: VR makes me nauseous

Position Last Quarter Berkshire Hathaway now has a 1% stake in the Mac maker. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Feb 15, 2017 at 9:44AM So much for that aversion to tech. The Oracle of Omaha made waves last year when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) disclosed that it had picked up a cool $1 billion worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, enough to scoop up 9.8 million shares. It's worth noting that this initial investment decision was not made by Buffett himself, but rather one of his lieutenants. Berkshire then proceeded to buy an additional 5.4 million shares in the second quarter of 2016, increasing its position to 15.2 million shares valued $1.5 billion at the time. There was no reported change in the number of shares during the third quarter, although Berkshire enjoyed some gains as shares rose. Berkshire has just filed its Form 13F for the fourth quarter, and it nearly quadrupled its Apple position. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Berkshire is now sitting on 57.4 million shares of the Mac maker, valued at $6.6 billion at the end of last year. Not many investors can say this, but Buffett now has a 1% stake in Apple, which is a pretty tall order when we're talking about a $700 billion company. You can count on one hand the number of institutional investors that have a stake greater than or equal to Buffett's, and most of those are fund families that aggregate reported holdings across different funds. Apple was a big chunk of Buffett's buying spree In an interview with Charlie Rose a few weeks back, Buffett noted that Berkshire had acquired $12 billion in common stock in the wake of the election, which represented a significant increase in buying activity. In contrast, Berkshire bought approximately $10 billion worth of equities through all of 2015. Apple Store Third Street Promenade. Image source: Apple. While some of that $12 billion was seemingly purchased after the new year, and we don't know what prices Berkshire was buying Apple at, it's safe to say that a good chunk of that money was allocated to the Mac maker. Apple's average share price during the fourth quarter was right around $113, which would translate into $4.8 billion based on the additional 42.1 million shares purchased during the quarter. Of course, Buffett is far from a market timer, but with shares currently trading at all-time highs, the increased position is already faring quite well. Shares are already up 17% year to date, thanks in part to a record fourth-quarter earnings release. AAPL data by YCharts. Cash flow is one of Buffett's favorite investing metrics, particularly compared to figures like net income, which are subject to more qualitative judgments from management and more prone to manipulation in general. Apple has cash flow in spades, and currently has the largest cash position of any company ever. The tech titan generated over $65 billion in operating cash flow in 2016, of which $52 billion was free cash flow. If Buffett thinks Apple is undervalued enough to nearly quadruple Berkshire's position, he's probably on to something. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

 Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Kif Leswing Feb. 14, 2017, 12:38 PM 29,230 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Music Apple is breaking into original TV content, and the trailer for one of its first shows, "Planet of the Apps," was released Monday evening. And by a large margin, Apple fans — and even some employees — seem to hate it. The concept for the reality-TV show is something like "Shark Tank" meets "The Voice." App developers come up with ideas for apps, choose a celebrity mentor such as Will.i.am or Jessica Alba, and eventually win $10 million in funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners as well as premium placement on the front page of Apple's App Store. "Developers, they're the rock stars of right now," Will.i.am says in the trailer while wearing gold boots. One contestant gives the one-liner, "We're eBay for the Snapchat generation." The show will air exclusively on Apple Music. You can watch the trailer at the bottom of the page. Here's what the Apple world is saying about it: Paul Haddad, the developer of popular iOS apps including Tweetbot: I can’t wait to see https://t.co/50qeVJsNkW doing code review. “You’ve got an unsatisfiable layout constraint, look at my gold shoes!” — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) February 14, 2017 Sam Soffes, who previously developed popular apps including the top Bible app: Got an email from Apple asking me to apply for this. So glad I passed. https://t.co/pOU0QTMMvB — Sam Soffes (@soffes) February 14, 2017 Realmac Software founder Dan Counsell: Apple should be producing amazing content like Netflix Originals does. Not this garbage. I am disappointed. — Dan Counsell (@dancounsell) February 14, 2017 Renaud Lienhart, the Home app developer at Apple: Today, I am ashamed to work for Apple. This is embarrassing, and not what we work hard for.https://t.co/9O5mjEGElm — Renaud Lienhart (@RenaudLienhart) February 14, 2017 Apple blogger and Instapaper founder Marco Arment: I’m sure Planet of the Apps will be a great show for all of those people who bug developers with their awful ideas. https://t.co/PORl3y4t1Y — Marco Arment (@marcoarment) February 14, 2017 Jake Frey, an app designer at Frey Labs: Devs: Hey the App Store has a few problems and its hard to be discovered. Can you take a look? Apple: Uh nope but that would make great TV! https://t.co/IjYAc58XLF — Jake Frey (@frey) February 14, 2017 Dermot Daly, the founder of Tapadoo, an iPhone app studio (Daly also wrote a Medium post): “Planet of the Apps. No. Just No”. https://t.co/Z67aaLH5xu (Typos, etc on a postcard to me please). — Dermot Daly (@dermdaly) February 14, 2017 But some are defending the show, pointing out that perhaps Apple fans and developers are not its target audience. Apple blogger Rene Ritchie: Planet of the Apps: Not intended for “us” but for the mainstream. Or, now “we” know how cooks have felt about Hell’s Kitchen for a decade. — Rene Ritchie 🖇 (@reneritchie) February 14, 2017 Watch the full trailer below:     SEE ALSO: Apple is at an all-time high More: Apple Apple Music Planet of the Apps Marco Arment Rene Ritchie Will.i.am Jessica Alba Lightspeed Ventures Lightspeed Venture Partners facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple fans and employees are 'ashamed' of Apple's new reality show, 'Planet of the Apps' Apple is breaking into original TV...

The only major winner last year, reports CNET, was Amazon, which doubled the number of tablets it sold – though Lenovo also saw a 12.3% growth to 10.9M sales. Despite the plunge in iPad sales, however, Apple comfortably retains its #1 slot in the market. Apple‘s iPad […] retained its top spot, selling 42 million devices to comfortably best Samsung. Samsung came in at a distant second place with 27 million tablets sold. Trendforce is predicting that iPad shipments will continue to fall this year, with a further slip in its market share, but that the damage will be minor. It is forecasting a slide in sales from 42.5M to 39.3M. With Samsung expected to experience a similar drop, Apple’s market share would be only marginally reduced, from 27% to 26.6%. The numbers back earlier ones from IDC and Strategy Analytics, which also give Apple a comfortable lead over Samsung and other players. Numbers differ, thanks in part to rather interchangeable use of sales and shipments, and also through different definitions of ‘tablet.’ Some analysts count two-in-one laptop/tablet devices while others don’t. Slow upgrade cycles are a significant factor in iPad sales, with the majority of even 9to5Mac readers – who likely upgrade more often than most – buying a new devices at 4+ year intervals. Apple is, however, fighting back with promotions and enterprise initiatives. Guides iPad What's next for Apple's iPad line?

If so, you might have been targeted by scammers using authentic-looking ‘phishing’ emails designed to steal your card details. We’ve reported in the past on tricks using faked Amazon logos, but The Mirror reports spotting examples of hackers sending emails claiming to be from not just Amazon but Apple and eBay, using a new kind of trick. All of these emails contain professional-looking graphics and authentic wording. But they’re all a scam. Hooded computer hacker with magnifying glass stealing internet password (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) The hack involves emailing would-be victims and telling them about a transaction processed on their account. There is often a prominently-displayed link asking to report the order as an error and ask for a refund. Of course, the victim will want to report the error - no one wants to be charged for something they didn’t choose and don’t want. Clicking on that link takes you through to a second page asking for your personal details. After that comes the form asking for your card details. It’s easy to be fooled by these, especially if the emails are served directly to your smartphone, as you may not see the full recipients email address. This can sometimes be a giveaway, but you’re not going to see it condensed onto a tiny smartphone screen. Remember though: no legitimate company will ever require your card details to process a refund. And many tech companies make a point of saying they will never ask for your card details over email. Here’s what the three tech giants had to say when contacted about this scam by the Mirror. Apple Apple offers a dedicated contact email for those who believe they have been a victim of a scam email such as the ones pictured here. “On the surface, the email may appear to be from a legitimate company or individual, but it’s not,” the company says. “Forwarding the message with complete header information provides Apple with important information.” Amazon The Amazon logo (Photo: PA) Amazon takes a similar stance against these kinds of scams and lays out what people should do if they’re unsure whether an email is genuine. “From time to time you might receive e-mails purporting to come from Amazon.co.uk which do not come from actual Amazon.co.uk accounts; instead, they are falsified and attempt to convince you to reveal sensitive account information,” the company said. Read More How your Visa credit or debit card could be hacked in just six seconds “These false e-mails, also called “spoof e-mails” or “phishing e-mails,” look similar to genuine e-mails from Amazon.co.uk. Often these e-mails direct you to a false website that looks similar to an Amazon.co.uk website, where you might be asked to give your account information and password.” Amazon says it will never use an email to ask for: bank account information, credit card number, PIN number, or credit card security code, your mother’s maiden name or other information to identify you (such as your place of birth or your favourite pet’s name) or your Amazon.co.uk password. eBay The eBay logo Similarly, eBay won’t ask you to resolve disputes over email. It says you need to log into your My eBay page and conduct any refund dealings from there. A simple rule to live by is to never put your personal details - especially financial details - into any link you access through an email.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | February 15, 2017 -- 13:23 GMT (05:23 PST) | Topic: Smartphones Apple topped the global smartphone market in the fourth quarter of 2016, which saw the "closest ever" gap between the iPhone maker and its Korean competitor, Samsung. Some 432 million smartphone units were sold worldwide in the quarter, up 7 percent year-on-year, according to the latest market figures from Gartner. This pushed total sales in 2016 to almost 1.5 billion units, up 5 percent from the previous year. Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation Cupertino is a victim of its own success and is fully responsible for creating the Chinese Android monster. Read More Samsung saw its sales drop 8 percent for the fourth quarter, clocking a second consecutive quarterly dip and pushing its share down by 2.9 percent year-on-year, said Gartner's research director Anshul Gupta. He noted that the Korean smartphone maker's move to discontinue sales of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range, dragging down overall sales of its smartphone portfolio. Samsung also faced increasing competition in the mid-tier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK, and Gionee--all of which saw increased sales every quarter last year, Gupta added. With Samsung's stance weakened, Apple was able to climb ahead to assume pole position in the fourth quarter. This marked the first time in eight quarters that the iPhone maker had led the global market, the Gartner analyst said, but it held a narrow lead of just 256,000 units ahead of Samsung. Gupta said: "The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014, when its sales were driven by its first ever large-screen iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. "It also benefitted from the weakened demand for Samsung's smartphones in mature markets such as North America and Western Europe, and in some mature markets in Asia such as Australia and South Korea," he said. Despite of its Note 7 woes and Apple's quarter surge, Samsung still led the global smartphone market in 2016 with a 20.5 percent market share, ahead of Apple's 14.4 percent. Both vendors saw their market shares drop for the year compared to 2015, where Samsung led with 22.5 percent while Apple had 15.9 percent. Samsung pushed 306.45 million units in 2016, while Apple sold 216.06 million units. The year proved stellar for China's smartphone vendors, which saw their share climb 7 percent for the fourth quarter--with Huawei, Oppo, and BBK accounting for 21.3 percent of global sales. This was a 7.3 percent climb from the previous year. Gupta pointed to the "good timing" of Huawei's Mate 9, which was unveiled during the quarter and within a month of Samsung's decision to discontinue the Note 7, propping the smartphone as an alternative. It helped narrow the gap between the Chinese vendor and Samsung to a difference of 36 million units, compared to more than 50 million units in the fourth quarter of 2015. Huawei shipped 132.82 million units in 2016. He added that Mate 9 with Alexa, expected to ship in the US market in the first quarter of 2017, would help Huawei further reduce the gap with Samsung.

"BBK's focus on quality, design, and strong branding initiatives has positioned it as a strong mobile phone brand in China and India," the research firm said. "BBK continued its hold on the No. 2 position in China and was marginally ahead of Huawei during the fourth quarter of 2016." It added that BBK saw strong growth in India, where its sales climbed 278 percent in quarter and more than 363 percent in 2016. This helped push its global market position to fifth. Gartner said major Chinese brands such as Huawei, ZTE, Xiaomi, and Lenovo were expanding into markets outside China, where they would "continue to disrupt the top smartphone players in 2017". Gupta added: "Samsung needs to successfully launch the next Galaxy flagship phone in order to continue the momentum Galaxy S7 generated, and win back lost customers by launching a new large screen and stylus-equipped smartphone." For the year, Google's Android grew its lead to account for 82 percent of the total OS market in fourth-quarter 2016. For the year, its market share climbed 3.2 percent to hit 84.8 percent, making it the only mobile platform to see yearly growth. Gupta said Google's Pixel smartphone and the re-entry of Nokia--via HMD--would drive further competition in the premium and mid-tier market segments, respectively.

Apple needs Samsung for the iPhone 8 by Aleks • February 15, 2017 February 15, 2017 in Apple Apple and Samsung are two of the biggest competitors in the world of technology. The two companies have had numerous court battles over the years. And every year, they compete for the best-selling phone. This year, Samsung is launching its Galaxy S8 in March/April, while Apple launches the iPhone 8 in September. The good news for Samsung is that the Korean company can make more money, even if Apple sells more devices. How is that? Well, Samsung is crucial for the success of the iPhone 8. ADVERTISEMENT How Samsung controls Apple? For the iPhone 8, Apple will finally make the switch to OLED displays. Previously, Apple used LCD displays for the iPhone. However, this year, the Cupertino-based company is making a switch. And Samsung is the only company in the world that can meet Apple’s demands. At the moment, Samsung controls 95% of the market for OLED displays. According to reports, Apple has already ordered more than 160 million OLED displays for the upcoming iPhone 8. The company will actually release three different iPhones, but only the iPhone 8 will use OLED displays. Apple will also release the iPhone 7S and the iPhone 7S Plus. The deal between the two companies is reported to be around $4.3 billion. Add in the profit Samsung makes from selling the Galaxy S8, and the Korean company is in a unique position to profit from two of the most anticipated phones this year. What about other manufacturers? Samsung not only supplies Apple with OLED displays but also other companies. LG Display might start producing OLED screens in the next year or two, but at the moment, Samsung is the only one meeting the demands and standards. Which phones have OLED display? Most of Samsung devices have OLED display. That includes the flagship line like Galaxy S, but also the Galaxy C, Galaxy J, and Galaxy A line. As for non-Samsung phones, the Nexus also has an OLED display. Other phones with OLED screens include the LG Flex line, the Asus Zenfone line, Motorola Moto Droid, Nokia Lumia 930, and the Lenovo P line. The iPhone 8 will be the latest in that group.

Over the year as a whole, the Chinese maker saw its sales leap by 26.7 percent, while the South Korean and US rivals both saw their sales decline by 4.3 percent, Gartner said in a study. As result, Huawei was able to increase its share of the smartphone sector to 8.9 percent in 2016 from 7.3 percent a year earlier, while Samsung saw its market share shrink by two full percentage points to 20.5 percent and Apple's contracted to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent. "Chinese makers succeeded in winning market share over last year and Huawei now seems to be the main rival to the two giants, even if the gap remains large," Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann told AFP. Among the other Chinese smartphone makers are OPPO, BBK Communication Equipment (with its One Plus and Vivo brands), ZTE, Xiaomi and Lenovo. "We're seeing a very real progression compared with earlier years, when the number three maker and the others had struggled to hold on to a market share of more than four percent," Zimmermann said. "Huawei looks likely to strengthen its position again this year," she added. In the fourth quarter of 2016 alone, the launch of the iPhone 7 and Samsung's difficulties with its Note 7 model enabled Apple to take top slot in the market with a share of 17.9 percent or 77 million units sold. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the October-December period, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, while Huawei sold 40.8 million phones or a market share of 9.5 percent. "Preliminary data for the current quarter suggest that Samsung will overtake Apple again. But it's remarkable that Apple can hold on to that sort of share of the market with a closed eco-system," the analyst said. With regard to the different operating systems, Android, which is used by the large majority of smartphone makers, commands a market share of 81.7 percent, while Apple's iOS operating system of its iPhones and iPads accounts for 17.9 percent of the market.

Apple held 17.9% of the market, selling 77 million units. Samsung had 17.8%, with 76.8 million units sold. This is the second consecutive quarter in which Samsung delivered falling quarterly smartphone sales. “Samsung’s smartphone sales started to drop in the third quarter of 2016, and the decision to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 slowed down sales of its smartphone portfolio in the fourth quarter,” said Gartner. Gartner said Samsung also faced growing competition in the middle and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK, and Gionee. “The last time Apple was in the leading position was in the fourth quarter of 2014.” “This time it achieved it thanks to strong sales of its flagship phones – the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.” Gartner’s stats for the whole of 2016 show Samsung still in the lead, though, with 20.5% of the market.

The US-based Dubliner swapped Ireland for the Big Apple when he was just 25 years old after feeling "miserable" in his old job. Aidan Keogh with his proud mum (Photo: @aidankofficial Instagram) He said: “I was an apprentice lithographic printer in Chapelizod when I left school. I was there for almost four years and I was miserable. I just didn’t fit in. “I remember the September 11 ­terror attacks in New York when the Twin Towers collapsed and we all stood around the radio in shock. “That was the moment I said, ‘I need to find my happiness. Life is too short and I’m not going to continue being miserable here.’ https://www.instagram.com/p/-w07DOB5bt/embed https://www.instagram.com/p/BK52SiDglxi/embed “I left shortly after that and the rest is history. Now New York has been my home for ten years.” Aidan began working in Brown Thomas,before he was recruited by make-up company MAC - and he quickly rose up the ranks. MAC in New York soon learned of his skills, and the 36-year-old hasn't looked back since. He told the Irish Sun: “It was a scary feeling at first but it was just like when I left the print factory. Everything I’ve ever wanted is outside my comfort zone. “I was 25 years old leaving Dublin to build the life I wanted for myself in New York. I’m 36 years old and it’s been a lot of hard work.

The two deals with Samsung would account for 160 million OLED displays. That in itself is staggering and yet today we're learning that Apple is in discussions with China's BOE Technology Group Co. to supply next-generation displays for future iPhones. So who is the BOE Technology Group?   According to the company's literature, BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd., was founded in April 1993, is a supplier of internet of things technologies, products and services. BOE's three core businesses are Display Device, Smart System and Healthcare Service. BOE's products are widely used in a broad spectrum of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, notebook, monitor, TV, vehicle display, digital information display, healthcare, finance, and wearable devices.   More specifically, the company notes that their OLED displays are underpinned by their proprietary advanced Super Dimension Switch technology and characterized by ultra-high definition, ultra-slim bezel, high contrast-ratio, ultra thinness, integrated touch solution, great energy efficiency, and environmental friendliness.   Today Bloomberg reports that "Apple's been testing BOE's active-matrix organic light-emitting diode screens for months but hasn't decided if it'll add the Chinese company to its roster of suppliers, one of the people said, asking not to be named talking about private negotiations. BOE, one of the country's largest screen makers, is spending close to 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) building two AMOLED plants in the southwestern province of Sichuan in anticipation of future business. Talks are at an early stage and it's unlikely to supply the next iPhone, but BOE is banking on outfitting the one in 2018 or later, the person said.   If BOE is selected for OLED, it will become the first known future supplier of the next-generation screens to Apple outside of South Korea and Japan -- a triumph for a Beijing-based company best known for computer and TV displays. The U.S. company is exploring alternatives to address a global shortage of OLED displays as it prepares to adopt the sharper, more power-efficient technology for its next iPhones, catching up with rivals such as Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co." For more on this, read the full Bloomberg report here.   The fact that Apple is going to need more than 160 million OLED displays may be a hint that Apple is looking to bring OLED to either more iPhone models or that they planning to expand OLED displays to Macs. For now it's an open question.   Other suppliers that are hoping to gain Apple orders for OLED displays in the future include LG and Foxconn/Sharp.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Mobile by Shara Tibken February 15, 2017 5:00 AM PST @sharatibken Apple CEO Tim Cook last year fought a request to develop software that would help the FBI break into an iPhone used in a terrorist attack. James Martin/CNET It's been a year since Apple fought the FBI over data privacy, and we've barely heard a peep from either side on the issue. So everything's fine, right? Uh, no. The FBI's attempt to force Apple to unlock an iPhone used by a terrorist set up a grand legal battle between security and privacy. On one side is a massive tech company envisioning a future similar to the setting in George Orwell's "1984" (which, coincidentally, has become a bestseller again after President Donald Trump's inauguration). On the other is the world's most powerful government dangling the threat of a terrorist attack if it can't get access to vital information. The stakes were sky-high. Cybersecurity experts said the dispute could have far-reaching implications for everything from how private our personal photos are to how tech companies operate in other countries. Both were poised to head to court, and then a funny thing happened: The FBI suddenly said it didn't need Apple's help, and the whole affair just faded away. But that doesn't mean everything is hunky-dory. See also CNET's full coverage of Apple's battle with the FBI How an iPhone became the FBI's public enemy No. 1 (FAQ) FBI expects more legal actions over encrypted devices Because the battle never went to court, we never got an answer on whether security or privacy takes priority. A year later, the only thing that's clear from the public battle is just how hazy everything still is. And the conflict isn't going away anytime soon, especially if there's another terrorist attack. "This past year was kind of a missed opportunity to work this thing out," said William Snyder, visiting assistant professor of law at the Syracuse University College of Law. "It hasn't gone away. The question is whether you deal with it now when things are calm or later when the stakes are high." The FBI referred CNET to comments made by FBI Director James Comey in April, when he talked about how the US has always balanced privacy with public safety and how encryption has upset that balance. "The logic of strong encryption means that all of our lives, including law enforcement's life, will soon be affected by strong encryption," he said. "The notion that privacy should be absolute, or that the government should keep their hands off our phones, to me just makes no sense given our history and our values." Apple CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, has continued to champion strong encryption and Apple's efforts to protect customer data. Last week at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, he said that "it wasn't that we were being activists; it's that we were being asked to do something that we knew was wrong. And so we had a choice to just blindly do what the institution said to do, or to fight. And we just fought." What happened again? Here's a quick refresher: In early 2016, the FBI wanted Apple to create software to unlock an iPhone 5C used by Syed Farook, who weeks earlier had killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California. Apple helped pull data from Farook's iCloud account, but some dates were missing. And the FBI couldn't get into the phone because it didn't know the passcode. FBI Director James Comey testifies during a House Judiciary Committee hearing about encryption on March 1, 2016. Getty Images On February 16, 2016, US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym ordered Apple to create that software for the FBI. Apple refused, with Cook arguing that the order went too far and would threaten the security of all iPhone users. Bypassing the iPhone's password meant creating a "back door" in its iOS mobile software that could then be used to access every other iPhone, he said. The two sides battled over the following weeks in legal filings and public comments. The fight ended with a whimper on March 21 -- the day before a slated court hearing -- when the FBI found a third party to unlock the phone. It turned out the government didn't need Apple's help after all. A separate case in Brooklyn, New York, that involved a confessed drug dealer ended in a similar fashion, with the FBI dropping its request for Apple's help after finding another way into the iPhone. In both instances, the FBI initially said Apple was the only organization that could get into the iPhones. But both times, the bureau ended up being able to access the phone with the help of third parties at the 11th hour. The government didn't specify in either instance who helped it get into the iPhones, but reports later named Israeli security firm Cellebrite as the company that helped the FBI in the San Bernardino case. Cellebrite earlier this year was hacked, something Apple had worried about. "We had a choice to just blindly do what the institution said to do, or to fight. And we just fought." Apple CEO Tim Cook "I would characterize this as the opening volley in what's going to be a very long-term conversation," said Paul Rosenzweig, a former Department of Homeland Security official and founder of cybersecurity company Redbranch Law and Consulting. The encryption debate What the fight came down to was the encryption used on Farook's iPhone 5C. The technology scrambles data and requires a passcode before letting you have access. If investigators copied the hard drive, the data would remain scrambled. And if investigators entered the wrong passcode 10 times, the iPhone's data would be wiped. Tech firms and privacy advocates argue that encryption is essential to secure personal information and communications. The government and law enforcement officials counter that encryption hurts their ability to investigate criminal and terrorist activity. Apple's battle with the FBI got the average consumer and Congress thinking about the once wonky topic of encryption. It spurred others to act. Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp rolled out end-to-end encryption in early April, which means it doesn't have access to those messages and can't be forced to surrender them to the authorities. FBI drops Apple court case after unlocking terrorist's iPhone The Feds have found a way into the San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone with help from an unknown third party, but bigger security questions remain for Apple. by Claire Reilly 1:06 Close Drag The same time Apple was battling the FBI, draft legislation leaked for a possible encryption bill from two US senators, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, and Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California. The bill would have given federal judges the authority to order tech companies like Apple to help law enforcement officials access encrypted data. Tech companies essentially would be legally required to build back doors into their products, the very thing Apple fought against. "The consensus among security and privacy and legal experts was that was a terrible idea," said Larry Downes, project director for the Center for Business and Public Policy at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. "It would mean the end of any actual privacy protection." In late May, that bill -- which was never actually introduced to the Senate -- died. No other encryption bill has been proposed since. As of January, more than half the volume of internet traffic is now encrypted, according to Firefox browser maker Mozilla. Then what? While Apple may not have been back in court over this issue, others have. Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel, testifies before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on March 1 about Apple's refusal to help the FBI hack an iPhone 5C. Getty Images Microsoft and Google faced legal battles over giving law enforcement access to data stored in their cloud services, and law enforcement has asked Amazon to send recordings made by its Echo smart speaker that relate to a murder in Arkansas. Microsoft has prevailed in court with its argument that it shouldn't have to hand over data held in an Irish data center until Ireland gives approval. Google, though, wasn't as lucky. Earlier this month, a US judge ruled that Google has to give the FBI emails stored overseas. "It's a question about information stored in the cloud that isn't encrypted, but the government wants to get through the Stored Communications Act," said David Opderbeck, a professor of law at Seton Hall University Law School. It's an issue that could pop up more, he said. Apple, meanwhile, continues to beef up the security of its devices. In August, it introduced its first "bug bounty" program for outside researchers to find vulnerabilities in its software. That's long been a common practice for other tech companies, but Apple previously performed its checks internally. It now offers up to $200,000 for any flaws found and reported to the company. The Trump card The wildcard in all of this is President Trump. He's expected to take an even tougher stance than President Barack Obama when it comes to strengthening law enforcement access. "I can only expect the new administration ... to go even further than the Obama administration did in terms of data collection and the expectation that even private companies are going to be compelled to share private information with the government," said Charley Moore, CEO of online legal technology company Rocket Lawyer. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly bashed Apple for not helping the government hack the iPhone. "Who do they think they are?" he asked at one time. Another occasion, Trump called for a boycott of Apple's products until the company helped unlock the device. That never happened. "They have to open it up," Trump said in mid-February 2016. "I think security -- overall, we have to open it up and we have to use our heads. We have to use common sense." President Donald Trump likely will take a tougher stance on encryption than President Barack Obama. Getty Images Some of Trump's early moves have butted up against the technology industry. His ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations caused an outcry joined by Apple, Microsoft and dozens of other companies. His pick for the head of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, will likely dismantle net neutrality, which most of the tech industry favors. Trump also withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had a provision that would ensure no company from a member state had to provide access to its software source code as a condition of entering the market another member state's market. "That provision would have gone a long way toward avoiding the parade of foreign horribles that Apple raised in its opposition to the FBI warrant," said Joshua Rich, a partner at law firm McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff. "But because the US withdrew, other TPP member states will not be required to extend those protections to US companies." Trump made Hillary Clinton's use of a private server while secretary of state a key campaign talking point. And in late January, he was slated to sign an executive order on cybersecurity but canceled those plans without explanation. With Trump in the White House and with Congress controlled by the Republican party, pro-law enforcement legislation is likely. The hope among cybersecurity experts is that anything related to encryption or privacy that happens takes place soon, not in the aftermath of an attack as was the case with the Patriot Act. That post-Sept. 11 law increased surveillance powers and caused major privacy concerns. "The pendulum swung wildly to the national security side because we suffered through a catastrophic attack," said Daniel Rosenthal, a former counterterrorism official with the National Security Council who currently works as an associate managing director at Kroll, a corporate investigations and risk consulting firm. "If we suffer through another [attack], there's a good chance the pendulum swings again, away from the privacy and data security side." Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

A small group of Apple investors [led by Tony Maldonado are]  leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he’s submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy … to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors.” This year, Maldonado has backing from Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm specializing in socially responsible investing, but that isn’t cutting any ice with Apple … In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has “much broader” diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made “steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities.” The proposed policy, Apple concludes, “is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity.” In 2014, Apple began publishing an annual Diversity Report, which last year reported that it had increased its hiring of women and underrepresented minorities, and was working to improve pay equity. The numbers include women making up 37% percent of new hires (versus 32% of current employees) and U.S. underrepresented minorities accounting for 27% (versus 22% of current employees). Apple includes “Black, Hispanic, Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander” in the underrepresented group and counts new hires within the last 12 months as of June. The company also has a microsite for its diversity program. Maldonado and Zevin, however, believe that Apple isn’t doing enough at a senior level. Maldonado says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple’s leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it’ll hurt Apple’s business in the years to come […] Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple’s decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world […] Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a “reputational risk” by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its “search light as wide as possible” for new engineers and executives. That’ll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are “basically irreplaceable.” The proposal last year got 5.1% of the vote, above the 3% threshold required to allow him to re-submit it this year. The bar this year rises to 6%, with Maldonado hoping to reach that level to enable the fight to continue.

Timothy Huffman  Headquarters Individual Reservist Readiness and Integration Organization ✔ ✗ Subscribe 0 The Headquarters Individual Reservist Readiness and Integration Organization (HQ RIO) has released a new mobile app for Individual Mobilization Augmentees. The RIO Connect – IMA Mobile Wingman app is available to both Android and Apple users and offers IMAs easy access to the tools and information they need to manage their careers, when and where they need it. The app allows users to access content from the HQ RIO website on their mobile devices, while also leveraging native mobile features and functions, further enhancing the user experience. RIO Connect was developed based on usage statistics from the HQ RIO website and primary features include a click-to-call and email directory, pay, travel and career resources, how-to videos and an events calendar. The RIO Connect – IMA Mobile Wingman app builds off the proof-of-concept HQ RIO app developed in 2015. “This new app builds on the original app and gives our IMAs a 24/7 ability to connect, which I believe will create more enabled, engaged and empowered Airmen,” said Col. Minh-Tri Trinh, the HQ RIO Advancing Technology Office program manager. The RIO Connect app is available in both the Google Play or Apple App stores by searching RIO Connect, or by following the links below: Apple: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rio-connect-ima-mobile-wingman/id1181013237?ls=1&mt=8 Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.u360mobile.hqrio Follow the on-screen instructions to install the app. The app was developed in conjunction with Straxis Technology, LLC., of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which has developed a number of other apps for Air Force organizations, including the U.S. Air Force Academy. Col. Carolyn Stickell, the HQ RIO commander, said one of her top priorities is ensuring Individual Reservists receive the support they need to be as effective as possible when augmenting their active-component organizations. She sees the app as a platform that will deliver relevant tools and information where people want it – on their mobile devices. “The RIO Connect – IMA Mobile Wingman will give IMAs instant access to the knowledge base they want and need in a format that’s easy to access and navigate right from their mobile devices,” she said. “And, if they can’t find what they’re looking for on the app, we’ve made it easy to contact the detachments or headquarters by building our contact information right into the app.” LEAVE A COMMENT NEWS INFO Date Taken: 02.15.2017 Date Posted: 02.15.2017 08:58 Story ID: 223595 Location: BUCKLEY AIR FORCE BASE, US  Web Views: 6 Downloads: 0 Podcast Hits: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN   This work, New mobile app for IMAs is “everywhere you are”, by MSgt Timothy Huffman, identified by DVIDS, is free of known copyright restrictions under U.S. copyright law.

Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple MacBook Pro 2016 buyers were more or less happy with the device’s performance. However, when it came to battery performance, they were thoroughly disappointed. Consumer reports even suspended its recommendation after testing the device. The MacBook Pro 2017 device is expected to get major upgrades to its battery. Apple is said to be making a proprietary chip that can take away some of the load off the device’s Intel processor. Moreover, the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 has reportedly removes bugs that drain the battery away. According to Tech Times, there are certain MacBook Pro 2016 tips and tricks that can significantly enhance the device’s battery life. Users should use Safari, instead of any other browser, even Chrome. This is because Safari performs the best for the MacBook Pro 2016 when it comes to power usage as the program has been designed specifically to not use the AMD graphics processor. Thus, even when a user is using graphics-heavy pages such as Google Maps, it won’t drain much of the battery. Most people already know that background applications drain away a lot of battery. Background has to be cleaned at intervals to remove apps that are not being used currently. All browser tabs must be closed when not in use. If users want to extract 45-60 minutes extra usage from their Apple MacBook Pro 2016, they should watch videos only in full screen mode and also deactivate the closed captioning. Within this state, the laptop draws significantly less power. While these are the main tips to decrease Apple MacBook Pro 2016 battery drainage, CNET has also advised users to dim the screen even though the new screens are 30 percent more power efficient. Apple has shrunk the battery size from 95.5 watt-hours of capacity for the 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro to 76 watt-hours for the 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro. Users must also be aware of the USB devices they are using. These devices fire up the laptop’s communication system that otherwise snooze in a low-power state. Apple MacBook Pro 2016 users should always unplug dongles once they are done with their work. The new USB-C ports are amazing only when one has the right cables and peripherals. The Apple MacBook Pro 2017 is a highly-anticipated device that may come with an Intel Kaby Lake processor and QHD+ Display that may significantly improve battery life. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on Apple’s Mac products.

With the 10th-anniversary iPhone speculated for a release this coming September, there is a very good chance that the year might very well belong to Apple when it comes to success and dominance in the smartphone market. Inasmuch as the device sounds very compelling, however, a new set of rumors has ended up getting fans both optimistic and apprehensive at the same time. Rumors about the iPhone 8 have been emerging for months now, with numerous speculations and leaks stating that the device would be the first real upgrade to the iconic smartphone since the reveal of the iPhone 6 back in 2014. Currently, the consensus in the rumor mill states that the iPhone 8 would feature Apple’s homegrown A11 processor, a brand new glass and metal frame as well as innovative features such as long-range wireless charging, an iris scanner and IP68 water resistance. VIDEO: iPhone 8 – 10 Amazing New Features, Giveaway, Release Date!https://t.co/p2nlTGNsOU #AppleSentinel #iPhone8 #iPhoneX #iPhone10 #Apple pic.twitter.com/p6w33ZsYSG — AppleSentinel (@AppleSentinel) February 13, 2017 Recently, however, a new set of rumors outlined by FastCompany have managed to attract the attention of iPhone fans across the globe. According to the website, a source from within Apple has claimed that the upcoming flagship device would cost upwards of $1,000. Considering that the top-tier iPhone 7 Plus already costs more than $900, this price increase does make sense. However, it is undeniable that a starting price north of $1,000 would make the iPhone 8 out of reach for a significant number of consumers. Considering the newest rumors about the device, however, the price increase of the iPhone 8 appears to be justified. For one, rumors are high that the upcoming Apple flagship would feature battery life that is superior to all previous iPhone models. Rumors state that this upgrade on the iPhone 8’s battery is made possible by Apple adopting a stacked, L-shaped battery construction for the iPhone 8’s speculated 2700mAh battery. Coupled with the new device’s rumored OLED display, which consumes far less power than Apple’s usual LCD screens, the improvements on the iPhone 8’s battery life is expected to be significant. The rumored improvement on the device’s batteries has been embraced extremely well by Apple’s fans, with many welcoming the inclusion of a heftier power supply for the upcoming flagship device. After all, Apple’s smartphones, while exceeding the market in numerous areas, fall quite behind when it comes to battery life. Thus, if rumors prove accurate and the iPhone 8 does indeed get released with an upgraded battery, Apple would be able to catch up and possibly even surpass the smartphone market’s endurance champions. [Image by Pixabay] Another interesting rumor, reported by MacRumors, stated that the iPhone 8 would feature fewer buttons than its predecessors, with the physical volume rocker, mute button, and power button being removed from the device. These rumors further stated that the iPhone 8’s buttons would follow the iPhone 7’s model, with capacitive buttons being partnered with a haptic engine. While the idea of a capacitive volume rocker has been embraced fairly well by fans of the device, the premise of a non-physical mute and power button has managed to get iPhone fans pretty apprehensive. After all, simply tasks such as hard resetting or muting the iPhone 8 while the device is in a pocket would be quite difficult if the buttons are all capacitive. This is not all, however, as recent rumors also stated that the iPhone 8, as well as the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, would come equipped with fewer accessories than the outgoing flagship devices. For one, speculations are high that the 2017 iPhones would not come with a 3.5mm headphone jack to lightning adaptor out of the box anymore, unlike the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus of 2016. Apart from this, a lightning to USB-C cable, which would be essential for plugging in the iPhone 8, 7, and 7 Plus to the 2016 MacBook and MacBook Pro, is also speculated to be sold separately. Unsurprisingly, these rumors have been met with much protest from iPhone fans, with many accusing Apple of cheaping out on its loyal customers. Regardless of the iPhone 8’s fewer accessories and its possible limitations resulting from the removal of its physical buttons, there is very little doubt that the 2017 flagship smartphone would be a dominant force in the mobile market this year. Judging by how well Apple has been hyping its device and how Apple fans are feverishly waiting for the arrival of the newest iteration of the iconic smartphone, the iPhone 8’s success is all but ensured.

But as prescient as the Oracle of Omaha has proved to be over the years, that doesn't mean you should run out and buy all of the stocks today. In some cases, the shares are much pricier now than when Buffett first purchased them. In other cases, the holdings are relatively small. "Any Berkshire investment worth less than $100 million, I ignore," says David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who studies Buffett and is a Berkshire shareholder. More often than not, Buffett doesn't comment on his investment moves, so it's not always possible to know his reasoning behind a big stock purchase or sale. But for buy-and-hold investors, Berkshire's stakes in blue-chip companies can be instructive nonetheless. Here's a closer look at the 11 Dow stocks owned by Warren Buffett. Data is as of February 13, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. Click on symbol links in each slide for current share prices and more. American Express Look no further than American Express to understand just how serious Warren Buffett is about investing for the long haul. He picked up his initial stake in the credit card company in 1991, when a struggling AmEx badly needed capital. Berkshire obliged, getting favorable terms on its investment. As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 16.6% of AmEx's outstanding shares, according to CNBC's Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Tracker . Buffett has played the role of white knight many times over the years, including during the 2008 financial crisis, as a means to get stakes in good companies at a discount. The stock today: AmEx shares change hands at 14 times expected earnings for 2017, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. That's in line with the stock's five-year average. Although the stock doesn't look particularly cheap, neither does it look expensive. Based on current estimates, the price/earnings ratio of the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is about 17. Analysts at William Blair Equity Research say the diversity of AmEx's business is underappreciated. The firm has a rating of "outperform" (buy, essentially) on the stock. SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks You Can Buy and Hold Forever Apple Buffett doesn't deserve all the credit for all of Berkshire's investments. In fact, the decision to buy Apple shares last year was made by one of Buffett's stock-picking lieutenants. Apple does have some of the attributes Buffett has said he likes: It's a leader in its market, and it has a ton of cash at its disposal. The stock was also trading at lower levels when Berkshire did its buying in 2016. The stock today: With shares reaching new highs, Apple is much more expensive now than it was when Berkshire first took a stake. But UBS analysts say the price gain is deserved because the number of iPhones in use continues to grow by double-digit percentages and retention rates remain high. UBS rates Apple stock a "buy," but picking up shares on dips over time might be preferable to going all in at today's record prices. SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Every Retiree Should Own Coca-Cola Buffett famously watched Coca-Cola for 52 years before investing in the stock. He finally took the plunge in 1988. "We expect to hold these securities for a long time," Buffett wrote back then of his new stake in Coke in a letter to Berkshire shareholders. "In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever." As of December 31, 2016, Berkshire owned 9.4% of Coca-Cola's outstanding shares. The stock today: Coca-Cola currently trades at 21 times expected earnings. That's a bit rich, given that analysts project average earnings growth of just 2% a year for the next five years, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts at Credit Suisse have a "neutral" rating on the stock (hold, essentially), saying they have concerns about an expansion of global regulations on sweetened products. If you already own the stock, find comfort in a plump dividend that has increased 54 years in a row. General Electric Berkshire's stake can be traced back to the lifeline that Buffett threw to General Electric in 2008. At the time, GE's finance arm was suffering the same as other big banks. "The GE investment resulted from Buffett's reputation and personal relationships, and Berkshire's very large cash position during the financial crisis," Kass says. But Buffett wouldn't have stepped in if he didn't believe in the company. "GE is the symbol of American business to the world," Buffett said at the time. "I am confident that GE will continue to be successful in the years to come." Berkshire received preferred shares and warrants in exchange for cash. The preferred shares paid handsome dividends until GE later bought them back, and the warrants gave Berkshire the right to buy GE common shares at below-market prices. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs is another holding Berkshire picked up during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares came with a dividend yield of 10%. Buffett said the investments in Goldman Sachs and General Electric - and similar deals with Dow Chemical, Swiss Re and Wrigley - delivered a total of $2.1 billion annually in dividends and interest. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in Goldman stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013. Goldman redeemed its preferred shares in 2011. The stock today: Credit Suisse analysts rate Goldman shares at "outperform," thanks in large part to the potential for lower corporate taxes and loosened financial regulations under the Trump administration. Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the stock, however, especially in light of its 35% share-price gain since Election Day. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, seven have Goldman at "strong buy," two rate it a "buy," eight rate it a "hold" and one has a "strong sell" recommendation on the shares. International Business Machines Longtime Berkshire watchers were surprised when the company revealed this stake in 2011 because Buffett had shown little interest in technology stocks. But after reading IBM's annual reports for more than 50 years without buying a single share, he was finally swayed by what he saw closer to home. "We went around to all of our companies to see how their IT departments functioned ... and I just came away with a different view of the position that IBM holds within IT departments and why they hold it and the stickiness and a whole bunch of things," Buffett said at the time. Berkshire owned 8.5% of IBM's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016. The stock today: UBS is "neutral" on IBM, but it says better times might be ahead now that a period of heavy investment back into the business is slowing down. Cost cuts will bolster the bottom line, and the company's Watson cognitive computing division is showing early promise. Buffett-like patience might be required, though, considering that the stock price has been stagnant for the past five years. IBM's solid dividend yield helps. SEE ALSO: 10 Best Dividend Stocks in the Dow Averages Johnson & Johnson During the 2008 financial crisis, Buffett reluctantly sold Johnson & Johnson shares to raise cash to invest in Goldman Sachs, GE and other struggling companies. By 2012, the reluctance had disappeared and Berkshire had essentially dumped its position in J&J, with Buffett saying the company was "messed up in a lot of ways" due to production problems and recalls. Despite the shift in sentiment, Kass says Berkshire's initial foray into J&J made sense because the stock was undervalued at the time. The stock today: The outlook for J&J is brighter these days than it was when Buffett abandoned ship, though the majority of analysts who follow the company are content to stand pat for now. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 10 rate it at "hold." Seven consider the stock a "buy" or "strong buy" and just one calls it a "sell." Income investors can rest easy. The dividend is as secure as it can be, having been raised every year for 54 straight years. Procter & Gamble Berkshire was a longtime shareholder in Gillette when Procter & Gamble acquired the razor blade company in 2005. Buffett called it a "dream deal," as Berkshire received P&G shares in exchange for its Gillette holdings. As with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett reluctantly sold some P&G shares in 2008 to raise cash to invest in distressed companies. Cut to 2014. Berkshire struck a deal to buy Duracell from P&G. To avoid a big tax bill, Berkshire arranged to hand over its P&G shares rather than pay cash for Duracell. The stock today: William Blair Equity Research rates P&G at "outperform," noting that its focus on major brands, such as Tide detergent, and cost cuts offer "a solid total shareholder return opportunity." Shares are not on sale, however, trading at 21 times year-ahead earnings. For comparison, the S&P 500 trades at 17 times future earnings. P&G's dividend is the definition of reliable; it dates back to 1891. Visa Credit cards are a Berkshire staple. The holding company also owns stakes in MasterCard and the aforementioned America Express. But Visa and MasterCard are growing faster than AmEx, says Kass, and both are investments of Todd Combs, one of Berkshire's chief investing strategists not named Warren. Payments processing is a rapidly expanding market, thanks to the emergence of mobile payments, such as Apple Pay. Global revenue from mobile payments is forecast to exceed $1 trillion by 2019, up from $450 billion in 2015, according to Statista, a data research firm. The stock today: "On the heels of solid December quarter results, we are raising our estimates and reiterate our Outperform rating on Visa," says Credit Suisse. "We believe shares are attractively valued at 21 times ... calendar 2018 earnings." And while the dividend yield is nothing to write home about, Visa shares have proved their long-term worth by outpacing rivals MasterCard and AmEx in price growth over the past two, five and 10 years. Verizon Verizon seems like an unlikely bet for Buffett in some ways. Its future is hitched to growth in digital mobile content and advertising, which makes it something of a bet on tech. That why it's probably not a Buffett call. "Verizon is likely an investment of Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have several telecom stocks in their portfolio," says Kass of Buffett's two chief stock-picking lieutenants. Either way, Berkshire all but abandoned its position at the end of last year, selling most of its 15 million shares. The stock today: The first thing that stands out with Verizon is the high dividend yield. Even better for income investors is the fact that the company has raised its payout every year since 2006. However, most analysts think the stock will underperform the S&P 500 this year. Of the 25 analysts surveyed by Zacks, 18 rate the shares at "hold," five have it at "buy" or "strong buy," and two rate it at "sell." William Blair Equity Research, which rates the company at "market perform" (hold, essentially), notes that intense competition is hurting financial results of late. Verizon, which bought AOL in 2015, is in the process of acquiring Yahoo, though it's far from a done deal after Yahoo disclosed serious security breaches that exposed user information to hackers. TAKE THE QUIZ: How Well Do You Really Know Warren Buffett? Walmart Stores Buffett sold off big chunks of Berkshire's Walmart stake last year. That's because the retailer is losing out to Amazon.com, Kass says. Buffett has made no secret of his admiration for Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos. "We haven't seen many businessmen like him," Buffett says of Bezos. "Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying and he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products, either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and that's remarkable." The stock today: Berkshire first bought Walmart in 2005, and it has been a disappointing investment. Shares in the world's largest retailer have gained 32% on a price basis since mid 2005. The S&P 500 is up 80% over the same time frame. Analysts at Stifel have a "hold" recommendation on Walmart shares . "We think a continued focus on grocery, including improved online and mobile ordering and increased offerings of more healthful products (i.e., organic), will continue to drive modest share gains," Stifel analysts say.

In an curious interview with Fastco Design, Landmark Entertainment Group founder Tony Christopher revealed Apple briefly considered going against traditional retail models with a series of futuristic cybercafe locations, infusing the common retail experience with the coziness of a boutique coffee shop. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Developed in collaboration with Mega Bytes, the Apple Cafe was imagined as an innovative internet cafe with a “high tech” interior design that reflected the forward-looking mindset the Big A aspired to stand for. Radically diverging from the facade of traditional retail stores, the modernist locale was slated to bring together food service, paraphernalia retail, user support and computer sales into one single common space. Credit: Landmark Entertainment Group “They didn’t know exactly what they wanted to do at first. I don’t know if they had the idea for a cafe or that was something we came up with,” Christopher told Fastco Design. “It was the world’s first cybercafe. There wasn’t a cybercafe at this time, and a lot of people who didn’t have computers were looking for a way to go use them. Back in 1998, this was a radical idea!” The idea for the Apple Cafe originally came in 1996, a short while before Steve Jobs eventually returned to the company and launched the signature Apple Store few years later. Credit: Landmark Entertainment Group While things ultimately never panned out, Christopher says Jobs opted to put the Cafe “on hold because he had this idea for an Apple Store.” “It’s interesting because this was not Apple as Apple is today. They were just a computer company. But they were interested in, again, making computers for everyone,” he added.

Credit: Susie Ochs More like this Chinese smartphone vendors show sales gains as Apple, Samsung decline Samsung's smartphone share hit by Note7 debacle, stiff competition Apple crosses Samsung in smartphone market, helped by Note7 debacle Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Apple has overtaken Samsung Electronics in smartphone sales for the first time in two years, but don't count on it staying ahead for long. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. The Gartner results are similar to the conclusions drawn by research firms IDC and Strategy Analytics. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

You can plug in an Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire TV stick, and your cable box, and then simply ask for content. The Caavo will figure out what device has that content, and then play it on your TV. There’s even an Alexa skill that lets you ask your Amazon Echo to control your Apple TV, which is fairly surprising given the balkanized state of TV services and devices. (Amazon and Apple don’t usually play nice when it comes to TV.) You can even switch back and forth between all of your various boxes’ native remotes and the Caavo remote without any hassle. It looks great. Here’s the fun demo from Code Media yesterday: But... how does it work? Sending a bunch of preprogrammed IR macros to various boxes is an ancient, inevitably doomed idea, and HDMI-CEC isn’t nearly universal or resilient enough to support search and discovery as powerful as Caavo’s demos. Caavo execs played it pretty coy yesterday, but late last night they exclusively confirmed to me that they’re doing something no one has ever tried before: they’re processing the video your TV streaming boxes send over HDMI, using machine vision to figure out what’s on-screen, and then determining what command to send next based on that information. Caavo has built an AI to control any device you might attach to a TV Essentially, Caavo has built an AI that simulates a human user to control any device you might attach to a TV, through whatever method the system can use, whether it’s IR, HDMI-CEC, or direct control over an API on your home network. They’re calling this system “visual analytics,” or VA, and it is quite possibly the thing that will crack the entire living room convergence game wide open. “We really wanted to keep it quiet because it’s a very volatile piece of the whole story,” Caavo CTO Ashish Aggarwal told me. “In some cases we have roundtrip confirmation via IP, so you send a command and it comes back, ‘yeah, I got it,’ and the box does what it does. But in other cases you have to have a closed-loop system where you have to know you selected the right profile and that you’re in the right app. Those kinds of things are by understanding what’s coming through on video, analyzing it, and doing some interesting things with it.” I’ve been writing about TV boxes forever, and the gap between sending a command to another device and knowing that it worked is what’s killed virtually every promising TV product for years. Most companies have tried to solve this problem by trying to make content deals or working with inconsistent control standards, and they’ve all hit the rocks and failed. The list is long: WebTV. Fanhattan. Boxee. Google TV. It’s a tech graveyard. Caavo’s CEO worked at Microsoft when the company tried to make Xbox TV happen And if they don’t outright fail out of the market, most TV devices offer an incomplete content lineup that means you’re stuck switching to another device when you can’t find what you want: There’s no Amazon app on the Apple TV, and you can’t watch anything you’ve bought on iTunes on your Nvidia Shield. It’s a mess. Perhaps the highest-profile failure of this method is the Xbox One, which launched with a very ambitious TV control system that relied on IR commands sent through the Kinect. Microsoft assumed at launch that a middling TV control system would get the company leverage to negotiate actual content deals that let the Xbox navigate and display content natively, but it never worked, and over the past two years the Xbox One has been intensely refocused on gaming over general entertainment. You know who worked at Microsoft when all that was happening? Caavo CEO Andrew Einaudi and now-deceased founder (and former Slingbox CEO) Blake Krikorian. But Caavo’s ability to understand what’s on your screen and truly, immediately control every possible device completely changes the dynamics of the industry. “Andrew and Blake worked on this feature forever,” says Aggarwal. “The last words I heard from Blake were, ‘Ashish, if you can make this happen, we’ll be everywhere.’ We worked our ass off to get this feature right, and we want it to be everywhere.” There are still some hacks involved in the Caavo system There are still some hacks involved in the Caavo system, and ways for other companies to potentially block the device. Caavo can’t control the Apple TV unless you install the Caavo app, for instance — but the way it works is wild: when it decides to control the Apple TV, it goes to the home screen, sends a bunch of scroll commands to the box, uses machine vision to locate the Caavo app icon, and then opens the app so it can pass a URL to the streaming app you actually want to use. “There is no way to launch an app using an API on the Apple TV,” says Aggarwal. “We need to know is where our app is, launch that app, and then hand the URL off to Netflix.” Just think about the automated intelligence it takes to do that — Caavo is scanning the entire interface of the Apple TV, watching what its control signals do on that interface, and making intelligent decisions about what signals to send next, all to send a Netflix URL to the Netflix app. It’s doing similar things on the Roku with a custom service and on other boxes with similar apps, but there’s no reason it can’t just click around like a standard human user if those apps and integrations get blocked. This thing is an end-run around the deal problem that’s killed so much TV innovation. an end-run around the deal problem that’s killed TV innovation Caavo CEO Andrew Einaudi says the demands on the system were intense. “It’s gotta work with my original remotes, and it’s gotta work with all these services,” he says. “Ashish has answered the call of duty.” The fact that Caavo is watching your screen means it can do all kinds of other stuff no other universal remote or TV box can do. You can ignore Caavo and launch your Roku like usual using the Roku remote, and then ask the Caavo Alexa skill to take over, and it’ll work. “If you launch content from any other system, we know what you’re doing,” says Aggarwal. “We can still control it.” Because it knows what’s on your screen. That’s brilliant, but there are a bunch of issues that come along for the ride: Vizio just got smacked by the FTC for detecting what was displayed on its TVs and collecting data without being transparent enough with customers. Apple can’t get Netflix in its new TV app because Netflix doesn’t want to hand over viewer data. This is not a simple ecosystem to launch new products in, especially when the core technology of your product is tracking what people are watching in the privacy of their own homes. This is not a simple ecosystem to launch new products in But Aggarwal is pretty confident about things — after all, the company isn’t launching until June, and their executive pedigrees mean they’ve taken meetings with all the big players. “It’s still very early — we just figured out how to do it,” he says. “We want to make sure that every single player is happy, and that we honor their value propositions to the consumer. We want to really encompass this whole space and bring all of these partners together.” It’s a tall order, and Caavo has a long way to go — and a lot of conversations to have with obstinate, protective players like cable companies who have been very slow to integrate with streaming services and devices. But if the company can pull it off and bring true smart control to the living room, Caavo will be the first company to solve the convergence problem in the modern era. We’ll find out in June.

Companies always try to deftly one-up each other. This year is no different. So as Apple preps the launch of its 10th anniversary iPhone, its competitors are also hard at work in doing the same. In fact, the Cupertino giant’s rivals will try to gain an advantage by releasing their flagship phones way ahead of the iPhone 8’s debut.  On Wednesday, DigiTimes rounded up the Android phone makers that will be releasing powerful flagship devices ahead of the iPhone 8’s arrival. The Chinese electronics newspaper even noted that such companies have planned to launch their new devices in the second quarter just to establish a good following prior the release of the iPhone 7 successor.  Among Apple’s competitors, Samsung Electronics is expected to make a big impact on the market with the introduction of its Galaxy S8 this March. The South Korea giant is even anticipating its first shipments to reach 10 million units. Despite suffering from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, Samsung is still expected to do well this year, especially now that the company already confirmed the rumored Galaxy S8 Plus by putting up a support page for the handset, according to Forbes.  Related Stories Apple Likely To Partner With Chinese Firm BOE For Future iPhones Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Apple CEO Tim Cook: Augmented Reality Can Be "A Core Technology" The iPhone 8 will also see a tough competitor in Huawei’s next flagship model, the Huawei P10. The P9 successor is making its debut at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month. As previously reported, the Chinese phone maker is preparing a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display, a Kirin 960 chip, 6GB RAM and Leica cameras.  Also arriving in the second quarter are the LG G6, Asus Zenfone 4 and Xiaomi Mi 6 and Redmi Note 4X flagship phones. If rumors are to be believed, the LG G5 successor will sport thin top and bottom bezels and an upgraded Quad DAC for exceptional sound quality. As for the Asus flagship device, a leaked benchmark already revealed that it is sporting a 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 display, a Snapdragon 820 chip and 6GB of RAM, as reported by BGR last week.  Meanwhile, Xiaomi’s upcoming phones, the Redmi Note 4X and the Mi 6, are reportedly debuting sans Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors. IBTimes Australia reported the handsets will come equipped with Xiaomi-owned company Pinecone Electronics’ Pinecone processors. Other than that, both flagship devices will come with premium specs and features.  Which Android flagship phone do you think will put up a good fight against Apple’s iPhone 8 this year?

Riding on the success of iPhone 7 and Apple Watch, the Cupertino-based company recently announced an all-time record revenue of USD 78.4 billion for the first quarter of 2017 that ended on December 31. International sales accounted for 64 percent of the quarter`s revenue. Overall, smartphone sales to end-users totalled nearly 1.5 billion units in 2016, an increase of five percent from 2015, said the report from the market research firm Gartner. "It has taken eight quarters for Apple to regain the top spot in global smartphone vendor ranking but the positions of the two leaders have never been so close, with only 256,000 units difference," said Anshul Gupta, Research Director, Gartner, in a statement. Samsung`s smartphone sales declined eight percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and its share dropped by 2.9 percentage points year-on-year. "The withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 left a gap in its large-screen phone range. Samsung also faced growing competition in the mid tier and entry-level smartphone segments from Huawei, Oppo, BBK and Gionee, which all grew their sales each quarter," added Gupta. Huawei, Oppo and BBK accounted for 21.3 percent of smartphones sold to end users worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.3 percentage points year on year. Offering high-performance, front-facing cameras and fast charging smartphones led Oppo to maintain the top position in China during the fourth quarter of 2016. In the smartphone operating system market, Google`s Android extended its lead by capturing 82 percent of the total market in the fourth quarter of 2016, the report noted.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Apple Signs $4.3 Billion Deal with Samsung for iPhone OLED Panels FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 2 days ago Samsung has finalized yet another deal with Apple to supply OLED panels for its upcoming iPhone. The deal, which involves the Samsung Display subsidiary of the Korean giant, is worth $4.3 billion, and will see the company provide 60 million panels to Cupertino. The deal will build upon the previous deal which was said to provide Apple with up to 100 million OLED panels. While the technology was said to be making its way only on the high-end model of the iPhone 8, the current volume indicates both models could be coming with the new hardware. The display size of the said panels is yet to be deciphered, but early rumors indicated they could come in three different options, with the high-end iPhone 8 model getting the OLED treatment. They also indicated an edge-to-edge display, which will be quite a big leap over the current, aging design philosophy. Fitting the final piece of the puzzle, the displays could also be curved, though, we are wishing too much at this point. Since these were all rumors, all of this should be taken with a grain of salt. Samsung, for its part, is clearly the world’s leader when it comes to OLED technology, making up about 95 percent of the panel’s production in the world, though, LG has been working on increasing its production to become a potent rival. While the number may sound a lot, it is still some way below the actual number of units sold in 2016 alone, that is around 200 million. Samsung is still the largest supplier of displays for the iPhone and that too by some distance.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Apple’s Latest Move Means the Next iPhone Could Come With Wireless Charging FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 2 days ago If ever a proof was needed that the next iPhone will have wireless-charging, then you have it now. As it stands, Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium, the foundation which sets the Qi charging standard used in most devices supporting wireless charging. It joins more than 200 other members of the industry which make devices supporting the technology, including Samsung, HTC, Huawei and Microsoft. Apple hasn’t given a particular reason behind joining the wireless standard, but it did say that it was “joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards”. Read More: Apple Roars Back with Record Breaking Quarter Apple has previously been vary of wireless chargers owing to their speed. However, in recent times the technology has evolved quite remarkably with charging speeds matching most normal wired chargers. This year alone, more than 350 million devices supporting the feature were shipped, clearly showing an increasing market acceptability. Apple has recently considered the possibility of long-distance wireless-charging, too, which sounds futuristic but is not too practical for most users, meaning the search for a mainstream standard is not too surprising. The iPhone 8, if it does come with wireless charging at all, won’t be the first Apple device to use this option; the Watch has had this option for long even though it doesn’t use the Qi charging standard. Now that Apple has joined the mainstream group it is a sign that it is about to expand the option to its other, more popular devices as well.

This could replace the Touch ID module in the upcoming iPhone 8.   ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement We have been inundated with leaks that show how the Samsung Galaxy S8 has eliminated the Home button to achieve wider screen real estate. Apple, however, could also be doing the same to the upcoming iPhone 8 if its fingerprint patent submitted to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office gets implemented this year. The patent, which was filed back in 2014, explains a technology that will enable a device's display to function as a fingerprint reader. It was first submitted by an LED display company called LuxVue, which Apple has acquired the same year the patent was filed. When the patent was published this Feb. 14, Apple is already the assigned patent holder. On-Screen Fingerprint Sensor Based on the attached patent documents, the on-screen fingerprint sensor relies on a micro LED system to sense light within an active matrix display. The sensing IR diode then detects fingerprints. It is not yet clear if the reported OLED screens that Apple purportedly ordered from Samsung accommodated this technology already. The innovation in this particular technology seems to rest on the capability to embed all fingerprint reading sensors on one device or component. Fingerprint modules in current devices rely on two separate components that need to be layered together to work. (Photo : USPTO) "The integration of sensing IR diodes into pixels within the display region may allow for thinner, less bulky display systems," the patent explained. "Further, the ability to sense IR light enables the display panel to perform interactive operations without the need to emit visible light. Accordingly, a user can interact with a display panel even though the display panel appears to be off." Apple vs. Samsung Fingerprint Technology Now, there are rumors that Samsung is merely relocating its fingerprint sensor at the back of the Galaxy S8. Based on leaked images showing accessories getting manufactured, the module appears to have been located beside the camera. Some sources are fretting over this particular bit of information, as such placement could prove quite inconvenient. There are, however, speculations that Samsung could implement an optical fingerprint sensor in the S8's chin. This is based on a Synaptics announcement that it will be mass-producing its FS9100 optical sensor in second quarter of this year. (Photo : Synaptics) One should note that the company is a Samsung partner, and the S8's launch itself has been significantly delayed. The link here is quite prominent. It will not take a high amount of imagination to conclude that the delay could be driven by a need to accommodate Synaptics' schedule. This technology could distinguish the S8's authentication solution from the Apple patent in the sense that it can be embedded under the cover of glass.

He almost immediately started cutting the Mac authorized retailer network, eliminating those stores he felt weren’t delivering the right kind of purchasing experience, and in 1999 began work on the Apple Store project. The first store opened two years later in 2001. But Apple came very close to launching a different kind of store back in 1997: Apple Cafes. These would not have been owned by Apple, but rather used the name and Apple computers under license. 512pixels ran a piece on them a couple of weeks ago, and that seemingly inspired Fast Company to interview the man behind the concept, ex-Disney Imagineer Tony Christopher. We were contacted by Apple because of all of our experience to that point. We were the go-to guys with creating something unique in the retail space. Steve Jobs—who we never met by the way—selected the team we were working with, because he was looking for a way to connect Apple to its customers . . . a way to have the customers sort of touch Apple. Quaint as it may seem now, the concept was the world’s first cybercafe. Apple computers would provide Internet access, but also be used to order food & drinks. It was a super secret project, because you know, at the time, the Apple Store hadn’t arrived yet. So buying a computer was done online or through computer stores. At the cafe, when you sat down at your booth, there was an Apple computer at the table. There were several programs you could call up. One was you could order your food. (There were food service people, but we wanted to make the order first.) You could play fundamental video games. Christopher says you’d also have been able to buy Apple computers there, so it would have been the forerunner to the Apple Store. There are a couple of different theories as to what killed the project. Christopher says that Steve was already working on the concept of retail stores, and wanted to do those instead. The book The Apple Revolution says that, actually, Apple wanted to go ahead but the third-party company which would have funded them pulled out. Whatever the truth, it’s certainly fun to think about how differently Apple Stores (or Cafes) might have evolved had the project gone ahead. Perhaps that moveable window on the balcony was the inspiration behind the sliding windows in San Francisco’s Union Square store?

The state of Nebraska is holding a hearing on the proposed legislation next month, and Motherboard reports that Apple will be formally opposing the bill. According to the source, an Apple representative, staffer, or lobbyist will testify against the bill at a hearing in Lincoln on March 9. AT&T will also argue against the bill, the source said. The source told me that at least one of the companies plans to say that consumers who repair their own phones could cause lithium batteries to catch fire …  It’s not known whether Apple is the company which will be arguing the safety point. Nebraska is reportedly one of eight states to consider granting product owners and third-party companies the right to repair products, following lobbying by Repair.org, a trade organization of independent repair shops. Apple has successfully lobbied against similar legislation in New York. Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, says that the safety argument is one that has been used by lobbyists in the past, and she plans to poke fun at the idea during the hearing. Last year, industry lobbyists told lawmakers in Minnesota that broken glass could cut the fingers of consumers who try to repair their screens, according to Gordon-Byrne. Byrne said she will also testify at the Nebraska hearing and “plans to bring band aids.”  Repair.org hopes that getting a single state to pass a right to repair bill will result in manufacturers giving in, citing the precedent of similar legislation in the car industry. In 2012, a Massachusetts law guaranteeing the right to repair automobiles became de-facto national legislation after car manufacturers decided to comply with the law nationwide rather than continue to fight burgeoning legislation in other states. Tekserve, the go-to third-party store for Apple product repairs in New York City, closed last year. It was also reported that Louis Rossmann who runs a YouTube channel full of Apple repair tutorials was being sued by Apple, but Rossman later said that there was just an issue with a particular schematic. The channel continues to be updated today.  There can be pitfalls for those conducting their own repairs. Last year it was discovered that replacing the Home button on an iPhone 6 can lead to the device being deliberately bricked. Apple stated that this is to prevent the security of a phone being compromised by someone swapping out the Touch ID sensor. Guides AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

But, speaking at a Goldman Sachs investor conference, Mr Maestri said the rule changes would give Apple "additional flexibility around our capital return activities". He dismissed the feasibility of building products such as the iPhone in America because of the lack of components. "Essentially, the supply chain for the tech industry is not in the US today," he said.  Workers at a Foxconn factory in China Credit: Reuters As most of its cash is held abroad, Apple currently uses debt to pay shareholders. To date it has paid $200bn in dividends and share buybacks. It said it would use the extra cash to pay more money to shareholders and speed up this process.  Mr Trump's tax reform proposals also include the controversial "border adjustment system", which would see all imports to the US subject to tax, with export revenues exempted. Apple criticised the proposals, against which European Union lawyers are preparing to mount a legal challenge.    "It is very hard for us to imagine that a border tax would be good for the US economy," Mr Maestri told the Financial Times. "It is a tax that would end up burdening the end consumer. It presupposes an idea that the dollar would have to appreciate very significantly from where it is today, which is already too strong."  The cost of an iPhone would rise if production were moved to the US Credit: Bloomberg To avoid losing out if the border adjustment plan goes ahead, Apple could manufacture more products in the US. But Mr Maestri gave no indication that this would happen, saying it is "very, very difficult to speculate at this point" on the policies.  "One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade," said Mr Maestri. "It's important to keep that in mind."  Apple did, however, mull the possibility of manufacturing in the US soon after Mr Trump was elected. The company reportedly asked its two manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron to assess the cost of US assembly. It is not clear if it has ruled the possibility out because of prohibitive expenses.  Inside the mysterious Chinese factory where your iPhones are made Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Donald Trump iPhone Apple Show more Technology latest 16 Feb 2017, 1:07am Google boss tells 7-year-old to 'follow her dreams' in response to job application 15 Feb 2017, 5:42pm Amazon drones could parachute packages to people's houses  15 Feb 2017, 5:42pm Amazon Prime revenues hit £5.2bn as online giant publishes details for the first time 15 Feb 2017, 4:25pm Verizon to buy Yahoo for $250m less as deal to go ahead despite data breaches 15 Feb 2017, 3:44pm Self-flying taxi to transport passengers in Dubai 15 Feb 2017, 12:39pm Nioh review - If there's any justice, this samurai marvel will go down as a classic 5 15 Feb 2017, 10:06am Facebook to autoplay sound on videos as users scroll past - how to stop it Gallery 15 Feb 2017, 9:53am Gallery: Retro tech making a comeback: in pictures 01:33 15 Feb 2017, 6:00am Jimmy Wales' career in 90 seconds 14 Feb 2017, 5:22pm Why your phone could prevent you from finding a date this Valentine's Day 00:45 14 Feb 2017, 4:47pm Nokia to bring back historic 3310  Gallery 14 Feb 2017, 3:54pm Gallery: Weird and niche dating apps for the passionate and picky 14 Feb 2017, 2:04pm Tested: The best dating apps for Valentine's Day 14 Feb 2017, 12:13pm iPhone 8 to come with wireless charging, Apple move hints Gallery 14 Feb 2017, 10:50am Gallery: The top 20 Valentine's Day songs on Spotify 14 Feb 2017, 10:42am Senators urge investigation into Donald Trump's reported use of personal 'insecure' Android phone Gallery 14 Feb 2017, 9:29am Gallery: Gaming's 17 greatest love stories 14 Feb 2017, 8:33am PewDiePie: Disney drops YouTube millionaire over anti-Semitic video controversy 14 Feb 2017, 12:01am Lack of cyber skills leaves Britain open to hackers 01:17 13 Feb 2017, 1:43pm China launches 1,000 illuminated drones into night sky in record-breaking display 13 Feb 2017, 10:00am IBM to use Jeopardy! winning machine Watson to fight cyber attacks  If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 Your support makes a big difference In order to bring you award-winning content and investigative journalism from your favourite writers, we rely on revenue generated by advertising.

Twitter Facebook Apple smartphones outsold Samsung's in Q4 Apple outsold Samsung by the narrowest of margins in Q4, but both are pursued by a pack of determined Chinese manufacturers Peter Sayer (IDG News Service) 16 February, 2017 10:36 - - - - print email Comments Apple has overtaken Samsung Electronics in smartphone sales for the first time in two years -- but don't count on it staying ahead for long. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from Gartner. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, though, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market, and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Veniamin Geskin The iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s might have very different designs Chris Smith @chris_writes February 14th, 2017 at 12:26 PM Share Tweet Reports from last week said that all of Apple’s three upcoming iPhones will support wireless charging out of the box, even if that means you’ll have to buy additional hardware to actually use the new feature. That suggested the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus will all feature a glass sandwich design to accommodate wireless charging. But a new report out of China now seems to indicate that the phones won’t share the same design at all, which could mean iPhone 7s and 7s Plus buyers won’t get one of Apple’s most hotly anticipated new features. Don't Miss: Mesh is the hottest trend in home Wi-Fi, so we tested every top system to find the best According to Digitimes’ sources, only the 5.8-inch 2017 iPhone will feature a glass and stainless steel design, while the 4.7-inch iPhone will have an aluminum housing just like this year’s iPhones. The 5.8-inch iPhone is believed to be the iPhone 8, which is expected to feature a steel frame that will hold the internal components, covered by glass front and rear panels. Apple used similar designs in the past for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. The 4.7-inch iPhone would be Apple’s iPhone 7s, likely the successor of the iPhone 7. The report says the design for the 5.5-inch model’s chassis is yet to be confirmed. It’s likely that the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will share the same design, just as every other pair of new iPhones Apple has launched since 2014. Digitimes says that Foxconn and Jabil Circuit will provide stainless steel frames for the iPhone 8, while Catcher will make the aluminum cases for the iPhone 7s. Additionally, Pegatron Technology Casetek is also “aggressively” looking to obtain orders from Apple. Catcher did not comment on the story but did say that its revenues will see significant year-on-year growth thanks to mobile device customers and an increase in adoption of metal chassis for notebooks.

But where once it was just the odd whisper, a selection of blocky images or a slip of the tongue from an over-eager employee, now we’re in a world where the level of secrecy on new phone has slackened to the point where even the iPhone will be accidentally shown off by Apple ahead of its launch.  The iron grip of secrecy surrounding a phone’s launch is undoubtedly slipping, with anyone interested in finding out what a brand is up to needing only to spend a few moments Googling to know pretty much everything that’s about to happen.  The subject of leaks inspires fierce debate among tech fans. Does it ruin the surprise? Or is the search for morsels of information and the disseminating of salacious gossip the most exciting part of the launch – a thrilling chase that's more satisfying than the expensive catch at the end? Building the hype Certain patterns of behavior are apparent in the leaks – or lack of leaks – from different manufacturers. Apple’s development of its iPhones has traditionally been cloaked in the most secrecy, while many of the Asian brands have traditionally been far more regular with the outpouring of information, raising questions as to whether the manufacturers themselves are doing the leaking in order to drum up interest in their new handsets. LG's behaviour has always been the most curious though. Where others let slip information quietly, LG will proudly announce key features of its new G Series flagship phones ahead of time, with the tech press in no doubt as to what they’ll be seeing come launch time. The LG G5 leaked in December 2015, three months before the reveal at MWC 2016. We recently reported on the forthcoming LG G6 launch in Barcelona later this month, and in that piece we questioned why LG would give away so much information with such regularity. Surely it ruined the surprise? To our surprise this struck a chord with a source within LG, who consented to an interview with TechRadar over its pre-release strategy under the condition of anonymity, in which they finally explained why the company's new handsets are splashed all over the internet ahead of their glitzy press conference unveiling. TR: How long before launch was the LG G6 conceived? LG: Generally we start developing a new smartphone a year and a half before launch. So for about six months you have two teams working on different products simultaneously, one as it's finishing and the other as it's starting.  TR. We often see early prototypes of new phones leaking months ahead of launch, with features that don’t make it to the final model. How many prototypes typically are made of a flagship phone? LG: There is no set number – it depends on the particular device, and how close to expectations they come at the early stage.  TR: At what point during the LG G6's conception and creation did you expect to see it start appearing on the internet?  LG: Generally, consumer and media interest in a phone starts about three months before the expected announcement date. Interest in the upcoming G phone has been particularly high, probably because there was so much speculation in the beginning as to whether it would be modular or not.  Surprisingly, we've seen more coverage of imaginary images of the new G-series phone than we saw with the G5, which was unexpected because we thought the early speculation that the G5 would be modular was what was driving the buzz. I guess we were wrong. TR: Where do leaks typically come from? Are they seen as a positive or negative thing within LG? LG: While we would prefer to be able to control the flow of information, it gets tougher and tougher with each new phone. I mean, if a candidate for the American Presidency can't stop her emails from leaking, what chance do we have?  Joking aside, this is a whole different world than 2010, when a prototype phone from [Apple headquarters] Cupertino ended up in the wrong hands. "It gets tougher and tougher with each new phone" You simply can't undo something that gets released online, it's out there forever, and there are so many touch points these days, from suppliers to retailers to case makers who have access to devices before they're official.  So we like to think that information that gets out before its time just proves how much interest there is in the product. And with the new G phone, there's been plenty of interest, which we're happy about. TR: We saw the early pictures of the LG G6 in January; is that earlier than you'd like for the phone to be shown off? At what point are you okay with elements being seen? LG: We’re less likely these days to spend too much time, energy and resources trying to find the source of a particular leak. Hey, it's out there so you can't turn back the clock. We try to make the best of it... lemons into lemonade, as they say. Credit: The Verge TR: Do you get wind of a source having a leak before it goes live, and if so what can be done about it? LG: We see the details and images online, like everyone else. On some occasions we'll see details pop up first on some Russian or Chinese site that the English [speaking] media hasn't caught wind of yet. That gives us a little bit of time to prepare ourselves for the inevitable questions as to whether that story is accurate. Of course, we don't confirm or deny anything. TR: LG’s internal divisions – LG Display in particular – often announces they're going to be bringing their latest product to the next iteration of the G series. What’s the benefit to LG of different divisions confirming they'll be supplying for the next flagship phone? LG: Well, you have to remember that our suppliers aren't only supplying to us. By announcing a component in an upcoming smartphone these partners are generating interest in other smartphone manufacturers who are planning their next products. If you have a big customer, you want smaller customers to know that. TR: Why does LG release the name of its flagship phones ahead of launch?  LG: In the past we didn't. But we thought that with the G6 it was already such a well-known assumption that we didn't see much of a benefit in playing coy until February 26. After all, what were we going to call it – G7? TR: What’s the benefit of having a press conference at an expensive event like Mobile World Congress when you could just spend more time leaking / previewing the phone on the internet? LG: Press events give companies a chance to set the record straight, to control the message one hundred percent. Even today, no one actually knows for sure which story is accurate and which isn't. And this is why it's more important than ever that we have official announcements, so we can help separate rumors from fact. Think about this fact: even though there are more and more leaks every year, more and more people turn up at our press events at MWC. That tells us that journalists still want to hear the truth from an official representative, and actually touch and feel the product, something that one can't do with a story or photograph. TR: In our experience, every other big phone brand is petrified of leaks, and works to ensure that as few details as possible emerge before the big announcement, so why does LG take an alternative view? Does being so open bring any tangible benefit? LG: Petrified is a strong word. We don't like not being in control of the communication process, but that's life in the digital age. We're realistic.  And at the end of the day, if someone doesn't think he or she needs to attend an unveiling event because all the information is already out there, I say fine, let's save that seat for someone who wants the real hands-on experience. We can live with that.

Shares Apple could be preparing to phase out the iPhone’s home button if its recent patent for a fingerprint reading touchscreen is any indication of the company’s future plans.  First spotted by AppleInsider, the patent describes an “interactive display panel with IR diodes” that would use a combination of infrared emitting LED and infrared sensing technology. This would allow Apple to place a fingerprint reader directly into the phone’s screen rather than the currently used home button. The patent was originally filed in 2014 by micro-LED display company LuxVue, but it was reassigned to Apple after it acquired the company. This isn’t, however, the first time we’ve seen Apple look into fingerprint reading touchscreen technology.  A new home Only last year Apple filed another patent that suggested the company was looking at moving Touch ID away from the home button and into the phone screen.  This more recently revealed design is slightly different from as it doesn’t require the layering of two separate transducers, instead relying on micro-LED technology which should allow for more accurate sensing and reading of fingerprints. By integrating the home button and its fingerprint scanner into the phone’s screen, Apple would open up a good deal of extra space at the bottom of the phone, allowing for an extended edge-to-edge display and even more streamlined aesthetic.  Rumors that Apple could be considering dropping the home button to move onto more advanced technology than Touch ID have been circulating for a while now and this micro-LED technology would certainly allow for that.  Whether or not Apple will actually use it in its next phone, or at all, is unclear. It would, however, enable the big hardware change people are anticipating for the iPhone 8 as the company celebrates ten years since the original iPhone’s release.

Patent Shows Display Embedded Fingerprint Scanner, Indicating Edge-To-Edge OLED By Rishabh Jain On 02/15/17 AT 7:14 AM Close iPhone 8 rumors have been doing the rounds for some time now, but no feature is confirmed unless Apple gives a formal indication of its existence. One such feature which might be part of the upcoming device is a display-embedded fingerprint sensor, for which Apple filed a patent Monday. The filing confirms Apple is actually working on the feature, and it also mentions a screen with infrared light emitters and sensors interwoven with regular RGB diodes. It sounds simple, yet the feature actually confirms multiple iPhone 8 rumors in one go. A display embedded fingerprint sensor would actually make the Apple home button with TouchID sensor redundant, so it is safe to conclude that Apple has actually taken steps towards getting rid of its proprietary home button, which has been there on every iPhone since the first iteration. Building on that, no home button would mean that there would be no use for the thick bottom bezel of the phone, which is an indication that Apple might be going in for a larger display rather than leave the space on the body of the phone vacant and unused. The only kind of display, which would make the best use of the available screen space, is an edge-to-edge display. Related Stories iPhone 8 Rumors: Device To Feature Glass Casing and Stainless Steel, iPhone 7S Keeps Aluminum Apple CEO Tim Cook: Augmented Reality Can Be "A Core Technology" Therefore, the presence of the patent has confirmed major features for the upcoming iPhone. Apple acquired LuxVue — a tech company specializing in micro-LEDs, which are needed to manufacture edge-to-edge OLED displays — in 2014. LuxVue also owns patents such as one for manufacturing thin flexible displays. Putting everything together, it seems that the standout feature of the 2017 iPhone might be its display. Edge-to-edge displays seem to be the ideal choice for premium smartphones with Samsung also rumored to opt for one for its Galaxy S8 smartphone.

From a young age, we listen attentively to stories – from tales in books to chronicles from the older generations. When we get older this fascination for fables doesn’t fade – whether it’s reading a gripping novel; watching the latest series or blockbuster movie; or being captivated by a person’s true life story. There’s a number of successes that bear testament to the power of storytelling in branding too. Locally, we’ve seen incredible success from the likes of Sally Williams Nougat who literally built the brand from the ground up through powerful storytelling.  In a commoditised confectionary category, Sally Williams set herself apart by captivating people with her tale of how she developed the world’s finest honey nougat. On packs and in interviews, she details how she embarked on a quest – from the souks of Marrakesh to the finest French bistros – in search of the perfect confectionary. It’s mysterious and intriguing, with an added rags to riches backstory of how she spent countless hours perfecting the recipe in her humble home garage. This has helped the brand go from strength to strength, locally and internationally – with the story also allowing her to extend into adjacent confectionary categories. In a very technical ‘audio’ category, Beats also utilised the power of storytelling to disrupt the headphone category and build a strong brand in a very short timeframe. The brand established a strong runway for growth by marketing the story of its founder, Dr Dre, who wanted to inject the energy and excitement of the recording studio into the Beats headset listening experience. It is a new, interesting story within a very ‘same-same scientific’ focused industry. There are a multitude of brand storytelling success stories across industries – some even brought to life through movies such as The Social Network (Facebook). It’s these stories that help brands to thrive, enhances the ability to charge a premium; and creates brand loyalists. Think about Apple: the exciting tale of Steve Jobs and Wozniak, trying to disrupt the world of computing with beautiful technology. Apple’s disruptive, ‘outside-in’ approach to computing story is certainly a lot more exciting than a ‘generic’ brand such as Acer (what’s their story?). As a result, Apple has attracted a set of brand evangelists who camp out year-after-year at their stores to get the latest and greatest Apple-branded product. I don’t ever recall hearing about anyone who have camped out to buy an Acer product…yet, it performs the same functionality as an Apple computer! So how can brands tap into the power of storytelling to enhance brand equity? Consider some of the following principles: Showcase your founders People connect with people; and many of the examples highlighted above, demonstrate how brands can use their founders or a persona to tell a successful brand story. And there’s heaps more: Richard Branson (Virgin), Sam Walton (Walmart), John Morgan (JP Morgan) and even Mrs Balls with her famous chutney, are the obvious ‘big’ ones that spring to mind.  But there are lots of small start-ups who are applying this principle too. For example, local start-up Tax Tim, has a cute story about its two founders: Evan always struggled with submitting his tax returns and explains how he always had to turn to his accountant friend, Marc to demystify the complexity.  It may require you to unearth that interesting tidbit about the person or team who had the ambition to launch something new. But think: if a bunch of accountants have a great story to tell, why can’t your brand founders do so too? Tax Tim founders Marc and Evan explain how Evan spent endless hours struggling with his tax submissions, and how he used to turn to his Marc to help him. Evan thought, “What if I could put Marc’s brain in a machine, then put it online, so that everyone could have their very own affordable tax man to help them?”  The two created Tax Tim, an award-winning interactive online user interface with backing from a number of institutions. Shout about your purpose Successful brands and businesses have a higher raison d’etre, which goes beyond solely focusing on making a profit. This ‘purpose’ could be based on realising non-financial ambitions such as solving a problem, helping people, or fulfilling an unmet need. The financial reward simply follows naturally. For example, eyewear brand Warby Parker has grown from strength to strength because of its associated purposeful story and innovative business model. The business is centred on the story of the founder who lost his glasses on a backpacking trip and as a student and couldn’t afford to replace them. After looking at the industry and realising that it was dominated by expensive retailers that were artificially inflating prices, he created Warby Parker. Warby Parker offers a retail alternative with good-looking eyewear through online and simple retail channels, without the expensive price tag and complexity. The brand’s purpose is to be all-inclusive and therefore for every pair of glasses sold, a pair distributed to someone in need. What’s not to love about the story; and in turn the brand? Understand that people love a disruptive challenger People are hardwired to support the underdog – whether it’s David defeating Goliath or a legal clerk with no experience or education taking on a behemoth Gas and Electrical company in Erin Brokovich– we love it when the challenger wins. Likewise, disruptive challenger brands should flaunt their stories. Locally, we’ve seen how Capitec has done this with great success. They clearly point out that they’re much simpler, more affordable and more transparent versus the big four banks. Staying true to the story of simplicity at every touch point has made Capitec a credible competitor in consumers’ eyes, and the company has reaped the rewards. Always be authentic As is the case with any tale, people want to hear the truth – and are sceptical when they don’t. Authenticity in one’s brand story is therefore key to unlock brand growth. Sometimes brands yearn so much for a story, that it results in a made-up tale which people question. Some time back, after a misleading promotion of ‘part of a healthy breakfast’ and an emphasis on a healthy living story, Nutella was forced to re-look its communication strategy. Yes, the brand could claim to be delicious, but healthy was a step too far in the consumer’s minds. Instead, the brand should have focused on other areas to build its brand story – the delicious ingredients; the childhood fun; its passionate employees; or even the role it plays in people’s breakfasts around the world. In conclusion, in a world where there’s so much choice, complexity and clutter, the importance of storytelling in branding cannot be overstated. Not only does storytelling bring life and emotion into our brands, it’s an incredibly powerful tool. When executed well, it can differentiate brands from competitors and connect brands with their customers to create all-important and profitable, brand loyalists. With this in mind, it’s time for marketers to interrogate their brands to find that golden nugget – a powerful brand story that truly engages and captivates.

Credit: Susie Ochs More like this Chinese smartphone vendors show sales gains as Apple, Samsung decline Samsung's smartphone share hit by Note7 debacle, stiff competition Apple crosses Samsung in smartphone market, helped by Note7 debacle Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price Apple has overtaken Samsung Electronics in smartphone sales for the first time in two years, but don't count on it staying ahead for long. Samsung sold 76.8 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, giving it a market share of 17.8 percent, but it was just beaten by Apple, which sold 77 million iPhones for a 17.9 percent share, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. The Gartner results are similar to the conclusions drawn by research firms IDC and Strategy Analytics. The fourth quarter is usually a strong one for Apple, boosted by holiday sales of the new generation of iPhones it releases each September, said Anshul Gupta, a research director at Gartner. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] For Samsung, though, 2016 ended particularly badly, dominated by the fiasco around the recall of its incendiary Galaxy Note7. Super-phones like the Note7 could have accounted for 10 to 15 percent of Samsung's smartphone sales in the period before its recall, said Gupta, but Samsung lost more than that: There was also the damage to its brand. It could bounce back sooner rather than later, though, as it has a new flagship phone coming out at the end of March. Apple, meanwhile, is expected to wait until September before unveiling new iPhones. This year will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary, and the next model is widely expected to be something special, so Apple fans may delay replacing phones until then, said Gupta. That would leave the way clear for Samsung to move back into the lead from this quarter. That pattern showed up last year too: Although it dominated the fourth quarter, Apple was a distant second over the full year, with market share of just 14.4 percent over the year, far behind Samsung's 20.5 percent, and the situation was similar the previous year. While the giants slug it out, a more interesting battle is going on just beneath them, as the next three companies in the fourth-quarter smartphone rankings are all Chinese. Huawei Technologies is in third place with a worldwide smartphone market share of 9.5 percent, with fourth and fifth taken by Oppo (6.2 percent) and BBK Communication Equipment (5.6 percent), two companies that many consider to be part of the same conglomerate. Gartner treats them separately because, whatever their shareholding structure, they operate independently, each with their own product team, Gupta said. BBK, almost unknown in the West, is now the number one smartphone brand in China, he said. A year ago, that honor went to Oppo, and the year before that, Huawei. Previous years saw the Chinese market topped by Xiaomi and Samsung. These Chinese companies have pushed Apple and Samsung aside in their home market and are expanding across South Asia. "Even in their current expansion, Oppo is not focusing just on emerging markets, but also on developed markets like Australia," said Gupta, so we may soon see them climbing up the rankings in Europe and the U.S too. The key ingredients for that are already in their products, he said. "Oppo and BBK make great phones in terms of feature set. They have integrated high-end features like dual cameras and fast charge." To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus, during a special event on 7 September last year. But we're already looking ahead to the next iPhone in 2017. In this article we sift through the clues and evidence pointing to Apple's iPhone 7s launch later this year, and predict the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, design and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information emerges, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone 7s rumours.

(Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Mind you, it's possible that Apple might bring the iPhone 8 forward... as we discuss later in this article. iPhone 7s production 'to start earlier than expected' According to analysts at BlueFin Research Partners, quoted by Barron's Tech Trader Daily, Apple is likely to start production of the late-2017 iPhone models earlier than is customary. "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next-generation iPhones earlier than historical norms," write John Donovan and Steve Mullane. "Interestingly, our present reads suggest a 300 percent increase in iPhone 8/X builds in the June quarter, now sitting at 9M. As a result, overall June quarter builds have increased from 45M to 48M, with the sharp increase in iPhone 8 offset somewhat by modest declines in legacy models. In the past, builds of upcoming releases began in earnest early in the September quarter, so this is a departure from AAPL’s normal build cadence." The researchers play down any suggestions that this indicates an earlier launch date, however, so we are left to wonder why the company feels it needs longer to produce the iPhones. Are they going to be technically more demanding to manufacture, or is it a question of volume? iPhone 7s release date rumours: Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump did not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. More of this sort of vague thing has emerged since then. Trump stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means.  To be frank, these statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was originally going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) It was understood, rather boringly, that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the company has since stated that it will merely be receiving, configuring and distributing servers from this hub rather than building any products. Any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the iPhone, will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Name Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". iPhone X Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at the research firm Cowen and Company, has sent out a client note predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - the letter X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. It's rather leftfield, and we'll count it as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, but it's actually not the worst idea in the world: those relentlessly rising model numbers draw attention to quite how long Apple has been churning out iPhones, and make each one seem like merely the latest update in a long line of identikit devices. This would be a statement of intent, a declaration that this one is different. We'll talk a bit about Timothy Arcuri's other predictions later in this article. Macworld poll: What will Apple call the next iPhone? iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Design What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. iPhone 7s design: Edge-to-edge screen, with no Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s. Technology that could help with this development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple is plotting the use of an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, refers to "Electronic devices having displays with openings", and appears to cover various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them, thanks to small (and in most cases tiny) holes in the screen. This in turn means Apple can expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it doesn't need to leave space around the edge for the various apertures and controls we've grown used to. The holes could be filled in with a material that doesn't block radio signals, for instance, although in many cases they will be so small that the user wouldn't notice them. No physical buttons at all A February 2017 report by Fast Company, which made headlines primarily for its prediction that an iPhone could top the thousand-dollar mark for the first time, also raised the possibility that the late-2017 iPhone might not have any physical buttons at all. "Apple has been working to remove the physical Home button from the iPhone," says the site, basing its comments on a source with knowledge of Apple’s plans. "It would become a button to touch, not press. There's even a chance that the physical buttons on the sides of the iPhone may go away, our source says, replaced by touch-sensitive inlays in the metal." Read Fast Company's full report for more juicy details - there's lots of good stuff. iPhone 7s design: Larger screen Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, who we quoted earlier, has also made some predictions about the screen to be included in what he predicted will be called the 'iPhone X'. There will be three models, Arcuri says: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones, to match the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a new 5.8-inch iPhone - the biggest ever iPhone screen. This latter, clearly flagship model, will have an OLED screen and a "wraparound" design with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated under the glass, with no separate Home button. Incidentally, The Investor reports that Samsung will be making LED panels for the late-2017 iPhone. A new deal struck between Apple and subsidiary company Samsung Display is worth 5 trillion won, or about £3.5m, and involves the supply of 60 million units. (Apple will need more than that - the company sold 78.29 million iPhones in Q1 2017 - and usually makes deals with multiple screen suppliers.) iPhone 7s design: Curved/flexible screen There have been consistent rumours, stretching back years, that Apple is going to make an iPhone with a curved or flexible screen - although flexible might be a misleading word to use here. Very few people imagine that an iPhone in the near future will actually be able to 'flex' in any meaningful way (being folded in half to fit in a pocket, for example); most pundits just mean that it will have curved edges so that the screen continues a little way down the sides, like the Samsung S7 Edge. Some relatively firm evidence was added to this theory in January 2017, when the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, confirmed [paywall article] that it is ready to start building flexible displays. (Again, this is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the company didn't mention Apple by name, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and analysts are understandably putting two and two together. iPhone 7s design: Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 - that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." iPhone 7s design: Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. iPhone 7s design: Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. (A slight complication here is that Apple has historically made red products as part of the Product Red HIV/AIDS charity, rather than as a cosmetic preference. Macotakara doesn't comment on whether this will be tied in with that charity.) Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: New features Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. iPhone 7s new features: New 3D Touch AppleInsider is predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will feature second-gen 3D Touch with greater sensitivity and greater gesture versatility than the current version, thanks to changes in the underlying design. According to a research note from the respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by the site, the next iPhone will have 3D Touch based around thin film instead of flexible printed circuit boards. While this would improve the way the technology works, it would create design headaches; for one thing, thin film sensors don't incorporate the metal conductive plate that protects the current screen from deformation, so Apple would have to add a passive metal backplate or risk a repeat of the Bendgate scenario. The development would also add to manufacturing costs, and with UK prices already up to account for the weakness of the pound, Apple hasn't got much room for manoeuvre if it wants to protect its profit margin. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts iPhone 7s new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component.  iPhone 7s new features: Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand."

Here are the prices of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which are already higher than the previous generation were at launch after Apple's wide UK price increases. It's likely that the iPhone 7s will be priced at a similar point. iPhone 7 (32GB): £599 iPhone 7 (128GB): £699 iPhone 7 (256GB): £799 iPhone 7 Plus (32GB): £719 iPhone 7 Plus (128GB): £819 iPhone 7 Plus (256GB): £919 But it's felt that there will be another price jump, even if only a small one. One theory holds that the next iPhone will break the thousand-dollar barrier in the US for the first time (this is according to Fast Company, citing a source "with knowledge of Apple's plans"). A thousand-dollar US price tag would most likely translate to a UK price of £940 or so, although obviously that would be the top-end model. For comparison, in the US the 128GB cellular-equipped edition of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,029; in the UK this model costs £939. The iPhone 7 Plus with 256GB of storage costs £919, or $969 in the US. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Leaked photos and concept illustrations It's a little early to expect leaked photos from Apple's supply chain - we'd imagine the iPhone 7s is still in the design stages - we have seen our first concept illustrations. These are imaginative images created by talented artists and design illustrators with ideas about what they'd like to see in the next generation of Apple's smartphone. Thadeu Brandao has come up with some lovely, minimalist concepts for the iPhone 7s: Brandao described his thought process as "mixing the design of iPhone 4 and 7", and you'll note the lack of a headphone port once again, and the Home button integrated into the screen. Brandao also worked on the following concept video posted by the YouTube channel ConceptsiPhone: On the next page: Everything you need to know about 2016's iPhone 7 launch >> >> Read on… Pages 1 2 3 Tags: iPhone , Rumour , iPhone 6 , iOS 9 , iPhone 6s , iPhone 7 Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Mobile 5 0 0 February 12, 2017 Will iPhone 8 Launch Be Bigger Than The Samsung Galaxy S8 Launch? Daryl Deino The 2017 iPhone 8 launch is going to be huge. BGR has the news. “By all accounts, this year’s iPhone launch will be a big deal. Unlike the last few years, which have seen mostly-incremental improvements, Apple is expected to blow the doors off with the 10th anniversary iPhone.” The article adds that a research firm suggests Apple will ramp up production in June, which is two months earlier than it usually does. The iPhone 8 could be the biggest iPhone launch in history. It’s obvious Apple is planning on big things since it will be the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone release. Apple will hugely improve the screen that’s on the current iPhone 7. [Image by Daryl Deino] According to 9to5Mac, we may also see 4.7-inch to 5.8-inch curved OLED displays, an all-glass design with new colors, an embedded (into the screen) home button, and something that has to do with augmented reality. It has been reported that Apple has been working with Carl Zeiss on augmented reality glasses that may be used in conjunction with the iPhone. One of the biggest features of the new iPhone 8 could be inductive wireless charging. “Over the course of the last year, there has been ongoing speculation that wireless charging company Energous has inked a deal with Apple and could potentially provide wireless charging technology for the upcoming iPhone 8,” says Mac Rumors columnist Juli Clover, who adds that a new investor’s note from Copperfield Research outlines why Apple has no plans to use Energous’ WattUp radio frequency-based wireless charging solution. According to CNN, Apple shares are soaring from the new iPhone hype. “Shares of the iPhone maker surged 6 percent on Wednesday to their highest level since July 2015. Apple (AAPL, Tech30) is now up an impressive 11 percent so far this year, blowing past the rest of the stock market.” The article adds that not only did Apple post its first sales increase in a year, but Tim Cook also sent positive signals about demand heading into the release of the iPhone 8, which has excited investors, due later this year. Apple will launch its new iPhone about five months after Samsung launches its long-awaited Galaxy S8. All versions of the new smartphone will be unveiled next month and released in April. According to the Sunday Express, the S8 will be missing physical buttons. “And if the alleged paparazzi shot is to be believed, something very important appears to be missing from the next flagship Samsung phone. The latest photo shows the long-rumoured, dual-curved display on the front of the device. And as predicted by the latest rumours from within Samsung, the physical buttons have been ditched.” Samsung is set to ditch the physical buttons that are on the current S7 Edge. [Image by Daryl Deino] The article adds that most sources had pointed to Samsung using on-screen navigation buttons instead of the physical controls used on previous Galaxy S devices. New pictures of the alleged Galaxy S8 have leaked online. Samsung Galaxy S8 pricing, availability leaked: Here's all we know so far – The Indian Express https://t.co/NFCzsd6qrn #Samsung #GalaxyS8 pic.twitter.com/YvXqrCXLt0 — Samsung Galaxy S8 (@GalaxyS8News) February 5, 2017 According to Tech Radar, likely highlights include a 4K screen (on the higher-end version), a Snapdragon 830 processor, 6GB of RAM and a massively improved camera. There’s even a chance that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have an iris scanner or a foldable screen, though the latter is somewhat less likely. There will likely be one version of the Galaxy S8 that has a 6.1-inch screen and another that has a 5.7-inch screen. Some sources point to a third version as well.

The device, which is expected to launch in September this year, has been the subject of considerable speculation as Samsung continues to pull further ahead of Apple in terms of global market share: Samsung now holds almost twice as much as Apple. Coupled with a lackluster launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September 2016, and a poor reception for the devices which suffered numerous issues and featured outdated technology, many are concerned that Apple can no longer live up to its own hype. The iPhone 7 also suffered widespread criticism for its lack of a traditional headphone jack. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] If the rumors are true, and many have been more-or-less confirmed, Apple intends to put themselves back on the map with the iPhone 8 (or, possibly, the iPhone X, say some rumors.) The consensus is that the device will represent a considerable leap forward for the iPhone. Here’s what we know, and what we think that we know, thus far. Performance One of the longest-standing rumors is that the iPhone 8 will feature Apple’s new A11 processor, which, according to The Motley Fool, is likely to be marketed as the A11 Fusion. Allegedly, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) had already begun taping out the processor in the middle of last year, but it wasn’t featured in any of the iPhone 7 models, making it a near-certainty that it will be in the iPhone 8. The A11 uses a 10nm FinFET process and will, according to TSMC, represent a 20 percent boost in performance and a 40 percent reduction in battery usage over current Apple devices. The iPhone 7 features an 8-core processor and a 6-core GPU. While nothing is known about the iPhone 8 GPU, it will likely be similar, if not the same. RAM is a bit of an oddity in Apple devices; while nothing is known about the iPhone 8’s RAM capacity, the iPhone 7 featured 2 GB, and the Plus featured 3 GB, which was well below industry standards for flagship devices: the Samsung Galaxy s7 featured a cool 4 GB on both the regular and Edge models. Hopefully, Apple will be bringing the iPhone’s RAM up to at least 4 GB. Internal storage is also up in the air at this point, but expect fairly typical iPhone tiers. As for charging, the iPhone 8 will reportedly come equipped for wireless charging, as most current Samsung devices do. Display According to a report from DigiTimes citing industry sources, the device will feature OLED panels, the same as current Samsung devices; the iPhone 7 models used a somewhat-outdated LED display. In fact, these OLED panels are so much the same as the Samsung OLEDs that Apple has apparently already ordered them from Samsung Display. The Galaxy s7 runs at 1440 x 2560 pixels over a 5.5″ screen, so expect to see similar specs on the iPhone 8. Camera As per TechRadar India, a recent report suggests that the iPhone 8 will feature a camera developed in concert with LG Innotek which incorporates 3D imaging technology. Adding substance to the rumor, Apple recently acquired an Israeli startup, LinX, specializing in 3D imaging. We can’t say at this point exactly how good that camera will be, but expect some impressive specs if its features are anything like LG’s current dual-lens offerings. Design Apple is finally doing away with their aluminum backing and replacing it with a stainless steel frame holding dual panes of reinforced glass, according to DigiTimes. The new frame will allegedly reduce the cost of producing the device significantly, and be stronger overall. Interestingly, they also recently filed a design patent for what amounts to a display with holes in it allowing for specialized Augmented Reality (AR) applications, which may or may not make it into the iPhone 8. Other rumors suggest that the iPhone 8 will feature a bezel-less design with curved edges, allowing for larger screen sizes and that the device will max out at 5.8″. Other Specs The iPhone 8 is also rumored to feature iris-scanning technology, and IP68-certified water resistance – meaning that the device can survive half an hour in 1.5-meter-deep water; a blessing to anyone who has ever been refused service from Apple due to “water damage.” Price The price is where all of this gets a bit shocking. Apple is, by all accounts, essentially bringing their devices up to the standard set by 2016’s Samsung devices. According to a report from FastCompany citing industry sources, the new iPhone 8 will cost over $1,000. That’s not as startling as it seems at first, considering that the iPhone 7 Plus carries a price tag of $969. By comparison, the Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge runs for around $800; and most people buying new flagship devices are either unconcerned with the price or are buying with contract discounts and financing – the iPhone 7 Plus costs $29 per month from AT&T on an installment plan – and most vendors offer significant discounts depending on contract terms. Top-of-the-line devices are often sold on installment plans lately, which some say are contributing to rising levels of financial insolvency. [Image by Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images] It’s still a fairly hefty chunk of change for a company whose market share is falling and who seem to be consistently trailing behind the industry standards in technology. That said, it’s doubtful that Apple is going away anytime soon – but as cheaper options such as ASUS become more competitive, they may find themselves challenged to maintain their position.

Considering the fact that 2017 would be the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, many experts believe that the next iPhone might turn out to be something very revolutionary. According to BGR, There is also chatter about this iPhone being called the iPhone X, instead of the iPhone 7s or the iPhone 8. For this article, we will refer to it as the next generation iPhone — the iPhone 8 — just to make things easier to understand. In the most recent rumor, we have reports coming about the possibility of the iPhone 8 getting a bunch of augmented reality features. iPhone 8 Reported To Feature powerful Next-Gen Augmented Reality Tech https://t.co/PqmFegx2ct pic.twitter.com/oDe5TwzzrN — Health2tech.Com (@Viral_EXP) February 13, 2017 According to a recent report by Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski, there is a good chance that Apple is seriously looking to incorporate several augmented reality features on the iPhone 8. This is what Simona was quoted in a recent note. “The inclusion of 3D sensing functionality is increasingly likely, which could enable a robust augmented reality (AR) feature set that we believe will be a key differentiator for the 10-year anniversary iPhone.” Jankowski has also talked about Apple’s recent relationship with a 3D sensor technology company, Lumentum, which was recently reported by Fast Company. Notably, it is also known that Apple has been working with Lumentum for a long period of time to bring 3D-sensing technology to its iPhones. While there is still no clarity on how this technology would find a practical application on the iPhone 8, it is likely that it would be used as an additional method to enhance facial recognition technology. There is also talk about the technology being used to endow the iPhone camera with a better depth sensing ability. What makes Jankowski’s claims more trustworthy is the fact that Lumentum, in its most recent earnings call, revealed that they had shipped their “first revenue into what we believe could be a high volume mobile device application.” As for augmented reality, we still do not know the extent to which augmented reality features would be used on the iOS platform. In its most basic form, the feature could be used to do simple things like pointing the iPhone at an object and the phone displaying interesting bits of information regarding the thing that is being pointed at. Basically, your phone might just get the ability to “know” what it is being pointed at. There are also talks about more complex applications — including the ability to identify and manipulate faces. We have already seen that the Android platform treading carefully as far as augmented reality goes with its initial batch of Tango-enabled smartphones (mostly from Lenovo). In fact, Lenovo already sells a bunch of Tango certified, augmented reality enabled Android smartphones.

If we are to make guesses, we need to listen to what popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said about Apple’s much-rumored AR platform. According to Kuo, he expects Apple’s AR implementation to be at least three-to-four years ahead of the competition. In fact, he has also gone on record and said that Apple could release a pair of augmented reality-enabled smart glasses by 2018. The possibility of Apple going all out with AR-enabled products is also enhanced by CEO Tim Cook’s recent talks about the technology. He was recently quoted saying that he is a”huge fan of augmented reality technology.” “AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what’s happening presently.” Do you think the upcoming Apple iPhone 8 (or the iPhone X) would indeed get a lot of augmented reality features?

 Apple's CFO explained why its research and development costs increased to $2.8 billion Shona Ghosh Feb. 15, 2017, 6:34 AM 2,144 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CFO Luca Maestri.Alex Grimm/Reuters Apple spent $2.8 billion (£2.2 billion) on research and development in its most recent quarter, and $10.39 billion (£8.36 billion) through 2016, according to its fourth quarter earnings report. Analysis of Apple's quarterly earnings over time show that annual spend is its highest ever. According to chief financial officer Luca Maestri, research and development spend is Apple's biggest differentiator from the competition, and stems from the company's expansion into new areas. Speaking at the Goldman Sachs investor conference on Tuesday, Maestri said Apple was "working on things that do not generate revenue today" but might be good future bets. Apple made the interview available through its investor relations site. Maestri didn't go into specifics, but rumoured projects on the books include the Apple Car and augmented reality glasses. Apple's suite of products is much larger than it used to be, Maestri added. "We make three iPhones, we only used to develop one. We develop multiple iPods, the Apple Watch, Airpods, Beats headphones. The product portfolio is larger, so we need more R&D [budget] to develop these." The company is spending more on its growing services business, which includes the App Store and iTunes. "Services has grown a lot," Maestri said during the interview. "We need engineering investments in services like iCloud, Siri, Maps. R&D on services is significantly higher than we used to have." Services jumped by almost $1 billion (£804 million) in revenue this last quarter, to $7.17 billion (£5.8 billion). Finally, there's Apple's increased focus on bringing core technologies in-house. Maestri said: "[R&D spend] allows us to keep our differentiation from the rest of the industry. Today, we do much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than we did a few years ago...think about the work we do around processors, sensors, there's much more work in-house than we used to do. It means we can push the envelope on innovation, we have better control over timing, cost, quality. We look at that as a great strategic investment for us." Apple opened an R&D centre in Israel focused on chip development in 2015, and new centres are set to open in Yokohoma in Japan, Jakarta in Indonesia, and an unspecified location in China.

Photograph: Kiichiro Sato/AP Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Samuel Gibbs Wednesday 15 February 2017 06.40 EST Last modified on Wednesday 15 February 2017 06.47 EST Apple is working on fitting fingerprint scanners beneath the screen of its iPhone, removing the need for a separate home button, a newly published patent has revealed. The patent, purchased by Apple as part of its acquisition of a display company called LuxVue in 2014, details a system of using LEDs mounted underneath a display to both detect finger’s position and scan its surface to be able to read a fingerprint. Apple said in the newly reassigned patent: “When the fingerprint is placed upon the transparent substrate, the sensing IR diodes within the display panel sense patterned IR light reflected off grooves of the fingerprint surface. “This patterned IR light is relayed to the output processor as a bitmap where it is processed to determine the fingerprint surface’s unique pattern. Because the display panel can sense IR light, the display panel is able to perform surface profile determination when the display panel is not emitting visible light.” The LuxVue-developed technology concentrates on using tiny LEDs under the display to replicate the ability to detect the presence of a finger or other interacting element against the glass of a screen. The majority of mobile devices use capacitive touchscreen layers, which detect a change in capacitance when a finger or other conductive element touches the screen. The technology is also used in many fingerprint sensors and other devices, but has drawbacks particularly in cold weather – they do not work very well when a finger is covered in a glove unless that glove has conductive surface. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The matrix of LED sensors under the screen will be able to read a fingerprint surface through the display. Photograph: US Patent Office The patent describes the use of the array of LED sensors under the display to replicate the functions of both a traditional capacitive touchscreen and a fingerprint scanner, replicating the function of Apple’s Touch ID home button. Apple states: “The ability to detect an object’s surface profile while the display panel is not emitting visible light enables the display panel to detect a user’s fingerprint to unlock a mobile device such as a cellphone when the display panel appears to be off. “Accordingly, the display panel need not emit visible light to detect a surface profile of an object, nor does the display panel require a separate sensor to detect the surface profile of an object.” Apple is not the only company working on new technologies to allow components necessary to the function of a modern smartphone to be moved under the display. Sensors such as ambient light detectors, which provide information to adjust the display’s brightness in line with current light levels, presence sensors that turn off the screen when you put the phone to your ear, the earpiece speaker and the selfie camera are all currently mounted above or around the screen in separate panels. The placement of those components is one of the biggest hurdles standing in the way of all-screen smartphones, where the unnecessary bezels around the screen are removed in favour of a display that reaches to the very edges and top and bottom of the phone. Progress is being made to reduce the need for bezels around the display. Some smartphone manufacturers, including Huawei, Google and LG have moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device. LG’s latest Android Wear smartwatches have a new ambient light sensor that can operate from beneath a screen, while Sharp and Xiaomi have both released smartphones that use bone-conduction systems built into the screens to remove the need for a separate earpiece speaker at the top of the device. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The sensors would likely have to be clustered at a higher density in one area of the screen designated for fingerprint scanning, rather than just anywhere on the screen. Photograph: US Patent Office At the same time, Apple’s iPhones have continued to have large symmetrical bezels at the top and bottom of the their screens, with the home button and integrated Touch ID fingerprint scanner mounted within the bottom bezel and the speaker grille, sensors and selfie camera in the top bezel. These large bezels have made the body of company’s smartphones relatively large compared to competitors, despite having smaller display areas. Samsung’s highly anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone is expected to have an edge-to-edge “infinity display” with thin top and bottom bezels that do not even have room for the company’s logo. It should give the Galaxy S8 one of the highest screen-to-body ratios of any smartphone, but even then it will not be truly all-screen.
