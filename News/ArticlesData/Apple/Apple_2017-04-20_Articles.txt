The most talked about feature is the screen, which is thought to wrap across the face of the device. Such a fundamental adjustment gives rise to a number of design considerations such as the placement of the home button, volume controls and fingerprint scanner, the last of which has come under close scrutiny this week.

On Wednesday night, Melbourne tech positor Sonny Dickson drew attention with a tweet titled "iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction" that features what appears to be a technical drawing of an iPhone design. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Related Content iPhone delayed as supply chain bites back The illustration features what appears to be a space at the back below the Apple logo for a potential fingerprint scanner. "Dual Vertical cameras are here, Touch ID sensor on the back. Definitely a shift in design," tweeted Dickson. Advertisement "Hard to tell, but volume rockets seem to be omitted as well," he continued. The reclusive Dickson has established a reputation as a reliable source of phone leaks, quoted widely by news sources. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tech drawing of what appears to be an iPhone. Photo: Twitter / @SonnyDickson Speaking to Fairfax via email, he gave the likelihood of authenticity of the illustration as "50/50", conceding "It's hard to know with Apple." Speculation about whether the bottom port offers lightning or USB-C connectivity abounded. There is no sign of a headphones jack in the blueprint, so users hoping for its return may have to let go. Samsung solved the vanishing home button dilemma on the recent S8 and S8+ releases by placing its fingerprint scanner at the back, drawing criticism from Fairfax reviewer Peter Wells about its accessibility. With specs on relatively level pegging, it seems like minor design decisions such as fingerprint scanner placement will be pivotal to the phone's reception. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

Samsung's new Galaxy S8 went on sale over the counter in South Korea today as the world's biggest smartphone maker seeks to move on from a disastrous handset recall and corruption scandal that has hammered its once- stellar reputation. The device, unveiled in New York last month and a challenge to Apple's iPhone, is the firm's first major launch since last year's humiliating withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries. It also comes with vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong and other executives on trial for bribery over their alleged role in the graft scandal that brought down former president Park Geun- Hye. But the company's profits are rising and the new phones have received good reviews, with more than one million pre- orders for the S8 and the larger S8+ in South Korea alone. Shares in Samsung Electronics jumped more than 2.5 per cent today, adding around USD 7 billion to its market capitalisation. "Market reactions to the release of the S8 series are somewhat positive," said Lee Seung-Woo of IBK Investment Securities. Samsung could break the record 48.5 million unit sales it achieved with its S7 series, he added. "Barring the weakening of the US dollar, Samsung's second-quarter operating profit would reach 12 trillion won," Lee said. Pre-order deliveries began earlier this week, and in- store sales begin in the US and Canada later Friday, with the device due to be rolled out to around 50 more countries next week. Samsung Electronics is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, whose revenues are equivalent to a fifth of South Korea's gross domestic product, and the S8 series introduction comes at a delicate time for the embattled firm. The Note 7 recall debacle cost it billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, forcing it to apologise to customers and postpone the S8 launch. "The latest salvo from Samsung shows how it's keen to regain consumer confidence and attain leadership in the smartphone landscape, a nearly saturated but still highly competitive space that remains key to retaining subscriber loyalties and winning new converts," IHS Markit said. When Samsung unveiled Galaxy S8 and S8+ in New York last month, it said the new handsets would mark a "new era of smartphone design". Fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, the two handsets include Samsung's upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.The most striking feature of the new phones is what Samsung dubs an "infinity display" -- an expanded glass screen that covers the entire front of the device and appears to curve seamlessly around its edges. tags #Business #Galaxy Note 7 #Galaxy S8 #IBK Investment Securities #Lee Jae- Yong #Park Geun-hye #Samsung #Samsung Electronics #smartphone #South Korea #Technology Related news Business Easy refunds no more as Flipkart tightens return policy Apr 21, 2017 11:29 AM Business Brownfield & greenfield projects more likely to drive expansion: JSW Steel Apr 21, 2017 11:28 AM Business JSW Steel plans to bring down debt & finance costs in FY18 Apr 21, 2017 11:21 AM Business Inorganic growth of any reasonable size looks unlikely, says JSW Steel’s Seshagiri Rao Apr 21, 2017 11:16 AM Business L&T signs pact with Hanwha Techwin for army weapon Apr 21, 2017 11:05 AM Business CII signs MoUs with 3 Singapore Universities Apr 21, 2017 10:15 AM Business Sunil Munjal invests Rs 100 cr in Aavishkaar Bharat Fund Apr 21, 2017 10:15 AM Business Samsung's Galaxy S8 hits stores, aims to move on from recall Apr 21, 2017 09:30 AM Business Nasscom hopes to overcome visa issues Apr 21, 2017 08:45 AM News Most Popular Top News Stay with winners! 100 stocks which rose to lifetime high in April gave up to 127% return Hindustan Zinc posts 42% rise in Q4 profit at Rs 3,057 cr, margin expands 940 bps Vijay Mallya gifted $40 million to his children, funnelled Rs 3200 crore overseas: ED’s dossier EC to get 30,000 new VVPAT machines by July for Guj, HP polls These 6 little-known companies can make it big in the next 2-3 years  Market Live: Sensex off day's high on HDFC, ICICI losses but Reliance supports Make no mistake, we're seeing signs of euphoria in midcaps: Udayan HDFC Bank Q4 profit seen up 18% at Rs 3966 cr, outlook on retail loan growth key see more Video of the day Agri sector to continue to do well; cautious on sugar space: Emkay Global Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is the upcoming launch of a new Watch with Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE). Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. Source: Nike NikeLab: Apple and Nike are working together to launch a new version of the Watch Series 2 later this month. The new version of the smartwatch will be called the NikeLab. This device comes in neutral colors and includes extra features for runners. Extra features include additional Siri commands, Nike+ Run Club integration, GPS and more. The device will become available on April 27 at nike.com, NikeLab doors and an AAPL pop-up store in Tokyo. Earth Day: Apple has announced its environmental preparations ahead of Earth Day, reports MacRumors. The tech company says that it plans to end all of mining that it does. Instead, it will create a “closed-loop supply chain”. This will have it only using recycled materials in the creation of new devices. However, it didn’t say when it would be able to switch to this plan. It also says it will continue to push for customers to return used devices to help with this process. Original Content: Apple is reportedly still interested in creating original content, Mashable notes. An unnamed source says that the company still doesn’t know exactly what it wants to do with original content. They also claims that AAPL still hasn’t decided on who would lead the project. Still, the company appears to be moving forward with original content plans, even if it hasn’t nailed down exactly what those are, yet.

Each focuses on a different aspect of Apple’s global environmental efforts for Earth Day, which takes place on April 22nd, 2017. I love these spots. They’re fun, easy to understand, and informative, too. Apple’s environmental efforts have been epic, and Apple should toot its own horn. It’s a powerful message when the planet’s most profitable company makes epic strides in the environment. John Kheit and I argue about these videos in episode 7 of Pop.0 (warning: profanity abounds). Of Yaks The first piece features Lisa Jackson, Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. She tells us about Apple’s effort to develop dual land uses for solar farms in China. In particular, at least one solar farm was elevated to leave enough room for yak herds and the grass they eat. Zero Waste Apple’s efforts to bring zero waste to landfills is part of that epic effort I mentioned above, and one where Apple puts other companies to shame. In this video, John Reynolds in iPhone Product Operations tells us how that started. Breathing Buildings I personally believe Apple Park is going to be hailed a modern architectural wonder. While that’s for a lot of reasons, this video talks about how it was designed to regulate its internal temperature in a way Apple likens to breathing. Making Sweat So it turns out Apple needs 30 gallons of sweat per year to test out Apple Watch and straps. Who knew, right? This video explains that the company makes its own artificial sweat for testing.

After an injury late last month, an incident report mistakenly found its way into the hands of hundreds of Apple reporters. This report found its way to Gizmodo earlier today. Titled “Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month,” the report contained new information about Apple’s rumored AR project. Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT There’s nothing concrete, but the report confirms that Apple is testing headsets designed to overlay a 3D image into your eye. After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis. This follows another report from March 2, detailing the same sort of injury. Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with. According to sources close to the matter, Apple may be testing both AR and VR headsets. While these don’t confirm the existence of either, it certainly sounds like something is in the works at Apple HQ. If you know anything about this prototype, shoot me an email, or reach me on Telegram.

Beijing city’s Cyberspace Administration this week publicly requested that Apple more carefully screen such live streaming apps to ensure they were in compliance with strict regulations governing online content. The regulating body expressed concerns that three live streaming services—Toutiao, Huajiao and Huoshanzhibo—available in the App Store did not comply with rules regarding monitoring live streaming content and identifying users, among other issues. The regulatory request complicates Apple’s already complex position in China, a market central to the company’s ability to continue to generate strong profits—there will be 772 million internet users in China this year, eMarketer estimates. Apple is one of the rare large Western technology-focused companies that has been able to walk a fine line between providing products and services to Chinese consumers, while simultaneously remaining on the right side of government content regulators. Internet services giants Facebook and Google have thus far been unable to reproduce that feat—both are effectively banned from the country. And Netflix withdrew from the market in 2016, citing its inability to overcome substantial regulatory hurdles. Apple’s more successful efforts have not been without blowback from Western entities critical of China’s history of censorship and quashing of domestic political dissent. In January, Apple endured criticism from those quarters after it was revealed the company had removed two news apps published by The New York Times from its App Store in China. Apple was also forced to end its iTunes Movies and iBooks services in 2016 at the behest of regulators. Apple’s position in China has also been imperiled by increased competition from domestic smartphone manufacturers like Oppo and Vivo. These companies have gained ground against the iPhone by providing many of the flagship smartphone’s features at a much lower cost. According to Counterpoint Technology Market Research, Apple’s share of smartphones shipped in China fell from 14.3% in 2015 to 10.4% in 2016. Apple is hoping to rejuvenate its fortunes this year with the launch of the iPhone 8, a device that is expected to undergo a significant design overhaul. But it remains to be seen if large numbers of consumers in China are still willing to fork over inflated sums for the iPhone, a product that may be unable to offer a feature set that differentiates itself significantly from cheaper alternatives. That makes Apple’s service-generated revenues—such as those from apps—increasingly important to the company’s bottom line. Just as it does everywhere else, Apple takes a hefty 30% cut from the sale of apps on its App Store in China. This type of service has already translated to a significant revenue stream for the company. According to App Annie, iOS App Store revenues crossed the $2 billion mark in China in Q4 2016. Live streaming apps—which have seen an explosion of popularity in China in recent months—are unlikely to contribute to Apple’s revenues in this way. Most, if not all, of them are offered for free by platforms looking to build out their user bases and then monetize by capturing a slice of in-app payments made to content providers by viewers. However, the apps have drawn close regulatory scrutiny after some incidents in which platforms featured pornographic content or other material deemed inappropriate for public dissemination. That’s likely what drew the attention of the government censors in Beijing. If these regulators were to refocus their concerns on paid apps, that could spell danger for Apple. To keep its somewhat tenuous pipeline to consumers in China open, the company will have to continue to make sure it appeases the country’s army of bureaucrats. —Rahul Chadha New Report in eMarketer PRO This Week Worldwide Ad Spending: The eMarketer Forecast for 2017 Paid media advertising outlays worldwide will increase 7.3% in 2017 to $583.91 billion.

That’s about to change. The company is set to announce a new, unprecedented goal for the tech industry, “to stop mining the earth altogether.” The announcement, part of Apple’s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report released Wednesday, will commit the company to making devices entirely from recycled materials such as aluminum, copper, tin, and tungsten. But there’s one hiccup: Apple doesn’t know exactly how it’s going to make that happen. Setting ambitious goals seems to be part of Apple's culture, but speaking about such goals publicly before the team has reached them – or before they even know how to reach them – is very different from the company's norm. VICE's photo of AirPods and Apple Watch cases in artificial sweat. Aside from this announcement, the piece also features interesting details about some of Apple's other environmental efforts. One of the stranger tidbits is that Apple soaks certain products in synthetic human sweat to test their durability over time – a fact also highlighted in the company's new environmental videos.

A new model of Apple Watch called 'Apple Watch NikeLab' is coming soon: The limited edition, neutral-toned Apple Watch NikeLab maintains the beloved features of its predecessor: deep integration with the Nike+ Run Club app, exclusive Siri commands, GPS, a two-times-brighter display and water resistance to 50 meters, all made possible by a powerful dual-core processor and watchOS 3. ​ I don't understand why Nike felt the need to give this Watch a new name rather than releasing it as an extension of the Nike+ line. Perhaps it's simply a marketing angle, as they are presenting the NikeLab as a limited edition model. If you'd like to get your hands on the Apple Watch NikeLab, it goes on sale April 27th on nike.com, at NikeLab stores, and at an Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan. Assuming this is a comprehensive list of sellers, it means you won't be able to get the Watch from the Apple Store. It also appears unlikely that the band will be available for separate purchase, though that remains unclear.

Following challenges for Thanksgiving (U.S. only) and the start of the new year, the latest challenge is in celebration of Earth Day on Saturday, April 22nd. This new challenge encourages Apple Watch owners to complete a 30-minute or longer walk, run, cycle, wheelchair, or swim workout on Earth Day. Doing so will earn a special Achievement in the Activity app, as well as unlock a few new iMessage stickers. My wife and I are two-for-two on prior activity challenges, so I'm sure we'll aim for the trifecta and complete the Earth Day challenge as well. If Apple pushed these challenges more frequently, they might be less motivating, but so far I think the company has struck a healthy level of frequency by centering challenges around special occasions.

One video shares how Apple creates artificial sweat to test the durability of its Apple Watch bands, another discusses how Apple Park was designed with a high level of "breathability," a third covers Apple's ambitions to produce zero waste company-wide, and the final video is about how solar farms can co-exist with traditional farming.

PHOTO/ Bloomberg.com Apple wants to “one day” end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the technology giant said in its annual environmental responsibility report out Thursday. “Traditional supply chains are linear,” it said. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products.” “We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material,” it added. The company’s research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. “For tin, we took a different approach,” the company said. “Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.” As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether,” the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. “Apple’s commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health,” Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group. Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an “environmentally friendly” manner. The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling. While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle. Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new ‘spaceship’ main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy.

Tags Tim Cook Apple Business Tim Cook reveals why Apple invested US$1 billion in China's Didi Chuxing: Data CNBC | Anita Balakrishnan | Friday, Apr 21, 2017 Tim Cook. Photo: Reuters Anita Balakrishnan CNBC Friday, Apr 21, 2017 Last year, Apple made an unusual move - announcing a $1 billion (S$1.4 billion) investment Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. The deal was far larger and more public than most Apple investments, and didn't clearly tie into Apple's flagship product, the iPhone. But a Thursday profile by Time reveals more about what CEO Tim Cook was thinking. Cook penned a profile honoring Jean Liu, president of Didi Chuxing and part of the "Time 100 Most Influential People" list. Cook led with the same factors that a US company like Uber or Lyft might tout: The convenience, flexibility and "disruption" of ride-sharing. But he quickly shifted focus to the vast amount of data that Didi monitors, and its "big-data algorithms." "By analysing commuter patterns the way oceanographers track the tides, Didi may help traffic jams go the way of the flip phone," Cook writes. The comment about the algorithms builds on Cook's earlier comments, where he said that Apple was always on the look out for great intellectual property. "From a Didi point of view, we see that as one, a great investment. Two, we think that there's some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market beyond what we currently know," Cook said last year. Data is important for testing self-driving cars - something Apple and Didi have almost certainly been mulling. Data can also become products: Uber has reportedly considered selling its data.

The company has added the locations of the UK's electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic's Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others. It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time. Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In May last year, Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said his company would open a new Indian development centre in Hyderabad, with a specific focus on speeding up the development of more competitive mapping tools. It plans to employ as many as 4,000 people in that facility. In December, Bloomberg reported that Cupertino, California-based Apple is assembling a team to use drones to create and update map information faster than it can currently do with camera-equipped road vehicles. "There are thousands of layers of useful information that could be added to digital maps as an overlay," said Mr Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight, "and there's a benefit in becoming known for adding as many as possible. But adding overlays like this is an enormous undertaking and needs an industrial approach in order to source, manage and maintain the information for a large number of layers across many countries." Apple first integrated transit information for the UK into Apple Maps in December, which includes route information for trains and buses across the nation, as well as London Underground services in the capital. According to data compiled by Zap-Map, there are just under 4,400 locations in Britain for recharging an electric vehicle. More than 3,000 of these will now be marked in Apple Maps. To identify these, Apple is using live data provided by Munich-based Cirrantic GmbH, a mobility services company founded in 2014, and pinpointing EV charge points on a map. Google lists charging points globally, but doesn't explicitly label them with easily identifiable icons. "We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars," said Mr Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic. "In the UK, we started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us," he said.

Gery, SeYoung Lee, and Jacob Ninas* In the past week, how many devices have you used that were connected to the Internet or relied on an algorithm to accomplish a task? Likely, the number is upward of 10 to 15, and most of those devices are used daily, if not hourly. Examples may include a Fit-Bit, cell phone, personal computer, work computer, home monitoring system, car, Internet television, printer, scanner, maps, and, if you are really tech savvy, maybe your coffee pot or refrigerator. The Internet of Things (IoT) is bound by a mesh network that is increasingly connected to every part of our lives, and those devices are becoming increasingly reliant on each other to perform their functions.1 Computing devices, using advanced algorithms, are entering the machine-learning phase, a subset of computer science in which the computer is “learning” about the environment and presenting predictions based on available data and conditions.2 Trends include machine-autonomy and self-learning. The idea of interconnectivity is not only about the IoT but also the information that transits the Internet, and how it influences our daily decisions. The trend toward a worldwide mesh-network is nearing, and with the creation of an information technology (IT)-based domain comes increased understanding of the environment in which we live. There appears to be no deviation from Moore’s law, developed in 1965, and popularized and demonstrated since its inception. If Moore’s law continues to be upheld in the future, more apps, algorithms, and daily functions will link together each part of our lives, providing increased processing capability and a limitless stream of information creating maximum efficiency for humans. The Westphalian design of society and order contributes to the human need to work within a set of logical models, whereas the principle of international law and orderly division of nations enables sovereignty over territory and domestic affairs. It is possible that globalization, which would be nearly impossible without a relatively high transfer rate of information, will play a critical role and may challenge global order. Assuming an information advantage is required to achieve nation-state and military objectives, and information superiority is not guaranteed because of the complex IoT, how does the U.S. Government present effective and integrated information warfare capability (IW) in the information age? Moreover, if wars are fought in the information space, can they be won with information alone? In other words, can information warfare provide the ways and means to fight wars, as well as the ends? Also, does the U.S. Government need to invest in an organization responsible for the coordination and integration of IW capabilities and effects? To increase the U.S. Government’s capability and capacity, a new organization should be created within the U.S. Government to focus on information warfare, with a fundamentally different organizational structure than our current governmental hierarchical structures. Specifically, the U.S. Government subscribes to the diplomatic, information, military, and economic (DIME) model but does not have an organization designed to lead the information functions of this model. The Department of State coordinates the diplomatic role, Department of Defense the military role, and Department of Treasury the economic role. Twenty-first-century challenges presented by the IoT require a more innovative organization that promotes adaptability and agility in the information space, akin to models used at Google, Facebook, or Apple. Winn Schwartau, author of Information Warfare and recognized IW theorist, describes the information age as “computers everywhere.”3 The ultimate fact of the information age is the proliferation of IT, which “incorporates information systems and resources (hardware, software, and wetware) used by military and civilian decisionmakers to send, receive, control, and manipulate information necessary to enable 21st-century decisionmaking.”4 Additionally, the development of IT allows sharing of information in near real time, at an exponential rate, anonymously and securely. These advances can be used as an asset, but also pose a potential vulnerability to the United States, our allies, and our adversaries.5 It takes seconds to upload pictures or comments on social media networks. At the same time, adversaries can use these systems to gain access to critical information. According to a New York Times article, “In July 2015, 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including social security numbers and some fingerprints.”6 The following list provides a general summary of the number of times systems have been attacked via cyber.7 The number of attacks on information systems has increased each year, reinforcing the fact that warfare is currently being conducted in the information space via IT. The Pentagon reports getting 10 million attempts a day. The National Nuclear Security Administration, an arm of the Energy Department, also records 10 million hacks a day. The United Kingdom reports 120,000 cyber incidents a day. That is almost as many as the state of Michigan deals with. Utah says it faces 20 million attempts a day—up from 1 million a day 2 years ago.8 To meet the challenge that exists in the information age, organizational changes are required. Modern ideas and incorporating industry concepts may be one way to traverse the information space and create an advantage in future conflicts. Within the IoT, actions take place in nanoseconds and occur billions of times daily. Big data concepts attempt to harness massive amounts of information and distill that information into something that a human can use to make a decision. In the near future, the information required to win the advantage over an enemy may be determined by who can extract data, identify key centers of gravity in the information space, and automatically take action though rule sets and computational criteria based on defined “rules of engagement.” The ability to harness big data exists now and is only increasing. Consumer product companies are mining Facebook, Google, and other data to understand customer preferences, global trends, and public opinion on matters of interest. From a military standpoint, understanding the information terrain in relation to the potential adversaries is foundational to discerning points for information operations (IO) across the range of military operations. Big data concepts used in business could be advantageous and used in information warfare. It is possible that data-mining and subsequently an information advantage could achieve objectives purely through IW alone. The United States has used various IW strategies, agencies, and professionals, with varying degrees of success. The U.S. Information Agency (USIA) was created in 1953 and was in service until 1999. USIA was designed to consolidate all information activities: [USIA] comprised all of the foreign information activities formerly carried out by the Department of State’s International Information Administration (IIA) and Technical Cooperation Administration, and by the Mutual Security Agency. Overseas, existing United States Information Service posts became the field operations offices of the new agency. The exchange of persons program conducted by IIA remained in the Department of State, but USIA administered the program overseas. The Department of State provided foreign policy guidance.9 Historically, information warfare was identified as critical to national security, and USIA was required to erode support for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.10 Today, we usually consider IW as the means, or sometimes a way, to achieve an objective. But currently we rarely think of IW as an end, even though we live in an information age where we are all affected by the information environment every day. Brian Nichiporuk, the author of “U.S. Military Opportunities,” discusses IW concepts and postulates: The goals of an offensive information-warfare campaign are to deny, corrupt, degrade, or destroy the enemy’s sources of information on the battlefield. Doing so successfully, while maintaining the operational security of your own information sources, is the key to achieving “information superiority”—that is, the ability to see the battlefield while your opponent cannot.11 In current and future warfare, information superiority could be the single most decisive factor. For instance, we could think about the China-Taiwan scenario. China is employing a robust IW strategy targeting the Taiwanese government in order to bring Taiwan under Chinese control, without engaging in kinetic war. They are simultaneously using information operations to delay U.S. involvement to the point where any outside interdiction occurs too late to affect the outcome.12 This concept is fully realized by a dedicated focus on IW strategy, organization, and capabilities. This could be analyzed best by Sun Tzu’s strategy: “To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”13 In another example, the Russian operations in Crimea provide a modern case study where the outcome of operations was directly attributed to IW principles and capability. Information Warfare: The Russian Invasion of Crimea The Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine, and eventual annexation of Crimea in 2014, serves as the current model of a sustained IW campaign and provides examples of successes and failures in these efforts. Russian IW, known as Reflexive Control, has its origins in Soviet doctrine and serves as a key component in their hybrid warfare operations.14 Reflexive Control “relies . . . on Russia’s ability to take advantage of preexisting dispositions among its enemies to choose its preferred courses of action.”15 During operations in Ukraine, Russia’s primary impediments included Western European powers and the United States. Russia took multiple actions to seize the advantage of preexisting dispositions among its enemies in order to conduct successful operations in Ukraine and, at the same time, avoid a large-scale confrontation with the West. As part of Reflexive Control, Russia utilized a well-coordinated denial-and-deception plan, called maskirovka, through the use of “little green men” to establish checkpoints and secure key terrain in Ukraine. These little green men operated with speed and efficiency, and wore no identifying patches or unit insignia. This lack of identification allowed Russia to deny any association with these forces, which were later acknowledged as Russian troops. By controlling information and being able to deny its involvement in the occupation of Ukraine during the early stages of the conflict, Russia was viewed as an interested party by the international community—as opposed to a belligerent. This fed directly into Russia’s view that Western Europe and the United States did not desire a direct conflict and would not press the issue of Russian involvement, even if discovered. The ability to operate in relative secrecy also allowed Russia to successfully mask its true desired endstate. By doing so, it allowed for almost any action to potentially be considered a successful mission to enemies and outside observers, due to a lack of understanding of Russian intentions. This also allowed for unchallenged Russian saber rattling and threats against the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the West as Russia attempted to paint Western Europe and the United States as weak, especially in the eyes of developing nations. In addition to actions on the ground in Ukraine, Russia integrated and utilized television, print media, and social media to deflect and hide its efforts at occupation and annexation while reducing potential Western involvement.16 The successful use of IW allowed Russian forces to occupy eastern Ukraine and annex Crimea without a large-scale response from the West. As the world continues to move into the information age, the ability of nation-state and nonstate actors to employ successful IO tactics into their overall strategy will undoubtedly increase. To successfully deter and respond to these threats, the United States must innovate and develop organizations with expertise in both preventing and conducting such actions. Russia’s IW campaign in Ukraine enabled it to achieve the objective of annexing Crimea, but it was not a flawless strategy. One flaw was the effort that Russian leaders took to deny the existence of troops in Ukraine. Even after undeniable proof, including geo-tagged photographs on social media and captured Russian troops inside Ukrainian territory, Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to deny involvement. These excessive and continual denials served only to discredit Russian leaders and provide additional reason to believe that Russian forces were in fact operating inside Ukraine.17 In addition, the lack of an overwhelming campaign of offensive cyber actions brings into question the overarching hybrid warfare campaign. Russia is arguably one of the most capable nation-state cyber actors.18 The lack of a comprehensive offensive cyber campaign, such as that observed in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, raises questions about Russian IW and Reflexive Control strategy. While this may indicate a desire not to aggravate potential adversaries, it may also indicate Russia’s inability to control all aspects of its offensive cyber actions such that it was concerned that actions could produce large-scale unintended consequences.19 These consequences may have resulted in the Russians’ inability to deny their involvement, or brought powerful enemies into the conflict. As discussed, the flaws noted in Reflexive Control doctrine serve as examples of how difficult it is currently, and will be in the future, to control the consequences of offensive actions and conduct information warfare in an information age. In an effort to better understand the capabilities and intentions of potential adversaries, understand their lessons learned, and use them to our advantage, the U.S. Government must ensure that the current organization of IW capabilities and strategic planning enables an integrated and cohesive National Security Strategy. Strategic Planning Guidance to Tactical Execution? In the joint planning process, IO planning is typically a supporting effort. If we prescribe to the idea that all wars are fought on the cognitive plane, at least at some point, then it is logical to assume that, at one point or another, IW courses of action (COAs) should be the supported effort. Moreover, “information operations support themes” are sometimes developed after military kinetic COAs are.20 While the current planning process and traditional planning structure provide the formal links between national strategy and the tactical level, they do not prescribe a way in which to gain the information advantage in future conflicts. Arguably, from a national perspective, an information strategy should drive subsequent actions and be integrated from the President to the individual Servicemember. The information strategy should be integrated with strategic communications efforts of the U.S. Government. However, as noted in the 2008 report from the Defense Science Board, “Strategic Communications is a dynamic process with responsibility held by those at the highest levels of government—the President and senior government leaders. . . . But to do so requires a commitment not yet seen, though some steps have been taken.”21 In fact, the report recommends the creation of a nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Global Engagement as a focal point for strategic communication activities. In 2010, Joseph Biden provided the President a report on strategic communications that urged synchronization and defined the overall concept.22 An interagency policy committee, led by the National Security staff, was a recommended solution; however, a committee is made up of individuals with allegiances to their own organization and likely with other responsibilities, not fully being dedicated to integrated strategic communications. The little IW capability that exists is based on the current and legacy organizational structure, which hinders effective IO planning and execution. If information space can be considered a way and means to fight and win wars, then a framework is required to assist in prioritization and planning and to present ends that may be achieved through information warfare. Planners must articulate why a specific action is being taken and when it should occur based on commander’s intent, the operational environment, and the operational approach designed to solve the problem. Decades of trial and error in warfare have led to institutional doctrine and rule sets. While there is an argument that these rules should be applied to both kinetic and nonkinetic effects, it is important to realize that there are certain unique factors associated with both. For example, targeting fundamentals are largely agreed upon and accepted for offensive force-on-force operations, but do the theories of targeting need to adjust for information warfare? Some argue that the center of gravity (COG) for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is the Internet. If we accept this idea, how does the United States target ISIL? Does the U.S. Government shut down Internet Service Providers (ISPs) (that is, the target) that ISIL is using? Does the government conduct a distributed denial-of-service attack against certain Web sites? Does it put influential messages onto ISIL message boards on the Internet? All options are plausible, but many times are not executed due to lengthy and unsynchronized plans. The lack of leadership and a focal point in the U.S. Government who can articulate the second- and third-order effects of information operations often contributes to a lack of action. The ability to understand how the information space will be influenced by the outcome of a U.S. action is not effective because there is no lead organization. In addition to the tactical-level information effects, how are strategic communications vetted and targeted? Do the processes differ or are they the same? If the view of this process were to change, and targeting were to become a process within which information targets are held at risk (for example, the ISP example or building a strategic weapon to deter an enemy), then it is possible that realistic options could be presented to a combatant commander in a crisis action scenario. To execute a concept where the United States holds information targets at risk, it must have access to the target. Access for information-related effects delivered through the information space is no different than for physical effects delivered by airplanes or ships. The delivery method could be news, a cyber capability, a military action, or even a comment by the President. The path to employ information-related capabilities (IRCs) requires access from the sender to the receiver, and that targeting path must be sustainable. Without sustained access, a target cannot be held at risk because gaining access to the receiver could take an extended amount of time, with relation to the operation. Additionally, the capability must be attainable. Software development can be a potential strategic advantage. Driving education and training for software development down to the tactical level empowers young Servicemembers to create capabilities linked to the target, reduce cost, and create efficiencies. For example, a Soldier is taught how to use a rifle, the foundations are built in training, and he is able to utilize the weapon through the employment of various tactics, techniques, and procedures on the battlefield as the situation dictates. If the situation changes, he adjusts to the enemy in an instant. From an IW perspective, software is but one tool, as is the rifle. Foundations are built, skills are honed, but it is left to the tactical level to ensure the capability is “tuned” to the target because the tactical-level operator should have the most accurate knowledge of that target. Additionally, as accesses change, the tactical and operational level should ensure consistent and reliable access to the target. Indeed, the Soldier does not develop the strategy; the national security staff, President, and combatant commanders do. But what organization is responsible for coordinating the strategic message throughout the national security apparatus? Furthermore, what organization is responsible for providing information operation COAs for the President, specifically designed as an end? The contrarian viewpoint to the idea of driving development down to the operator level (that is, the Soldier) is that authorities do not come with capability. This is true. A tactical-level unit should not have authority to execute operations in the information space, just as the Soldier with the rifle would not fire without orders. There should be a strategy with clear and precise guidance for operational and tactical targeting. This does not require “execution authorities,” but it does require guidance from national-level leadership on the issue. In other words, because technical acumen is required, the U.S. Government cannot afford to have a disjointed IW strategy in which progress is slowed due to an overly complicated and bureaucratic hierarchical structure. A lack of unity of effort results, and risk to mission and risk to force increase. Developers, operators, and analysts need flexibility and agility to solve problems quickly with innovative technology and an understanding of the information age, just as a Soldier does when in battle. Is the World Organizationally Changing? Military organizations have generally followed hierarchical models as early as the Greeks in 400 BCE for organizing and equipping. It is possible that global IT trends will require a foundationally different way of thinking and organizing IRCs in the U.S. Government to maintain pace with the speed of information. Largely, from the time of the Greeks to that of the current U.S. Government, militaries have been designed around a hierarchical system. As IW becomes increasingly more important during the conduct of government or military operations, a lattice framework and system may be a logical way to organize information warfare–based capabilities and personnel. This concept prescribes basic guidance and a certain rule set (that is, authorities) but empowers individual members to develop solutions unabated by personnel unfamiliar with the technical situation. The concept capitalizes on meritocracy-based principles and focuses on a federated approach as well as crowd-sourcing solutions internally to the military, or even in the public sector, to arrive at solutions. Within the U.S. Government, it is unlikely that a lattice organization would be wholly integrated; however, a hybrid concept that captures the value of a legal and hierarchical framework along with realizing the potential benefit of a lattice organization would be valuable, as globalization and IT increasingly integrate our world. Additionally, a lattice framework would more closely align conceptually with the mass-network IT environment in which we live. Ideas presented in the corporate world are potential solutions that can be used or modified for complicated IW concepts within the U.S. Government. In a thought piece from business, Cathleen Benko and Molly Anderson from Forbes magazine highlight a few key benefits of a lattice organizational structure: With employees working in geographically dispersed teams, the old ways of communicating [are] no longer served. Lattice ways to participate moved the organization toward more interactive, transparent communication. In one instance, the finance division gave a role traditionally reserved for management—identifying improvement priorities—to employees, by launching a “pain points” portal where they can voice their views of current challenges for everyone to see. The company appoints teams to address the highest priorities. At Deloitte, our annual employee survey shows that 90% of workers who experience all three lattice ways are engaged. Contrast that with the results of a major global workforce study by Towers Perrin in 2007–2008 that found just over 60% of employees in surveyed companies were engaged.23 Not only does a lattice framework promote internal integration and idea-sharing, the concept also promotes the use of solutions from external sources. In many cases, members of a lattice-type organization are encouraged to look for nonstandard solutions to difficult problems, even if that means branching outside of organizational norms. Analyzing a recent case, the iPhone encryption issue surrounding the San Bernardino terrorist attack is an example of a federated approach to problem-solving. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to crack the iPhone’s encryption, despite Apple’s unwillingness to support. Apple’s fear stemmed from the idea that if it provided the requested support, the government would then own the key to all encryption security measures for iPhones around the world.24 When the international media reported and publically debated the issue, the FBI received calls from individuals and companies claiming to possess the tools necessary to break the encryption. In fact, one company was able to break the encryption and allowed the FBI to retrieve the desired data from the terrorist’s phone. This example shows the power of information in multiple ways; the first is the fact that the government was unable to use traditional methods of gaining support from a private company. Second, media, as the primary driver, brought attention to the problem and forced a public debate, which worked in favor of the government. There were arguments on both sides of the issue, but it should be assumed that the challenge in and of itself was enough to stimulate a solution, whether right or wrong. The key point to this example is that the proliferation of information drove a solution, regardless of Apple’s standpoint, the FBI’s authority, and even despite popular public opinion for or against the FBI. If the power of information can easily dictate the outcome of such an example, what are the long-term implications for warfare? The U.S. Government can take measures now, organizationally, to harness IW concepts and be positioned to maintain the information advantage in a dynamic and unsure information age. Future IW solutions will also need to involve multidomain skills from individuals with varying backgrounds. In today’s military, once a Servicemember is branded with a specific skill set, it is challenging to break from that community and maneuver effectively between communities, while still maintaining upward mobility. To achieve greater effectiveness in IO planning and execution, cross-domain and diverse IRC careers should become a desired career path option for future leaders. Amazon Meets the U.S. Government To harness the information age and enable IW capability toward the success of future U.S. conflicts, a new organization should be created within the U.S. Government. The Cold War has passed, and so has USIA; however, it is possible that a new version of USIA is required as Russia continues to test its limits of power. As in the case of Ukraine, Georgia, and Estonia, as well as the need to combat terrorist groups such as ISIL, a renewed effort on U.S. information warfare is required. The dynamic and ever-changing environment requires a fundamentally different organizational structure than that of current government hierarchical structures in order to be flexible and adaptable for 21st-century problems. Additionally, as we move forward in the information age, our lives will be increasingly intertwined and connected with information systems. This information environment will continue to play a critical role in how the U.S. Government and military interact with allies, partners, and adversaries in all of the operational domains. To shape the environment to meet our desired endstates, we must recognize the importance of information warfare and work to ensure that IO concepts are properly integrated into all actions and operations, if not become an end themselves. We must also search for innovative ways to build and employ IO concepts. Our IO experts must have the required training and expertise necessary to meet these requirements by way of strategic guidance. Operators must have flexibility and agility engrained into their ethos through a lattice-type organizational structure, which honors a multidomain career path. The ability to carry out all IW requirements must be done in a timely and succinct manner that allows for the fastest possible action with the most flexibility. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, we will most definitely fall behind in the fast-paced and constantly changing world of IT and IW, and we will likely be ineffective in identifying and combating enemy COGs, such as ISIL’s reliance on IT. It is time to implement ideas that exist in industry, and force change, before change is unattainable—through a sustainable and repeatable process and organization within the U.S. Government. *About the authors: Major William R.

Yet in many ways, the company’s headquarters, which will become the iconic physical symbol of Apple in future decades, is also front and center in the environmental progress report, which covers the company’s 2016 fiscal year. “Our new corporate campus, Apple Park, is on track to be the largest LEED Platinum–certified building in North America,” the company stated in the report. “Over 80 percent of the new campus is open space with more than 9,000 drought-tolerant trees. It’s powered by 100 percent renewable energy.” The report, however, also poses a weighty question, and one that won’t be easy for a complex tech titan with $218.12 billion in revenue and $45.22 billion in profits. “Can we power a global business with the sun, wind, and water?” the company asks of itself. Perhaps not surprisingly, the company answered this nettlesome question in the affirmative. “One hundred percent of the electricity we use to power our data centers, and 96 percent used by our facilities worldwide, comes from energy sources like solar, hydro, and wind power,” Apple stated in the report. “So every time you send an iMessage or ask Siri a question, it’s powered by renewable energy.” Cupertino-based Apple also says it’s pushing its manufacturing partners to go green as well. “Seven major suppliers have now pledged to power their Apple production entirely with renewable energy by the end of next year,” the company said. “We’re making strides toward our commitment to bring four gigawatts of renewable power online by 2020, a key step in reducing our manufacturing footprint.” The company also said it is “moving toward a closed-loop supply chain,” saying that one day it hopes to build products using only recycled materials.   Image from Apple’s Environmental Responsibility 2017 Progress Report Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Apple, cleantech, cupertino, environment, green, Tech   More Posts in Clean Tech Tesla lawsuit: Autopilot unsafe, based on ‘half-baked software’ April 19, 2017   Tesla faces labor dispute at key German robotics factory April 19, 2017   Pre-release Tesla Model 3 spotted near company headquarters April 6, 2017       Share this Post Tweet               Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Google to pay $22.5 million in AdWords settlement Tesla lawsuit: Autopilot unsafe, based on ‘half-baked… San Francisco startup Juicero’s $400 juice-maker turns Oracle’s Larry Ellison to host Mitch McConnell, other… Tesla issues voluntary recall on most 2016 vehicles     Archives Archives Select Month April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital   About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Legal Battle Again Dominates Qualcomm's Earnings Call Just about every analyst question was about the litigation. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 20, 2017 at 6:14PM Just like last quarter, all anyone wanted to talk about on Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) earnings call last night was the mobile chip giant's expanding legal battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The situation even overshadowed relatively strong earnings, as Qualcomm topped consensus estimates by putting up revenue of $6 billion with adjusted earnings per share of $1.34. Management said that the automotive, networking, and Internet of Things (IoT) segments performed particularly well. Heading into the release, there was concern that Qualcomm's results could be held back since Apple is interfering with royalty payments that its contract manufacturers owe to Qualcomm, which was one of the counterclaims in Qualcomm's countersuit against Apple. The whole situation is complicated because Apple's suppliers sit between the two dueling parties, and are effectively getting caught in the crossfire. Image source: Court filings. Here are the relevant highlights from the call regarding the escalating litigation. Qualcomm believes its direct license offers are fair Over the years, Apple has tried to ink a direct licensing deal with Qualcomm, but has never found the offered terms consistent with fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) principles. Qualcomm says its offers have been comparable with the terms it offers hundreds of other companies, according to Qualcomm President Derek Aberle: The offers we have made to Apple for a direct license to Qualcomm cellular standard essential patents are consistent with the value of our patent technologies, established by these more than 300 arm's-length license agreements and are fully compliant with Qualcomm's FRAND commitments. It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fair and reasonable offers. Apple has started withholding payments to suppliers, which owe Qualcomm Since Apple's contract manufacturers pass along the royalty costs in full, which Apple is now disputing, Apple has simply started to withhold these payments from its suppliers. These suppliers, in turn, underpay what they contractually owe to Qualcomm. The difference is roughly $1 billion. Aberle again: Despite Apple's claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple. In our fiscal second quarter, Apple interfered with the license agreements between Qualcomm and the Apple suppliers by actively inducing them to underpay the royalties they owed to Qualcomm for sales during the December quarter. Apple withheld payments to their suppliers for sales in the December quarter in an amount equal to what Apple claims Qualcomm owes to Apple under a separate cooperation agreement between the companies. Image source: Apple. The underpayments didn't affect recognized revenue Apple suppliers reported the appropriate amount of royalties owed during the quarter, but simply underpaid what was owed. As such, Qualcomm still recognized the full royalty revenue from these contractual agreements, so it's mostly a matter of cash flow. Net accounts receivable did increase sequentially by $2 billion, including the disputed $1 billion. This is offset on the balance sheet, with $1 billion held in liabilities while the dispute remains ongoing. Here's CFO George Davis: It is worth noting that fiscal second-quarter royalty revenues were not impacted by the underpayment because the suppliers reported the full royalties for the term of their agreement, and acknowledged they were due, but underpaid by the same amount that Qualcomm is withholding from Apple under the cooperation agreement. Suppliers are still on the hook As mentioned above, Apple suppliers are getting caught in the crossfire, since they still owe Qualcomm royalties due to their agreements irrespective of what Apple does. Apple withholding payments to suppliers because Apple has a beef with Qualcomm has no direct impact on what the suppliers owe. On the other hand, the suppliers don't want to pay out such large amounts. Here's General Counsel Don Rosenberg: So just to be clear, the excuse that the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn't paying them and what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to them to match payments that they claim we owed them from the other agreement, the BCPA. No connection to the license agreement between us and our contract manufacturers. So it was totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold. And we now look at what they're going to do going forward, and we say, well, even the excuse that they use before that is Apple claiming that they were making up for amounts that we didn't pay them, doesn't exist anymore. So there doesn't seem to be even an arguable rational reason for anybody to withhold the payments. This is how Qualcomm still recognizes the full revenue Normally, if an amount is disputed, it isn't recognized as revenue. But since the suppliers themselves have not formally disputed the payments, Qualcomm is still able to recognize the revenue in full, as mentioned above. Here's Davis: Typically, if there's a formal dispute, then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved. And I'll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes a formal dispute. But certainly, entry into arbitration or lawsuit is one case in the past. For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and underpaid and has not filed a formal dispute. And in that case, we take the revenue for the amount paid while we're working on collecting the balance owed from the customer.  A major overhang The legal battle is a major overhang, and -- unlike the FTC's suit -- probably isn't going away anytime soon. It's a small consolation for Qualcomm investors that the bulk of the dispute is in the rearview mirror. The Business Cooperation and Patent Agreement (BCPA) that's at the center of the dispute expired at the end of 2016. Rosenberg again: While we disagree with [Apple's original complaint], obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies. As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So there are no more monies even arguably due from us to them and therefore, no basis or rationale to continue withholding from the contract manufacturers.  Qualcomm is taking a conservative approach to guidance, factoring in numerous scenarios of royalty payments from Apple via its suppliers (not including a scenario where Apple suppliers pay nothing). The company expects fiscal third-quarter revenue to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion, with adjusted EPS of $0.67 to $0.92. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Headlines ZICTA claims they can read your WhatsApp Messages and Disable any Communication Device April 20, 2017 94 10,239 views Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala ZICTA has sensationally revealed that it is able to disable any communication devices and read personal messages. The revelation is likely to unsettle many social media users especially that platforms such as WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption which ensures that only the sender and the person receiving can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. On WhatsApp, messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and the sender have the special key needed to unlock and read the message. In recent years, some tech companies with very large user-bases have been championing user privacy. For instance, Apple and WhatsApp recently challenged law enforcement authorities’ demands to weaken their security system and/or access encrypted data. Apple most visibly in the San Bernardino case when Apple resisted demands by the FBI that it writes a new version of its OS to weaken the security of the terrorist’s iPhone. But ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala has also disclosed that the authority has a good working relationship with Facebook and Google in order to protect internet users in Zambia. Mr Chisala said Communications and Transport Minister Brian Mushimba envisions an ICT sector that is well disciplined. He said Zambia would have a lot of problem if it allowed people to do what they want online. Mr Chisala was speaking when he featured on the Hot FM Red Hot Breakfast show on Wednesday to clarify on the raid at CEC Liquid Telecom and other IT firms in Lusaka. “You know there have been a lot of social media pages, cloning, hate speech and the exchange of pornographic material and the ICT Act is very clear on some of these things. Now we have moved into gear to ensure that even taking you to court, we are going to ask for the maximum penalty because we don’t want a few people to twist the hand of government to now start putting in laws to start restricting people’s use of the internet. That is unnecessary, the Internet is one tool that can be used for businesses, research, communication and other things,” Mr Chisala said. He added, “So we have now gone into gear and we are now going to visit all those we find wanting to ensure that the ICT sector is one that other countries can be proud of and come to learn from.” “I always wish to remind people that with great power comes great responsibility. When you sit in your room on your Ipad or your phone and you start commenting, writing and rubbishing people, you know, we will catch up with you.” Mr Chisala said the ZICTA of today has realised that collaboration and education is not the only way to go hence the need to increase on enforcement of the law. “I think we need to switch up, turn the heat up. We are now following every lead we have and we will get to you. A very good example, a lot of you lose your phones, your laptops and when the police find them in a raid or if it is stolen, what we have to do to know if it belongs to you is that we will have to go through it and now instead of giving you back your stolen item, we will have to arrest you because even if you have deleted anything, we have equipment that can bring back everything that was deleted,” Mr Chisala explained. He added, “So if somebody is disturbing you or harassing you on social media, come and report to ZICTA and by the way, we are having very good relationships with these social media platforms like Facebook and Google and we speaking the same language.” “We are goona come after you and we will make you an example because we will name and shame you and we are going to blacklist you in Zambia, meaning you cannot use any of these services and if cousin, your mother, your father buys you a phone and you start using and we find out, we will blacklist your mother, your father, your cousin and whoever will give you access.” Related posts: ZICTA trains 100 CB teachers in curbing cybercrime ZICTA shuts down internet cafes operating without trading licences Over 6 million Zambians accessing the internet-ZICTA ZICTA raids CEC Liquid Telecom Loading...

Accessing Whatsapp is another issue- to get access of someone’s whatsapp message one would have to use a clone server but you would have to know the number of the person whose account you wish to hack! Which is why some people avoid giving their numbers or putting their numbers on social networking sites such as FB or linkedin! So Zicta are actually quit right as they have a list of names and numbers of the owners of those names-however I believe they would require an act of Parliament to do so as the current Law on information is vague.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 April 2017 | MYT 10:30 AM Apple Maps update for Europe includes focus on electric vehicles Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc's Google. — Apple Apple Inc is expanding the capabilities of its Maps app in Europe to help users charge their electric vehicles or find bike rental hubs, in another bid to keep iPhone users away from rival Google.  The company has added the locations of the UK’s electric vehicle charging stations by incorporating data from Munich-based Cirrantic’s Moovility service, which lists re-juicing points for cars made by Tesla and Nissan, among others.  It has also added public bicycle rental and drop-off points to maps of London, New York and Paris in a catch-up to long-time mobile navigation leader Google, which has listed such stations in multiple countries for some time.  Improving its mapping products has become a key focal point for Apple in its battle with Alphabet Inc's Google. In May last year, Apple's chief executive officer Tim Cook said his company would open a new Indian development centre in Hyderabad, with a specific focus on speeding up the development of more competitive mapping tools. It plans to employ as many as 4,000 people in that facility.  In December, Bloomberg reported that Cupertino, California-based Apple is assembling a team to use drones to create and update map information faster than it can currently do with camera-equipped road vehicles. “There are thousands of layers of useful information that could be added to digital maps as an overlay,” said Martin Garner, an analyst at CCS Insight, “and there's a benefit in becoming known for adding as many as possible. But adding overlays like this is an enormous undertaking and needs an industrial approach in order to source, manage and maintain the information for a large number of layers across many countries.”  Apple first integrated transit information for the UK into Apple Maps in December, which includes route information for trains and busses across the nation, as well as London Underground services in the capital.  According to data compiled by Zap-Map, there are just under 4,400 locations in Britain for recharging an electric vehicle. More than 3,000 of these will now be marked in Apple Maps. To identify these, Apple is using live data provided by Munich-based Cirrantic GmbH, a mobility services company founded in 2014, and pinpointing EV charge points on a map. Google lists charging points globally but doesn’t explicitly label them with easily identifiable icons.  “We think that consistent, live information of the growing charger infrastructure increases the confidence of EV drivers and, especially with Apple Maps, attracts new user groups to sustainable mobility offerings like EV cars,” said Arne Meusel, CEO and co-founder of Cirrantic. “In the UK we started with supporting the major charger operators, including Podpoint, CYC, Ecotricity, NPower and NewMotion. Any interested operator is welcome to set up a connection with us.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Olympic Council welcomes eSports at Asian Games, ‘FIFA 2017’ named China's Bitauto unit raises US$1bil from Internet giants Tencent, Baidu Facebook out to read minds Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Inaugural football course a big hit India opener Rahul set to miss Champions Trophy Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas advertisement Latest News Messaging app said to be used in White House does not work: lawsuit Spotify ensures independent artistes are on board with fresh deal Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Most Viewed in Tech Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber could face higher licence fees in London under new proposals German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage Xiaomi’s preparing to make a comeback with latest marquee phone Alibaba backs decision to add videogames to ‘Asia Olympics’ Tinder survey unveils naked truths about Millennial dating The biggest time suck at the office might be your computer Experts say automated accounts sharing fake news ahead of French election Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Serial Apple leaker Sonny Dickson is back with yet another scoop. The notorious hardware insider took to Twitter to share an intriguing image, showing what appears to be design schematics for the upcoming iPhone. “We're hunting for awesome startups” Run an early-stage company? We're inviting 250 to exhibit at TNW Conference and pitch on stage! CHECK IT OUT Here is the full image: iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Right off the bat, the leaked sketch seems to confirm earlier reports and design renders suggesting Apple could be moving its Touch ID module to the back – as well as ditching the standard horizontal dual-cam setup in favor of one placed vertically. The schematics also reveal the device will be approximately 15cm (or 5.9 inches) high and about 7.2cm wide (or 2.8 inches) wide. Interestingly, the sketch appears to be mysteriously missing the rocker volume, but as Dickson himself speculates – they might simply be invisible from this angle. Hard to tell, but volume rockets seem to be omitted as well. Then again, I can't see the hard side…I'll work on that! — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 As expected, Dickson has refrained from giving any details about the source of the leak, but you can clearly notice the blue stamp on the right side of the image has what appears to be Chinese characters – which is where the company has been known to assemble its handsets. Meanwhile, Apple is expected to unveil its new iPhone during its signature hardware event in September, but shipping might be slightly delayed.

The most talked about feature is the screen, which is thought to wrap across the face of the device. Such a fundamental adjustment gives rise to a number of design considerations such as the placement of the home button, volume controls and fingerprint scanner, the last of which has come under close scrutiny this week.

On Wednesday night, Melbourne tech positor Sonny Dickson drew attention with a tweet titled "iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction" that features what appears to be a technical drawing of an iPhone design. iPhone 8 looks to be taking a new direction pic.twitter.com/mG19bcDYiC— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) April 19, 2017 Related Content iPhone delayed as supply chain bites back The illustration features what appears to be a space at the back below the Apple logo for a potential fingerprint scanner. "Dual Vertical cameras are here, Touch ID sensor on the back. Definitely a shift in design," tweeted Dickson. Advertisement "Hard to tell, but volume rockets seem to be omitted as well," he continued. The reclusive Dickson has established a reputation as a reliable source of phone leaks, quoted widely by news sources. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tech drawing of what appears to be an iPhone. Photo: Twitter / @SonnyDickson Speaking to Fairfax via email, he gave the likelihood of authenticity of the illustration as "50/50", conceding "It's hard to know with Apple." Speculation about whether the bottom port offers lightning or USB-C connectivity abounded. There is no sign of a headphones jack in the blueprint, so users hoping for its return may have to let go. Samsung solved the vanishing home button dilemma on the recent S8 and S8+ releases by placing its fingerprint scanner at the back, drawing criticism from Fairfax reviewer Peter Wells about its accessibility. With specs on relatively level pegging, it seems like minor design decisions such as fingerprint scanner placement will be pivotal to the phone's reception. 3 comments Log in to comment New User?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple sets a new environmental goal: No more mining Caitlin McGarry 21 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple never used to announce what its roadmap looked like. Instead, the company held its cards close and let the rumour mill run amok. But lately, Apple is being much more open about its future. Expect new iMacs later this year, company executives said earlier this month, but that’s not all: Apple plans to make all of its products with recycled materials. That means the end of mining metals from the earth, which is a tall order. Apple doesn’t have a timeline for moving to a completely closed-loop supply chain, says Lisa P. Jackson, the company’s vice president of environmental and social initiatives. Jackson, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, told Vice News Tonight that Apple is trying to move the industry in the direction of sustainability. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do which is announce a goal before we completely figure out how to do it,” Jackson says. “We’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important because as a sector it’s where we believe technology should be going.” You can see Jackson’s full Vice News Tonight interview below. Liam, Apple’s iPhone-disassembling robot, will play a big part in recycling and reusing Apple’s own components to produce new devices. But there’s much more to it than that, which Apple is still trying to figure out. The company managed to move almost entirely to renewable energy to power its facilities within four years of announcing that goal, so it can be done. In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity Apple uses worldwide came from renewable energy. In 24 countries, it’s 100 percent renewable. The company is encouraging its suppliers to do the same, and seven have promised to power their Apple manufacturing with renewable energy by the end of 2018. Apple is also using 99 percent recycled and sustainably sourced paper for its packaging. Apple released its annual comprehensive environmental sustainability report, which covers its progress in fiscal 2016, and you can check it out in full here. The news of Apple’s new goal comes just in time for Earth Day, which falls on April 22. To get you in the mood, the company is encouraging Apple Watch owners to finish a 30-minute outdoor exercise activity on Saturday, for which you’ll be awarded an Earth Day badge and iMessage stickers. You’re not gonna help the earth with that workout, really, but you’re probably already recycling your iPhones and being responsible in other ways. The Earth Day challenge is just for fun.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Nike will sell an exclusive Apple Watch NikeLab not available in most Apple stores Oscar Raymundo 21 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple and Nike are launching a new Apple Watch model at the end of the month, but it’s hard to spot any major upgrades in the Apple Watch NikeLab. The Apple Watch NikeLab is a limited-edition model with a Space Grey aluminium case and a “light bone” and black Nike Sports Band. This model sports the “NikeLab Innovation x Innovators” logo on the back. Just like the Apple Watch Nike+ models that were first unveiled in 2016, this is a Series 2 model running the latest watchOS 3 with built-in GPS and water-resistance. In addition, the NikeLab model is also integrated with the Nike+ Run Club and has exclusive Siri commands catering to runners. Apple Watch NikeLab will go on sale from 27 April on Nike.com, at NikeLab doors and at an Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan. Notably, this NikeLab model will not be available on Apple.com, nor at any other Apple store locations. Why this matters: Save for the neutral-toned band and the NikeLab logo, Apple Watch NikeLab seems near-identical to the previous Apple Watch Nike+ models. So it just sounds like Nike wanted to extend this collaboration and promote itself as an “innovative” company with an internal “lab.” Unfortunately, the only innovative thing that’s new about NikeLab’s product is the use of a weird colour: bone. Perhaps Apple is throwing Nike a bone, by giving the company an exclusive product to drive people to Nike.com and to the NikeLab locations to see all the other innovative bone-coloured stuff they sell.

"Traditional supply chains are linear," it said. "Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products." "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material," it added. The company's research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. "For tin, we took a different approach," the company said. "Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s.  The ultimate aim is "to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. "Apple's commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health," Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group. Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an "environmentally friendly" manner. The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling. While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle. Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new 'spaceship' main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy. © Agence France-Presse Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  Apple   environment   /business/03/30/17/in-pictures-samsung-challenges-apple-bets-revival-on-galaxy-s8 /business/04/05/17/apple-aims-for-more-control-less-cost-as-it-accelerates-in-chip-design /business/04/13/17/apple-hires-secret-team-for-treating-diabetes-cnbc /business/04/15/17/apple-gets-permit-to-test-self-driving-cars /video/life/04/03/17/recipe-chef-tatungs-tinapang-bangus-with-pineapple-glaze LATEST NEWS MOST READ 2 patay matapos magulungan ng 18-wheeler sa Antipolo April 21, 2017 Palace: TIME failed to say De Lima jailed by court April 21, 2017 Sandigan rejects Echiverri MR vs arrest April 21, 2017 Cars to be rerouted in 'stop and go' scheme for ASEAN Summit April 21, 2017 Philippine fishermen accuse China of firing on vessel April 21, 2017 OPINION: Pro-Duterte group gave reporters and bloggers 'gas money' for attending its presscon April 21, 2017 Celebrity recipe: Rufa Mae Quinto's roasted chicken April 21, 2017 Paraiso sa Palawan, dinadayo ng mga turista April 21, 2017 SILIPIN: Loft-style condo ni Rufa Mae Quinto April 21, 2017 How party food may be exposed to bacteria April 21, 2017 Jaya wants to do a concert with fellow 'Tawag' judges April 21, 2017 Security Bank, pansamantalang matitigil ang mga serbisyo April 21, 2017 LOOK: Gov't forces find suspected Abu Sayyaf camp April 21, 2017 Dancing pulis, nais maibalik ang tiwala ng publiko sa kapulisan April 21, 2017 Malacañang suspends work on April 27-28 in parts of metro April 21, 2017 April 27-28 declared non-working holidays in parts of metro 'Greatest Love': Gloria's death breaks hearts Malacañang suspends work on April 27-28 in parts of metro IN PHOTOS: 10 celebrity couples with big age gaps Birthday boy Erap, biniro ni Digong 'Will to succeed': Sampaguita vendor, a cemetery dweller, finishes college Nosebleed?

By: Tech Desk | Updated: April 21, 2017 10:05 am Apple customers will receive a special achievement as well as a unique sticker in the Messages app if they complete at least a 30-minute workout. If you are one of those having trouble motivating yourself to get outside and workout in this Indian summer, here is something that could get you up and running. Apple has launched a notification for customers as part of the Earth Day Challenge on April 22. On April 21, Apple Watch customers across the globe will receive a notification about the Earth Day Challenge, encouraging them to get outside and enjoy the planet. Apple customers will receive a special achievement as well as a unique sticker in the Messages app if they complete at least a 30-minute workout. In addition to the notification on April 21, Apple Watch users will see the unearned achievement in the Activity app on iPhone. However, in case the achievement is not earned by April 23, it will disappear. Apple had earlier promoted an activity challenge around New Year’s Day. Earth Day Network’s mission is to diversify, educate and activate the environmental movement worldwide. Growing out of the first Earth Day, Earth Day Network is the world’s largest recruiter to the environmental movement, working with more than 50,000 partners in nearly 195 countries to build environmental democracy. More than 1 billion people now participate in Earth Day activities each year, making it the largest civic observance in the world. We work through a combination of education, public policy, and consumer campaigns. The first Earth Day was marked on April 22, 1970 in the US, and in many ways kickstarted the modern environmental movement. It led to the passage of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and many other groundbreaking environmental laws in the US. However, it took two decades for Earth Day to go global when it was observed in over 141 countries.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

The company’s CEO has not been shy at sharing his belief about how much he thinks AR will become a mainstream piece of technology in the future, which has since led to rumors that Apple could be working on some kind of AR glasses. If you’re looking for proof, a recently leaked document obtained by Gizmodo might have provided us with the closest thing to confirmation to date. The document in question is a report compiled by a Environment Health and Safety contractor for Apple, which was mistakenly sent to hundreds of Apple employees and subsequently fell into the hands of Gizmodo. The report mentions several incidents that happened at Apple’s campus, one of which reads, “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” Another incident reads, “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use.” This has led to speculation that this mysterious device employees are working on could be the rumored AR glasses. However given its vague language it’s hard to say if it is or if it could be something else entirely, so take it with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Gadgets >Rumors.

Nike has announced that it partnered with Apple to create a Apple Watch Nike+ that combines a Space Grey Apple Watch Series 2 aluminium case with a black and white coloured Nike band. The watch, dubbed Apple Watch Nike Lab, is otherwise exactly like the Nike+ watch. However, unlike the Nike+, it will only be available through Nike’s website, at NikeLab locations, and at an Apple pop-up in Tokyo. Apple Watch Nike+ review: Great watch, not a perfect runner's watch Which Apple Watch should you choose? Nike said the device is meant to be "the ultimate style companion" for runners. It's integrated with the Nike+ Run Club app and offers exclusive Siri commands, GPS, a dual-core processor, and water resistance up to 50m. It also comes running watchOS 3 out of the box. ​It will not be sold in any physical Apple Stores or from the Apple Store website, making it the first Apple Watch to get such a limited release. Nike The Apple Watch NikeLab will be available from 27 April. It's unclear how many units will be made and how much they'll cost. No pricing information was announced by Nike on Thursday, and yet MacRumors has reported that the 38mm model and 42mm model will cost $369 (about £290) and $399 (about £310), respectively, which is the same price as the Apple Watch Nike+, which debuted last autumn. Nike UK pricing is unknown too, but we've contacted Apple for more details. Apple and Nike first teamed up late last year to launch a version of the Appl Watch together that sits alongside Apple's own Series 2 devices.

Does a leaked report point to Apple's augmented reality glasses? By Michelle Fitzsimmons Wearables   Let's hope those eye injury issues are fixed before launch Shares Take the following with a hearty heap of salt, but a newly leaked incident report may further confirm Apple has an augmented reality device in the works. The report, issued on April 14 by an Environment Health and Safety contractor working on behalf of Apple, was accidentally sent to a few hundred employees before making its way to Gizmodo. It describes in limited detail more than 70 incidents in which Apple employees had some kind of safety-related issue at work. These include an employee running into a door, someone burning his hand when taking fish out of an oven (likely at an on-campus cafe), a woman feeling lightheaded and employees encountering hazardous materials. In what sounds like a fairly routine report are a pair of incidents that potentially point to an Apple AR product in testing: two people experienced eye injuries when using prototypes.  One person required "medical treatment beyond first aid" after she experienced eye discomfort while using a "prototype unit". "After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study," the report reads. "Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis." "See the laser flash" is a phrase that leads us to think the tester was looking through something when she developed an eye issue, though that's our speculation. Is Apple working on its own version of Google Glass? In another incident, an employee "reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use." The prototype in question was potentially tampered with, the report notes. Gizmodo spoke to a source at Apple who mused the second incident may involve an AR device Apple is possibly testing, though this person didn't offer any hard evidence. The publication notes the device is "something like glasses with an overhead display." Glasses or iPhone 8? Of course, without knowing what kind of prototypes the employees were using, we can't know for certain it had anything to do with augmented reality, let alone are devices worn like eyeglasses or a visor that goes on the face. It's even possible the prototypes are versions of the iPhone 8, which is rumored to have augmented reality features when it launches later this year. Months of reports have indicated Apple is working on some kind of augmented reality product, and CEO Tim Cook has spoken on numerous occasions about his preference for AR over virtual reality. He has hinted, however, that the iPhone could be in for augmented reality features first.  The leaked report provides some back up to the cacophony of rumors that Apple is developing an AR device, but it's likely we won't see what the tech giant has made for at least a few more months.  Apple's next major event is the WWDC 2017 developer conference in June, followed by the expected iPhone 8 launch event in September. If Apple is ready to release its AR device this year, it will likely unveil the product at one of these two gatherings. Let's just hope those eye injury problems are remedied before that happens.

For the most part users could only appreciate it on Apple devices, although last year Tumblr did roll out support for the feature on its platform. The good news is that if you wanted to share your Live Photos with more people, Apple has released an official Live Photos JavaScript API which basically allows developers to use the API to share Live Photos on a bunch of platforms, such as iOS, macOS, and even the web. According to Apple, “This new JavaScript-based API makes it easy to embed Live Photos on your websites. In addition to enabling Live Photos on iOS and macOS, you can now let users display their Live Photos on the web.” If you’re not a developer, the takeaway from all of this basically means that in the future, there might be more apps or websites that will support the displaying of your Live Photos, so the feature won’t feel quite as exclusive anymore.

The bands themselves were nothing special save for their design which offered up a slightly more sporty look. Now if you did like that look, you might be interested to learn that Nike is back with a new limited edition design in the form of the Apple Watch NikeLab. According to Nike, “Today, the long-standing partnership continues with NikeLab — the company’s collaborative innovation platform — through the launch of Apple Watch NikeLab. […] Apple Watch NikeLab is the ultimate style companion for those with a passion for running, whether emerging runners or marathon veterans.” Note that the only difference here would be its band as the watch will pretty much maintain the same features as before, so don’t expect anything different other than its aesthetics. In terms of availability, the Apple Watch NikeLab is expected to be launched in a week and will be available via Nike’s website, NikeLab stores, or through Apple at a Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan. As we mentioned it is limited edition so you might want to move quickly if you hope to get your hands on it. Filed in Apple >Gadgets. Read more about Apple Watch, nike, Smartwatch and Wearable Tech.

Apple, which already powers 96 percent of its facilities with renewable energy, has a new environmental goal: to one day build all its gadgets using only recycled materials. The Cupertino tech giant in its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, released today, said it aims to have a "closed-loop" supply chain, "where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material." "Traditional supply chains are linear," Apple explained. "Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use." Apple wants to change that, and instead break down old gadgets and use the scrap to build new products. "We're also challenging ourselves to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," Apple wrote. Those are lofty goals, which Apple admittedly isn't 100 percent sure how to accomplish. "We're actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we've completely figured out how to do it," Apple's Vice President of environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, told VICE News. "So we're a little nervous, but we also think it's really important, because as a sector we believe it's where technology should be going." Related How to Recycle Your Technology How to Recycle Your Technology Apple's goal will "require many years of collaboration across multiple Apple teams, our suppliers, and specialty recyclers," the report says. To start, Cupertino is encouraging customers to recycle their old devices through its Renew program, which lets you trade in your old Apple devices to be refurbished for resale or recycled. Apple also touted the its disassembling robot Liam, which it introduced last year. Liam "can quickly disassemble iPhone 6, sorting its high-quality components with the goal of reducing the need to mine more resources from the earth," Apple says. Apple has already been melting down the aluminum enclosures Liam recovered from iPhone 6, and reused the material to create Mac mini computers the company uses internally. "We wanted to show it was possible to use our own scrap to build new products," Apple wrote. "Now we're looking for opportunities to expand this pilot."

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 21 April 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Apple is making iWork, iMovie and Garage Band freely available to everyone The iWork suite includes Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (presentations). — Apple The iWork, iMovie, and Garage Band apps (office, video editing and music tools) were already provided free to all new Mac, iPhone or iPad owners, and are now available free for download to anyone with a device that runs macOS or iOS.  Since 2013, new owners of a Mac, iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch have been entitled to various Apple apps free of charge. However, they had to be paid for on the App Store and the Mac App Store by anyone who wanted to download them onto other older or second-hand devices.  iWork, iMovie and Garage Band are now free of charge for any user of an Apple device. Note, however, that iWork, iMovie et Garage Band require at least macOS 10.12 or iOS 10 to operate.  Apple is hoping to convince more students and companies to change over to its productivity suite which competes with Microsoft Office. Note that the iWork suite is also available online via iCloud, and can be used on any Apple device by connecting to iCloud with an Apple ID. — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Xiaomi’s preparing to make a comeback with latest marquee phone China's Bitauto unit raises US$1bil from Internet giants Tencent, Baidu Messaging app said to be used in White House does not work: lawsuit Zuckerberg vows work to prevent next ‘Facebook killer’ How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Police officer killed, another wounded in Paris shooting Reaching out to orang asli children Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas advertisement Latest News Messaging app said to be used in White House does not work: lawsuit Spotify ensures independent artistes are on board with fresh deal Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Most Viewed in Tech Uber extends sexual harassment probe; expects report by end-May Robots, chefs hope to bring invasive lion fish to restaurants near you Uber could face higher licence fees in London under new proposals German chancellery investigated in probe into WikiLeaks sources Lufthansa, Air France departures briefly hit by computer outage Xiaomi’s preparing to make a comeback with latest marquee phone Alibaba backs decision to add videogames to ‘Asia Olympics’ Tinder survey unveils naked truths about Millennial dating The biggest time suck at the office might be your computer Experts say automated accounts sharing fake news ahead of French election Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Here’s what’s been making our iPhone smartwatch tick. The Apple Watch is now being superseded by the Apple Watch 2. These much-hyped smartwatches are now finally seeing their true potential through apps and games this year following the Watch OS 3 launch. I think the main reason here is that it’s a brand new product category. So, while it’s one of the best smartwatch options out there, it’s still in “learning mode.” Here you go, without further ado, here’s our best Apple Watch apps list this 2017! Best Apple Watch Apps in 2017 Runkeeper Runkeeper is a long-time favorite of healthy enthusiasts. It is a snazzy Apple Watch app that communicates happily with your iPhone that provides updates on your current progress as you run your way around the city. If you’ve got an Apple Watch Series 2, you can turn off Run With Phone and this app will use your wearable’s GPS to build a map of your journey. This is also good for checking out routes of successful runs. Download Runkeeper Sleep++ While most Apple Watch apps were designed to feed you information while you’re awake. Sleep++ is the complete opposite as it grabs information while you’re sleeping. Sleep++ is designed to track your motion while you’re snoozing, thereby figuring out how restless you are – and when. If it turns out you’re always rolling about at 1AM, it might be worth seeing if your friend’s performing impromptu guitar lead solos around that time. With watchOS 3’s Background Refresh, Sleep++ is now more responsive when you wake. This allows it to immediately analyze your last night’s sleep. Download Sleep++ Productive Productive is a basic companion designed to help you build good habits. This app then builds daily schedules, split into morning, afternoon and evening. On launch, it’ll switch to the relevant list, allowing you to check through your schedule.  If you’re done with a specific task, tap done and wear a smug grin. If you don’t want to do anything, simply tap skip and perfect your guilty face for a bit. Download Productive Just Press Record Just Press Record was developed to make capturing voice memos insanely simple. This app starts off as a microphone button. Press it to start recording, and once you’re done, the recording lurks on your Apple Watch until it next connects to your iPhone. Easy.

Excess heat generated by the data center will be captured and returned to the local district's heating system, which will warm up homes in the community. The data center in the Jutland region will be partly powered by recycling waste products from farms. Apple is working with Aarhus University on a system that passes agricultural waste through a digester to generate methane, which is then used to power the data center. The digester reaction turns some of the waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer, which Apple returns to local farmers to use on their fields. It's a "mutually beneficial relationship," Apple said in its environment report for 2016, released this week. The data center in Denmark will be fully powered by renewable energy and won't put stress on the local grid, Apple said. Apple is also building a data center in Athenry, Ireland, that will be powered by energy generated by ocean waves. The iPhone maker is supporting the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to develop the new source of energy, the company said. Apple's making a major push to be one of the greenest companies on the planet. It's new corporate headquarters in Cupertino, called Apple Park, will run on renewable energy. The company has cut its use of toxic materials and is also using more recycled materials in its products and packaging. Apple's commitment to renewable energy was applauded by activist organization Greenpeace. Samsung, Huawei, and Microsoft now need to catch up, the organization said. Siri, iMessage and other cloud-based applications are processed at Apple's data centers. The company has five data centers in the U.S., which are all powered by renewable energy. The two new data centers in Europe are expected to come online this year. The company is spending about US$1.8 billion to build the two data centers. Apple also uses colocation facilities worldwide depending on the capacity it needs. All of Apple's data centers are operated on renewable energy, and that's a goal Apple is chasing for all its facilities. About 96 percent of Apple's facilities worldwide are now run on renewable energy, the company said. Data centers tend to be the most power hungry tech facilities, and electricity requirements go up as computing moves into the cloud. As servers are saddled with more tasks, the processing requirements go up. As a result, more heat is generated, and Apple has found an innovative way to recycle heat. Many data centers find ways to recycle heat, while others let the resource go waste. Amazon recycles heat to warm up offices nearby, and other companies recycle the heat to generate hot water. Iceland and the Scandinavian countries are hot spots to establish data centers because of naturally cool weather and easy availability of hydropower.

We only know this because in two instances, Apple employees were left injured after testing the prototype. Don't Miss: Verizon is losing customers like crazy, even with unlimited data plans The document leaked to Gizmodo is an incident report on workplace injures, compiled for Apple by an independent contractor. The report details a number of accidents that could be linked to new products Apple is testing, including a face-mounted AR or VR system, and possibly a minivan linked to an Apple project. The report details two injuries related to a prototype that sounds like it has a lot to do with augmented reality: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” In another report, an employee working at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain on March 2. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” A source inside Apple speculated that this injury may have something to do with an augmented reality product Apple may be testing, something like glasses with an overhead display. Laser flashes and “eye pain associated with use” all sound like some kind of head-mounted display, like the ill-fated Google Glass. The fact that the prototype had a magenta housing also points it towards being a piece of wearable technology. The only thing that Apple has gone out of its way to make colorful is its other wearable, the Apple Watch. Apple has been linked to some kind of augmented reality project for a long time. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly said that he thinks AR will be more interesting than VR, and numerous reports have suggested that Apple has been working on a prototype for some time now. The leaked report also detailed an incident where a company-owned minivan turned into a crosswalk and hit an Apple employee. It’s possible that the minivan is something to do with Apple’s long-rumored self-driving car program, or it could also be collecting mapping data for Apple Maps.

At launch, the feature was limited to Baltimore, Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Sydney, Toronto, and over 300 cities in China. Since then, Apple has been working to expand support for public transportation to other cities around the world. Newer additions include Atlanta, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Houston, Kansas City, Manchester, Melbourne, Miami, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Montréal, New Orleans, Portland, Pittsburgh, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, and Vancouver, B.C. Now, there is evidence to suggest that Apple Maps will soon support transit directions in several other cities around the world. MacRumors reader Bernd Keuning, who keeps close tabs on Apple Maps and has been a reliable tipster, believes that we might soon see transit directions enabled in the following cities and countries, as station outlines visible on the map in each area have increased significantly in the past few weeks: Adelaide, Australia Perth, Australia German states of Hamburg, Bremen, Niedersachsen, and Schleswig-Holstein Las Vegas, NV Madrid The Netherlands Paris Phoenix, AZ Rome Singapore Taiwan Keuning also expects Apple Maps to eventually support transit directions in the following cities in the United States and Canada, but it might take longer for the feature to expand to these areas, as only a single or handful of red station outlines have been added over the past few weeks in most of these locations: Albuquerque, NM Buffalo, NY Calgary, Alberta Edmonton, Alberta Orlando, FL Ottawa, Ontario Nashville, TN Norfolk, VA St. Louis, MO Tucson, AZApple Maps typically adds station outlines to a city shortly before expanding support for transit directions to the area. MacRumors has verified that each city listed above does have at least one station outline in Apple Maps. Keuning believes that the first areas to support Transit in Apple Maps next could include Adelaide, including at least all services from Adelaide Metro and Great Southern Rail intercity service to Melbourne, and the Netherlands, including international trains to Brussel, Berlin, Frankfurt, and possibly Paris. Google Maps has offered wider support for transit directions for quite some time, but it's nice to see Apple Maps catching up with careful consideration. A complete list of cities that support Transit in Apple Maps is available on the iOS Feature Availability page of Apple's website.

(Even still, I'll just use TransitApp for bus times.) Rating: 2 Votes Jumeira 7 hours ago at 05:27 pm If this the case, I also think Dubai will be included as well, after reading the article I launched the Apple map to check if the metro stations are included, and they are finally here! but the information provided by foursquare! We still don't have the navigation from apple maps, it will be great if it will work! Rating: 2 Votes verniesgarden 7 hours ago at 04:47 pm well if they have one line for stlouis then they are done! that's the public transit we have! Rating: 2 Votes Terrinb 7 hours ago at 05:16 pm This is exciting stuff. I hope Apple has some other features in the works. For instance, Why doesn't the app let me know when I'm speeding? Currently I run Waze and Apple Maps at the same time. I run Waze in the background to let me know when I'm speeding and when there's traffic concerns. I use Apple Maps to give me directions because I think it does a better job at correcting for traffic conditions and getting me to where I'm going. Rating: 1 Votes bluespark 4 hours ago at 07:41 pm Great to hear. I live in a city that has full Apple Maps transit support and it's excellent. While the launch of Apple Maps was a true debacle and it still isn't as up-to-date as Google, I really like the interface and it works well where I am. It has become my map app of choice on the strength of the interface.

Google Home will recognize each user’s voice, and deliver customized results accordingly. This is a feature Google Home devotees have been requesting since day one, and Google has finally acquiesced. Google Home is, for the uninitiated, a smart home speaker similar to the Amazon Echo. The two are currently embroiled in a battle for control of the smart home market, although Apple is rumored to be working on its own competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor Amazon Echo vs. Google Home vs. Apple's Competitor In this article, you'll learn the differences between the Amazon Echo and Google Home.

Recognizing Multiple Users By Voice Alone The latest addition to Google Home’s growing skillset is support for multiple users. Starting today, your Google Home speaker can be made to remember six different users, and differentiate them by voice alone. Each user can then customize their Google Home experience to suit them. To make use of support for multiple users you’ll need to do the following. First, make sure you have the latest version of the Google Home app. Then look for the card which says “multi-user is available”. If you don’t see the card, click on the icon in the top-right, and find your Google Home from the list of connected devices. Then, click, “Link your account”. After this it’s just a matter of teaching your Google Home to recognize your voice. To accomplish this you’ll need to repeat the phrases “OK Google” and “Hey Google” several times apiece. A neural network will analyze your voice, and be able to recognize you from then on. A Clear Advantage Over the Competition Support for multiple users is available from today in the U.S., and set to arrive in the UK in the coming months.

William Clay Ford Jr used his visit to the company's roots in West Cork yesterday to address Apple's decision this week to begin testing driver-less 'autonomous' vehicles of the future. "We would rather be friends, but we are willing to punch it out if we have to," declared the Executive Chairman of Ford Motor Company. It's an intriguing battle that pits the two big beasts of Cork's industrial jungle past and present. Ford employed 7,000 in Cork at one stage in the 20th century, while Apple is the city's biggest employer in the 21st century. However, Mr Ford, great-grandson of his company's founder, Henry Ford, also didn't rule out linking up with Apple as companies around the world race to develop autonomous vehicle technology. "We are willing to take on all comers," he said. "But there is an equal possibility these competitors could become collaborators. The scenario has yet to play out. "We will see lots of alliances, we may compete with them on one front and co-operate on another. I don't rule anything out. "One thing is for sure, we are here for the duration." Speaking as he and his family visited the Ballinascarthy homestead where Henry Ford's father was born to mark the centenary of the company in Ireland, William also addressed the two great economic challenges for Ireland - Brexit and the Donald Trump administration. Regarding the new US President, he said: "One thing the President really does believe in is creating jobs for Americans." However, he said that was not "a zero sum game" - an American term indicating this did not have to mean a jobs deficit in other countries. He added: "I talk personally with the Trump administration and have been very impressed with their willingness to listen and to get our input." However, Mr Ford admitted that Brexit was "concerning" and "on balance, would not be good" for his company. "It has an impact on our business and to the extent that it inhibits free trade, that's not a good thing," he said. "Free trade is where we all need to work towards. "We live in an inter-connected world, we at Ford manufacture all around the world, we sell all around the world and have suppliers from all around the world. We can't unscramble the egg." However, showing that his position as head of a global motoring company did not obscure his family ties, Mr Ford added: "Our family here are farmers and Brexit is having an immediate impact on that through currency change. "But Ford Motor Company is 114 years old and we've been through so many taxation regimes and we not only survive, we thrive." Mr Ford, 59, is due to address an audience at UCC this morning as part of his two-day visit, discussing the way ahead for the motoring industry. He said this would involve designing autonomous and electric vehicles together. "Autonomous vehicles will make people's lives better," he said, "they will free up traffic and stop pollution. "But people ask me what year will we see it and we just don't know yet. "People get enthralled by technology but we need to take a step back and ask how is this technology helping people? We don't have all the answers to that yet." READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS ireland, ford.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S8, and Galaxy S8+ are four of the best smartphones money can buy. From their excellent cameras, to their speed, to their beautiful displays, these devices have it all. Close to it anyway. These days though it can be hard to tell the iPhone and Galaxy S apart, particularly for those that aren’t plugged into the world of smartphones. While the hardware lines are blurred, there are some key differences that you must consider before you commit to one or the other. Today we want to walk you through some basics to keep in the back of your mind as you try and make up your mind. These tips aren’t aimed at hardcore Android or iOS users. These are focused on those of you that don’t possess any brand loyalty and are simply in the market for the best device, for the right price, to suit your needs. Software Support Software support is one of the key differences between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus vs. Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8: Software support. If you’ve owned, or currently own, an iPhone or Galaxy S you probably know where we’re going with this. Let’s start with Apple and the iPhone. Apple is in complete control of the iOS software that powers the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Carriers have some input but ultimately it decides what to put on its software updates. It also decides how and when to roll software updates out to its mobile devices. So what does this mean for the end user (you)? It means the iPhone doesn’t have any carrier bloatware. It means you can test beta software ahead of time. It means you get rapid fire iOS updates with bug fixes and security patches. It means your device is constantly updated with new features and tweaks. It also makes predicting when you’ll get your next big software release easy. Apple is predictable in that it announces new software in the summer, releases a beta, and then releases the new iOS update in the fall alongside a new iPhone. All iPhone users get the new iOS software at the same time. You also know that Apple will keep your device supported for a long stretch of time. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are new and should be supported for at least three to four more years before they’re kicked to the curb. Compare this to Samsung. While things have improved over the year, Samsung’s software support still isn’t on par with Apple’s. And this is something to consider if you hate bugs, love getting new software features, and/or plan to keep your device for a long time. Samsung, in some ways, is still at the mercy of Google and its carrier partners. What does this mean for you? It means the Galaxy S8 comes with annoying carrier bloatware. Some can be removed, others can’t and will just sit there taking up space on your screen/internal storage. It means big Android releases for the Galaxy S8 will be unpredictable. Google is planning to announce more Android O details at Google I/O in May ahead of a probable release this fall but it won’t talk about Samsung’s plans for the new operating system. It’ll probably be awhile before you hear anything concrete about the Galaxy S8 Android O update. Samsung’s typically months behind Google’s roll out. Case in point: The Galaxy S7 and Android 7.0 Nougat. Android 7.0 Nougat rolled out to Nexus devices in August. The first Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat update landed in January. It’s also worth noting that the Galaxy S7 isn’t running Android 7.1.1 (released in late 2016) or Android 7.1.2 Nougat (released by Google in April). It means Galaxy S8 bug fix updates will be sporadic and unpredictable. You could go long stretches without seeing receiving key bug fixers from Samsung and your carrier. Samsung and its partners will roll out monthly security updates but these patches typically don’t come with bug fixes. And then there’s the longevity of Galaxy S devices. With Apple, again, you typically get four years of software support before your device gets cut off. With Samsung, its typically two, three if you’re really lucky. Take the Galaxy S5, Samsung’s most popular device in the United States. It was released in 2014 (same year as the iPhone 6) and it probably won’t get Nougat. And while its still getting bug fix updates and security patches, we expect support to slow as Samsung and carriers focus on more pressing matters (Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, newer devices). Storage With the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple changed up how it handles storage. They still don’t feature expandable storage but there’s more internal space for photos, videos, and applications. The 64GB iPhone is no more. Instead, Apple and its partners offer 32GB (cheapest), 128GB (same price as 64GB in years past), and 256GB of internal storage. Of course, you don’t actually get 32GB, 128GB or 256GB of storage. Apple’s software requires some space to operate. For instance, on a 32GB iPhone 7, you’ll probably only get 25GB of space with which to work. That won’t be a problem for some people but you’d be surprised how quickly that space can fill up. You’ll also get 5GB of free iCloud storage before you have to start shelling out real cash to Apple for additional space on the cloud. 5GB isn’t much either. Samsung also offers a cloud solution, Samsung Cloud, but it’s not as vital as iCloud. This is because the Galaxy S8 features expandable storage. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ come with 64GB of internal storage. There are not other storage options. This might seem like a problem but it’s not when you consider that you can buy a cheap microSD cards to expand your storage up to 256GB. That’s a mind-boggling amount of space for $20. So this is something to keep in mind as you decide which to buy. If you typically find yourself scrounging for free space on your device, you might take a closer look at the Galaxy S8 and the peace of mind it could deliver. Price The Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 are the new guys in town but that doesn’t mean they’re more expensive than the seven month old iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus. Samsung’s flagship devices cost about the same at America’s most popular carriers, AT&T and Verizon. AT&T iPhone 7 32GB Monthly: $21.67/mo Full Price: $649.99 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB Monthly: $25.67/mo Full Price: $769.99 Samsung Galaxy S8 Monthly: $25/mo Full Price: $749.99 Samsung Galaxy S8+ Monthly: $28.34/mo Full Price: $849.99 Verizon iPhone 7 32GB Monthly: $27.08/mo Full Price: $649.99 iPhone 7 Plus 32GB Monthly: $32.08/mo Full Price: $769.99 Samsung Galaxy S8 Monthly: $30/mo Full Price: $720 Samsung Galaxy S8+ Monthly: $35/mo Full Price: $840 So what should you take away from these numbers? Both of these phones are expensive. You have to pay up if you want the latest and greatest features. If these prices are too much for your blood, consider the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge or the iPhone 6s/iPhone 6s Plus. They’re a year old but they’re still excellent devices. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are actually a little cheaper at Verizon even though the monthly payments are larger. iPhone vs. Android The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ run Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat with the Samsung Experience (formerly known as TouchWiz) on top. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus run Apple’s iOS 10 operating system. More specifically, they run iOS 10.3.1. If you trying to decide between the iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8 you’ll want to get acclimated to both of these operating systems before you buy. All of these phones come with powerful hardware so it’ll be the software, and your comfort level with that software, that helps to separate one device from the rest of the pack. There are also some key differences between iPhone and Android you’ll want to be aware of. For instance, Android doesn’t have a unified messaging experience like Apple’s iMessage service. Read about the differences between iPhone vs. Android but make sure to go hands-on with the software before you make a final decision. Moving from one device/operating system is easier than ever. If you own an Android device you might be thinking about how hard it will be to transfer all of your data over to the iPhone 7 or iPhone. Same goes for you iPhone users. This might seem daunting but don’t let it influence your decision. It’s actually very easy to make the switch. Both Apple and Samsung make it simple to switch from Android to iPhone and vice versa. Samsung offers its Samsung Smart Switch service and Apple has its Move to iOS app that takes you step-by-step through the process. Galaxy S8 Fingerprint Sensor We remember the days when you used to have to enter a PIN or a password to unlock an iPhone or a Galaxy S. These days, smartphones are smart enough to unlock with a fingerprint. The fingerprint sensors on the iPhone 7 (known as Touch ID) and Galaxy S8 are important for security but they also make opening the device and paying for items through Samsung Pay and Apple Pay much more convenient. The iPhone 7’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor isn’t perfect but it’s not considered to be a detriment like the Galaxy S8’s fingerprint sensor. The Samsung Galaxy S8’s sensor is located on the back of the device and its has been widely panned in reviews from around the web. Even Android-centric sites hate it. In our brief experience, its awkward placement can make it hard to unlock with your index finger leading to longer unlock times. Your finger also might gravitate to the camera sensor which is placed right next to the sensor. This isn’t a feature you’ll use once or twice a day. This is a feature you could use 100+ times a day. It’s important. Unfortunately, this isn’t something Samsung can fix with a software update and it’s a change you’ll really want to see for yourself before you commit to one device or the other. 3 Reasons Not to Install Galaxy S7 Nougat & 7 Reasons You Should Install Nougat If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 Let's start with some basics. If you value your security, and most of you probably do, you'll want to think about installing the Galaxy S7 Nougat update soon after it arrives for your device.  Every month, Google and Samsung release important security patches for Android devices. The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Android Nougat updates should bring the latest security patches to your device. Samsung's initial batch of Galaxy S7 Nougat updates delivered the company's January security update while upcoming updates could deliver the patches from the February security update. You can read more about their contents on Samsung's website.  If you failed to download or receive an older security update (December, November, etc), the patches from those updates might be baked into your version of Nougat. If not, you might be forced to install them manually before you can download Nougat.  On top of the patches, Samsung's Galaxy S7 Nougat update brings Samsung Pass, a way to secure your identity using biometric data rather than entering your password or ID.  Samsung Pass is like a master key for your various logins and it relies on Galaxy S7's fingerprint scanner. The biometric data is encrypted and stored safely by Samsung Knox.   1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Mastercard The Government Is Clueless About eBay And Online Retail Leaked Document Details Apple Employee Injuries, Hints At Secretive New Products William Turton Apr 21, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple Share An incident report compiled by an Environment Health and Safety contractor working for Apple mistakenly sent to hundreds of Apple employees and leaked to Gizmodo includes tantalising clues about some of the new products the notoriously secretive tech company may be cooking up. The report includes over 70 different incidents. Image: AP The report, sent out on April 14, is titled "Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month", and contains everything from inconsequential reports from employees after running into a door, all the way up to people seeking medical attention after testing new Apple products. The report includes information on the date and location of the incidents — which range from reports of workplace hazards like spills and fires to injuries sustained while on campus — and the level of care provided to the injured person, if any was required. Many of the incidents detail common workplace injuries. For example, on March 1 at 6:44PM an employee working in building 4 of Apple's Infinite Loop campus (presumably working within Caffè Macs, Apple's posh cafeteria for employees) burned his hand pulling fish out of the oven. Or when an employee working at Apple's Arques office in Sunnyvale on March 14 reported "feeling lightheaded, had difficulty seeing clearly, could not stand. She mentioned feeling stressed." Another incident, on March 29 at Apple's Bandley 5 office in Cupertino, involved an employee dealing with a "hazardous material". "Employee was opening a box of used Apple Pencils in [room number redacted]. As soon as she opened the box, a strong odor emanated from within the box. The employee, who is familiar with lithium battery odours, identified two Pencils as the odor source. She suspected the Pencils were leaking electrolytes." Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. This document lacks a lot of context, and the vague mentions of Apple prototypes jives with the company's cult-like methods for keeping products under wraps. Even then, the incidents reports can be revealing, so we'll let you make you own assumptions. It seems some of the incidents listed within this report may hint at new products Apple may be working on. One report on February 21 that included "medical treatment beyond first aid" involved a prototype unit at Apple's De Anza office in Cupertino. "After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis." In another report, an employee working at Apple's Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain on March 2. "Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with." A source inside Apple speculated that this injury may have something to do with an augmented reality product Apple may be testing, something like glasses with an overhead display. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he thinks augmented reality will be a pretty big deal. Further, on March 10, an employee on the Apple Watch team injured his knee while skiing. "Watch EE team has two days ski trip (3/10-3/11) to Tahoe area to help collect core motion data for skiing/boarding activity tracking. It's also part of team building activity. Employee has participated in the activity and had an injury on his knee." We asked Apple if it plans to add skiing and snowboarding as tracked activities to its Workout app but have not heard back. In one incident that required medical treatment beyond first aid, an Apple employee was struck by a company minivan on March 21. A source inside Apple speculates this may have been one of Apple's minivans designed to collect data for its Maps product. "Minivan 82 (CA licence plate #REDACTED) turned left leaving the [Vallco Parkway] parking lot and struck a pedestrian (Apple employee) crossing the footpath from the opposite direction (at the intersection of Vallco parkway and Main Street Drive Garage Parkway.) The crosswalk signal was white, the van turned on a green light. When the van struck the employee, he fell back several feet; he suffered minor injuries." On March 7 at Apple's Forge office in Cupertino, an employee suffered a swollen toe after doing some testing. "Employee was preforming a testing in our chamber when the [sic] dropped a heavy object on this toe. At that time, he didn't feel was a big deal, he continued to finish his testing. He just reported to me that is toe is now swollen." WATCH MORE: Science & Health News Comments backfromthedead @backfromthedead Apr 21, 2017, 8:36am Battery powered pencils ?

Mastercard The Government Is Clueless About eBay And Online Retail Turn Your Expensive Smartphone Into A Tiny Antiquated Macintosh Andrew Liszewski Apr 21, 2017, 7:30am ⋅ Filed to:  apple apple macintosh computers elago iphone m4 macintosh nostalgia Share After releasing a stand that turned the Apple Watch into a miniature Macintosh computer to sit on your bedside table while it charges, Elago has now essentially done the same thing for your iPhone with its M4 stand, which lets your phone cosplay as a vintage Apple computer that's woefully underpowered in comparison. Dressing up your iPhone 6 or 7 is as easy as sliding your smartphone into this make-believe silicone Macintosh, which props your device up for hands-free use. If you want to use a matching vintage Apple keyboard with it, however, you might be out of luck unless it's been hacked and upgraded with wireless Bluetooth functionality, which simply didn't exist way back in 1984. While your iPhone is dressed up as a classic Macintosh computer, you'll still have easy access to its home button, but adjusting the volume is a bit more complicated, requiring you to stick your fingers into an opening on the underside to reach those buttons. As for the lock switch on the other side? That seems completely inaccessible, unfortunately. Available now for $US30 ($40) in beige or black, it's cheaper than buying and gutting a real Macintosh computer on eBay if you've got a nostalgic itch. However, if you also want to run the classic Mac OS on your mobile device for authenticity's sake, you'll have a far easier time emulating it on an Android smartphone instead.

Excess heat generated by the data center will be captured and returned to the local district's heating system, which will warm up homes in the community. The data center in the Jutland region will be partly powered by recycling waste products from farms. Apple is working with Aarhus University on a system that passes agricultural waste through a digester to generate methane, which is then used to power the data center. The digester reaction turns some of the waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer, which Apple returns to local farmers to use on their fields. It's a "mutually beneficial relationship," Apple said in its environment report for 2016, released this week. The data center in Denmark will be fully powered by renewable energy and won't put stress on the local grid, Apple said. Apple is also building a data center in Athenry, Ireland, that will be powered by energy generated by ocean waves. The iPhone maker is supporting the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to develop the new source of energy, the company said. Apple's making a major push to be one of the greenest companies on the planet. It's new corporate headquarters in Cupertino, called Apple Park, will run on renewable energy. The company has cut its use of toxic materials and is also using more recycled materials in its products and packaging. Apple's commitment to renewable energy was applauded by activist organization Greenpeace. Samsung, Huawei, and Microsoft now need to catch up, the organization said. Siri, iMessage and other cloud-based applications are processed at Apple's data centers. The company has five data centers in the U.S., which are all powered by renewable energy. The two new data centers in Europe are expected to come online this year. The company is spending about US$1.8 billion to build the two data centers. Apple also uses colocation facilities worldwide depending on the capacity it needs. All of Apple's data centers are operated on renewable energy, and that's a goal Apple is chasing for all its facilities. About 96 percent of Apple's facilities worldwide are now run on renewable energy, the company said. Data centers tend to be the most power hungry tech facilities, and electricity requirements go up as computing moves into the cloud. As servers are saddled with more tasks, the processing requirements go up. As a result, more heat is generated, and Apple has found an innovative way to recycle heat. Many data centers find ways to recycle heat, while others let the resource go waste. Amazon recycles heat to warm up offices nearby, and other companies recycle the heat to generate hot water. Iceland and the Scandinavian countries are hot spots to establish data centers because of naturally cool weather and easy availability of hydropower. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple's new commitment to closed-loop supply chain will one day mean no more mining to create iPhones By Brad Moon, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 20, 2017, 8:40 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit Source: Shutterstock     Popular Posts: Apple Inc. (AAPL) Rumor Points to Multi-User Support for iOS 11 Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones F8 Conference: Facebook Inc (FB) Bets Big on AR Recent Posts: Apple Inc. Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) F8 Conference: Facebook Inc (FB) Bets Big on AR View All Posts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn’t just the world’s most valuable company — it’s well on its way to being the greenest as well. In the lead-up to Earth Day 2017, Apple released its 2017 Environmental Sustainability progress report. The company continues to make progress in its goals, including the use of renewable power for its own facilities as well as by its suppliers. And it added a lofty new pledge to the list: Apple says it is pursuing a “closed-loop supply chain” that would see it cease mining and instead build all of its products entirely from recycled materials. But it’s still not big on having an iPhone last more than three years of practical life, or having you fix it yourself. Apple Continues to Lead Green Technology Companies Apple has built a reputation as a green technology company. In 2012, it committed to transitioning to 100% renewable energy and has increasingly emphasized environmental sustainability in its products and packaging. In 2017, Greenpeace named Apple the most environmentally friendly major technology company — a title it has held for three years straight. Other major tech players like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) score well in many areas, but AAPL continues to lead the pack. The company released the 2017 update to its annual Environmental Sustainability report, showing just how much progress it has made. Source: Apple Apple wants to keep up its role as one of the planet’s greenest tech companies. 2017 Environmental Sustainability Progress Report With Earth Day coming this weekend, Apple’s progress report release was timely. It shows a company that continues to push green technology and environmental sustainability at a massive scale. Two primary areas — transitioning partners onto renewable energy and the new goal of implementing a closed-loop supply chain — remain a work in progress. But otherwise, the report shows the company continues to make great strides. Among the milestones achieved in the past year: 100% of electricity used by Apple’s data centers and 96% of power used by its facilities worldwide comes from renewable energy (primarily solar, wind and hydro) Working with suppliers to bring 4 gigawatts of renewable energy online by 2020 (with around 750 megawatts currently operational and 2 gigawatts committed) 99% of Apple packaging is recycled or responsibly sourced from sustainable forests (iPhone 7 boxes made from a mix of responsibly sourced paper, bamboo and waste sugarcane) Use of laser-induced breakdown spectrometers to ensure materials used in products are safe Moving to a Closed-Loop Supply Chain Right now, the biggest knock against technology companies like Apple is the massive mining operations needed to supply raw materials — aluminum, copper, lithium and other elements. Mines are an environmental nightmare, they’re dangerous for workers and they’re often located in conflict regions. To solve this part of the equation, Apple is now committing to a closed-loop supply chain. This means using high-quality recycled materials — and even harvesting components from old AAPL products — instead of mining. A recycled iPhone, in other words. Source: Yanki01 via Flickr (Modified) Can Apple make a recycled iPhone? This goal is further in the future, but it’s something Apple says it is moving toward. What the company won’t do in the name of green technology is build an iPhone with an extended useful life, or one that users can repair themselves instead of having to take it to an Apple Store. Apple’s VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives gave an interview with Vice to discuss the company’s environmental sustainability initiatives. She talked up the closed-loop supply chain commitment, noting that it would also let AAPL certify its products as being “conflict-free.” However, she stopped short at the idea of an iPhone having a useful life of beyond three years and deflected the proposal of designing smartphones so customers could undertake basic repairs (like replacing a dead iPhone battery) by themselves. “I think trying to pretend that we can sort of make it easy to repair the product, and that you get the product that you think you’re buying — that you want — isn’t the answer.” Son’t expect iPhone owners to be able to swap out that cracked screen themselves any time soon. However, Apple fans can take heart in the fact that they’re buying from the world’s most environmentally friendly tech company. And someday, they will be able to buy a recycled iPhone, thanks to Apple’s new commitment to pursuing a closed-loop supply chain. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

MacStories, which first spotted Apple’s notification, explains that Apple Watch owners are being challenged to complete at least half an hour workout on Saturday to earn a new medal in the Activity app and unlock special iMessage stickers. “Get outside and celebrate Earth Day on April 22 and earn this award,” reads a message in the Activity app on iPhone and Apple Watch. Apple wants you to go for a walk, run, cycle, wheelchair or swim workout of 30 minutes or more in the Workout app or in any third-party app that writes workouts to Health. Do that and you will earn the special award in the Activity app and unlock iMessage stickers for the Messages app. This is Apple’s third special activity challenge. The first challenge was issued was for Thanksgiving, but it was U.S. only. Then, ahead of the start of 2017, the company challenged Apple Watch wearers to close all three Activity rings each day for an entire week in January to bag a special “Ring in The New Year” medal and unlock a few new iMessages stickers.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 20, 2017 9:35 pm UTC Enlarge / In the future, parts from old iPhones could be used to build new ones. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 57 Share this story Further ReadingApple’s new spaceship campus gets a name, lifts off in April Today Apple released its Environmental Responsibility Report (PDF) for the 2016 fiscal year, detailing the progress of the company's environmental initiatives and laying out some of its goals for the future. Apple remains committed to reducing its carbon footprint (down 23 percent from 2015), pushing its suppliers to use renewable energy (96 percent of Apple's own global facilities are renewable energy-powered), investing in wind and solar power, and in reducing the energy used to create its products and the energy the products themselves use. The report also talks at length about Apple Park (née spaceship), which it calls "the greenest corporate headquarters on the planet." The most interesting of Apple's goals for the future is a stated desire to manufacture 100 percent of its devices out of recycled materials rather than mining new materials and throwing out used materials. Apple calls this a "closed loop supply chain." Enlarge / A simple visualization of Apple's "closed loop." Apple The day that aspiration becomes reality may yet be far in the future, though. Apple has started some pilot projects, including using aluminum reclaimed from old iPhone 6 models to make Mac Minis for iPhone assembly lines, and using 100 percent recycled tin in logic boards for the iPhone 6S. Scale is the primary challenge. Apple's "Liam" robots, used to dismantle phones and sort their components to increase the number and quality of components that can be reclaimed, are currently capable of dismantling 2.4 million phones a year, a number far, far lower than what Apple sells. For aluminum in particular (probably Apple's single most-used material across all its product lines), the company says it's important that Apple's own high-quality aluminum not be mixed in with lower-quality scrap aluminum during the recycling process, as is currently common practice at recycling facilities. The "closed loop" project is probably the most immediately interesting of Apple's long-term initiatives, but the full report is worth a read if you're interested in Apple's energy production and water use, how it sources paper and reduces the amount of packaging material it uses, and how it attempts to cut down on waste by building more durable components that last longer.

Apple will return heat generated by data center to warm up homes A new Apple data center being built in Denmark is focused on returning to the community Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 21 April, 2017 06:53 0 - - - - print email Apple is building a new data center in Denmark, and it has some interesting ideas on how to power the data center with renewable energy, while also giving back to the community. Excess heat generated by the data center will be captured and returned to the local district's heating system, which will warm up homes in the community. The data center in the Jutland region will be partly powered by recycling waste products from farms. Apple is working with Aarhus University on a system that passes agricultural waste through a digester to generate methane, which is then used to power the data center. The digester reaction turns some of the waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer, which Apple returns to local farmers to use on their fields. It's a "mutually beneficial relationship," Apple said in its environment report for 2016, released this week. The data center in Denmark will be fully powered by renewable energy and won't put stress on the local grid, Apple said. Apple is also building a data center in Athenry, Ireland, that will be powered by energy generated by ocean waves. The iPhone maker is supporting the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to develop the new source of energy, the company said. Apple's making a major push to be one of the greenest companies on the planet. It's new corporate headquarters in Cupertino, called Apple Park, will run on renewable energy. The company has cut its use of toxic materials and is also using more recycled materials in its products and packaging. Apple's commitment to renewable energy was applauded by activist organization Greenpeace. Samsung, Huawei, and Microsoft now need to catch up, the organization said. Siri, iMessage and other cloud-based applications are processed at Apple's data centers. The company has five data centers in the U.S., which are all powered by renewable energy. The two new data centers in Europe are expected to come online this year. The company is spending about US$1.8 billion to build the two data centers. Apple also uses colocation facilities worldwide depending on the capacity it needs. All of Apple's data centers are operated on renewable energy, and that's a goal Apple is chasing for all its facilities. About 96 percent of Apple's facilities worldwide are now run on renewable energy, the company said. Data centers tend to be the most power hungry tech facilities, and electricity requirements go up as computing moves into the cloud. As servers are saddled with more tasks, the processing requirements go up. As a result, more heat is generated, and Apple has found an innovative way to recycle heat. Many data centers find ways to recycle heat, while others let the resource go waste. Amazon recycles heat to warm up offices nearby, and other companies recycle the heat to generate hot water. Iceland and the Scandinavian countries are hot spots to establish data centers because of naturally cool weather and easy availability of hydropower. 5 Reasons to Move to Cloud ERP Right Now More from MYOB Join the PC World newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days.

The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too!

Of all things, an incident report filed by an Environment Health and Safety contractor working with the company offers a glimpse into what the Cupertino giant may be working on. The report, which was accidentally sent to hundreds of employees, then made it onto Gizmodo’s desk, and is titled “Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month”. Beneath the drab name, one can find incidents ranging from employees running into doors, to those involving the need for medical attention following the testing of Apple prototypes. On the lower end of the scale, we find occurrences such as someone burning their hand on an oven, or feeling lightheaded due to stress. Another occurrence details a strong odor coming from a box of Apple Pencils, which was allegedly later found to contain two such devices which were leaking electrolytes. One of the most interesting tidbits is an incident on February 21, which involved “medical treatment beyond first aid”. An excerpt from the report reads: After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis. Yet another, similar incident report read: Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with. The statements above could be a clue that Apple is working on its own version of smart glasses, most likely an augmented reality type of device, as Tim Cook previously hinted this technology would happen “in a big way”. There are also reports detailing an employee being struck by the company’s minivan, which is speculated to have been gathering data for Apple Maps. Yet another report outlines how a member of the Apple Watch team hurt his knee while skiing, suggesting the possible addition of tracking for these types of physical activities in future iterations of the smartwatch. Apple has so far not come forth with any statement regarding the leaked report or what it contains.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Apple’s next iPhone breakthrough sounds amazing, but only on paper Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 11:48 AM Share Tweet Apple’s iPhone 8 will bring a bunch of novel new features to the iPhone family, which should further refine the iPhone experience. Apple has even bigger goals in mind for its upcoming products, but they only sound amazing on paper for the time being. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked The company wants to stop mining the earth for the precious minerals it needs to use in its iPhone, iPad, MacBook, or any other piece of hardware it plans to make. The news came from Apple’s 2017 Environment Responsibility Report, which outlines plans to use recycled materials including aluminum, copper, tin, tungsten, and others, to build these devices. The only problem with that line of thinking is that Apple has no idea how to make it happen… and the company is pretty straightforward about that fact. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Apple’s Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson told Vice. “So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.” Just four years ago, Apple said it was going to power all of its facilities with the help of renewable energy, and it’s currently at 96%. However, using only recycled minerals in all of its products is something a lot more complicated, and something that can’t be fixed as easily, especially considering the volume of devices Apple sells each year. Apple ships more than 200 million iPhones alone every year, and the device contains plenty of metal. So why is Apple announcing this goal right now? The company wants to encourage innovation among its suppliers, whose help is desperately needed. The iPhone maker already has a smart robot that can recycle iPhone minerals, but that’s hardly enough to do the trick. So it’ll need mining companies to bring over their expertise. “Who knows more about recovering metals than people who mine them?” Jackson, a former head of the EPA, also said. “So some of the same smart people who do that, if they think there is a market for their services on the other side might get involved.” A video version of Vice’s interview with Apple follows below.

Zeman   @phonescooper Apple today released a new tool for developers that should make it easier for people to share their Live Photos with others. Specifically, the company made available the LivePhotoKit JS API. Apple says, "This new JavaScript-based API makes it easy to embed Live Photos on your web sites. In addition to enabling Live Photos on iOS and macOS, you can now let users display their Live Photos on the web." Live Photos, which are essentially short moving pictures, can be shared between iOS and macOS devices, but not so easily across platforms. Google solved this problem with its own Motion Stills app for iOS, which lets iPhone owners turn Live Photos into web-compatible GIFs. Apple says it will be up to individual developers and web sites to put the LivePhotoKit JS API to use on their own sites. Until they do, Google's Motion Stills app remains a viable alternative. more info at Apple » Related Apple Retunes Apple Music for Android Devices Apple today released Apple Music 2.0 for Android handsets and the app introduces a number of features found on the iOS version. To start, Apple Music for Android drops all elements of Google's Material Design in favor of Apple's app design language. Google's 'Motion Stills' Makes GIFs from iOS Live Photos Google today released an app for iPhones called Motion Stills. Google created the app in order to take advantage of Apple's Live Photos, as captured by the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. T-Mobile Pitches Free MLB Content to Customers T-Mobile today said baseball fans will be able to watch every regular season Major League Baseball game on their smartphones for free. T-Mobile has again partnered with MLB and is providing customers with access to a free year of MLB.TV Premium, which includes MLB.com At Bat Premium. Facebook to Support iPhone's Live Photos The Facebook iOS application now lets users upload, share, and view Live Photos captured with the iPhone 6s or 6s Plus. Live Photos debuted with the newest iPhones from Apple earlier this year. Google's Motion Stills for iPhone Picks Up a Useful Update Google updated its Motion Stills app for the Apple iPhone this week and added a small number of new features. Motion Stills allows iPhone owners to export their Live Photos in the more widely usable GIF format, which can be shared with non-Apple devices. more news about:   AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

Tech Culture by Dara Kerr April 20, 2017 12:54 PM PDT @darakerr Former US Vice President Al Gore says Apple is one of the most environmentally responsible companies in the world. Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images Apple has pledged to be a greener company over the past few years. It's using renewable sources of energy and has doubled down on recycling its products. The company also hired former US Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson in 2013 to head its environmental initiatives. These efforts have won the praise from the former US vice president and climate change activist Al Gore, who also sits on Apple's board of directors. "Apple is one of the most successful and valuable companies in the history of the world," Gore said. "And one of a handful of the most environmentally responsible and committed companies in the world." Gore spoke with Jackson at the company's San Francisco retail store on Wednesday evening. The two discussed renewable energy, President Donald Trump and climate change. "Why do we do this work?" asked Jackson. "I hope you know it's not about bragging rights. The reason we do it is we know climate change is real." Apple released its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report on Wednesday, which detailed its initiatives to reduce its impact on climate change. The company says it now powers 96 percent of its operations around the world with 100 percent renewable energy, like solar, hydro and wind power. It's also using 100 percent recycled paper in its packaging. But the company acknowledges more can be done. Related stories Apple's environmental chief to now head all social policy programs Tim Cook advises climate change deniers to get out of Apple stock Al Gore a lightning rod at Apple shareholder meeting It still mines for materials, like aluminum and tin, to build its electronics. In its report, Apple said it's now taking steps to end its reliance on mining and move toward a closed-loop supply chain in which it'll build new products only with recycled materials. "I am so proud of Tim Cook's leadership on Apple," Gore said, speaking of the CEO's environmental work. "He lives and breathes it. I know it sounds corny, but it's real." As for Gore's views on Trump? He's disappointed by some of the measures being discussed by the president's cabinet, like cutbacks for the EPA and pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord. "But we're less than 100 days into this experiment," Gore said. "We still don't know how it's going to shake out." Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

As can be inferred from the name, this will be part of Nike's NikeLab range of products, which means it is also limited edition. The Apple Watch NikeLab is functionally identical to the Apple Watch Nike+. What's new here is the color palette; while the Nike+ comes in a black or white color options, the NikeLab variant combines both to form a stunning new design, with a Space Gray aluminum body and Light Bone/Black band. Apart from that it has all the features of the standard Apple Watch Series 2, along with the Nike exclusive extras, such as Nike+ Run app and exclusive Siri commands, found on the Nike+ variant. The limited edition Apple Watch NikeLab will be available starting April 27 at NikeLab doors and at an Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan.

Charles Pierce, Esquire KING: Now is the perfect time to discuss how and why Bernie Sanders could’ve beaten Donald Trump NY Daily News Sanders: I don’t consider myself a Democrat The Hill (PU). “‘If the Democratic Party is going to succeed – and I want to see it succeed – it’s gonna have to open its door to Independents,’ [Sanders] continued. ‘There are probably more Independents in this country than Democrats or Republicans. It’s got to open its doors to working people and to young people, create a grassroots party. That’s what we need.'” Jon Ossoff takes first in special election, forcing a runoff for a seat the GOP’s held for decades Daily Kos. As one would expect, Kos has most egregiously triumphalist attempt to spin a Democrat loss as a victory. The runoff was not “forced,” since it was a foregone conclusion that an establishment Democrat-backed so-called insurgent would finish in the top two in a race with 17 other candidates. If there is a positive message, it’s that Ossoff exceeded expectations set by polling. But a moral victory isn’t a victory! Second, just as with Clinton 2016, the Democrat establishment has again failed to flip enough well-to-do suburban Republicans to bring home the bacon.

About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Yes, the NYT has gotten some big stories wrong on the Clintons and btw, a great many other things. This doesn’t mean there is some mysterious inexplicable reason why people perceive the Clintons as greedy opportunistic politicians who have helped lead the country rightwards and have favored every stupid war we have engaged in for the past 17 years. People see the Clintons as greedy opportunists because they are obviously greedy opportunists and not because the NYT so often gets things wrong. At a comment section on another blog a clueless person said Trump’s bombing of Syria showed that Trump was more militaristic than Hillary. I pointed out the facts regarding Clinton and Syria and a third person jumped in to defend Clinton and citing ” the Clinton Rules.” So citing Clinton’s actual record, including the call to bomb Syria before Trump did it, was an example of the “Clinton Rules”. Criticism of the Clintons evokes this kind of kneejerk response with some people, whether the criticism is accurate or not. Reply ↓ pretzelattack April 19, 2017 at 9:16 am the times inadvertently got something right in their haste to smear the clintons; they are greedy opportunists. but all’s right with the world–the clinton’s and david brock and the neocons, together at last, as it was always meant to be. Reply ↓ fresno dan April 19, 2017 at 10:15 am Donald April 19, 2017 at 7:29 am It took me a long time to understand and than accept, but beliefs come before facts for most people. It is a rare person who will admit their won error and than revise their ideology. Humans are religious beasts, and just like people belief in certain economic cults or sects, certain people believe in the cult of Hillary – ‘Hillary said it, I believe it, and that settles it…’ Reply ↓ sid_finster April 19, 2017 at 12:29 pm No sacred cows. Reply ↓ Plenue April 19, 2017 at 9:47 pm From the Pierce piece: “Full disclosure: I have not yet read the book. Allen and Parnes are both good, reliable reporters, and I have no doubt that all of the anonymous backstabbing, ass-covering, and score-settling in the book is accurately quoted and a further clear example that the members of the consultant class have the fundamental loyalty of a brood of vipers.” My first thought upon reading this is of Germans inventing a myth that they’d been stabbed in the back. My second thought is of Bill O’Reilly obliquely discussing sexual harassment allegations against him by lamenting a lack of loyalty among Fox employees. Reply ↓ MoiAussie April 19, 2017 at 7:29 am US seeks political solution to Yemen conflict: Pentagon chief It’s hard to tell if this and similar reports represent an about face or a cover for increased US involvement. 3 weeks ago, the WSJ reported in US Boosts Military Backing for Saudi-Led Coalition in Yemen that Mattis was pushing for greater military support, possibly boots on the ground. A Counterpunch article from today US Moves Toward Major Intervention in Yemen suggests the same. As with Syria, perhaps more boots on the ground is seen as necessary to ensure the “right” political solution is reached. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 19, 2017 at 9:15 am As with today’s story that Trump’s “armada” is actually sailing away from Korea, perhaps it’s time to conclude that the reality of Trump’s foreign policy is, and will continue to be, completely opaque. This was true during the campaign too BTW. Many would claim to be spokespeople for Trump only to turn out to be marginal figures or talking out of school. The phenomenon is probably due less to Machiavellian strategy and more to the fact that Trump himself doesn’t know what he is going to do next. But what increasingly does seem to be true is that Trump is inclined to do as little as possible while appearing to be doing something. Thus the shocking betrayal of the Tomahawk strike is also the tactically meaningless shooting up of an empty airfield. And if the above analysis is correct then a boots on the ground escalation in Yemen seems most unlikely. Or not. Like I say, opaque. Reply ↓ fresno dan April 19, 2017 at 10:23 am Carolinian April 19, 2017 at 9:15 am I would hypothesize that the Trump “doctrine” is OFFICIALLY contradictory. Yup, the official policy is to be all things to all people – they will do the opposite of Obama while doing exactly what Obama did….or vice versa…. And if THAT doesn’t work, they will say exactly what Obama said – they just didn’t explain well enough what they were doing…. Reply ↓ Carolinian April 19, 2017 at 10:57 am Alastair Crooke in Consortium suggested that Trump’s whole run for president was to spite Obama after that correspondent’s dinner humiliation. By this theory Trump sent the Tomahawks because Obama didn’t. Of course Obama is just as petty, and is likely the source of the Russia scare witch hunt. Reply ↓ JustAnObserver April 19, 2017 at 1:07 pm So we get single payer ‘cos Obama threw it into the ditch and Hillary said `never, ever’ ? Reply ↓ Knot Galt April 19, 2017 at 7:28 pm I think Trump might be our first “read-the-small-print” President. Take Single Payer for example. Ain’t gonna happen. That would be taking things too far! As it is turning out, even Trump has his limits. Only on certain things. And only those things that work against your favor. And, you won’t see it when it is coming. Assuring Trump wins. We are all losers in his book. That is the Art of the Deal, my friends. Reply ↓ Whine Country April 19, 2017 at 11:07 am It appears to me that Trump’s policy is to have no policy. It is obvious that his schtick is to make decisions in real time according to his reading of the tea leaves, with input from his “trusted” advisers. Everything is a “deal” to him and, you know he as just real good at the art of the deal. It appears opaque because it does not exist to him. I would describe it as “Let’s burn that bridge when we come to it”. Reply ↓ Ernesto Lyon April 19, 2017 at 12:18 pm The fact that Trump and a stalemated congress will get little done is a feature, considering that most of what politicians do now is seek to mine the public for the benefit of their sponsors. Trump fiddling about is a good thing only because the alternatives will seek to take us further in the wrong direction. Politicians with the nads to truly “drain the swamp” are nowhere to be found. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 19, 2017 at 12:36 pm He is contradictory, just like those who to oppose him, at every turn. It’s just math or logic. Trump is for A and -A. When he is for A, they are against A. When Trump turns around and advocates for -A (180 degrees), they for against -A. Reply ↓ Adam Eran April 19, 2017 at 2:05 pm I’d suggest this is a variation on the bargain bazaar of garage sales. If you find something you want, then the best strategy is to find fault with it so you can get it at a lower price. It’s not policy, it’s poker. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 19, 2017 at 2:20 pm It’s a little more. Here, the seller seems contradictory. And the buyer joins in. Trump will lower or hike the asking price. Those on the other side then mirror him in the opposite direction. When Trump lowers the asking price, they will complain it’s low and want to pay a higher price. (“No. Too cheap. I don’t want to buy) When he hikes the price, they want it lower. Just so they can be against, at every turn. Reply ↓ philnc April 19, 2017 at 1:23 pm Or maybe people inside the government, possibly including Trump, still get the importance of operational security. Surface ships, especially really big ones like aircraft carriers, a particularly vulnerable when the enemy has anti-ship missiles and knows you’re coming. A lesson the British Navy learned the hard way in 1982. Rather than the incompetence of the administration, the mis-reporting here seems to confirm the gullibility and a lack of investigatory effort by the press and their “expert” commentators. But we already knew that from their uncritical parroting of administration talking points on events in Syria last week. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef April 19, 2017 at 2:34 pm It’s more than reporting and mis-reporting by the press. They have been active players in actuating events. The road-to-Damascus in the last few months seems like this: Warmongers —-> Press —–> Epiphany —-> the Adminstration Reply ↓ Mark P. April 19, 2017 at 3:09 pm the mis-reporting here seems to confirm the gullibility and a lack of investigatory effort by the press and their “expert” commentators. The lack of investigatory effort is a failure — by all the big outfits like the NYT — to figure out they could at any time simply go online and look up all U.S. carrier deployments, including the Vinson carrier group, at this site here — http://www.gonavy.jp/CVLocation.html Think about that. That’s how stupid and lazy the press is. They then copy each other’s blunders. That would be how this particular stupid story happened — one source came up with it without bothering to check and the rest copied that first article. Reply ↓ jsn April 19, 2017 at 6:23 pm They’er not stupid or lazy, they’re just 22, I know several of them. They’re great kids and they think they’re working for a great institution, but they don’t know anything that wasn’t taught to them by some hyper competitive private school who’s mission is to groom them to conform to the interests of our “establishment”, and your link isn’t in the syllabus at Princeton.

Reply ↓ oh April 19, 2017 at 2:25 pm Unlike Lord Obama and the great communicator Reagan (Obama’s idol) ,Trump does not have a host of political advisers who chart his every move and script his speeches to gain maximum advantage with the correct amount of spin. Reply ↓ zapster April 20, 2017 at 2:54 am I’m a lot less worried about what Trump will do than what his now unleashed generals will do without any pushback from the White House. Reply ↓ Procopius April 20, 2017 at 2:25 am If you read Sic Semper Tyrannis, col pat lang believes the Saudis are terrified of sending their own army into Yemen because any significant number of casualties (and the Houthis would inflict enormous casualties on them) would lead to serious political unrest in their Kingdom. He said a couple of years ago the Saudis pulled their “army” back from the frontier because they lost 65 men. I would not be surprised if the Pentagon wants to send a few battalions of infantry. At this point, with the Houthi starving and sick, they might actually be able to win — temporarily. So if they pull out after a week they might be able to claim a victory, which by this time they badly want. Reply ↓ Linda April 19, 2017 at 7:40 am PepsiCAN. Devil’s advocate.

The Menominee Nation flag features the Thunderbird, but in this case, the Thunderbird would be meant to symbolize Native Americans, as the Thunderbird is important in Native American lore, so is not suggesting just the one tribe. Reply ↓ Procopius April 20, 2017 at 2:48 am I don’t want to be too dogmatic about this, but I’m fairly sure it’s not part of Navajo or Hopi mythology. Don’t know about Apache. Navajo and Hopi are very different from each other. Just as with languages, the Amerinds had enormous differences in religions. The term Native American is about as meaningful as Asian American. Reply ↓ Linda April 20, 2017 at 3:53 am Thanks, Procopius. I’m sure not an expert on this topic. I think the ad makers intended to represent Native Americans. Maybe a better symbol could have been selected. Reply ↓ Bugs Bunny April 19, 2017 at 12:41 pm Thanks for the clarification.

It’s the neoliberal DLC’ers like her who have been economically crushing the middle and working classes. Her turn? When is it our economic turn ? Reply ↓ Procopius April 20, 2017 at 2:53 am Don’t overlook the side message from the DNC, DCCC, and DSCC, “We’re not as bad as them.” I don’t really remember if that was Hillary’s message or not, because I don’t really remember if she had a message.

Reply ↓ Deadl E Cheese April 19, 2017 at 8:28 am They’re for restoring a sense of tony to the White House rather than Trumpian vulgarity. The actual policies don’t matter so much so long as the person fronting the policy is calm, intellectual, and civil. Being ‘cool’ and ‘historical’ is a plus, too, but not necessary. If Mike Pence or Paul Ryan slithered into the White House instead of Trump, the Resistance would melt into ether. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner April 19, 2017 at 9:34 am Many of “The Resistance” types would have said crazy stuff about other Republicans. “The Resistance” is clearly an attempt to connect the DLC with the good guys in the new Star Wars. Is it any different than “Darth Cheney” and such? Again the unhealthy obsession with a toy line rears it’s head. Yes, Shrub was clearly a mean spirited Calvinist nut, but back in the 00’s, it was apparent many anti-Shrub people only cared because Shrub wasn’t on their team. Since he’s out of the game, it’s okay now. Obama could praise Reagan in front of people who “despised” Reagan for the same reasons: appropriating Star Wars branding. There would a “Resistance,” and it would still be stupid. Reply ↓ Darius April 19, 2017 at 8:42 am We’ve had freaks in the White House but no one close to the Trump order of magnitude.

Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob April 19, 2017 at 8:03 am A few observations from a provincial curmudgeon in NYC this week – Overheard a couple talking about the ‘Fearless Girl’ statue over dinner last night and they had bought the hype hook, line and sinker – they mentioned the need to find a permanent place for it, seemingly no knowledge that it was a marketing ploy by an investment firm, etc. Went to see it myself and the plaque on the ground in front of it I’d seen in some pictures was not there – maybe State Street is quite happy with people not knowing its origin. I did mention to my wife while there that it was a marketing ploy by an investment firm with $2.5 trillion in assets (rather loudly I might add- trying to get the word out and my other ideas at publicizing this were nixed by the kid who didn’t want to be publicly embarrassed by her dad). Not sure how many in the crowd of tourists heard or cared – the crowd around the bull was much larger than that around the girl and the former were mostly interested in taking posterior photos while kneeling and gently cupping its testicles! Tried to ride the bus and pay with cash and found out you had to either pay in quarters (who carries $2.75 in quarters around?) or use a swipe card purchased at a metro station. We’d walked from midtown to the Met and the bus driver was nice enough to let us ride back to midtown without paying. Thank you sir for being nice to ignorant tourists! Now knowing this, we went to get tickets for the subway the next day only to find that you know had to purchase them from a machine as there were no human beings performing this task any more that we could see. The line was rather long and didn’t move quickly as people had to take time to figure out how to use the damned machines which were not all in working order to begin with. I was suggesting to my better half that it would be a lot quicker if we could simply deal with a human being but a millennial in front of us complained that there should be an app for purchasing tickets because of course the solution to inefficient technology is moar technology. Oh, and it took all of about 30 seconds to hail a cab the old fashioned way. Familyblog Uber.

They are smart enough to navigate and use IT, but incurious when it comes to the essentially depersonalizing aspects of the technology. Heaven forfend that random curmudgeons ask “appistas” if they even understand the RFID implant chip nature of apps. Someone is collecting and using all of this “personal data,” generated every time one not only uses an app, but every time ones iPhone “shakes hands” with a cell tower. IT has begun to realize the potential of the Panopticon. Your comment about there being no live attendants to collect fares and make change in the NY Subways shows how far the “cashless society” movement has come. As mentioned above, every swipe of the “boarding pass” to enter the subway is recorded and collated, somewhere. Next, look to see the idea of “metered travel” introduced so that the hapless “consumer” must swipe a card to not only enter the public transit system, but to leave it too. Then, both ends of ones’ travel will be recorded, and analyzed. What do those displaced subway workers now do for a living? Steal Uber taxi hubcaps? Here’s to the anonymity of cash! Reply ↓ Carolinian April 19, 2017 at 9:36 am Pre-computer Panopticons like the Soviet Union and and Nazi Germany depended on your neighbors to spy on you. So perhaps modern machine spying is less sinister in that all that data will go into an impossibly large haystack and be lost by the nerds who think this is a good idea. It does seem stupid that NYC, with its hoards of tourists, would force subway riders to buy tix by machine. Locals who have already scaled the learning curve must find this very trying.

Over five million riders every day on 600 miles of track, stopping at 425 stations. A very long time ago, at the beginning of the Age of Reagan, there were toll takers and transit cops in every station. But austerity budgets and heightened danger for increasingly isolated toll takers (some of whom were literally burned out of their toll booths) made it impossible to maintain that level of service. Maybe, someday, when the City and State of New York are willing to adequately tax those who benefit most from the whole governmental system, we could see a restoration of that service.

But that all goes by the wayside if marijuana is legalized, even with rules about growing your own. I’m not discounting the drug war’s effective means of kicking the lower classes, especially minorities.

Reply ↓ XXYY April 19, 2017 at 9:42 am I don’t understand at all the idea, which occasionally pops up, that Apple should build a car. There seems to be this idea floating around that all you need is a popular brand and you are qualified to do anything. Literally anything. Pro tip: Building a car is hard! It requires a huge capital investment, a large engineering staff of people who know what they’re doing, tremendous manufacturing facilities building a dedicated product, a large marketing and sales effort, showrooms or some other gigantic distribution network, and a big and costly system for doing warranty repairs and other needed maintenance funded by the manufacturer. Like any other complicated engineering effort, it often takes many years of failures and missteps before your product finally gets in the groove, accompanied by substantial brand risk. And the odds of failure are high. Cars are particularly difficult because they are a mature technology and the field is filled with other companies who have been doing it for a long time and doing it very well. These would be newbie Apple’s competition. Apple has literally nothing to bring to the party when it comes to building a car other than a brand and a logo. (For that matter, since Jobs the company seems less and less capable of doing things well even within their area of expertise, cf their decaying desktop systems.) Could we please apply some minimal sanity here? Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner April 19, 2017 at 9:52 am I think elitism is at play here.

Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive April 19, 2017 at 10:38 am Had a talk with a couple of my sons who are “in the business”. Apple has no intention of building an iCar. What they want is technology and intellectual rights, i.e., they don’t want to sell you the car, they want to sell the whiz-bang technology to the company that builds the car…. Reply ↓ Toshiro_Mifune April 19, 2017 at 11:33 am That is a notable departure from Apple’s past strategies. Reply ↓ Kurtismayfield April 19, 2017 at 1:26 pm This, to them the parts of the car that actually make it a car are boring.. it’s the “brains” they are after.. they will contract out the manufacturer of the car and add their AI as well as paint it some bright color scheme and round off all the edges. It not like Apple makes any of their own computer parts. Reply ↓ Toshiro_Mifune April 19, 2017 at 11:47 am I respectfully disagree on this. Apple, at least potentially, brings a lot to the table other than just brand recognition. A traditional ICE powered car is complicated and expensive and difficult. However a battery powered self driving electric car (which is what Project Titan was supposed to have been) reduces a significant number of the components of the car. No cooling system, no oil system, no transmission, no I-4, V-6, W-8, fuel system, etc etc etc. A lot of what makes a car expensive to manufacture goes away. The primary concerns would be battery life, which Apple does know a bit about, electric motors at the self driving AI. Apple could potentially offer a lot with a car as an integrated iDevice, never miss a call (ok, maybe not great) all of your media can follow you on the road, a simple ‘Take me There’ button available for interesting places in news or magazine articles that sends directions to the cars. Hell, send the car to go pick up the groceries, and on. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive April 19, 2017 at 2:05 pm Then perhaps you need to explain WHY this would be a good idea for Apple financially? Tesla has never made a dime on its car development – all of Tesla’s money comes from speculation. Do you really think Tim Cook wants to take Apple and its fortunes down that route? I can’t see him doing that, can you? But I can see him going after the technology and intellectual rights because that makes sense for Apple – after all, Apple already does that…..and it doesn’t cost them that much and it doesn’t risk their company…. Reply ↓ oh April 19, 2017 at 4:29 pm Apple would probably subcontract the manufacturing to a Chinese company that will have nets to catch people that want to bail from the upper floors; Apple would be able to apply their existing manufacturing (outsourcing) model to the car and they can change the exterior ever so slightly and come out with a new model each year to sell to the Apple fanbois. Reply ↓ zer0 April 19, 2017 at 6:17 pm As an automotive expert (15 years industry experience), everything you just mentioned is blatantly false. 1). Electric cars have just as many components as combustion cars if not more 2). Electric cars USED to not have trannies, but they definitely do now (Faraday, Tesla, etc. all use 1 or 2 gear transmissions – if I could post pictures, I could show you the CAD models). 3). Electric cars weigh on average about the same as combustion cars, and use oil and cooling circuits powered by electric pumps. In fact, some people say they weigh more. Anyhow, doesn’t really matter about the electric/combustion as the frame materials and so forth. 4). The fuel system is the battery – which weighs and has a shitload more components than combustion engines, like transformers, chips, outer and inner shells, fire-retardant foams, etc. And finally….electric cars cost much more than combustion cars due to, if anything, low volume, high risk of patent liabilities, rare-earth metals, etc. There is a reason why car companies are worth $50 billion while Apple is worth $600 billion: its far far far harder to build & sell a car than a phone or a computer. You need tremendous amounts of capital & people to make a product that has very little margin and carries tremendous risk. Apple’s ONLY strategic move would be to downright buy an existing automaker, and as mentioned above, Apple is a software company trying to get into the self-driving electric car SOFTWARE patent market, not actually build a car. Just take a look at the graveyard of past automakers. Its stunning just how many companies/people have built cars, even great cars, yet made no money doing so. There is a big divide between silicon valley and highly engineered manufactured products. Huge divide. Its a divide between the virtual and the physical. On one end you can make a multibillion dollar app with just a few friends, some computers, and a free summer. On the other end, you would need hundreds of millions to just start, let alone 4-5 years where you will make almost no money. I don’t see Silicon Valley venturing very far into engineered manufacturing market. And Musk is a poor example: Musk is to Silicon Valley what Buffet is to Wallstreet.

It’s impossible to pass over the election. From what little I gleaned, Melenchon is being portrayed as a Left wing “populist”. As we know a populist is a slightly sullied appellation. (Code for: not an insider who may cause waves in the grand scheme?) As for the politician, himself, he made one very smart move. He distanced himself from every socialist formation in France to some extent. He is not being hindered from the tiresome and loathsome “talking points” that often dominate socialist dialogue; i.e. the meme that there is only one correct way to approach every issue or problem. (In fact, I’m finding that many socialists, especially strong democratic ones, might be better termed as floating independents these days as they abandon the formal parties.) Many other commentators are projecting their hopes and fears onto the man and politician. It seems all rather of a muddle at this junction of the election. If the polls are correct, it is Le Pen and one of three others, including Melenchon – the late arriving upsurger. Reply ↓ D. Battabong April 20, 2017 at 6:54 am Uncle, try Art Goldhammer’s blog.

An important one is that Mélenchon has been from the start an apparatchik of the Socialist Party. He was elected to the French Senate as soon as he reached the minimum age. This is the perfect spot: no responsabilities (so all the time in the world for inter-party fighting) and lots of material perks. Reply ↓ Benedict@Large April 19, 2017 at 12:41 pm Yes, the headline was click bait. Mélenchon has been a t forefront of liberal French politics for years, and so hardly should need a comparison to anyone else. Also, he’s well to the left of Sanders in his ideology, so I’d think Sanders being compared to Mélenchon would be a greater compliment than to Sanders than the opposite would be to Mélenchon.

I have been binge watching clips of Maria Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who most definitely will be the next president after Putin. Wow, is she not only articulate and fierce, but also passionate and moving. There is a montage of some of her best moments and at around 8 minutes in she talks about being literally a starving young person until she was given a student meal ticket to go to University in 1993. She says that she would rather go hungry again than return to the chaos and bad days of the mid 1990s.

In fact, it seems to me that with its deepening strategic alliance with China, Russia actually has a much better sense now that a post-US-domination world is possible (and even necessary, lest we all end up vaporized).

He said that is what Russia learned from their Soviet Union history i.e. not to force their ideology on others. Gee, learning from your mistakes. What a concept! And if anybody would like to see another narrative on Crimea other than the one that says Russia invaded it and annexed it against the wishes of its citizens, just watch this moving video on the 2014 May 9 Victory Celebration of the Liberation of Sebastapol at the end of WW II from the Nazis.

I find that the cult of genius is especially pronounced in the U S of A, where it ties in with celebrity, Romantic-era ideas of the role of artists and writers, and melodrama. At the time that Leonardo lived, Italy was awash in wildly talented people. (Luigi Barzini occasionally lamented the prodigious talents of the Italians as a group–except in the area of national governance.) Michelangelo was around, Leonardo’s contemporary, and also from a humble background, and if you read his letters, you’ll find a rather dull guy who complained a lot about being mistreated by patrons–who wanted to keep his fees low. Titian worked all the time. Raphael was considered somewhat charmed–but no more so than any of the others. (Even Galileo, whose life was spectacular in many respects, had a hard time pulling off enough melodrama to make himself a Romantic Genius.) But what Americans really want is melodrama: Witness the odd career of U.S. culture hero Artemisia Gentilleschi. She was Orazio’s daughter, and their paintings are barely distinguishable. But she as a genius, and he wasn’t. Somehow. Or Caravaggio. Caravaggio’s life was a disaster, so his paintings are constantly being upgraded by the critics and the public: Leonardo Di Caprio will play him in the movie, no doubt. As mentioned, Titian seems to have worked all the time, and he lived to be something like 98, so he isn’t movie fodder. And then there are all of the dozens and dozens of Italian culture figures ignored by the Anglo world, even as Leonardo’s great mysteries are plumbed by under-the-Tuscan-sun scribblers. Pietro Aretino, anyone? Ever hear of Isabella Andreini, a couple of generations of after Leonardo? Considered the greatest artist of her time?

VIX is calculated from the prices of options on the S&P 500 stock index. Since these trade in large volume, it would be very difficult to systematically underprice or overprice the whole range of strike prices of index puts and calls. If that were to happen, options dealers can easily sell overpriced options (or buy underpriced options), hedge away the directional risk with S&P futures, then sit back and wait for their risk-free profit when market pricing is restored. For retail investors speculators, inverse VIX funds (such as XIV) amount to a highly leveraged bet on stock prices, by effectively selling portfolio insurance. XIV was smashed to a 60% loss between Aug 2015 and Feb 2016, but has more than tripled since then.

Reply ↓ Vatch April 19, 2017 at 10:42 am Jon Ossoff takes first in special election, forcing a runoff for a seat the GOP’s held for decades According to Ballotpedia (and my possibly flawed arithmetic), the Republicans got 97,997 votes, the Democrats got 93,911 votes, and there were 176 votes for independents. That means the Republicans got 51% of the votes, and the Democrats got 48.8%, with 0.2% for the independents. It’s close, but the Republican Karen Handel obviously is the favorite to win the runoff election on June 20. It would have been a heck of a lot more cost effective for the national Democratic party and the Kansas state Democratic party to have put an extra $100,000 into the James Thompson campaign. Considering how well Thompson did with almost no support at all from the party organizations, with that extra help, he would have won. There would be one fewer Republican vassal of the Koch brothers in Congress. Tom Perez of the DNC and Ben Ray Lujan of the DCCC are either inept, corrupt, or both.

Also I remember an article about how the franchise is supposed to be huge with Hispanic and Asian youths in North America where much of the entertainment industry revolves around very white and classic black faces (despite “Oscarssowhite” largely focusing on blacks not being represented despite a small black population in LA skewing the numbers of Oscars in the other categories. Hispanics have a real beef.). This franchise features Vin Diesel, the Rock, and Michelle Rodriguez. I have now checked, but it features a woman from Panama and mutiple Asian male leads. Perhaps it was a long term accident, but the franchise features people who look like people not often featured in Hollywood. I enjoyed the first “Transformers” movie from 2007, but there is only one non-white character and it was black comedian playing a clown. Its about giant robots from space and stereotypes. As for the relative problems with “The Great Wall” movie, the movie going public does not want to be disappointed for the price of tickets relying on proven franchises, and two, who cares about monsters at “The Great Wall.” The Great Wall is baller in of itself.

A number of people have asked me what this means for the H-1B work visa and related programs such as Optional Practical Training (OPT). Let’s take the latter first. As many of you know, OPT is an extension of the F-1 student visa. Though it was intended to give foreign students a chance to work in one-year internships after earning their American degrees, it became an unofficial supplement to H-1B. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both extended it much beyond one year, and it now serves in essence as a backdoor way to expand the yearly cap on new H-1B visas. There is no cap on OPT.

It is actually even worse in a top-two runoff such as France, and now both Washington and California,,use. The long time US example is Louisiana, not a recommendation. There is a technical solution: Ranked Choice aka Instant Runoff Voting, which eliminates the spoiler effect by giving voters a backup vote and guarantees a majority winner, all in just one election (hence “Instant Runoff.”) It’s been around a long time and is in use in a number of places, but is opposed by the “major” parties because it’s just too democratic. That said, the French election will be especially earthshaking if Melenchon comes from behind and gets into the runoff, against LePen. We will then see whether the Right is as “tactical” as the Left has been.

Apple never used to announce what its roadmap looked like. Instead, the company held its cards close and let the rumor mill run amok. But lately, Apple is being much more open about its future. Expect new iMacs later this year, company executives said earlier this month, but that’s not all: Apple plans to make all of its products with recycled materials. Apple Apple’s environmental goal illustrated. That means the end of mining metals from the earth, which is a tall order. Apple doesn’t have a timeline for moving to a completely closed-loop supply chain, said Lisa P. Jackson, the company’s vice president of environmental and social initiatives. Jackson, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama, told Vice News Tonight that Apple is trying to move the industry in the direction of sustainability. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do which is announce a goal before we completely figure out how to do it,” Jackson said. “We’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important because as a sector it’s where we believe technology should be going.” You can see Jackson’s full Vice News Tonight interview below. Liam, Apple’s iPhone-disassembling robot, will play a big part in recycling and reusing Apple’s own components to produce new devices. But there’s much more to it than that, which Apple is still trying to figure out. The company managed to move almost entirely to renewable energy to power its facilities within four years of announcing that goal, so it can be done. In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity Apple uses worldwide came from renewable energy. In 24 countries, it’s 100 percent renewable. The company is encouraging its suppliers to do the same, and seven have promised to power their Apple manufacturing with renewable energy by the end of 2018. Apple is also using 99 percent recycled and sustainabily sourced paper for its packaging. Apple released its annual comprehensive environmental sustainability report, which covers its progress in fiscal 2016, and you can check it out in full here. The news of Apple’s new goal comes just in time for Earth Day, which falls on April 22. To get you in the mood, the company is encouraging Apple Watch owners to finish a 30-minute outdoor exercise activity on Saturday, for which you’ll be awarded an Earth Day badge and iMessage stickers. You’re not gonna help the earth with that workout, really, but you’re probably already recycling your iPhones and being responsible in other ways. The Earth Day challenge is just for fun.

The deal was far larger and more public than most Apple investments, and didn't clearly tie into Apple's flagship product, the iPhone. But a Thursday profile by Time reveals more about what CEO Tim Cook was thinking. Cook penned a profile honoring Jean Liu, president of Didi Chuxing and part of the "Time 100 Most Influential People" list. Cook led with the same factors that a U.S. company like Uber or Lyft might tout: The convenience, flexibility and "disruption" of ride-sharing. But he quickly shifted focus to the vast amount of data that Didi monitors, and its "big-data algorithms." "By analyzing commuter patterns the way oceanographers track the tides, Didi may help traffic jams go the way of the flip phone," Cook writes. The comment about the algorithms builds on Cook's earlier comments, where he said that Apple was always on the look out for great intellectual property. "From a Didi point of view, we see that as one, a great investment. Two, we think that there's some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market beyond what we currently know," Cook said last year. Data is important for testing self-driving cars — something Apple and Didi have almost certainly been mulling. Data can also become products: Uber has reportedly considered selling its data.

Apple's Promise to End Rare Earth Mineral Mining Is '100 Percent Unattainable Today' Apple says it'll end mining 'one day.' Recycling scientists say that day is not coming soon. Apple said Wednesday it wants to stop mining the Earth entirely in pursuit of an iPhone made completely out of recyclable materials. "Can we one day stop mining the Earth altogether?," Apple asks at the top of its new Environmental Responsibility Report. It's a laudable goal, but it's currently just a platitude—no more meaningful than say, SpaceX hopes to eventually colonize Mars. If attempted in earnest, the world's largest company will surely spur innovation in mining practices and electronics recycling. But Apple has provided no roadmap of how it will begin to recycle many of the dozens of rare earth elements that scientists have thus far deemed impractical to recover. The goal of a mining-free iPhone is not only far off; at the moment, it's scientifically impossible. So, good idea, Apple. Now get to work. Image: Apple "It's a noble promise, and it sets a real 'stretch goal' for the company," Alex King, director of the Critical Materials Institute at the Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory, told me. Recycling aluminum is easy, but there is currently no strategy for how to recycle rare earth metals. "The current iPhone models use somewhere around 60 or 65 distinct chemical elements, most of which are not recycled at all today and only come from mines." Apple says it has created "risk profiles" for 44 elements within the iPhone and its other products, based on "environmental, social, and supply risk factors spanning the life of each material," and that it plans to "invest in research" for recycling rare Earth elements that science doesn't know how to yet. These are needed investments, but Apple has set no specific goals and has given itself no timeline other than "one day." "I don't see how they can possibly get the white color they want with 100 percent recycled material," Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, which advocates for responsible recycling practices, told me. "So it's kind of an interesting goal from that perspective. It's 100 percent unattainable today, but it's a goal that lets them claim progress toward it without proving anything to the rest of us, because it's a metric that's independently unverifiable." Aerial view of a copper mine in Chile. Image: Jason Koebler Benjamin Sprecher, who is researching rare earth mineral recycling at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, told me "there is no recycling infrastructure in place to produce some of these metals on the scale that Apple requires." Neodymium, for instance, which is used in the iPhone's speakers, has only been recycled in small quantities in proof-of-concept research studies at universities. "One needs to collect a large volume of waste electronics, and refine the recovered contaminated metals to the purity levels necessary for the electronics industry," Sprecher said. "This is usually more expensive than simply mining the metals." There's also no indication of where Apple would actually be able to source rare earth metals from: Recycling is not a one-to-one proposition and the vast majority of iPhones and MacBooks are not ultimately returned to Apple to be dismantled. "They will certainly not be able to make new iPhones just by recycling the materials in old iPhones," King said. "Their recycled materials will most likely come from other kinds of post-consumer scrap." Both researchers said Apple's goals will likely be possible sometime down the line, and both said that the company should be cheered for throwing its weight for trying to spur innovation in the recycling industry. A lithium mine in Chile that iPhone lithium ion batteries are sourced from. Image: Jason Koebler At the same time, Apple artificially hampers the recycling of its own products, and has opposed right to repair legislation that would make it easier to extend the life of the products it makes today. "Technology is really complex; it is sophisticated to make it work, to ensure that you have security and privacy, [and] that somebody isn't giving you bad parts," Apple VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson told VICE News about allowing independent repair of its products. So while it's definitely cool that Apple wants to reduce mining, it's certainly not doing everything it can to be green. "If Apple were sincere about the environment they would be helping their customers keep their expensive toys in service for a decade or longer in order to fully amortize the environmental costs of mining, manufacturing, and toxic damage to workers," Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, which is advocating for right to repair legislation, told me. "Everything else is putting lipstick on a pig."

Headlines ZICTA claims they can read your WhatsApp Messages and Disable any Communication Device April 20, 2017 94 10,239 views Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala ZICTA has sensationally revealed that it is able to disable any communication devices and read personal messages. The revelation is likely to unsettle many social media users especially that platforms such as WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption which ensures that only the sender and the person receiving can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. On WhatsApp, messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and the sender have the special key needed to unlock and read the message. In recent years, some tech companies with very large user-bases have been championing user privacy. For instance, Apple and WhatsApp recently challenged law enforcement authorities’ demands to weaken their security system and/or access encrypted data. Apple most visibly in the San Bernardino case when Apple resisted demands by the FBI that it writes a new version of its OS to weaken the security of the terrorist’s iPhone. But ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala has also disclosed that the authority has a good working relationship with Facebook and Google in order to protect internet users in Zambia. Mr Chisala said Communications and Transport Minister Brian Mushimba envisions an ICT sector that is well disciplined. He said Zambia would have a lot of problem if it allowed people to do what they want online. Mr Chisala was speaking when he featured on the Hot FM Red Hot Breakfast show on Wednesday to clarify on the raid at CEC Liquid Telecom and other IT firms in Lusaka. “You know there have been a lot of social media pages, cloning, hate speech and the exchange of pornographic material and the ICT Act is very clear on some of these things. Now we have moved into gear to ensure that even taking you to court, we are going to ask for the maximum penalty because we don’t want a few people to twist the hand of government to now start putting in laws to start restricting people’s use of the internet. That is unnecessary, the Internet is one tool that can be used for businesses, research, communication and other things,” Mr Chisala said. He added, “So we have now gone into gear and we are now going to visit all those we find wanting to ensure that the ICT sector is one that other countries can be proud of and come to learn from.” “I always wish to remind people that with great power comes great responsibility. When you sit in your room on your Ipad or your phone and you start commenting, writing and rubbishing people, you know, we will catch up with you.” Mr Chisala said the ZICTA of today has realised that collaboration and education is not the only way to go hence the need to increase on enforcement of the law. “I think we need to switch up, turn the heat up. We are now following every lead we have and we will get to you. A very good example, a lot of you lose your phones, your laptops and when the police find them in a raid or if it is stolen, what we have to do to know if it belongs to you is that we will have to go through it and now instead of giving you back your stolen item, we will have to arrest you because even if you have deleted anything, we have equipment that can bring back everything that was deleted,” Mr Chisala explained. He added, “So if somebody is disturbing you or harassing you on social media, come and report to ZICTA and by the way, we are having very good relationships with these social media platforms like Facebook and Google and we speaking the same language.” “We are goona come after you and we will make you an example because we will name and shame you and we are going to blacklist you in Zambia, meaning you cannot use any of these services and if cousin, your mother, your father buys you a phone and you start using and we find out, we will blacklist your mother, your father, your cousin and whoever will give you access.” Related posts: ZICTA trains 100 CB teachers in curbing cybercrime ZICTA shuts down internet cafes operating without trading licences Over 6 million Zambians accessing the internet-ZICTA ZICTA raids CEC Liquid Telecom Loading...

If one checked LinkedIn today, you will find Mushota and she is not what you think she is but a petty nasty thing. This is what money can do when corruptly you are asked to sing their song.

But just because you don’t like the commentator’s point of view doesn’t mean you have to censor them. Only dictatorships like North Korea do that.

Accessing Whatsapp is another issue- to get access of someone’s whatsapp message one would have to use a clone server but you would have to know the number of the person whose account you wish to hack! Which is why some people avoid giving their numbers or putting their numbers on social networking sites such as FB or linkedin! So Zicta are actually quit right as they have a list of names and numbers of the owners of those names-however I believe they would require an act of Parliament to do so as the current Law on information is vague.

"Traditional supply chains are linear," it said. "Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products." "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material," it added. The company's research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. "For tin, we took a different approach," the company said. "Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is "to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. "Apple's commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health," Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group. Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an "environmentally friendly" manner. The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling. While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle. Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new 'spaceship' main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Virtual Reality Apple has a mystery prototype that injures employees’ eyes Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 20th, 2017 at 3:58 PM Share Tweet According to a workplace Health and Safety report obtained by Gizmodo, Apple is working on some kind of eye-mounted system that involves using lasers. We only know this because in two instances, Apple employees were left injured after testing the prototype. Don't Miss: Verizon is losing customers like crazy, even with unlimited data plans The document leaked to Gizmodo is an incident report on workplace injures, compiled for Apple by an independent contractor. The report details a number of accidents that could be linked to new products Apple is testing, including a face-mounted AR or VR system, and possibly a minivan linked to an Apple project. The report details two injuries related to a prototype that sounds like it has a lot to do with augmented reality: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” In another report, an employee working at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain on March 2. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” A source inside Apple speculated that this injury may have something to do with an augmented reality product Apple may be testing, something like glasses with an overhead display. Laser flashes and “eye pain associated with use” all sound like some kind of head-mounted display, like the ill-fated Google Glass. The fact that the prototype had a magenta housing also points it towards being a piece of wearable technology. The only thing that Apple has gone out of its way to make colorful is its other wearable, the Apple Watch. Apple has been linked to some kind of augmented reality project for a long time. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly said that he thinks AR will be more interesting than VR, and numerous reports have suggested that Apple has been working on a prototype for some time now. The leaked report also detailed an incident where a company-owned minivan turned into a crosswalk and hit an Apple employee. It’s possible that the minivan is something to do with Apple’s long-rumored self-driving car program, or it could also be collecting mapping data for Apple Maps.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals I learned from these cartoonish videos that Apple makes its own artificial sweat Christian Zibreg on April 20, 2017 2 Did you know that Apple makes its own artificial sweat to test whether or not products like Apple Watch and Apple Pencil that come in direct contact with the human body would irritate the skin? Neither did I, but that’s what they apparently do. I was educated about this, and other fun facts, by watching Apple’s new cartoonish videos that highlight the company’s efforts at sustainability. “Can a Building Breathe?” “Apple Park uses outside air to cool the building naturally, reducing the campus’ cooling load by 35 percent a year,” reads the video’s description. This clip is narrated by Apple’s Vice President of Real Estate, Dan Whisenhunt. “Do Solar Farms Feed Yanks?” Narrated by Lisa Jackson herself, who is Apple’s lead on Environment work, this video attempts to give a crash course on how the company’s 40-megawatt solar farms in China produce enough electricity for all of its corporate offices and retail stores in the country. “Can We Produce Zero Waste?” “None of Apple’s fourteen final assembly facilities in China send any waste to landfills,” notes Apple. “As in zero. And that all started when John Reynolds in iPhone Product Operations visited a factory in Guanlan, China.” “Why Does Apple Make Its Own Sweat?” “Apple’s toxicology experts Rob Guzzo and Art Fong will grossly tell you how we make about 30 gallons worth of sweat every year, and how it keeps you safe,” reads the description. Not a joke This isn’t a joke: Apple does in fact make its own artificial sweat in order to test if products like Apple Watch and Apple Pencil that come in direct contact with the skin might give you a rash. “We analyze materials that someone might put in their mouth—like an Apple Pencil you might chew on while considering the next line in your drawing—to make sure they’re safe,” Apple wrote in its annual Environmental Responsibility Report that iDownloadBlog highlighted today. One of the testing procedures they adhere to involves dunking Apple Watch straps inside a jar containing artificial sweat that simulates human body temperature. “We also evaluate products after they’ve undergone extensive reliability testing to ensure that they remain safe for our customers, even after years of use and exposure to different environmental conditions,” the company added.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Limited edition Apple Watch NikeLab launching next Thursday Christian Zibreg on April 20, 2017 1 Launching a week from today, a new Apple Watch variant created in partnership with Nike pairs a Space Gray Apple Watch Series 2 aluminum case with a strap featuring a new creamy color and black perforations (they’re calling this color combo “Light Bone”). Marketed as Apple Watch NikeLab, this limited-edition version of the wearable device will be available on nike.com, at NikeLab doors and at an Apple Tokyo popup store in Isetan beginning next Thursday, April 27. NikeLab models will be available in 38mm and 42mm options, respectively priced at $369 and $399 like your regular Series 2 models. I’m not sure if you can discern it from the hero shot top of post, but the NikeLab Innovation x Innovators logo appears on the inside of the strap. Like prior Nike+ variants of Apple Watch, the new NikeLab edition is being positioned as “the ultimate style companion” for those with a passion for running. ROUNDUP: 5 inexpensive alternatives to Apple Watch Nike+ straps Aside from a special combination of straps/colors/materials along with deep integration with the Nike+ Run Club app and a few exclusive Siri commands, this is your regular Apple Watch Series 2 will all the features you’ve come to love: built-in GPS, water resistance up to 50 meters, a faster S2 chip and a lot brighter screen than its predecessor’s. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Curiously enough, these new NikeLab variants won’t be offered in Apple’s own retail stores or through the company’s online store, which is definitely a first for the wrist-worn device. Apple’s been collaborating with Nike on various initiatives since the iPod days. After launching two Apple Watch Nike+ models in Silver and Space Gray last September, Apple this spring made the exclusive Apple Watch Nike+ straps available standalone. Previously, you had to opt for an Apple Watch Nike+ if you wanted one of those wonderfully executed bands in Nike’s signature colors.

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple partners with World Wildlife Fund on money-raising Earth Day 2017 initiative Christian Zibreg on April 20, 2017 0 Last year, Apple honored Earth Day with an App Store promotion that sent 100 percent proceeds from select app purchases to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). It ended up being wildly successfully as the company revealed it donated $8 million to the fund. This year in celebration of Earth Day 2017, the two brands are collaborating on a similar money-raising initiative involving Apple retail stores. Starting today and through April 28, the Cupertino firm shall donate $1 to the World Wildlife Fund for every purchase customers make in its stores with Apple Pay. As per 9to5Mac, the donation amount is based on the purchase alone, not how much it is worth, meaning a $10 accessory has the same value for the fund as a $4000 Mac Pro. If you’d rather donate to the fund directly, you can make a one-time donation using Apple Pay via WWF’s Donate Once webpage. World Wildlife Fund, in case this is the first time you’ve heard about it, is the world’s leading organization in wildlife conservation and endangered species. Apple detailed its efforts and initiatives regarding sustainability in 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, on its Environment mini-site and via four cartoonish videos. The firm revealed, among other tidbits, that “one day” it would like to make all its products from 100 percent renewable or recycled materials, including aluminum, copper, tin and tungsten. One of the videos about Apple’s sustainability efforts tells us that Apple makes its own artificial sweat to test whether or not gadgets that come in direct contact with your skin, like Apple Watch and Apple Pencil, would give you a rash, irritation or allergic reaction.

A creuseur, or digger, climbs through a copper and cobalt mine in Kawama, Democratic Republic of Congo on June 8, 2016. Image: Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post via Getty Images By Colin Daileda2017-04-20 20:24:29 UTC Please clap.  Apple wants to stop mining for rare Earth metals and other components that help its technologies work. The company announced this through its recently-released 2016 environmental responsibility report, and via a nice little rollout with the help of Vice.  Everything Apple builds, they say, will one day be made from recyclable materials such as copper, aluminum, and tin. No more digging up the Earth for cobalt, tantalum, tungsten and other rare earth metals. SEE ALSO: New drone footage gives us the best look at Apple's spaceship campus yet But Apple has no public timeline to complete this goal. Lisa Jackson, the company's vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives, told Vice that company officials are a bit "nervous" because they don't have a plan, either.  Some of this seems fine — the goal, after all, is admirable, as it sets a higher target than Apple's competitors. It was even lauded (with caveats) by Greenpeace, an advocacy organization.  A man carries a bag of copper at a mine quarry and cobalt pit in Lubumbashi on May 23, 2016. Image: JUNIOR KANNAH/AFP/Getty ImagesAFP/Getty Images But Apple is choosing not to take some steps that would speed up their timeline. First, Jackson said Apple is not about to make it easier for customers to repair their own phones.  She defended that stance with this: “I think trying to pretend that we can sort of make it easy to repair the product, and that you get the product that you think you’re buying — that you want — isn’t the answer.” Apple needs minerals mined from the ground to build its products, as do its rivals. Those products are held together with special screws and other pieces you can't find in the average repair shop. This is intentional.  It means Apple can make money when it sells you an iPhone and on your return to the Apple store after you've fumbled your phone down the stairs and lacerated its screen. Instead of being able to fix your phone with readily available generic parts, each broken iPhone means more mining for the creation of specialized items.  Either that, or iPhone owners decide to buy a new one, since the price of repairs often makes it more cost-effective to just get an updated device. If repairs were made easier, though, that would increase the longevity of Apple's products, which would in turn reduce the demand for mining.  Alas. Folks trying to buy iPhones in Amsterdam. Image: lex van Lieshout/Epa/REX/Shutterstock Speaking of fewer phones, Apple has been accused of planning the demise of old devices, forcing the purchase of new ones. A December, 2015 lawsuit, for example,  alleged Apple knew a software upgrade could hamper its older devices. The company makes its recyclers shred old devices so they can't be reused. Whether you believe this is a deliberate move to create product obsolescence or not, the company does roll out new products with regularity, and it certainly doesn't discourage you from discarding your still more than functional iPhone for the shiny next edition.  Apple's environmental responsibility report acknowledges their mining goal will take "many years," and Jackson told Vice that only a marginal amount of the iPhone is currently built from recyclable materials. Perhaps that's why they haven't released a timeline and don't have a plan?  Thus far, Apple's touted recycling initiatives include "disassembly robots" that pull apart old iPhones for use in new ones, and a campaign "encouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple Renew."  Again, fine, sure. These are good things that will benefit the environment. But when a seemingly major component of your anti-mining initiative is to ask customers to give you their old devices on top of regularly purchasing those devices and repairing said devices only at your shops, it feels a little like a goal that will be achieved on a timeline tied to profit, not speed. This is hardly sufficient for the most valuable company on Earth, which prides itself on its environmental ambitions.  WATCH: iPhone 8 rumors include a 'Smart Connector' for AR headset Topics: Apple, Science, mining, repair, report, World About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

And they don’t come more off the wall than the company’s employee injury report offering hints at the rumored augmented reality glasses/headset Apple is reportedly working on. In documents leaked to Gizmodo, over 70 workplace injuries are listed, many of which are completely routine (burns in the café, a knee injury while testing the Apple Watch while snowboarding). Related: Apple's AR/VR headset - all the latest news However, a couple of reports stand out. At least two employees reported eye strain and discomfort after using an unnamed Apple prototype device. Gotta be an AR/VR prototype, right? On February 21 one employee required medical treatment after “she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” A second report revealed an “employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use.” According to Gizmodo’s inside source it could really be result of testing AR technology Tim Cook has already confirmed Apple is working on. The site gained its information after a third-party Environment Health and Safety working on Apple’s behalf accidentally sent the incident reports to hundreds of Cupertino workers.

It was accidentally sent to hundreds of Apple employees and obtained by Gizmodo. The report contains information about over 70 different incidents and offers some hints on secret products Apple may be working on. The report is entitled, 'Impact Descriptions Reported in [Santa Clara Valley] from Last Month' and is dated April 14th. It contains incident reports ranging from an employee running into a door to individually needing medical attention after testing new Apple products. One report on February 21st requiring 'medical treatment beyond first aid', involved a prototype unit at Apple’s De Anza office in Cupertino. “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis.” On March 2nd, an employee at Apple’s Vallco Parkway office in Cupertino reported eye pain. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use. He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” It's been rumored that Apple is working on a pair of augmented reality glasses and source inside Apple speculated that these injuries may have had something to do with the project. Another interesting incident happened on March 10th when an employee on the Apple Watch team injured his knee while skiing. “Watch EE team has two days ski trip (3/10-3/11) to Tahoe area to help collect core motion data for skiing/boarding activity tracking. It’s also part of team building activity. Employee has participated in the activity and had an injury on his knee.” This may indicate that Apple is planning to add skiing and snowboarding as tracked activities in the Workout app. Gizmodo details some other incidents include one where a pedestrian was struck by what may have been a Maps data collecting van.

NEW DELHI: India’s $15 billion handset industry is expected to see consolidation going forward due to heightened competition among 100 odd brands present in the market, but the fast pace of growth in the smartphone segment is set to attract investments from Apple which is seeing growth slowing in its major markets like China, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML) said in a report. “Over time, we expect the market to be consolidated as it is unviable for smaller companies to survive,” analysts at BoAML said. With improving 4G infrastructure and slowing growth in other markets like China, iPhone maker Apple is increasingly looking at the market and considers India to be a big longer term opportunity. It is now looking to set up contract manufacturing in India via its partner Wistron, which would assemble 300-400,000 iPhone SE units – its lowest price phone. The company is also looking to improve its distribution network, BoFA-ML said. “With cheaper 4G phones and a strong brand appeal, Apple could expand its reach from the current high-end niche market to a broader market over time,” analysts at the brokerage said. India is currently the fastest growing smartphone market in the world with a 2017/2018 estimated year-on-year growth rate of 22%/30% against 6%/7% global growth, the house said. The growth is largely driven by the launch of 4G services by telecom operators, declining data prices and smartphone average selling prices, and discounted 4G services offered by new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm that is enticing users to upgrade to 4G smartphones. Samsung currently leads the market but Chinese companies are rapidly increasing their presence, given their relatively cheaper costs. BoFA-ML added that Indian brands are losing market share to Chinese companies who are offering value for money products. Chinese handset vendors have increased their market share to 46% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 16 from 14% in a year earlier period. Smartphone sales are expected to be strong over the next four to five years, the report said, adding that online sales have also benefitted the growth. Moreover, the shortening handset replacement cycle as a result of the desire for consumers to upgrade their phones with 4G compatibility and better features are also driving the growth. BoAML analysts though believe that the feature phone market will continue to be relevant as it caters to the low-end consumers. “In fact, of late the growth in the low-end smartphone market has been slower than the mid-segment due to a slowdown in conversions of feature phone users as the price differential is stark,” they said, adding that ease of use, long battery life and durability of feature phones are ensuring that this market will continue to remain. Additionally, the introduction of VoLTE feature phone by Jio may further spur the handset growth. Home-bred company Micromax is also launching VoLTE feature phone, Bharat One, to tap the potential. “In our view, bringing down the price of VoLTE enabled handsets will increase the incentive for consumers to buy these phones in order to access free VoLTE services being offered by Jio,” the analysts said. While noting India has seen increased smartphone assembly, the reports said that the upcoming shift to the GST regime is also leading to uncertainty amongst manufacturers as the current taxes will be subsumed under the new tax structure, impacting this duty differential. It said that the duty differential could still be achieved under GST by increasing custom duty on imported phones; exemption by way of refund/rebate given to manufactures, and higher incentives granted on local value addition. The brokerage said that the 11.5% duty differential on manufacturing against importing is incentivizing companies to assemble in India. Currently, there are 40 assembling units in India contributing to $8 billion in revenues.

The video, narrated by Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, explains that the solar facilities powering the company’s China operations are built high enough off the ground that the sun can both be absorbed by the panels and help the grass grow. The design promotes sustainable farming practices and helps feed local livestock — like yaks.

Before the company moves in, here's what you need to know. This month, Apple employees will begin moving into the company's brand new multi-billion cheerio-shaped campus (some say "spaceship," I say cheerio). What amazing and original name hath Apple bestowed upon this soon-to-be icon of Silicon Valley; the crowning jewel that sits atop decades of cutting-edge design, technology, and branding? (*drumroll*) Apple Park. Kind of meh, right? What "Apple Park" lacks in branding pizazz, it makes up for in architectural oomph. The campus was a passion project conceived by Steve Jobs during his final years and is truly a work of high-end structural engineering. Here are some of the coolest facts about the new complex. 1) Once the dust settles, the total cost of the campus is expected to be about $5 billion (or, for a point of reference, slightly more than the annual GDP of the entire nation of Mauritania). 2) The initial land purchase was cobbled together from nine Cupertino properties that were completed in 2006 (though additional nearby land purchases would follow). It is reported that Apple kept its identity secret during its initial land buying spree to stop a bidding war and keep prices down. 3) Once fully operational, the campus will house up to 12,000 employees. For those keeping track, that's about the population of Mariehamn, the capital city of the autonomous Finnish territory of Aland. 4) The Park's employee café can seat around 3,000 patrons. To put that number in context, it's roughly equal to the number of currently active players on every team in the MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL. 5) The Park's 1,000-seat auditorium will be named the Steve Jobs Theater. Probably not intentional, but the auditorium doesn't not resemble a turtleneck. An illustration of "Steve Jobs Theater." 6) The Park's inner courtyard will be home to a 30-acre green space complete with mini fruit orchards including apricot, olive, and apple trees. The space will also host an herb garden and pond. How very Zen! 7) The campus will be exceedingly eco-friendly. According to a release from Apple, the site will be "one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world" and "will run entirely on renewable energy." Energy sources will come from solar panels on the roof and supplemented by on-campus Bloom Energy Servers, which run off of harvested methane. 8) Parking is built both underground and in two large parking structures accommodating approximately 14,200 employees. Hopefully, Steve Jobs stipulated that there be bountiful parking for disabled drivers—according to his official biography, all throughout his life, the late CEO was known to park in handicapped spaces on the reg. (He was kind of a huge jerk!) 9) Not only will parking be plentiful, but it will reportedly be managed by sensors and apps, which will manage traffic and parking spaces. 10) There will be 300 car-charging stations and 2,000 bicycle parking spaces. How Silicon Valley, right? 11) There's much more to the Park than the eye can see. The structure will be four stories above the ground, but will also include three stories below ground. 12) The campus was conceived by Steve Jobs but designed by British architect Norman Foster, who designed the famous egg-shaped 30 Street Mary Axe in London (among many many other notable buildings). Related The Most Annoying Features in iOS 10 The Most Annoying Features in iOS 10 13) The campus's ring-shaped main building will cover 2.8 million square feet. That's about 49 standard football fields. 14) All the windows on the outside of the building are curved and, according to Apple, are made of "the world's largest panels of curved glass." 15) The campus will house two separate buildings just for a secure highly secure R&D department.

Companies such as Apple would love for you to ditch your credit cards completely and instead use Apple Pay through an iPhone. One argument in favor of this is cards are less secure by design, but that's set to change if a new biometric card proves popular. Mastercard today unveiled a new payment card with an embedded fingerprint sensor and therefore a whole new layer of security. By placing the sensor directly on the card, it ensures the person who owns the card must be present with their finger on the card to complete a transaction. That is, of course, assuming the store you're in supports the feature through its card terminals. Mastercard says no new hardware is required for authentication to work, however. If you're thinking this all sounds very familiar, it may be because Mastercard first talked about a card with a fingerprint sensor back in 2014. The card goes hi-tech with #biometrics https://t.co/5n6ZBUzLN9 pic.twitter.com/sobcSAoRjB — Mastercard News (@MastercardNews) April 20, 2017 In order to function, the card needs to know what the owner's fingerprint is. This is achieved by a bank recording your fingerprint, turning it into an encrypted digital template, and storing it on the card before handing it over to the new owner. Related Synaptics Fingerprint Sensor Works Through Glass Synaptics Fingerprint Sensor Works Through Glass Trials of the biometric card are already underway in South Africa through the supermarket retailer Pick n Pay and Barclays Africa subsidiary Asba Bank. The trials will be expanded over the next few months to include locations across Europe and Asia Pacific, and then Mastercard expects a "full roll out" of the system before the end of 2017. In order for security to work, it really needs to be transparent for the user trying to protect themselves. I think Mastercard managed to achieve that with this new card. The card holder doesn't need to do anything different beyond being a little more accurate with finger placement when paying. The rest is automatic. And with fingerprint authentication enabled, there's very little point in stealing the card, or in fact the user panicking if it is stolen.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone X Concept with Full Vision Display is Perhaps the iPhone of Our Dreams By Uzair Ghani 20 hours ago 11Shares Share Tweet Submit A brand new iPhone concept has surfaced and it, without a doubt, envisions an Apple smartphone straight out of our dreams. iPhone X with Full Vision Display is the Perfect Tenth Anniversary Smartphone from Apple – If Only it Was Real If you look at the current trend in the smartphone space, then it’s absolutely clear that bezels are on their way out. Apart from that, manufactures are taking things to the edge (literally) by adding a curved panel on either sides of their smartphones. This is an aesthetically pleasing touch, and something which is believed Apple will follow as well with the release of the iPhone 8 later this year. Related Apple Reported to Sell up to 230 Million New iPhones – Chip Makers Have Started to Stock Solutions But it’s absolutely unclear how Apple might go about this from a design perspective. Though we have leaked schematics that claim to be the real deal, but everything is still uncertain at this point in time. However, concept artists are churning out mockups from time to time imagining what the next iPhone will bring to the table. Today’s concept is no different except that it looks like something straight from Apple itself, equipped with a Full Vision display that touches all four corners of the smartphone, leaving no bezel behind at all. Adding a display only at the front means that Apple would have to move the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to a brand new location. If there’s anything to take from the Android side of the fence, then moving the sensor to the back of the smartphone makes logical sense. Also, the iPhone X concept envisions the device having a dual lens setup like the iPhone 7 Plus, except that the they are placed in a vertical order.

Name: Subject: Message: Why the US market is so hard to crack Features Newsby Robert Triggs10 hours ago 44 110 12 2017 hasn’t been very good year so far for LeEco, the China-based smartphone company with big ambitions for the US market. After struggling to pay its US staff and laying off a third of its regional workforce, firing employees in India, selling its expensive Silicon Valley property, canceling its acquisition of Vizio, and shutting down its EcoPass video service, the company has had more than its share of bad headlines already. Many of LeEco’s current problems stem from what’s looking increasingly like a miscalculated bid to enter the lucrative US smartphone market, combined with the company’s huge rate of expansion. LeEco apparently hoped to generate over $100 million in revenue following its October 2016 launch in the US, but has allegedly managed just $15 million in that timeframe. Even so, LeEco plans to stick around and fight it out in the country. Misunderstanding the market If following the world of smartphones over the years has taught me anything it’s just how rigid the US smartphone market is compared with much of the world. Consumer interest is still predominantly focused on premium tier flagships, with Apple and Samsung catering to the bulk of the market. Then there’s the tough carrier, patent, and regulatory requirements that make it difficult for smaller companies to gain a foothold. With the focus firmly on premium products, there’s also a certain expectation associated with the buying experience. Perusing the Apple Store or chatting to your local carrier rep is part of the buying experience for many in the country. Hammering the refresh button on a web browser hoping to strike it lucky is not what the majority of US consumers look forward to when buying a new phone. The makeup of the US market has barely moved in the past 3 years, suggesting a strong preference for a few select brands. Source: comScore LeEco appeared to have misunderstood this key difference when it originally launched its smartphone range in the US using the “flash sale” method. While popular in India, China, and some other regions, this isn’t a phenomenon that US customers are familiar with and not one that competes well with the convenient, premium experience that many consumers have come to expect when buying a phone. LeEco eventually dropped this in favor of selling through stores such as Amazon and Best Buy, but this was only ever part of the retail challenge facing the launch. See also: LeEco ditches flash sales, will sell its phones at Amazon, Best Buy and Target November 29, 2016 Like it or not, carriers remain the gatekeepers of the US smartphone market. The US remains stubborn in its reliance on carrier-subsidized handsets and physical store locations. Without the likes of T-Mobile, Verizon, or Sprint plugging LeEco’s wares, the company was only ever going to have a shot at a relatively small target audience. When you study the cautious talk of US expansions plans from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi, you can see where LeEco jumped the gun. As is rather common of Chinese handsets, the company’s Le Pro3 and Le S3 smartphones don’t have the support of CDMA based carriers, instantly locking out customers on Verizon, Sprint, and Boost networks. However, the company still retained ambitious launch plans. Meanwhile, Xiaomi has been stocking up on patents, some related to cellular modem technology, and Huawei has been gradually testing the waters in the US with small GSM only launches. Huawei only recently signed up its first carriers (Rogers, Fido, Bell and Videotron in Canada), all while gradually improving its modem technology to match local standards, possibly with an eye to getting carriers onboard soon. Spread too thin Of course, there’s more to LeEco’s current financial woes than a few months of misjudged handset launches. The company is also developing and maintaining a much larger product portfolio than most other smartphone companies, but it may be spreading its efforts far too thin to have the meaningful impact that the company is after. Alongside smartphones, LeEco offers a range of TVs, media boxes, Bluetooth speakers, and headphones. The company is also investing heavily in the autonomous vehicle market, and debuted its LeSEE Pro last year. Alongside smartphones, LeEco offers a range of TVs, media boxes, Bluetooth speakers, and headphones. We’ve even seen oddities such as an Android-powered bicycle. The company is also investing heavily in the autonomous vehicle market, having debuted its LeSEE Pro concept car in the closing months of 2016. Then there’s the company’s large video and entertainment business, maintained from the days of LeTV, which includes television, film, and sports broadcasting in China. LeEco also has history providing music streaming and cloud storage, which was all packaged into its ill fated EcoPass platform that offered consumers exclusive content from partners including Sling TV, Machinima, and Seeso. The company had big plans for upselling content and services to customers to help generate profits from its low cost smartphones, but this strategy is heavily reliant on getting phones in consumer hands in the first place. See also: Not just smartphones: LeEco plans $1.8 billion self-driving car factory August 11, 2016 The company has also been expanding into new territories at an extraordinary rate. As well as making moves into the US market, the company recently put an Asia Pacific expansion on hold, as well as trying to increase its market share in China and India. Then there’s the cancelled Vizio merger, and the large number of expensive business properties that the company has bought up. Unfortunately for LeEco, capital to fund these expensive investments has repeatedly been thin on the ground. The company has been lurching between investor rounds, having recently secured another $2.2 billion from a selection of Chinese backers. However, that doesn’t appear to be enough for the company to afford its luxurious expansion plans, with staff layoffs and property sales dominating news about the company in the past month. LeEco has been attempting to expand very quickly, but the sheer number of undertakings has resulted in a loss of focus and put a strain on the finances required to make breakthroughs in tough markets like the US. Learning from its competitors This isn’t to say that it’s impossible to carve out a niche in the US market with some clever planning. Apple and Samsung aren’t the only two brands operating in the country, after all. A good example is to look at the relative success of brands like BLU and ZTE, two companies that have managed to carve out sustainable niches for themselves in the lower cost smartphone market. ZTE’s Axon 7, for example, managed to stand out not only because it does a good job at undercutting the competition, but also because it offers consumers a better audio experience than most, held a Nougat preview program for fans, unlocks phones on request, and hopped in early with features like Google Daydream. That’s a fair number of selling points, which helps to curate interest and a dedicated fanbase. Related Articles   OnePlus 3T reviewJanuary 31, 2017   ZTE Axon 7 reviewJuly 25, 2016 LeEco has plans for upselling content and services to customers, but this strategy is heavily reliant on getting phones in consumer hands first. Similarly, OnePlus has managed to secure itself a dedicated US following, despite lacking store support and data on CDMA carriers. Although not competing with the big players for market share, this support gives the company a platform with which to expand. LeEco’s selling point is its range of extra services and its vision to tie all of its technologies together at some point down the line. However, there’s already a lot of competition for video streaming services, cloud storage, and wireless audio gear, and many consumers aren’t so easily convinced of these proprietary platforms compared with the range of options already out there. On the smartphone front, the Le range is OK if you’re in the market for a low cost model, but lacks the refinement and features to compete with what’s on offer from super-mid and flagship rivals in the country. It seems likely that LeEco’s issue stems from splitting resources, talent, and efforts between its automotive, video, smartphone, and other initiatives, to thinly. Readjusting to focus on mobile as its main goal, as many successful smaller smartphone brands do, might give the company the Western platform it needs to make a success of its other products. Wrap up Although LeEco’s recent spate of bad news and financial difficulties highlights the problems faced by relatively unknown smartphone brands looking to make inroads in the US, the company is far from alone. Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO, and others are all taking measured approaches to entering the US market, with various plans to tackle the difficulty of CDMA networking patents, carrier support, storefront shelf space, and of course the marketing dominance of the big two brands. In the years to come, these companies may finally crack a formula that sets them on a level playing field with Samsung and Apple, but we’re not there yet.

It turns out Apple has an entire Skin Safety team to ensure products like an Apple Watch band aren’t harmful to wearers or the environment around them. Given the problems Fitbit endured through not properly testing its bands down the years, this is a prudent move. However, in order to do that, Apple needs a lot of sweat for use in its lab tests. Related: iPhone 8 So, rather than employ an army athletes and harvesting their perspiration (and we wouldn’t put it past Apple to have this either), Apple has a guy who creates buckets of synthetic sweat. During its tests, Apple goes through 30 gallons of the stuff every year. So, if you happen to meet someone who works for Apple try to bear in mind that among all of those guys and gals working at the cutting edge of Apple Watch innovation, there’s a guy who works hard to ensure you don’t get a rash when you start sweating. The video, released by Apple (via The Verge), commemorates Earth Day 2017. Earlier we brought word of Apple’s vow to stop mining for precious materials in order to build iPhones. While the vow could be a turning point for an industry that has continually pilfered the world’s natural resources, Apple stopped short of setting itself a deadline.

Expects to Continue to Supply Apple Inc. Despite an ugly legal battle between these two companies, Qualcomm still expects to supply Apple now and going forward. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 20, 2017 at 2:00PM For years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had relied exclusively on cellular modems from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to power its iPhone line of products. However, beginning with the iPhone 7, Apple chose to dual-source the modem from both Qualcomm and chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel appears to have gotten a significant amount of iPhone share, but that share is necessarily capped because Intel's modems don't support the CDMA standard, while Qualcomm's do. Image source: Apple. Intel's upcoming XMM 7560 cellular modem -- which should be ready in time for Apple's 2018 iPhone -- fixes this deficiency by adding support for CDMA. Given the legal battle between Qualcomm and Apple, there has been some concern and/or speculation that Apple might ultimately drop Qualcomm modems altogether in favor of Intel ones. Per comments Qualcomm made on its most recent earnings call, though, it seems that Qualcomm management isn't expecting Apple to sole-source from Intel in the foreseeable future. Qualcomm staying in the Apple supply chain In prepared remarks made by Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf on the company's April 19 earnings call, the executive said the company "will continue to focus on developing and delivering the best products to [its] customers, including Apple, consistent with [Qualcomm's] track record to date." Image source: Qualcomm. Mollenkopf further said that, "considering the strength of both [Qualcomm's] product roadmap and [research and development] investments, [Qualcomm] expect[s] to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the future." Business and investment implications The way I view this is a "lack of significantly more downside" rather than, say, significant potential upside. It's better for Qualcomm to be in the Apple loop than to be completely cut out; this is a reasonably sized revenue stream that clearly contributes positively to gross profit and, ultimately, net income. So, if Qualcomm can defend what share it has at Apple, that'd obviously be good. At the same time, it's hard to get too excited for Qualcomm. Unless Intel really drops the ball in terms of future modem technology development (this becomes decreasingly likely as time passes, as Intel gains experience), I find it unlikely that Apple will want to go back to sole-sourcing cellular modems from Qualcomm -- especially in light of the allegations it has put forth against Qualcomm. So, while Qualcomm's statements seem to suggest that its iPhone cellular modem percent share has a non-zero floor, I don’t see much potential share upside, either. Foolish takeaway It's not a surprise that Qualcomm intends to continue to do business with Apple. After all, Apple has been in fiercer litigation before against a supplier (Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF)), and even as those two companies fought legal battles, Apple kept buying parts from Samsung. What I think will be interesting to see is what kind of modem share Qualcomm captures in Apple's upcoming iPhone models. Intel's upcoming XMM 7480 modem still won't support CDMA, so on networks that require CDMA, Qualcomm modems will be the only choice. The reason I'm interested in potential share shifts in this cycle is because I want to see if my hypothesis that Apple is using Qualcomm where it needs to while using Intel everywhere else holds up. If that hypothesis is correct, then we shouldn't see much of a shift during this product cycle, because Qualcomm already lost the share it was going to with the last product cycle. If Qualcomm loses significant additional share at Apple this cycle, then we'll know that my hypothesis was incorrect.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Video What happens to companies that depend on the iPhone? Apple and Nike are launching a new Apple Watch model at the end of the month, but it’s hard to spot any major upgrades in the Apple Watch NikeLab. The Apple Watch NikeLab is a limited-edition model with a Space Grey aluminum case and a “light bone” and black Nike Sports Band. This model sports the “NikeLab Innovation x Innovators” logo on the back. Just like the Apple Watch Nike+ models that were first unveiled in 2016, this is a Series 2 model running the latest watchOS 3 with built-in GPS and water-resistance. In addition, the NikeLab model is also integrated with the Nike+ Run Club and has exclusive Siri commands catering to runners. Apple Watch NikeLab will go on sale starting April 27 on Nike.com, at NikeLab doors and at an Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan. Notably, this NikeLab model will not be available on Apple.com, nor at any other Apple store locations. Why this matters: Save for the neutral-toned band and the NikeLab logo, Apple Watch NikeLab seems near-identical to the previous Apple Watch Nike+ models. So it just sounds like Nike wanted to extend this collaboration and promote itself as an “innovative” company with an internal “lab.” Unfortunately, the only innovative thing that’s new about NikeLab’s product is the use of a weird, made-up color: bone. Perhaps Apple is throwing Nike a bone, by giving the company an exclusive product to drive people to Nike.com and to the NikeLab locations to see all the other innovative bone-colored stuff they sell.

Do these 10 things first Our 10 favorite iOS apps of 2016: From Instagram Stories to Pokémon Go 38 must-know secrets and shortcuts for your Apple TV Video Hands-on with Apple's new video-editing app, Clips When Apple released the iPhone 6s in 2015, the company also introduced Live Photos, a picture that, when you tap it on your iPhone, becomes a 1.5 second video clip. It’s a fun feature, but it has limitations. It’s not easy to post a Live Photo on the web, for example. Nearly two years after Live Photos made its debut, Apple has finally revealed the Live Photo API. The API makes it easier for developers to post Live Pictures to the web or to add Live Pictures support in an app. Apple’s developer website features details on a software development kit for building apps for iOS, macOS, and tvOS. For web developers who want to put a Live Photos player on the web, Apple has a JavaScript-based Live Photos API called LivePhotosKit. What this means to you: Some social networks, like Tumblr and Facebook, figured out how to support Live Photos on their websites, but many other sites (especially photo-sharing sites) have not figured it out. This is a frustration of Live Photos enthusiasts who feel like the full impact of their photos are not being felt by viewers, or that the intent of their phots aren’t being preserved online. The Live Photos API is a boon for developers; they now support a form of content that’s popular with iPhone users. And it’s a boon for users, who get to see their Live Photos presented as intended.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market View All Editorials → Apple Plans to Make iPhones Without Mining for Materials Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet 1 minute read Apr 20th, 2017 11:18 AM EDT | News Apple has a lofty goal to stop relying on mining for the raw materials needed to make iPhones, iPads, and Macs. There isn’t a plan for how the company will accomplish that, or at least there isn’t one yet. Apple plans to use recycling instead of mining for iPhone raw materials The problem Apple is facing is that some of the metals and toxic materials for electronic devices are mined, and in some cases that involves child labor and slave labor. Apple has a history of pushing for better environmental responsibility and is an advocate for better working conditions, so it makes sense that the company wants to distance itself from these mining and labor issues. Apple’s commitment doesn’t, however, include a plan. Apple Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson told Vice, We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it. So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going. Apple does say in its 2017 environmental report, “One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.” So Apple’s idea is to recycle the raw materials that have already been mined. The trick now is to figure out how to actually make that happen. That’ll involve recycling on a whole new scale, and finding additional sources for those reclaimed raw materials. Jackson said Apple is looking to purchase recycled metals from suppliers and combine those with materials harvested from old products customers return. Apple doesn’t have a time frame yet, which makes sense considering the plan right now is little more than a commitment. Still, Apple keeps moving forward with its environmental initiatives. The company continues to reduce the toxins in its devices, and nearly all the power for Apple’s corporate and retail locations comes from renewable sources. Now it looks like Apple is ready to take on the environmental and human issues surrounding mining operations.

But in the real world of increasing demand and recycling inefficiencies, there will always be some materials in short supply. Apple won’t ever reach 100%. They’ll get close, probably closer than most think. But they will always need something. Even if they’re recycling other companies products as well as their own. 100% is not going to happen. April 20, 2017 at 11:22 EDT AM JBSlough April 20, 2017 Maybe they should offer real trade-in deals for their products, especially the Mac, when buying new ones. If that happens at least the device doesn’t end up in a land fill eventually. Apple somehow needs to get control of its older products instead of relying on people recycling them. April 20, 2017 at 11:35 EDT AM geoduck April 20, 2017 JBSlough Good point…except what if it ended up with Apple and others switching to a lease program. I mean the surest way to make sure all the computers came back would be if you paid X$ per year and got a new one every year. A fair number of people already do this with phones. That would increase the ‘churn’ getting new hardware out there and the old stuff back for recycling. Can’t say I’m fond of the idea but it would reduce the number of computers in landfills.

Apple bought the rights to the film based on music industry legend Clive Davis’s autobiography. Apple lands exclusive rights to Clive Davis documentary for Apple Music Davis is the producer behind artists such as Aretha Franklin, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen, and Alicia Keys. He spent more than 50 years in the record industry and has won five Grammys for his work. The announcement that Apple bought the rights to the documentary was announced just before its Tribeca premier, according to Deadline. The plan is to release the movie exclusively on Apple Music. Davis commented on the deal saying, “It is a touching honor to share the music and unique stories that have shaped my career with millions of Apple Music subscribers around the world.” Acquiring the rights to the documentary is in line with Apple’s original content plans. Shows like Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps are already on the way, as is an original series Vital Signs based on Dr. Dre’s life. Apple Music currently offers streaming music and some video content including concerts, but Apple’s ambitions clearly go beyond that. Original content is a big part of the long term Apple Music game plan, and getting the exclusive rights to a big name documentary like Clive Davis: The Soundtrack Of Our Lives shows just how serious Apple is.

Apple's iPad Fights For the Education Market View All Editorials → Apple’s 5th Avenue Store Glass Cube Dismantling is Only Temporary Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet 1 minute read Apr 20th, 2017 9:29 AM EDT | News A New York City building permit is making the rounds and raising eyebrows because it’s for removing the iconic glass cube entrance covering the 5th Avenue Apple store. The cube is coming down, but only temporarily, because it’s in the way of Apple’s renovation plans. Apple is removing the 5th Ave store’s glass cube entrance, but it’ll be back The permit, which you can see on buildzoom, shows Apple was granted a remodeling permit on April 17th for “full removal of glass cubical structure at apple store entrance.” That sounds pretty ominous, but it makes sense to dismantle the cube. As Techcrunch noted, the cube covers the easiest and biggest access point into the underground store. Apple is doubling the store’s size, so there’s a lot of construction material that needs to come into—and out of—the location before they’re done. The project is so big that Apple has temporarily moved the store into a nearby location until the project is complete. Apple’s only comment on the glass cube has been, We look forward to creating an incredible new Apple Fifth Avenue, where our customers will enjoy new services and experiences in a much larger space. While construction is underway all 800 employees will serve our visitors from around the world at a fully-functional store next door at 767 Fifth Ave, also open 24 hours a day. We’d like to thank our customers and neighbors for their understanding as we complete the renovation. Since the 5th Avenue store is completely underground Apple needs something to mark the entrance so shoppers can easily find the location. The glass cube is synonymous with the store, so it’s a safe bet Apple will put it back up at the end of the renovation project. What we don’t know is if Apple will reassemble the same cube, or put a redesigned version in its place. Apple replaced the glass cube once already in 2011, streamlining the look by using 15 massive glass panels instead of 90 smaller ones. There could be plans to build an even more impressive cube to go along with the store expansion, but for now Apple isn’t saying. Still, the cube structure is the single most recognizable feature of the 5th Avenue store. It’ll be there when the store reopens, but it may be even cooler than before.

That’s one potential explanation being juggled for a mysterious incident report at the iPhone company, after a cache of such filings were inadvertently leaked. The handiwork of an Environment Health and Safety contractor, the document was presumably intended for internal eyes only, but was mistakenly distributed first among employees and then snuck out to Gizmodo. If you’ve ever read through an incident report in your own workplace – or, worse still, had to file one yourself – then you’ll know already that they generally don’t make for especially entertaining reading. Sure enough, the maladies and mishaps affecting Apple staff seem no different, for the most part, from what occurs in any large organization. One employee smelled what she suspected were leaking Apple Pencil batteries; another burned their hand while pulling hot fish from an oven. However, there’s at least a couple of tidbits in there which have got the rumor mill all worked up. A February 21 incident at Apple’s De Anza site affected the vision of someone in a user study, for instance, while testing out an unspecified prototype device. Whatever the gadget was, it apparently relied on using lasers near the eyes: “After BT4 user study, user advised study lead, that she experienced discomfort in her eye and said she was able to see the laser flash at several points during the study. Study lead referred her to optometrist and secured prototype unit for analysis” Apple incident report Another report, filed a few weeks later on March 2, could well be connected to the same project, though of course that’s not made clear in the document and the issue took place at a different Apple location. “Employee reported eye pain after working with new prototype, thought it may be associated with use,” the filing reads. “He noticed that the security seal on the magenta (outer) case had been broken and had thought the unit may have been tampered with.” The speculation is that this testing was connected with Apple’s work on augmented reality (AR). Although the company is traditionally coy about revealing what projects it’s working on – the significantly reworked new Mac Pro notwithstanding – CEO Tim Cook has previously voiced his enthusiasm for AR. Indeed, earlier this year Cook suggested that the technology could end up as big as the iPhone. Apple is known to have made investments in AR technology, including acquiring startups in the business. So far, though, we’ve seen only software implementations. Apple Clips, the recently released mobile video editing app, uses AR among other things to overlay digital graphics onto real-world photos and footage. The expectation, however, is that the company is also working on some sort of AR wearable, most likely a headset or pair of augmented reality glasses. There are several possibilities as to how the lasers mentioned in one of the incident reports might be involved in that, depending on the technologies Apple is using. For instance, laser projection – where graphics are created directly on the eye using a system of targeted laser light – has been used by several companies wanting to make a daylight-visible UI. Another alternative, and possibly a more likely one, is laser eye-tracking. That relies on using lasers to monitor eye movement in real-time, so that the wearer’s direction of gaze can be calculated. Such a system would be able to figure out what the user was looking at and potentially control a user-interface that way. It would likely work in conjunction with transparent displays; reports earlier this year suggested Apple was working with Carl Zeiss on such technology. Other uses for eye tracking include foveated rendering – used, notably, by VR headset maker FOVE, which Samsung invested in last year – which prioritizes the area of the scene being looked at for the maximum GPU power, downscaling the resolution of the periphery where it won’t be noticed. That’s expected to have significant impact on how good mobile graphics look, but also on power consumption, an essential consideration for what’s expected to be a mobile device. Of course, these unfortunate incidents could be about something else entirely. Apple has in the past patented designs for virtual reality goggles as well as wearable headsets that, akin to the Samsung Gear VR, rely on docking an iPhone in for use as the display.

And now that Samsung's latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S8, has hit the market, the debate resumes, especially concerning each device's photo-taking skills. To further muddy the waters, the Galaxy S8 features the same 12-megapixel sensor as the one in the Galaxy S7, but with some new software tweaks that improve image processing. To see how the S8 fares against Apple's top shooter, the iPhone 7 Plus, we took both out for multiple side-by-side comparisons. Aside from the HDR comparison, (in which we turned HDR on for both cameras), every shot was taken in auto mode without adjusting any settings or using tap to focus. Overall, the Galaxy S8 came out on top, but by the slimmest of margins. Bright Light/Landscape In a gorgeous shot of some of NYC's fine spring weather, both phones did a good job of capturing that lovely dappled light as it fell through the trees. However, if you take a close look at the tree trunk on the right, the S8's pic is just a tad sharper than that from the iPhone 7 Plus. More importantly, if you look at the differences between light and dark patches on the grass, the green in the S8's pic looks richer, and you can see each verdant blade more clearly, regardless of how much shade there is. The one area where the iPhone 7 Plus beats the S8 is on the pink flowers in the top left, where the iPhone 7 captured richer colors and features less blown out details than the S8. Winner: Galaxy S8 Macro When I shot a close-up of some flowers with each phone, I was surprised to see the results from the S8's camera. Recent Galaxy S cameras have established a reputation for capturing super bright and saturated colors, but what I got here looks muted and flat compared to the iPhone 7's photos. It's a shame, too, because if you zoom in a bit, the S8's pic is actually slightly sharper than the iPhone's. But that advantage isn't nearly enough to unsee those drab yellows and lifeless reds. It's a little disconcerting to see the S8's image quality take a step back on a shot like this. It occurred consistently across a number of close-ups and may have something to do with the partially overcast light that day. In direct sunlight, we didn't notice nearly as much of a difference. Winner: iPhone 7 MORE: Galaxy S8 Review: The Best Android Phone Will Only Get Better HDR If these shots were shown side by side, many people would not be able to immediately spot the difference. The iPhone 7 Plus' photo does a better job of capturing the color of the red bricks on the side of the building and sports a deeper blue on the sky in back. Meanwhile, the S8's pic features slightly better contrast, as evidenced by the darker shades on the pavement in the foreground and better highlights on the reflections coming off the storefront window in the middle of the picture. This one is close enough for us to call it a draw. Winner: Tie Well-Lit Nighttime While this isn't a true low-light shot, this picture of a sign at night with plenty of lights is a good situation for evaluating dynamic range, color and white balance. And across the board, the S8 comes out top. The S8's pic doesn't have the yellowish tint on the sign that you see in the iPhone's photo; it has better dynamic range, as evidenced by less blown-out details under the lights next to the walkway, and colors are generally richer than what the iPhone delivered. In fact, the leaves on the trees in the background of the S8's pic feature significantly more detail, too. Winner: Galaxy S8 Indoors Low-Light Indoors at a nearby bar, the close race continues. If you look at the light shining behind the bottles, you can see that the iPhone 7's pic has more blown-out areas compared to the S8's image, which manages to preserve more details in the center of the frame. Additionally, looking at the top shelf in the S8's photo, the shapes of glasses and reflections look significantly sharper than in the iPhone 7 Plus' shot. Winner: Galaxy S8 Outdoors Low-Light This photo is a good example of the S8's low-light prowess. Its photo is better-exposed than the iPhone 7's pic, which results in brighter colors. The S8 also captured more fine details (like on the tractor's headlights) compared to the iPhone. And the S8's picture is a little less grainy. Winner: Galaxy S8 Nighttime Cityscape One of the things I really like about the iPhone 7 Plus' camera is its restraint when taking low-light photos. Sometimes, that results in pictures that are a little too dark, but other times, it's the right move, and in this shot across the Hudson River, it really shows. The iPhone 7's pic features way fewer blown-out lights. Because its photo was shot as ISO-320 (versus ISO-1250 for the S8), the iPhone's image is considerably less noisy as well. Yes, the S8's photo has slightly richer colors, most noticeably on the pink lights in the upper right, and it might be a bit sharper, but its excessive noise makes the iPhone's photo the easy pick. Winner: iPhone 7 MORE: iPhone 7 Review: Great Upgrades, But One is Greater Selfies With an 8-megapixel cam in front, the S8's selfie shooter has a slightly higher resolution than the 7-MP one on the iPhone 7. However, that doesn't really come into play. Instead, other differences between the two cameras hold greater weight. The S8's selfie cam has a wider angle, which is good for capturing multiple people, but its shots look too smooth for my taste. It's like the camera's beauty mode is never truly off, even when the slider is set to zero. My vote goes to the iPhone 7's shot, which sports richer colors and sharper details. Winner: iPhone 7 Video While both phones are capable of capturing 4K video at 30 fps, each one has its strengths and weaknesses. The iPhone's video is smoother and less prone to the wobble that many smartphone videos (including the S8) suffer from. iPhone 7 Plus 4K Video Sample However, the S8's audio is clearer, which for better or worse, lets you more easily hear the voices of nearby pedestrians and trucks driving behind, and the footage is marginally more well-exposed. Winner: Tie Samsung Galaxy S8 4K Video Sample Overall Winner: Galaxy S8 With a final score of four rounds for the S8 versus three for the iPhone 7, the Samsung's Galaxy S8 wins this flagship camera showdown. In bright light, these cameras are essentially equal, though S8's pics are usually a tiny bit sharper and more colorful than the iPhone 7's photos (aside from the close-up shot). However, where the S8 pulls ahead is at night, where it won three out of four low-light categories. For those thinking about getting an S8, though, it will be important to learn how to use phone's pro mode, so you can dial back the ISO at night for clearer, less grainy shots. Perhaps the real takeaway is how good the top smartphones cameras are. Anyone would be happy to have either the S8 or the iPhone 7 in their pocket, which means it's important to realize the strengths and weaknesses of each camera. The S8 is generally a better shooter at night than the iPhone 7, and its photo are usually slighter sharper and bit more colorful. However, the iPhone 7 offers a more detailed and realistic selfie cam, produces consistent and accurate results across a wide variety of scenarios, and boasts some of the smoothest 4K video capture around. Then there are the bonus features, like the 7 Plus' dual cams, which makes this device a go-to for smartphone portrait photographers or those who want a true optical zoom. Overall, though, the S8 is our preferred all-around shooter, even if it's just by smidge.

Apple Forces Recyclers to Shred All iPhones and MacBooks Documents obtained by Motherboard: "No reuse. No parts harvesting. No resale." Apple released its Environmental Responsibility Report Wednesday, an annual grandstanding effort that the company uses to position itself as a progressive, environmentally friendly company. Behind the scenes, though, the company undermines attempts to prolong the lifespan of its products. Apple's new moonshot plan is to make iPhones and computers entirely out of recycled materials by putting pressure on the recycling industry to innovate. But documents obtained by Motherboard using Freedom of Information requests show that Apple's current practices prevent recyclers from doing the most environmentally friendly thing they could do: Salvage phones and computers from the scrap heap. Apple rejects current industry best practices by forcing the recyclers it works with to shred iPhones and MacBooks so they cannot be repaired or reused—instead, they are turned into tiny shards of metal and glass. "Materials are manually and mechanically disassembled and shredded into commodity-sized fractions of metals, plastics, and glass," John Yeider, Apple's recycling program manager, wrote under a heading called "Takeback Program Report" in a 2013 report to Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. "All hard drives are shredded in confetti-sized pieces. The pieces are then sorted into commodities grade materials. After sorting, the materials are sold and used for production stock in new products. No reuse. No parts harvesting. No resale." From Apple's 2013 recycling report to Michigan. Apple is fundamentally a manufacturer, not a recycling company. While its two Liam "recycling robots" looks cool in an ad, they're only capable of disassembling a total of 2.4 million phones per year; Apple sold 215.3 million iPhones in 2016. Most iPhones simply aren't making it back to Apple, and Apple doesn't have the capacity to recycle these phones. But the company is responsible for recycling thousands of tons of electronics per year thanks to a series of state-level "manufacturer responsibility" laws that require electronics companies to recycle e-waste each year based on their overall sales in that state. To learn more about its recycling practices, I have spent the last year collecting Apple's state recycling reports using Freedom of Information laws around the country. Documents from Missouri, North Carolina, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma, Washington, Michigan, and Wisconsin obtained using these FOI requests confirmed several things: A) Almost all of Apple's recycling is contracted out to third parties B) Apple products account for a tiny fraction of its overall recycling practice C) Apple does indeed have so-called "must shred" agreements with recyclers that bar them from salvaging any e-waste According to documents filed with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Apple works with "three nationally contracted recyclers." Piecing together information from several states, these recyclers are SIMS Recycling Solutions, ECS Refining, and Metech Recycling, though several recyclers I've spoken to believe Apple works with other companies as well. Apple also uses Dynamic Recycling and Advanced Technology Recycling to collect products that other companies will then recycle, and uses a company called call2recycle to recycle the batteries it collects at its retail stores. From Apple's report to North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality In 2012 in Michigan, for example, SIMS collected 412.25 tons of material on behalf of Apple; just .25 tons of this was via Apple's mailback programs, which presumably have a higher percentage of Apple products than standard e-waste collection events. The amount collected through Apple stores was so negligible that it did not even register on the report. It's not unusual that a manufacturer would use third party recyclers, but it's important to understand how the system works. Because these companies are working on Apple's behalf, Apple has complete control over what ultimately happens to the e-waste they collect. And Apple decides that everything collected on its behalf should be destroyed, even if some items could be repaired, refurbished, and resold. So Apple isn't just preventing Apple products from being salvaged, it's ensuring that everything else is getting shredded, too. A 2013 report to Illinois Documents from Illinois show that the vast majority of Apple's recycling is of televisions, printers, DVD players, VCRs, computers, and monitors. This is because older technology is heavier, more often recycled, and state recycling quotas are based on weight, not total number of items. There are, nonetheless, plenty of MacBooks and iPhones with latent value that eventually make it to electronics recyclers. "Electronics recyclers are filled with heaps of broken iMacs and MacBooks, which due to economics and the requirements of certifications are most often scrapped rather than repaired or sold," John Bumstead, a refurbisher who sells MacBooks that he salvages and frankensteins together from broken ones that he gets from recyclers that don't work with Apple, told me. "All the manufacturers talk about sustainability but when it comes down to it, their security and their brand is way more important than how the material is recycled" A document submitted to North Carolina's Department of Environment Quality in September 2016 shows that Apple's must-shred policy hasn't changed in recent years, even as it continues to position itself as a green company: "All of the equipment collected for recycling is manual and mechanically disassembled and shredded. The resulting fractions are sorted into plastics, metals, and glass and sold as stock feed in the manufacturing process." On its face, this might not seem so bad: At least these products are getting recycled, right? And it makes sense that hard drives would be shredded to protect data.  But in practice, the premature recycling of an iPhone or a MacBook is not ideal. MacBook hard drives can be removed and replaced. And the recyclers Apple uses all advertise industry-standard data destruction tools that can be used to safeguard consumer data without requiring the destruction of all of the rest of the computer or phone's parts. Bumstead still sells computers from 2009 and 2010 for hundreds of dollars to people looking for entry-level laptops. "Apple talks about responsibly recycling their own products, and they may in fact do a good job with that when they get their devices back, but Apple only receives back a small percentage of what they sell," he said. Sorted materials before they are shredded at ECS. Image: Jason Koebler In trying to source MacBooks to repair, Bumstead says he's been turned away countless times by recyclers who say they can't sell him Apple products. Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, notes that recycling "should be a last option" because unrecyclable rare earth metals are completely lost and melted down commodities are less valuable and of generally of a lower quality than freshly mined ones. Repair and reuse are much better ways to extend the value of the original mined materials. To be clear, Apple's practices are often against the wishes of the recycling companies themselves, who don't like to shred products that are still valuable. In a weird twist of fate, I visited ECS Refining before I knew that it did recycling for Apple. While I was there, I watched workers crowbar and crack open recent-model MacBook Pro Retinas—worth hundreds of dollars even when they're completely broken—to be scrapped into their base materials. At the time, I asked ECS CEO Jim Taggart how he feels about "must shred" agreements when he sees products that could have data safely deleted before being turned into parts or repaired. He called such deals an "extreme position," one his company doesn't like signing but is a core requirement from some manufacturers. "All the manufacturers talk about sustainability but when it comes down to it, their security and their brand is way more important than how the material is recycled or what you get to recycle that material," he said. "We try to encourage them to let us save what's worth saving, and in the case where we're not required to destroy material, and we always wipe the drives prior to reselling it." "Giving up old products to Apple is generally a foolish financial decision" ECS, SIMS, Apple, Metech, and Dynamic Recycling did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Apple has recently started a reuse program of its own, but it's a program that requires direct return of the product to Apple, it offers only Apple Store gift cards, and offers prices that are far below what the products are worth on the open market. It's also a program that's not widely known and does not capture any of the products that end up at run-of-the-mill e-waste collection sites or electronics recyclers. "It is naive to believe that Apple's own efforts represent a solution to a significant chunk of the problem," Bumstead said. "Giving up old products to Apple is generally a foolish financial decision—an old Apple product is often still worth hundreds of dollars, and consumers are well aware of this. eBay, Craigslist, and other marketplaces represent a healthy economy of millions of products that are sold, repaired, and reused." Apple can say that it wants to revolutionize the recycling industry, but right now, it's just holding it back.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple to Introduce Bezel-Less iPhone 8 as Samsung Prepares to Compete w/ Dual-Camera Galaxy Note 8 By Rafia Shaikh Apr 18, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit KGI: Galaxy S8 selling better than expected; Note 8 will copy iPhone 7 Plus dual camera setup; Apple to copy bezel-less S8 design Ming-Chi Kuo, a trusted name in the murky world of leaks and rumors – is out today with new investor reports, focusing mainly on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 reception and expectations for Galaxy Note 8 and Apple’s iPhone 8. In his investor report, Kuo of KGI has said that Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be the company’s first dual-camera smartphone. Kuo adds that despite his earlier remarks on Galaxy S8 lacking “attractive selling points,” the S8 duo is selling better than expected, raising his own shipping estimates for the handset. Galaxy Note 8 to bring dual camera setup that will match iPhone 8 Kuo has said that the introduction of dual camera setup will be “the most important upgrade” in the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. He adds that the “Note 8’s dual-camera will be much better than that of iPhone 7 Plus, and likely match that of OLED iPhone.” The iPhone 7-inspired dual camera design was one of the most talked about iPhone 7 Plus features, bringing extra add-ons like the Portrait Mode and the artificial depth of field effect that is meant to give the illusion of using a high-end DSLR. Kuo believes that Note 8 could exceed iPhone 7 Plus camera performance and match the performance of Apple’s rumored iPhone 8 – one of the three expected iPhones for this year. Related Samsung Completes 2nd Generation 10nm FinFET Process – Get Ready for 10 Percent Greater Performance Galaxy Note 8 dual camera setup is rumored to feature 12MP wide-angle CIS supporting dual photodiode (2PD), 13MP telephoto CIS, 3x optical zoom, dual 6P lenses and dual optical image stabilization. This camera design has already appeared in leaked images of what was being called a Galaxy S8+ prototype. In a note released to investors (obtained by AppleInsider), Kuo has focused on this feature calling it the most important new upgrade that could possibly help Samsung finally get rid of those fiery Note 7 images. Kuo added that Samsung Galaxy Note 8 will be a 6.4-inch QHD+ OLED handset with a full-screen design and a rear-facing fingerprint sensor, powered by Exynos 8895 processor. Advertisement Galaxy S8 and S8+ selling better than expected thanks to their bezel-less design Additionally, Kuo has also talked about the early reception of Samsung Galaxy S8, saying that the bezel-less design has helped the company get a better reaction than expected. Apple is also expected to introduce a bezel-less design with iPhone 8 – a massive design overhaul for iPhone that has largely remained untouched over the past few years. But, it isn’t clear whether Apple will also consider fitting a rear-facing Touch ID especially after seeing negative feedback on this particular design choice made by Samsung for Galaxy S8. We now expect full-screen design will accelerate penetration of the high-end smartphone segment over the next few years, thanks to adoption by S8 and the new 2H17F OLED iPhone model. Kuo noted that the feedback on Galaxy S8 and S8+ has been “better than expected,” which is why KGI has increased 2017 shipment predictions by 10 million units. The analyst believes this positive reception is largely due to the full-screen design that has offset concerns over a back-mounted fingerprint sensor. Related Another Galaxy S8 Prototype Reveals a Dual-Camera Setup – Missed Opportunity? According to our survey, market feedback to Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ (abbreviated as ‘S8’) has been better than expected since their unveiling. We attribute this to a better- than-expected selling point in the full-screen design. For this reason, we revise up our 2017F S8 shipments from 40-45mn units to 50-55mn units. Post-launch market response a big thumbs up for full-screen design, offsetting our concerns. Although the full-screen design has not created any new applications, its form factor will be effective in attracting high-end users. This is why market feedback has exceeded our expectations. KGI expects Samsung to sell 50 million to 55 million units of Galaxy S8 duo and 13 to 15 million units of Galaxy Note 8 in fiscal 2017.

Chris Burns - Apr 20, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Today Apple launched LivePhotosKit JS Live Photos API software for developers, enabling use in iOS apps, macOS, and on the web. Developers can utilize the new Live Photos SDK (software developer kit) with sample code – to do this, developers must download Xcode, which includes the SDK’s for building apps that support Live Photos. Developers will also gain access to details on how to build app extensions and entire apps using the new Live Photos API. This is the first time developers have had access to Live Photos API since the first announcement of Live Photos back in September of 2015. Live Photos are essentially tiny movies, captured by the iPhone in bursts of 3 seconds. Apple describes the recording to be “1.5-seconds before and after you take a picture.” Apple describes this feature as “more than a great photo – but a moment captured with movement and sound.” More important than the file it creates is how Apple devices handle it. The “Live Photos” feature was first announced with the iPhone 6s, running on iOS 9 and up once launched. All iPhones from that point on had access to capture of Live Photos – so long as they were as powerful or more powerful than the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. Users of iPhones 6s and up can capture a Live Photo with the standard Camera app. An early problem for Live Photos was accidental capture of lifting or dropping of phones before and after photos. That was corrected not long after it was released. The entire thing can be turned off, too, with that button in the center of the options in the Camera app – the two solid rings inside two dotted-rings. Those of you wondering if Live Photos are bigger than standard photos – yes and no. Yes, enabling Live Photos results in more space being taken up by the camera app. But no, because the space isn’t being taken up by photo files, it’s being taken up by the .MOV files that accompany them with Live Photos. Have a peek at this feature from the initial outrage. To edit Live Photos, Apple’s enabled editing in their standard Photos app. Tapping the three lines with dots on them inside any Live Photo in Photos will allow editing of several sorts. But it’s all for naught unless everyone can see the result. That’s why Apple is expanding the means with which Live Photos can be experienced fully. Several popular apps have integrated Live Photos into their regular working schedule over the past couple of years. You can upload Live Photos to Facebook with ease. Users can also share Live Photos to Instagram with movement. With Apple’s release of the Live Photos API, more than just the most popular apps will be able to join in on the fun. For Developers that wish to take part in this release, there’s the Live Photos for Developers page that Apple’s made for clicking. Jump in on it and let us know what you’ve created!

Since then, we’ve seen companies like Google and Facebook work to make sharing Live Photos easier, and now Apple is doing the same. Apple has released a new LivePhotoKit JS API that aims to make it easier for iOS users to embed Live Photos on the web. This means that web developers will have to add the LivePhotoKit JS API to their site, and then Live Photos embeds will be supported.  Previously, you could only shared Live Photos on iOS and macOS, so this new API can expose your Live Photos to many more people. Of course, it’s up to the web developers to add this API to their sites, so you’ll have to wait for your favorite sites to enable support before you can start sharing your Live Photos with everyone on the web. Still, it’s good to see Apple making Live Photos easier to share and giving iOS users more of a reason to use them. Do you use Live Photos?

Apps iOS Apps Mac Apps Accessories Tips Jailbreaking Jailbreak Tweaks How to Jailbreak Unlock Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV Deals Latest Deals Apple launches JavaScript API for embedding Live Photos on the web Christian Zibreg on April 20, 2017 0 Apple on Thursday announced a new JavaScript-based API for web developers who wish to enable embedding of Live Photos in their websites and web apps. Called LivePhotosKit JS, the new API is in addition to Apple’s current Live Photos API which enables Live Photos on iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Mac devices and in apps that use it, like Facebook’s mainland mobile app, Tumblr for iOS and others. The LivePhotosKit JS API is available on NPM. Code samples are available as part of Apple’s LivePhotosKit JS API reference. An embeddable web player can be configured with photo and video resources and other options, with developers able to control its behavior and playback programmatically. TUTORIAL: How to use Live Photos in Instagram Stories Developers must include Apple’s LivePhotosKit JavaScript code on their website. Some of the parameters that can be used include the locations of the photo and video components of a Live Photo, whether or not the player will prefetch data before the user attempts to begin playback, if the playback controls are enabled for the user and more. The player is supported on the following browsers: iOS—Safari and Chrome macOS—Safari, Chrome and Firefox Android (performance depends on device)—Chrome (beta) Windows—Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer 11 As Live Photos may take a long time to download, Apple recommends explicitly specifying the height and width of the HTML element being decorated to be a Live Photos player. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube “If the photo takes too long, it will not be able to show the progress badge,“ explains the firm. “Downsizing assets will greatly improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.” As you know, Live Photos consist of two components—a still photo and a video of the moments 1.5 seconds before and 1.5 seconds after the photo is taken. Live Photos can be captured on iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus. Devices supporting viewing Live Photos include iPhone, iPad and iPod touch with iOS 9 or later, Mac models with OS X El Capitan or later and Apple Watch models on watchOS 2 or later. “In addition to playback, users can share their Live Photos within your app on iOS, macOS and the web,” noted the Cupertino company.

Macs & Mac OS X | 20 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (3) iLife and iWork Apps Now Free for Everyone by Josh Centers Once upon a time, Apple used to charge for nearly all its software, and especially productivity apps like the iLife and iWork suites. However, back in 2013, Apple made those apps free with the purchase of any new Mac or iOS device (see “New Free iLife and iWork Apps Share across Devices and Platforms,” 22 October 2013). Now, with no announcement or fanfare, Apple has made the current iLife and iWork apps entirely free for all users. Just to be clear, the change affects the following apps: GarageBand for macOS (requires Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite) and iOS (requires iOS 10.2) iMovie for macOS (requires Mac OS X 10.11.2 El Capitan) and iOS (requires iOS 9.3) Keynote for macOS (requires macOS 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Numbers for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) Pages for macOS (requires 10.12 Sierra) and iOS (requires iOS 10) This is good news for holdouts who haven’t purchased a new eligible Apple device since 2013 but would like copies of the iLife and iWork apps. And it makes explaining the pricing easier for Apple — it’s hard to get simpler than “free for everyone.” Why didn’t Apple just make these apps free for everyone in the first place? The answer likely lies deep within Apple’s accounting department. By making iLife, iWork, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks free and bundling them with every new Mac and iOS device sold, Apple was able to delay recognition of a portion of its sales receipts. That’s because the product wasn’t “fully delivered” without updates to the software — it’s a “subscription accounting” approach. In its Q4 2013 financial quarter, Apple delayed recognition of $900 million in revenue, in essence hiding that money from the quarterly report (see “Apple Q4 2013 Results See Lower Profits Again,” 28 October 2013). That may answer the question of why Apple made this change now too. According to Daniel Eran Dilger of AppleInsider, the deferred revenue trickles back into Apple’s reported revenues over 2 years for iOS and 4 years for the Mac. It has been about 4 years since this deferral likely began, implying that Apple has finally cleaned the associated deferred revenue off its books. In the end, this change won’t mean much. Any effects from iLife and iWork becoming free — on competing apps, on Apple’s revenues, and on the perceived value of Apple hardware, for instance — have already taken place. Most people who want to use the iLife and iWork apps have likely either bought copies already or purchased new hardware since October 2013. We suspect that sales to owners of older Macs and iOS devices have dropped to the point where it was no longer worthwhile for Apple to bother charging for the apps anymore.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Reply Jeffrey Puritz  2017-04-20 17:33 You're an optimist but my lengthy experience with Apple tells me that like Aperture these apps are in for a long slow death by neglect. Sadly, I think that this is true for the mac as well. Apple is only interested in the products with the most revenue and it shows. Reply Frans Moquette  2017-04-20 18:15 Free may seem like a good thing, but nothing is really free. In this case we will be paying for these apps through hardware purchases, if we use an app or not. Then there is the question of app quality. Since Apple is not making any money off them anymore there is no stimulus to make these apps so good people will be willing to pay for them. The option to vote with our wallet has been taken from us. One sad example is the latest version of Numbers for iOS. The complaints and 1 star reviews are pouring in but Apple seems to be deaf and blind to them. Now that Numbers is free there is even less reason te expect Apple to do anything about this bad update.

"Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material." The company's research concluded that recycled aluminium should come from Apple products rather than from recycling facilities because of the high grade needed for the metal. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminium enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. "For tin, we took a different approach," the tech giant said. "Unlike aluminium, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is "to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," said Apple, without settling a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. The tech giant said 96% of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable energy and that its new corporate campus is powered entirely by renewable energy.

Dan Goodin - Apr 20, 2017 6:34 pm UTC Enlarge / This is how a Chrome 57 displays https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/. Note the https://www.apple.com in the address bar. reader comments 113 Share this story If you're using Chrome, Firefox, or Opera to view websites, you should be aware of a weakness that can trick even savvy people into trusting malicious impostor sites that want you to download software or enter your password or credit card data. The weakness involves the way these browsers display certain characters in the address bar. Until Google released version 58 in the past 24 hours, for instance, Chrome displayed https://www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com/ as https://www.apple.com. The latest versions of Firefox and Opera by default continue to present the same misleading address. As the screenshot above demonstrates, the corresponding website has nothing to do with Apple. Had a malicious attacker registered the underlying xn--80ak6aa92e.com domain, she could have used it to push backdoored software or to trick visitors into divulging passwords or other sensitive information. Xudong Zheng, a Web application developer who developed the apple.com look-alike site to demonstrate the threat, explained here how the attack works. Punycode makes it possible to register domains with foreign characters. It works by converting individual domain label to an alternative format using only ASCII characters. For example, the domain "xn--s7y.co" is equivalent to "短.co". From a security perspective, Unicode domains can be problematic because many Unicode characters are difficult to distinguish from common ASCII characters. It is possible to register domains such as "xn--pple-43d.com", which is equivalent to "аpple.com". It may not be obvious at first glance, but "аpple.com" uses the Cyrillic "а" (U+0430) rather than the ASCII "a" (U+0061). This is known as a homograph attack. Fortunately modern browsers have mechanisms in place to limit IDN homograph attacks. The page IDN in Google Chrome highlights the conditions under which an IDN is displayed in its native Unicode form. Generally speaking, the Unicode form will be hidden if a domain label contains characters from multiple different languages. The "аpple.com" domain as described above will appear in its Punycode form as "xn--pple-43d.com" to limit confusion with the real "apple.com". The homograph protection mechanism in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera unfortunately fails if every characters is replaced with a similar character from a single foreign language. The domain "аррӏе.com", registered as "xn--80ak6aa92e.com", bypasses the filter by only using Cyrillic characters. You can check this out yourself in the proof-of-concept using Chrome, Firefox, or Opera. Visually, the two domains are indistinguishable due to the font used by Chrome and Firefox. As a result, it becomes impossible to identify the site as fraudulent without carefully inspecting the site's URL or SSL certificate. This Go program nicely demonstrates the difference between the two sets of characters. Safari, along with several less mainstream browsers are fortunately not vulnerable. The issue has generated an interesting discussion on the Mozilla developer forum. For now, lead developers have indicated they won't change the default behavior when the browser encounters punycode-based domain names. Such a change "would make all non-Latin domain names show as gibberish," Mozilla developer Gervase Markham wrote. "That's not really a good thing for people, countries and languages which don't use Latin letters. We want every script and language to be treated equally on the Internet." People who use Chrome should install version 58 as soon as possible. Firefox users can protect themselves by entering "about:config" in the address bar and agreeing to the displayed warning. From there, enter "punycode" in the search box to bring up a line that reads network.IDN_show_punycode. Next, double-click the word "false" to change it to "true." From then on, Firefox will display the "dumb ascii" characters and not the deceptive, encoded ones. Besides Apple's Safari, Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer browsers are also not affected, at least as long as they don't have support for a Cyrillic language. The weakness was reported to Chrome developers in January. Security firm McAfee has more about this problem here.

The company’s research concluded that recycled aluminium should come from old Apple products rather than from recycling facilities because the gadget need to be made with high grade metal. 2 The Apple iPhone 7 Plus (PRODUCT) RED, a special edition smartphone which helps to raise money to support the fight against HIV/AIDS Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. “Traditional supply chains are linear,” Apple wrote today. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. “We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material.” 2 Could a future generation of iPhones be made entirely from recycled materials? The ultimate aim is “to one day end our reliance on mining altogether,” said Apple, without settling a date. Apple is already has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. “For tin, we took a different approach,” the tech giant said. “Unlike aluminium, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards.” MOST READ IN TECH AND SCIENCE BIOTERRORISM THREAT Bill Gates fears terrorists will use killer viruses to wipe out MILLIONS of people CHILLING CHALLENGE The Blue Whale 'suicide game' has been linked to hundreds of teen deaths - but what is it?

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker LG UltraFine 5K review: 14.7 million pixels can’t be wrong by Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg Apr 20, 2017, 1:47pm EDT Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales share tweet Linkedin Apple finally refreshed its new MacBook Pros last fall, but while the laptops received their first new design in years, the long-suffering Apple Cinema Display didn’t even get a mention. Instead, buyers were pointed toward the new LG UltraFine 5K as the best monitor for their new USB-C laptops. And after a few days using the $1,299 IPS display, I’m inclined to agree that when it comes to Apple’s latest laptops, the UltraFine 5K is a great option. But much like the updated MacBook Pros, the UltraFine 5K fits a much narrower use case than other more full-featured displays. The UltraFine 5K is perhaps one of the best monitors I’ve ever used First things first: when it comes to the actual visual quality of the screen, the UltraFine 5K is perhaps one of the single best monitors I’ve ever used. Nothing I’ve seen can match it for color, brightness, and clarity. The display puts the already excellent display on the new MacBook Pro to shame, and going back to my old Retina MacBook Pro (circa 2013) felt like looking through a dusty window. The UltraFine uses the same clever trick as Apple’s Retina displays — instead of running everything at the impossible tiny native 5120 x 2880 pixel resolution, the UltraFine 5K by default renders scales things up to more standard resolutions of, say, 2560 x 1440 when it comes to visual elements of things like fonts and icons, and using the extra pixels to render things twice as sharp. And much like it did when the iPhone 4 first debuted the Retina display, it’s a wonderful experience, with text rendered crisp even at the smallest font sizes and images appearing vibrant and clear. Between the high resolution and wide display, the UltraFine 5K is a multitasker's dream. From a design perspective, the 27-inch UltraFine 5K Display is virtually identical to LG’s smaller 4K 21.5-inch panel (which runs for a comparatively cheap $699.95). That means you’re getting the same uninspired black plastic case and bezels, and an overall bland design the could charitably be called "professional." For all that Apple touts that it worked closely alongside LG to ensure that the UltraFine 5K would be the perfect monitor for its new USB-C MacBook Pros, that partnership hasn’t extended to the design, with the UltraFine tends to blend into the background among the rows of pedestrian Dell displays that line my co-workers’ desks. Adjusting the screen is silky-smooth That said, materials aside, the mechanical parts of the UltraFine 5K are wonderfully put together. Adjusting the screen is silky-smooth, with the perfect amount of resistance when it comes to sliding the display to a welcome range of heights. And ultimately, while Apple’s aluminum chassis on the now-defunct Thunderbolt Display may be nicer from an aesthetic perspective, functionally speaking it’s not strictly necessary when it comes to the actual use of the screen. The display also features a built-in webcam, which offers a bit better visual quality than the built-in one on the new MacBook Pro and some integrated speakers, which at least provide some louder sound than the computer’s speakers, if nothing else. But while Apple’s hand may not have been in play from an industrial design perspective, its vision for the future of computing is all over the UltraFine 5K Display. Unlike other desktop displays, which tend to offer a wide range of options to hook up computers, ranging from DVI to HDMI to DisplayPort, the UltraFine 5K has exactly one choice: USB-C Thunderbolt 3. And due to the confusing nature of the USB-C standard, that means that, unlike the smaller 4K UltraFine panel, not every laptop with a USB-C port will cut it here. So, for example, Apple’s new MacBook Pros are in, but the 12-inch MacBook is out. Apple’s vision for the future of computing is all over the UltraFine 5K Display Even if you have a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter, you’ll be limited to only specific, recent models of Apple’s desktops and laptops, which also can only run at a maximum 4K resolution of 3840 x 2160 instead of the full 5120 x 2880 that the newest MacBook Pros can power it. I tested the UltraFine 5K the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model, arguably the least powerful MacBook Pro that still supports 5K. Performance was fine for the most part, with some minor slowdowns during visually intensive Exposé commands. The bigger issue was 4K video, which tended to stutter on YouTube, something with probably has to do with the MacBook rather than the screen, but was still disappointing to see from a $1,500 laptop. Only the most recent of laptops were able to drive the display at the full 5K resolution Like the MacBook Pro models that it was intended for, the UltraFine 5K is similarly anemic when it comes to ports. The single USB-C connection that drives the display also provides power to a connected laptop (up to 85W) and allows the computer to take advantage of the extra ports on the back of the display as a USB hub. But Apple’s single-minded devotion to USB-C shines through here as well, with the UltraFine 5K only offering three extra USB-C ports. On the one hand it’s understandable given Apple’s aggressive pushing of the format, but on the other I couldn’t help but be frustrated by the addition of three more ports that required the same dongles and adapters to connect a flash drive or SD card. Setup of the UltraFine is meant to be plug-and-play — simply connect the display to powered, and connect your computer via USB-C, and you’re good to go. Or, at least in theory. In practice, I spent several minutes trying to figure out why I had been presented with a blank screen, before restarting several times and eventually updating macOS on the MacBook Pro I was using, at which point things actually were plug-and-play. I also tested the UltraFine with a few Windows computers, as well. The monitor works out of the box with anything that supports Thunderbolt 3, but only the most recent of laptops were able to drive it at the full 5K resolution, with the rest defaulting to 4K. Additionally, while the Windows PCs were able to work with the display without any issues, there was no way to adjust the brightness without installing LG’s drivers first (which is more important than you’d think, given that the screen is almost blindingly bright at the maximum setting of 500 nits). And to briefly address the router-shaped elephant in the room, the original shipments of of the UltraFine 5K display infamously suffered from issues where the screen would completely cease to function if placed within roughly six feet of a router, which many computers tend to be. I am pleased to confirm that based on my testing, LG does seem to have fixed that issue, and I experienced no problems with the 5K UltraFine cutting out. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge At $1,299, the LG UltraFine 5K display isn’t cheap, costing almost as much as some of the computers it’s designed for, and suffers from a major lack of connectivity options, both for input and output, that make it incredibly limited in terms of compatibility. And while the Ultrafine may be the best accessory for your MacBook Pro today, it’s worth keeping in mind that Apple already has announced its plans to get back into the pro display game next year. But if you’re willing to work within the narrow scope that Apple has imposed the UltraFine 5K (and are willing to pay for it), then you can be safe in knowing that you’re getting one of the best displays on the market.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Sharp is getting their OLED Fab for Smartphone Displays up to Speed with the Help of Innolux | Main April 20, 2017 Today Google Home's Virtual Assistant can learn its Owner's voice for Security Reasons like Apple's Patent Pending Idea   On April 04 we posted a report titled "Apple Patent Reveals a New Security Feature Coming to Siri," which explained that Apple is working on making Siri understand the voice of the owner as yet another security step in being able to access your future devices and online services to ensure that someone who stole your iDevice can't use it or make purchases online. It was a pretty interesting idea. Two weeks later and we're now learning that Google is putting that feature into their 'Google Home' devices, as of today.   CNN reports that "As of Thursday the square, cylindrical device will now recognize partners, roommates, kids and guests who come to visit. Also, Google Home users can now create up to six different accounts on their devices.   So when you say the trigger phrases "OK Google" or "Hey Google," the Home will listen for who is asking and provide answers based on your voice. For example, Google Assistant will know what's on your calendar, what your reminders are and what your commute looks like.   It will also know when someone talking to it doesn't have a profile, preventing personal data being read aloud to someone it doesn't belong to. For instance, if a guest asks what someone's calendar looks like, Google won't read it.   Apple's published patent application for Siri's similar feature was completely coincidental, as Google's patent patent application for this feature surfaced today showing by date that they were ahead of Apple. Of course it'll be up to USPTO to decide who gets the granted first. Late this afternoon Patently Mobile covered Google's patent and you could review the highlights here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) Share Written by Zoë Schlanger April 20, 2017 Apple just announced that it plans to stop relying on mined rare earth minerals and metals to make their products, and instead use only recycled sources. Mines where rare earth mineral are extracted are often sites of exploitation, where workers, some children, are exposed to extremely toxic substances and dangerous working conditions for scant pay. The effluent from the mines poisons soil and groundwater supplies and wreaks environmental devastation, too. Virtually all smartphone companies—as well as manufacturers of a long list of other tech products—rely on the rare-earth supply chain to make their products. Apple wants to stop. It just isn’t sure how to yet. “Can we one day stop mining the Earth altogether? It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it,” the company wrote in its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report published Wednesday. Vice News called the move unprecedented for the tech industry, and spoke to Lisa Jackson, the former administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency who now heads environment initiatives for Apple. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Jackson told Vice News. She hopes the announcement will send a message to mining companies that Apple is looking for recycled materials—perhaps prompting some of them to pivot their focus. “Who knows more about recovering metals than people who mine them?” she said. “So some of the same smart people who do that, if they think there is a market for their services on the other side might get involved.” Notably, Jackson also said that Apple is not exploring ways to elongate the lifespan of its products—like its iPhones, which the company says work for three years—or ways to make them more repairable as a means of conserving materials or reducing e-waste. “I think a product that lasts is really important, and a lot of people buy Apple products because they know they do last,” Jackson said.

Developers will now be able to use the API to share Live Photos playback on iOS, macOS, and now the web. From Apple’s introduction: This new JavaScript-based API makes it easy to embed Live Photos on your websites. In addition to enabling Live Photos on iOS and macOS, you can now let users display their Live Photos on the web. The new LivePhotosKit JS API is available on NPM with code samples shared in the new API reference. In the new documentation, Apple includes examples on how to get Live Photo assets up and running online. According to the official documentation: The JavaScript API presents the player in the form of a DOM element, much like an image or video tag, which can be configured with photo and video resources and other options, and have its playback controlled either programmatically by the consuming developer, or via pre-provided controls by the browsing end-user. Tumblr brought Live Photos to the web last year, and had even shared their own code implementations as well. Their work may have been what inspired Apple to eventually build out their own API for developers.

Shares of computer hardware maker Qualcomm dipped slightly on Thursday, a day after it reported fiscal-second-quarter earnings that beat forecasts. The chipmaker, a major supplier to Samsung, Apple, and other mobile-phone manufacturers, reported an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.34 per share, 15 cents above Reuters' consensus estimates. The chipmaker, which reported results on Wednesday, also saw its revenue top estimates. Qualcomm's stock briefly rose about 2 percent in early trading despite a conservative outlook and potential turbulence over payments owed from Apple. But shares pared earlier gains after a slew of analysts lowered their June estimates; the stock held about 1 percent lower in mid-morning trade. Qualcomm shares closed fairly flat on Thursday at $52.66 per share. In a statement, Qualcomm said manufacturers under contract with Apple "reported, but underpaid" royalties during the quarter. The dispute did not affect Qualcomm's earnings this quarter, although the company warned of weaker results if the dispute continues into the next quarter. The company supplies chipsets and technology to Apple and other major original equipment manufacturers. Qualcomm, which pioneered major cell phone technologies, counts Samsung and Apple as their biggest customers and holds a large portfolio of intellectual property. The company also has license agreements with top Chinese phone manufacturers. In October last year, the company announced it would buy Dutch rival NXP Semiconductors for an estimated $38 billion. Qualcomm expects the deal to close by the end of 2017. Mike JuangSpecial to CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change QCOM ---

State officials in Karnataka claim that this is going to happen no matter what the central government decides regarding the tech giant’s request for concessions. To recap, Apple had asked the Center for considerations like a 15-year exemption on customs duty and tax breaks. The government apparently rejected most of these demands. A Karnataka state official told the Economic Times that the administration might be concerned that these waivers won’t fit into the framework of the proposed GST. He also thinks that Apple will pursue its application with the government independent of its Bengaluru plans since the brand can’t afford to ignore India at this point. The firm needs to increase its sales in the subcontinent amid a global slowdown in markets like China. Also See: iPhone 8 to sport stainless steel frame, vertical iSight dual cameras Karnataka has apparently been taking up the company’s case with the Center, working towards a goal where it brings its entire component ecosystem to the city and begins exporting iPhones from there. Another official is confident that Apple will begin manufacturing iPhones for the domestic market. It’s not clear which models it plans to produce in the country. Speculation so far has indicated that the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S will be the first ones out of the gate. The iPhone SE may follow 3 months later. There’s a slim chance Apple might put together the upcoming iPhone 8 in India as well. A January report asserted that the firm had chosen Wistron as the primary supplier for the handset in the nation. Everything we know about the next iPhone rides on speculation more than concrete information. As Feras Antoon points out, news about the iPhone 8’s design has been confusing. Accordingly, the display may be curved, or not. The battery may be of higher capacity courtesy of a stacked substrate-like PCB mainboard, or not. Apple might put a 3D camera on the back, or not. Get the picture? It’s too early to feel certain about any details that come our way, though Apple can be depended on to stick to its fall launch tradition for the new iPhone. Or not.

Headlines ZICTA claims they can read your WhatsApp Messages and Disable any Communication Device April 20, 2017 94 10,239 views Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala ZICTA has sensationally revealed that it is able to disable any communication devices and read personal messages. The revelation is likely to unsettle many social media users especially that platforms such as WhatsApp have end-to-end encryption which ensures that only the sender and the person receiving can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. On WhatsApp, messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipient and the sender have the special key needed to unlock and read the message. In recent years, some tech companies with very large user-bases have been championing user privacy. For instance, Apple and WhatsApp recently challenged law enforcement authorities’ demands to weaken their security system and/or access encrypted data. Apple most visibly in the San Bernardino case when Apple resisted demands by the FBI that it writes a new version of its OS to weaken the security of the terrorist’s iPhone. But ZICTA Director for Consumer Protection Mofya Chisala has also disclosed that the authority has a good working relationship with Facebook and Google in order to protect internet users in Zambia. Mr Chisala said Communications and Transport Minister Brian Mushimba envisions an ICT sector that is well disciplined. He said Zambia would have a lot of problem if it allowed people to do what they want online. Mr Chisala was speaking when he featured on the Hot FM Red Hot Breakfast show on Wednesday to clarify on the raid at CEC Liquid Telecom and other IT firms in Lusaka. “You know there have been a lot of social media pages, cloning, hate speech and the exchange of pornographic material and the ICT Act is very clear on some of these things. Now we have moved into gear to ensure that even taking you to court, we are going to ask for the maximum penalty because we don’t want a few people to twist the hand of government to now start putting in laws to start restricting people’s use of the internet. That is unnecessary, the Internet is one tool that can be used for businesses, research, communication and other things,” Mr Chisala said. He added, “So we have now gone into gear and we are now going to visit all those we find wanting to ensure that the ICT sector is one that other countries can be proud of and come to learn from.” “I always wish to remind people that with great power comes great responsibility. When you sit in your room on your Ipad or your phone and you start commenting, writing and rubbishing people, you know, we will catch up with you.” Mr Chisala said the ZICTA of today has realised that collaboration and education is not the only way to go hence the need to increase on enforcement of the law. “I think we need to switch up, turn the heat up. We are now following every lead we have and we will get to you. A very good example, a lot of you lose your phones, your laptops and when the police find them in a raid or if it is stolen, what we have to do to know if it belongs to you is that we will have to go through it and now instead of giving you back your stolen item, we will have to arrest you because even if you have deleted anything, we have equipment that can bring back everything that was deleted,” Mr Chisala explained. He added, “So if somebody is disturbing you or harassing you on social media, come and report to ZICTA and by the way, we are having very good relationships with these social media platforms like Facebook and Google and we speaking the same language.” “We are goona come after you and we will make you an example because we will name and shame you and we are going to blacklist you in Zambia, meaning you cannot use any of these services and if cousin, your mother, your father buys you a phone and you start using and we find out, we will blacklist your mother, your father, your cousin and whoever will give you access.” Related posts: ZICTA trains 100 CB teachers in curbing cybercrime ZICTA shuts down internet cafes operating without trading licences Over 6 million Zambians accessing the internet-ZICTA ZICTA raids CEC Liquid Telecom Loading...

If one checked LinkedIn today, you will find Mushota and she is not what you think she is but a petty nasty thing. This is what money can do when corruptly you are asked to sing their song.

Free speech means just that — free speech. People are free to speak their minds and say whatever they want, as long as they’re not inciting violence, or making physical threats against someone. But just because you don’t like the commentator’s point of view doesn’t mean you have to censor them. Only dictatorships like North Korea do that.

The idea of coming out of ICC is one to brutalise anyone opposing their views because they think they will not be answerable to anyone. The idea of whatsapp is just a lie because they fear everyone has a phone in Zambia and are able to communicate beside their ZNBC propaganda current affairs they call news. 7 Patriot April 20, 2017 at 7:33 am vote It is cardinal that the public is sensitized on the ICT Act so that there is full protection of people’s fundamental rights such as freedom of expression.

Post-ECL, there has to be a great deal of soul searching and remodelling of our institutions, especially educational institutions spewing out such garbage for leaders. We then have to purge and ensure that only those suitably qualified and responsible occupy positions in government and allied institutions. I hope this guy gets dealt with by his superiors immediately. If not, we’ll take it that they’re complicit and he’s echoing their views.

And this is what it has led us to, our rights are stepped on like lab rats. #releaseHH #leavestatehousetoday Hey old grouch you forgot that VPNs are cheaper than your Pair of Panties Reply 37 2020vision April 20, 2017 at 12:08 pm vote It is very easy to find the location of someone especially when they use social media platforms as this one- you only need to get their IP address using their digital signature by right clicking on the page and choosing from the drop down menu. Accessing Whatsapp is another issue- to get access of someone’s whatsapp message one would have to use a clone server but you would have to know the number of the person whose account you wish to hack! Which is why some people avoid giving their numbers or putting their numbers on social networking sites such as FB or linkedin! So Zicta are actually quit right as they have a list of names and numbers of the owners of those names-however I believe they would require an act of Parliament to do so as the current Law on information is vague.

What’s next, coming into bars and your homes to monitor your conversations so you don’t insult the authorities? They are coming for you, whatcha gonna do now, huh?

As part of a batch of Earth Day 2017 videos it uploaded today, Apple expanded on something it first told Vice News Tonight last night; there’s an employee whose specialty is producing fake sweat for testing on the company’s various products. Mostly this applies to the Apple Watch, a device that millions of people sweat on every day. In the video, Apple’s head of environmental technologies Rob Guzzo explains that he created a smaller subdivision within his team “just focused on skin safety.” And there’s good reason for that careful approach; remember when one of Fitbit’s fitness trackers gave consumers a nasty skin rash? Another employee explains the rationale: “We want to mimic actual use conditions, but we’re not going to go around collecting sweat from our employees.” In the clip from Vice News Tonight below (hi Arielle), you’ll get a look at the real-world environmental testing lab. One thing I found interesting is that Apple puts its AirPods through this same sweat test — even though the wireless earbuds aren’t advertised as water or sweat-resistant. This isn’t unique to Apple. Garmin must have a sweat engineer. Samsung and Huawei probably do, too, and I would hope Fitbit does by now. But they haven’t (yet) given their people a rare moment in the spotlight.

Just days after being ordered to pay Apple £38,085 for filing trademark revocation proceedings with an ulterior purpose, firms that list Gleissner as Director filed trademark applications in the U.S. for both Apple and iPod. Meanwhile, his attorneys are up to their usual trademarking activities. On the same day as filing the Apple and iPod trademarks, they filed a trademark application for Clear.com. The domain name was owned by Wimax company Clearwire which was acquired by Sprint. Sprint still owns the domain name and forwards it to Sprint.com. They also filed an application for Brandster.com, which appears to not be connected to Gleissner’s firms. I have reached out to the owner of Brandster.com to confirm. Tweet Email Learn more...

Reply John says April 20, 2017 at 2:58 pm His attorneys like Jonathan Grant Morton are the reason why most people believe all lawyers are complete sleazeballs who would file anything for a buck. They spent all the money on law school just to show they are people with zero ethics or morals. Reply Garth says April 20, 2017 at 6:02 pm I got a handover pack from these guys. I bet they get gems just handed over to them without question. The blow-back vs. getting domains for nil must be worth it (otherwise why do it). Reply Josh says April 21, 2017 at 12:05 am I hear you but one would think that what they target is so highly desired/valued that not one will hand over anything. If they went after more lower to mid level names, sure I see your point. That may not be worth it though? Just all very odd, why people chose pain for gain.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Apple Inc. has been working to improve its environmental impact in recent years and it really wants people to know about it this year, just in time for this weekend’s Earth Day. On Thursday, Apple released four informational videos that try to explain some of the different measures the company uses to reduce its impact on the environment. The videos, animated by artist James Blagden, are drawn to illustrate the spoken words of various Apple executives and spokespeople. Questions about Apple’s practices that are answered include ‘Can we produce zero waste?’ and ‘Why does Apple make its own sweat?’ The new videos on Thursday come on the heels of Apple releasing its annual environmental responsibility report late Wednesday night. Some of the points the company highlighted includes: Ninety-six per cent of electricity used at global facilities in 2016 came from renewable energy, reducing CO2e emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. Being 100 per cent renewable in 24 countries, as well as all of Apple’s data centres (something that was called ‘dirty data’ by environmental groups in the past). Introducing a ‘closed loop supply chain’ that will still take years to fully implement, but essentially means the company wants to end mining and move to fully recycled materials in the coming years. Partnering with the World Wildlife Fund to get 320,000 acres of working forest in China recommended for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.

Since introducing new measures, however, the tech giant has made an environmental comeback and has sat at the top of Greenpeace’s report for the past three years (including 2016). Apple said it will continue to improve its environment footprint. Financial Post Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Posted 21 Apr 2017 00:41 Updated 21 Apr 2017 00:50 An Apple iPhone 7 and the company logo are seen in this illustration picture. (REUTERS/Regis Duvignain/Files) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Technology giant Apple wants to "one day" end the need to mine materials from the earth to make its gadgets, the company said in its annual environmental responsibility report out on Thursday (Apr 20). "Traditional supply chains are linear. Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material." The company's research concluded that recycled aluminium should come from Apple products rather than from recycling facilities because of the high grade needed for the metal. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. "For tin, we took a different approach," the tech giant said. "Unlike aluminium, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is "to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," said Apple, without settling a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. The tech giant said 96 per cent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable energy and that its new corporate campus is powered entirely by renewable energy. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

ENTERTAINMENT ARTS & CULTURE Beverly Center as art gallery? How some big-name artists are behind those construction barricades Lisa Anne Auerbach's 1,000-foot-long mural, "Strik Strikke." Charlie Cho / Beverly Center Lisa Anne Auerbach's mural "Strik Strikke." Lisa Anne Auerbach's mural "Strik Strikke." (Charlie Cho / Beverly Center) Deborah VankinContact Reporter You may have seen it on your way to the Apple store. You likely rushed by. Stitched into the Macy’s wing of the Beverly Center — now an eyesore of construction scaffolding and detour signage due to a massive renovation — is recently installed art by Lisa Anne Auerbach to temper the clutter. The temporary, site-specific work, “Strik Strikke, 2017,” is a mural more than 1,000 feet long depicting intricate knitting patterns rendered in candy-colored hues and a pixelated effect. The work is both a distraction from the construction and a meta commentary on it. The mural is embedded with playful wordplay and symbols addressing the surrounding landscape (think orange construction cones, security cameras and ripe fruit opposite the Apple store). It also has nods to a broader political landscape (think human silhouettes carrying protest signs and a pink 1960s feminist symbol, the Venus sign with a raised fist inside). Auerbach’s work is part of a Beverly Center art project that’s morphing along with the building’s $500-million renovation. As the mall makes way for a new food hall, parking lot and updated facade, art in the form of construction barricades and scaffolding scrims brightens the space and injects passing shoppers with a bit of culture. Independent curator Jenelle Porter organized the project in association with the Hammer Museum and brought in Barbara Kruger, Catherine Opie, Sharon Lockhart and other big name artists who Porter felt would be provocative. “Lisa’s work is fun, but it’s also political,” Porter says. “I wanted to invite artists who could push a little bit. Especially after the election. Public art asks questions and invites us to ask questions. That’s the point.” As the Internet becomes the shopping destination of choice, some old-school malls across the U.S. are trying to reinvent themselves. This could simply mean fancier dining or aesthetic touch-ups, or it could mean offering a new experience featuring IRL (in real life) services and entertainment: live music, a spa, amusement park-like rides, a farmers market. Or, in the case of the Beverly Center, turning retail walkways into a pop-up art gallery. The first four artworks at the Beverly Center — by Opie, Lockhart, Geoff McFetridge and Dave Muller — went up shortly after the construction groundbreaking last summer. Others, by Julian Hoeber and Karen Kimmel, went up in the fall. Now that the construction has progressed and new barricades have been erected, most have come down and new works — mostly temporary vinyl murals — have been installed in their place.

(Charlie Cho / Beverly Center) “It’s a big platform, metaphorically and literally,” Porter says. “We wanted to offer them a really large canvas — time, a lot of space and money. And see what they’d do. I think this town is hungry for art, especially contemporary art.” William Taubman, chief operating officer of Beverly Center owner Taubman Centers and an art collector himself, says his intention is to “capture the creative spirit of L.A.” for thousands of passersby to see daily. “In many ways, L.A. is to the art world what New York was in the 1960s,” Taubman says. “L.A. is a dynamic environment which is attracting artists from everywhere.” Because of that, he added, “including art within our renovation was a given.” Taubman reached out to Hammer Museum Director Ann Philbin, and she connected him with Porter, an L.A. native who spent about four years working at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston before returning to L.A. in 2015.

(Charlie Cho for Beverly Center) During a recent tour of the Beverly Center artworks, Porter said that when she conceived of the project, the idea was to involve established artists as well as those who were under-recognized. But even she was at first unsure of the venue. Would people want to see art in a mall? Would they even notice it? Might it cheapen the art to be showcased in such a commercial setting? Porter called serious artist friends to take a temperature check. “I called Cathy [Opie] and said: ‘Would you respect me in the morning if I did a project like this?’ And she said: ‘Yes!’ And then: ‘Would you invite me?’ Everyone was so positive.” Opie, whose series of beach photographs, “Hands on Boards,” lined the Beverly Center pedestrian walkway at street level, says she jumped at the opportunity. “I really believe that the art world is larger than just being based in museums and galleries; I think art should activate every place,” she says. “Why do we only have to look at advertisements in a mall? Let’s expand our minds and our expectations of what these spaces can offer to us.” Barbara Kruger's scrim, with an all-capped message for shoppers and passersby.

(Charlie Cho / Beverly Center) Among the latest works are large photographs by Lepore in 4-foot-square windows that would otherwise peer into a construction zone. The artist’s studio is located in his father’s Lincoln Heights bikini factory, and he brought bits and pieces of that world into the Beverly Center. Abstract images depict the folds and sheen of uncut fabric, other pictures show spools of thread and boxes of buttons; other photographs are more realistic, even offering sociological commentary. An image of factory employees’ time cards provides a window, literally and figuratively, into the shrinking textile business. Ed Fella, the 79-year-old type designer whose exhibit “Free Work in Due Time” is on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, has an installation spanning three floors. The artist made small cut-and-paste collages of his black-and-white hand-drawn lettering, doodles and drawings over the years — material from fliers and vernacular signage that was then scanned and enlarged. The new murals function as something of a survey of his art over the decades. Kruger, whose work blends art provocation and advertising aesthetics, has a 60-foot-tall dark scrim printed with the question “Can Money Buy You Love?” covering the exterior scaffolding on the nose of the building, at the intersection of Beverly and La Cienega boulevards. Back inside, as customers stream past the Ferrari and Halston Heritage stores, Auerbach’s piece might just seem like bright and playful wallpaper in the background to passersby. A toddler runs her fingers over the mural’s Chiclet-like vinyl squares, cooing “aw wowwww.” An older gentleman in a felt fedora grinds his chewing gum into the mural’s base with his toe as he rushes past. A young couple on a mission to find new shoes for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival pause to take in the artwork. “I like it. It’s so fun,” says Alessandra Grijalva, 27, a graphic designer visiting from Mexico. “It puts you in a better mood and doesn’t make the whole construction thing so bad.” Caption 'The Fate of the Furious' movie review by Justin Chang Justin Chang reviews "The Fate of the Furious," directed by F.

As it is now, Apple needs metals mined from our lovely planet to build its mobile devices – something that has a lot of repercussions, whether those are environmental or humanitarian. According to Apple’s new environmental report, though, the company wants to change that. In Apple’s Environmental Responsibility Report for fiscal year 2016, vice president of environment, policy, and social initiatives Lisa Jackson lays down a pretty lofty goal for her company: move entirely to recycled materials in the mobile devices it produces. This means that Apple could presumably stop mining the Earth for the materials it uses in iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, which would be a great move indeed. “Traditional supply chains are linear,” the report reads. “Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products. We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material.” There’s just one problem with that plan at this point in time: Apple isn’t quite sure how it’s going to accomplish these goals yet. Speaking to VICE, Jackson was upfront about that. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Jackson said. “So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.” Still, if any company has the resources and the cash in its coffers to explore such a big initiative, it’s probably Apple. In a statement to SlashGear, Greenpeace said that while Apple’s plan is “critical” to reducing the company’s carbon footprint, there was still more it could do. “While transitioning to 100% recycled materials is critical to reducing the sector’s footprint, it is also fundamental for Apple and other major IT companies to design products that last, are easy to repair, and recyclable at their end of life,” said Greenpeace senior IT analyst Gary Cook. It’s a big initiative to be sure, and it’s probably not something that Apple will be ready to accomplish for a few years. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of measures Apple implements as it works toward this goal, so definitely stay tuned for more.

The monthly series will focus on up and coming artists. The documentary series falls in line with Apple Music’s own growing independent content catalog. While the content is stylistically different from Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, it shows that Apple Music is focusing on what it knows – music. This month, Apple Music is starting off with 6LACK (pronounced “black”) and his journey through music. From his Up Next biography: Considering he made his recording debut at the age of four, you could say that 6LACK – pronounced “black” – was born to do this. The singer/rapper transcended the Atlanta underground with last year’s “PRBLMS”, a bold showcase of late-night, R&B-inflected hip-hop. The unfiltered personal narratives of his full-length debut, FREE 6LACK, proved that “PRBLMS” was just the beginning. Explore 6LACK’s blossoming catalog, watch his incredible live performance in Atlanta, and get to know him through our exclusive documentary and in-depth interview with Beats 1’s Zane Lowe. The official Apple Music Twitter account states that Up Next is “music’s next generation.” The current Up Next page for 6LACK shares his mini-documentary, his latest album release, a live performance, and an interview with Zane Lowe. Notably, the live performance is titled Up Next Session, possibly hinting that Apple Music may be sharing more of its own in-studio performances in the future. Introducing #UpNext.

The limited edition version features a Space Gray Apple Watch Series 2 with a unique Light Bone/Black Nike Sport band with the NikeLab Innovation x Innovators logo stamped inside. Sony A6500 Today, the long-standing partnership continues with NikeLab — the company’s collaborative innovation platform — through the launch of Apple Watch NikeLab. […] Apple Watch NikeLab is the ultimate style companion for those with a passion for running, whether emerging runners or marathon veterans. Nike says the new Apple Watch NikeLab version will launch in one week on Nike.com, at NikeLab stores, and through Apple at an “Apple Tokyo pop-up in Isetan.” The new Light Bone/Black Nike Sport band matches one of the new colors for Apple Watch Nike+ faces introduced through the recent watchOS 3.2 update as well (fingers crossed for a Blue Orbit edition soon). It doesn’t appear (yet) that standalone versions of this new band will be available to purchase. After initially making the first Nike Sport bands exclusive to Apple Watch Nike+, Apple and Nike recently started selling select bands individually; Apple Watch NikeLab appears to be the next limited edition version, however, so these may be more exclusive and temporary.

Apple, which is one of the most environmentally conscious companies, released the report just ahead of Earth Day on Saturday. “It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it,” the company said of its plan to stop mining altogether. “We’re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products.” Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Apple Working On Advanced Camera Systems, Curved Screens, Stainless Steel Frame Apple said it’s looking for ways to recycle material, including aluminum, copper, cobalt and tin. By recycling, the company will try to reduce its footprint in the environment. “Climate change is undeniable,” Apple said. “Earth’s resources won’t last forever. And technology must be safe for people to make and use. We don’t question these realities — we challenge ourselves to ask what we can do about them in every part of our business.” The report also detailed environmental milestones for the company. In 2016, 96 percent of the electricity used at Apple’s global facilities came from renewable energy, reducing its carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. Apple also said it’s 100 percent renewable in 24 countries and all of Apple’s data centers. Read: Apple's Gift Suggestions For Mother's Day Include The iPad Pro And BeatsX Earphones The iPhone seller also cited its new campus Apple Park, which will be the “largest LEED Platinum-certified building in North America.” Apple Park will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy and will be home to more than 9,000 drought-tolerant trees, the report said. Apple is also pushing its manufacturers to help fight climate change. The company said seven major suppliers have vowed to power their production of Apple products solely on renewable energy by the end of next year. The report detailing Apple’s mining plans comes after a 2016 Amnesty International investigation found Apple battery suppliers used child labor to mine cobalt.

(AAPL) Won’t Buy Walt Disney Co (DIS) – But It Will Do This Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Beats on Q2 Earnings, But It’s Still a Trap 10 Stocks That Won’t Exist in a Decade View All Posts A report from RBC Capital Markets last week suggested that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could acquire Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS). Analyst Amit Daryanani said that multiple investors had asked him about the possibility of a merger between Apple and Disney, arguing that there was a non-zero possibility of such a deal occurring. Source: Shutterstock A combination of AAPL and Disney stock would be the largest merger in history — and in RBC’s estimation, a strong positive for Apple stock. The idea has been greeted with almost universal skepticism, and the report had little, if any, impact on trading in Apple shares. Indeed, the merger seems highly unlikely. But it does appear that Apple, which traditionally has shunned major acquisitions, could be in the market for a bigger target. That target may not be Disney. But there’s reason to believe Apple has a major deal in its future. What Would an Apple-Disney Merger Cost? Disney has an enterprise value of about $196 billion at the moment. Apple likely would offer a roughly 40% premium for Disney stock. In that case, the acquisition would cost Apple about $267 billion, including assumption of debt. That’s a huge price tag, obviously — but it’s not insurmountable. Apple could fund at least some of the purchase price with Apple stock. Apple already has about $226 billion in cash and securities as well. The one major problem is that most of the cash remains trapped overseas. If the Trump administration can’t push through a repatriation holiday, the cash portion of a Disney acquisition could be tougher to fund. Would Disney Benefit AAPL Stock? The strategic value of such a deal for Apple and AAPL stock is more complicated. On its face, the addition of Disney’s content would provide a huge leg up to Apple’s services business — notably both Apple TV and Apple Music. Apple has been trying to put together a streaming TV package for years — only to fall behind Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, among others. Disney’s ABC and ESPN properties could form the beginning of a content package that could rival YouTube streaming, Hulu and other bundles. The counterargument is that adding Disney could ruin Apple’s ambitions in TV. The whole point of providing a streaming platform is to be provider-agnostic, something that Apple is … but it wouldn’t be if it owned Disney’s programming. Would a provider like AMC Networks Inc (NASDAQ:AMCX) want to license The Walking Dead to an Apple TV package if Apple also is a major competitor? The most interesting aspect of the deal would be Apple’s ownership of ESPN. ESPN is struggling badly with cord-cutting, which threatens its business model of charging $7-plus per subscriber per month — whether subscribers are interested in sports or not. The Apple delivery system, from one standpoint, could invigorate ESPN. From another standpoint, however, ESPN would be an anchor. Liberty Media Corporation (NASDAQ:FWONA) CEO John Malone speculated last year that Disney could split off ESPN and sell the rest of its assets to Apple for cash and/or Apple stock.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Opinions Image Source: Handy Abovergleich Why the iPhone 7S could be better than the iPhone 8 Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 19th, 2017 at 5:31 PM Share Tweet We’ve still got months until Apple even prints the invites for the iPhone 8 event, but rumors are starting to mount. The new flagship iPhone, likely named the iPhone 8, iPhone X or iPhone Edition, will likely have an edge-to-edge display with a curved glass front, no home button, a dual-camera setup and possibly some kind of facial recognition. It all sounds great, but I think the iPhone 7 series might still have a shot at glory this year. Don't Miss: Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user It all comes down to the tradeoffs that Apple is likely to make to create room for the iPhone 8’s standout features. Want a zero-bezel display with a curved front? That means no home button, and no Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the front either. There’s rumors that Apple will have some kind of under-screen fingerprint sensor, but some leaks are now suggesting that the Touch ID sensor will move to the back. Without mincing words, that would be a disaster. Samsung is already getting major flak for moving the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S8 to the back. It sits right next to the camera sensor, causing endless fingerprints and smudges on the lens. A Samsung rep has already said that it was a deliberate design decision to try and free up more internal room for a battery, but the justification doesn’t really matter: it still leads to a terrible user experience. It’s easy to think that Apple won’t fall into the same trap, but just look at last year. Removing the headphone jack was a consumer-hostile decision that is still causing me annoyance to this day. Moving the Touch ID sensor to the back would be a little less “courageous” than killing the headphone jack, so it’s easy to imagine Apple doing just that. Other things make me already hesitant about the iPhone 8. Including a bunch of fancy features like curved glass, OLED screens and iris sensors is going to jack the price of the phone up, and there’s no way that Apple will take a hit on its historically fat profit margins. Instead, expect the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus to retail for about the same (or a little less) than the current iPhone 7, while the iPhone 8 could run close to $1,000. No thanks. Even niggling details could be cause for concern. Apple has championed LCD screen technology for years, and it’s reasonable to think that there might be bugs in its first generation of OLED phones. Even Samsung, which produces screens in house and has been using AMOLED for years, still has problems with its screens. Waiting one year for Apple to work out the bugs in a new generation of device really wouldn’t be a bad idea. I’m not saying that the iPhone 8 will be a flop, or that people won’t buy it. But if Apple comes out with an iPhone 7S at the same time, with the same processor and some of the same camera improvements as the iPhone 8 at a much lower price, waiting a year to jump on the iPhone 8 bandwagon might not be such a bad idea.

Rachel Jacoby ZoldanApr 20, 2017 12:34PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestQilai Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images Considering the expansive work Apple has done regarding recycling and sustainability efforts — especially in comparison to their technological company counterparts — you may be surprised to learn that the fruit nonetheless pulls many rare-earth metals and toxins from the ground to make a slew of products including iPhones, iPads, Macbooks, and other Apple accessories. However, Apple has promised to stop mining minerals: Yesterday, in an unprecedented goal for the company and its industry, Apple announced a goal "to stop mining the earth altogether." The announcement came as part of the company's 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, which was released in full on Wednesday. Part of the report focused on how Apple's been doing on their own environmental goals (prior to the above announcement), citing that its facilities worldwide now run on an impressive 96% renewable energy — up an also incredible 93% from the year prior. This number, though, is in relation to the many Apple stores, corporate offices, and data centers and does not reflect the current material usage and procurement for its devices. But the nucleus of the report — and the changes set forward — is that Apple is planning on eliminating the use of mining, which is also notorious in and of itself for its labor abuses and the environmental damages the practice causes. What Apple is proposing to do instead is to make all of its devices devices from recycled materials like tin, copper, aluminum, and tungsten. This will also eliminate reliance on minerals mined in particularly conflict-ridden areas. However, there's one MAJOR problem: Apple doesn't know how or when they're going to make it all happen. "We're actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we've completely figured out how to do it," Apple vice president of environment, policy, and social initiative, Lisa Jackson, told Vice. "So we're a little nervous, but we also think it's going to be really important, because as a sector it's where technology should be going." We can't help but entirely agree.

"Traditional supply chains are linear," it said. "Materials are mined, manufactured as products, and often end up in landfills after use. Then the process starts over and more materials are extracted from the earth for new products." "We believe our goal should be a closed-loop supply chain, where products are built using only renewable resources or recycled material," it added. The company's research concluded that recycled aluminum should come from Apple products rather than recycling facilities because of the high-grade quality required. Apple has been encouraging customers to return used products for recycling and has melted down iPhone aluminum enclosures to make mini computers used in its factories. "For tin, we took a different approach," the company said. "Unlike aluminum, there is an existing market supply of recycled tin that meets our quality standards." As a result, Apple has been using recycled tin for its iPhone 6s. The ultimate aim is "to one day end our reliance on mining altogether," the company said, without specifying a date. Apple did not disclose the amount of recycled products currently used in its products. "Apple's commitment to 100 percent recycled materials is ambitious, and highlights the need for greater urgency across the sector to reduce resource consumption and e-waste that are causing significant impacts on the environment and human health," Greenpeace senior analyst Gary Cook said. Making new gadgets with reclaimed material reduces demand for mined metals and increases the tendency for devices to be recycled, according to the environmental group. Samsung last month said it would sell some Note 7 smartphones that were recalled for safety reasons as refurbished devices, in an effort to manage its stockpile in an "environmentally friendly" manner. The South Korean giant recalled an estimated four million of its flagship smartphones over concerns that batteries could overheat and burst into flames. A Samsung statement said that salvageable components from devices would be detached, and metals extracted by companies that specialize in recycling. While lauding a shift to devices made completely from reclaimed materials, Greenpeace analyst Cook urged technology companies to also design products that last a long time and are easy to repair and recycle. Apple is also among Silicon Valley titans investing heavily in green energy for operations, saying that 96 percent of the electricity at its global facilities comes from renewable sources and that its new 'spaceship' main campus is powered entirely by renewable energy.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News iPhone 7S Plus release date, news and rumors iPhone 7S Plus release date, news and rumors By John McCann Mobile phones   All the details on Apple's fourth generation iPhone phablet Shares 2017 marks another fallow year for Apple, as it looks to update its previous generation of devices with an "S" upgrade, rather than giving us a new numeral. With this in mind, rumors of the iPhone 7S Plus aren't exactly getting our pulses racing, and along with the iPhone 7S, we'd be surprised if it didn't show up in September.  There is one thing though... this year also marks the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone and Apple is tipped to celebrate this milestone with major upgrades in the form of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus alongside the the 7S duo. The iPhone 7 Plus was better than the iPhone 7, so we have high hopes for the iPhone 7S Plus. Everything you need to know: iPhone 8 | iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone 7S Cut to the chase What is it? The next phablet iPhone When is it out? Probably September 2017 What will it cost? Likely the same as 7 Plus at launch iPhone 7S Plus release date For the last few years Apple has announced new iPhones at the start of September and released the phone later in the month, and that’s exactly when we expect the iPhone 7S Plus to launch in 2017. This is not to be confused with the rumored iPhone 8 Plus which, along with the iPhone 8, is said to be suffering delays due to complications with OLED display production - which may mean it doesn't appear at the same time as the 7S Plus. TechRadar’s take: We're pretty confident that the iPhone 7S Plus will launch in September, and it would make sense for it to go on sale a couple of weeks later. Will the iPhone 8 launch really be later than usual? iPhone 7S Plus screen Hottest leaks: Display likely to stay the same size and resolution May feature a brighter, more colorful OLED screen It terms of the size and resolution of the iPhone 7S Plus display, we expect things to stay the same in this iterative update, with the iPhone 8 Plus more likely to see a bump in quality. That would mean we're looking at a 5.5-inch screen with a 1080 x 1920 resolution on the 7S Plus, generating a more-than-acceptable pixel density of 401ppi. Rumor has it Apple wants to upgrade the screen technology to OLED on all of its iPhone models, but demand for the tech is apparently high which may force Apple to stick with a LCD panel for the iPhone 7S Plus. All hope is not lost, with more recent rumors suggesting Apple has secured 160 million OLED panels, which could be enough to cater for all planned new iPhone models. TechRadar's take: It makes sense for Apple to stick to the same size and resolution for the iterative 7S Plus, while the OLED rumor is less certain. iPhone 7S Plus design Hottest leaks: An iterative update usually means a similar look One of the biggest criticisms of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was the fact that neither had a new design, but don't expect any big changes from the iPhone 7S Plus. Apple handsets from the iPhone 6 Plus onward look largely the same, but big design changes look set to come with the 10th anniversary iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. If Apple does keep the same blueprint for the iPhone 7S Plus then we're looking at a premium metal body finish and bezel-heavy front, with the iconic home button with Touch ID sitting pride of place below the display. TechRadar's take: Don't expect too much to change on the design front for the iPhone 7S Plus. Apple could make it a hair thinner, or reduce the camera bump on the back a bit, but on the whole we're expecting an almost identical device. iPhone 7S Plus camera Hottest leaks: Dual-cameras tipped to remain Optical image stabilization looks almost certain The new dual-camera was arguably the biggest upgrade for the iPhone 7 Plus, and it set it apart from the single-camera iPhone 7, so we’d expect to see the photos smarts on the iPhone 7S Plus.  Respected Chinese analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested the dual-lens camera will remain limited to the Plus model, and that both lenses will benefit from optical image stabilization, where currently only the wide-angle lens features OIS on the iPhone 7 Plus. TechRadar's take: Dual-cameras remain popular in 2017 with the LG G6, Huawei P10 and P10 Plus all donning double snappers on the rear and we see no reason why Apple would move away from this on the iPhone 7S Plus. iPhone 7S Plus battery Hottest leaks: Likely to be the same size, 2,900mAh battery Battery life could be improved with newer chipset and software Moving onto the iPhone 7S Plus battery size, there's currently little word on what to expect.  However, with the design of the 7S Plus likely to be very similar to its predecessor we wouldn't be surprised is Apple stuck with the same 2,900mAh offering and improved efficient with a newer chipset and software integration. There have been suggestions that Apple could introduce wireless charging to its iPhones this year, but this is something which it may save for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus - or not all. TechRadar's take: Looking at Apple's previous iPhones, it makes sense for the 7S Plus to sport a similar size battery to the iPhone 7 Plus, with improvements in battery life made on a chipset and software level. iPhone 7S Plus OS and power  Hottest leaks: A new iOS 11 operating system More powerful chipset, possibly more RAM too We’d expect iOS 11 to be running on the iPhone 7S Plus, and we should learn more about the next version of Apple's mobile operating system at WWDC 2017 in June. In recent years new iPhone launches coincided with the release of the new version of iOS, and there's no reason to believe things will change in 2017. The iPhone 7 Plus launched with A10 Fusion chipsets, so we’d expect a new quad-core chip on the iPhone 7S Plus and it's likely to be called the A11 Fusion, or just A11. The iPhone 7S Plus could pack either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. The 7 Plus has 3GB, while the iPad Pro has 4GB, so there's a change Apple may up things here. TechRadar's take: A new A11 chipset is almost certain, while a minimum of 3GB of RAM is also highly likely. iPhone 7S Plus other features Hottest leaks: A Smart Connector for accessories Iris scanner and facial recognition tech There’s a chance the Smart Connector from the iPad Pro could launch on the iPhone 7S Plus.  The long rumored iPhone 7 Pro was meant to feature the Smart Connector, for accessories such as small keyboards, but Apple may be waiting to launch it on the iPhone 7S Plus instead. Other rumors for the iPhone 7S Plus point towards the addition of an iris scanner and facial recognition as ways to further secure your phone. It’s a technology Samsung has included on the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, and we wouldn't be surprised if Apple followed suit with on the iPhone 7S Plus (and iPhone 7S). TechRadar's take: With Samsung adding more biometrics to its S8 handsets this year, Apple could well offer the same security features with the 7S Plus. iPhone 7S Plus price We’d expect a similar price for the iPhone 7S Plus as there was for the iPhone 7 Plus.  The 32GB model costs $769 (£719, AU$1,229), while the 128GB version costs $869 (£819, AU$1,419). If you want an even bigger 256GB version you have to spend $969 (£919, AU$1,569). TechRadar's take: The iPhone 7S Plus is sure to cost at least as much as the iPhone 7 Plus.

Try these troubleshooting fixes Siri not working? Try these troubleshooting fixes Get more out of Siri on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and Apple TV with these troubleshooting tips. From failures of understanding to difficulty with accents, we list the 14 most annoying Siri problems, and how to fix them by David Price | 20 Apr 17 Isn't Siri rubbish? Well, that's a matter of opinion, but Apple's voice-activated 'personal assistant', introduced with the iPhone 4s and later made available on iPad, certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea. Back in 2013 we went on to Twitter and asked Macworld readers about their experiences with Siri, and the things that they love and hate about Apple's voice-controlled personal assistant. In those early days, only about half said they use it - but while some of those used it fairly rarely, others defended the feature staunchly. We discuss the good stuff in a separate article - 10 things we love about Siri - but in this article we talk about its problems and annoyances, and how to fix them. In this article, however, we're going to concentrate on the bad stuff: the reasons why the other half gave it a go and recoiled with horror, never to ask for Siri's help again. So: what is it that makes Siri so rubbish? Read next: How to use Siri on Mac Siri's not working at all on my device. Can it run Siri? If Siri isn't working for you, the first thing to check is whether your device is able to run Siri. Siri is available on the iPhone 4s and later, on the iPad 3 and later (including all iPad Pro, iPad Air and iPad mini models, and the iPad 2017) and on the 5th- and 6th-gen iPod touch models. Plus every Apple Watch model and the 4th-gen Apple TV, and any Mac able to run macOS Sierra. If you've got an iPhone 4 or earlier, or an iPad 1 or iPad 2, you won't be able to run Siri, although there are some alternative voice-control apps on the App Store that you might like to try. How to turn Siri on If it's not working at all, Siri might be switched off. In iOS, go to Settings > Siri (in earlier versions of iOS you had to select Settings > General > Siri) and make sure the top slider, labelled Siri, is on, and green. On Mac, open System Preferences and click Siri (on the fourth row). Make sure there's a tick next to Enable Siri on the lefthand side. The best questions to ask Siri Simon Davies was put off Siri by his first (and only) experience. "Nope. Tried once. Gave up." "To be honest, I find it quite useless," added Abdullah. Solution: Don't be put off by one bad experience, Simon! Siri can do lots of stuff but it takes a little while to get used to its way of working. Bear in mind that Siri is constantly improving: Apple is continually adding features, and it should get better at interpreting your wishes the more you use it. There are many, many useful questions you can ask Siri. For more ideas of the questions that Siri can handle, press and hold the Home button to activate Siri, but don't ask it anything. After a short wait it will start cycling through several pages of sample questions. If your issue is that Siri can't understand your requests, rather than not knowing which questions are likely to produce useful results, try the fixes we list below for accent problems. How to make Siri understand a British accent Will Leitch complained about Siri's ability to grasp our weird and varied British voices. "The interaction bit is useless with UK and Irish accents," he writes. "Never seems to learn." "It only recognises what I say about 10 percent of the time," sighs Lee Peterson. Sorry Lee, what was that? And OwenScott never uses the feature at all, for precisely this reason. "Can't understand my accent," he explains. We're very sorry to say this - firmly opposed as Macworld is to the homogenisation of British accents - but it may be worth developing a 'Siri voice' in the same way our parents' generation had telephone voices. Just talk a bit posher. (More poshly?) And try speaking very clearly and slowly. (Find that embarrassing? We deal with that later on.) Here's how not to do it: On a less class-conscious level, check the microphone on your iOS device is clear and that you've removed the case if it blocks this. Apple has a handy Siri troubleshooting guide with some more advice related to this. Read next: iPhone buying guide 2016 Siri can't hear me - is there a problem with the microphone? Siri is dependent on being able to hear you, so the microphone on your iPad or iPhone is crucial. If Siri is activating - you're seeing the the soundwave graphic and "What can I help you with?" text - but Siri can't make out what you're saying, there could be an issue with the microphone. Here are some things to check: Case: If you've got a case or cover, this could be obstructing the mic. Take the case off and try again. Any better? Fluff: Is there any fluff, gunk or detritus in the microphone aperture? Locate the mic - on your iPhone it will be on the bottom edge, although the precise layout varies from model to model, while on an iPad it will be on the righthand edge - and examine it for any obstructions. Blowing gently, using a can of compressed air and probing very cautiously with a pin or similar can all help clear away annoying fluff, but you must make sure you don't damage the mic and aggravate the issue. Now try Siri again. Any better? If Siri's still not picking up your words, there may be something more serious wrong with the microphone. To isolate this, you need to see if Siri works with a different microphone - you could plug in a pair of headphones with an integrated mic, for instance, or plug your iDevice into a CarPlay-equipped vehicle. Any better? If so, Siri is fine but the microphone isn't. You'll need to take your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store and get the microphone looked at. How to use Siri (or Siri-like features) without an internet connection Our own Ashleigh Allsopp uses Siri regularly, but pointed out: "I never use Siri unless I'm on Wi-Fi. It's the most irritating thing ever because it requires an internet connection to do EVERYTHING!" Jim Martin, who is the editor of our sister website PC Advisor, echoed Ashleigh's comments. "In my view, Apple needs to build in on-board recognition for simple commands - timers, alarms, playing music, sending messages etc - that doesn't need an internet connection. "In the car this is a major problem. Drive anywhere without a 3G signal and you're scuppered. There's no saying 'Text my wife to say I'm running an hour late because of bad traffic'." Solution: We can't get past this fundamental limitation of Siri's technology and entirely agree with Jim's idea. But remember that Voice Control (which offers a few similar functions, such as letting you dial contacts' numbers verbally) does work offline. If you want to use that instead, you'll need to switch off Siri: Go to Settings > General > Siri. Read next: How to teach Siri nicknames How to stop other people activating 'Hey Siri' on your iPhone or iPad Hey Siri is a neat feature. If you've got the feature switched on, you only have to say the words "Hey Siri" and Siri will turn itself on and listen out for instructions - even if your iPhone or iPad was asleep. One issue with this - one which was alluded to humorously at Apple's iPad Pro 9.7in launch, where Phil Schiller carefully placed a pause between the words "Hey... Siri" so that he wouldn't set off the devices in the audience - is that other people can sometimes activate Siri for you. If this is driving you to distraction, you can of course turn off Hey Siri entirely - go to Settings, General, Siri, and tap the slider next to 'Allow "Hey Siri"' - but then you'll miss out on a cool feature. Instead, assuming you didn't do this when you first set up your device, train Hey Siri so that he or she is attuned to your voice and only your voice. (And, in practice, a few other people with very similar voices, but you can't have everything.) Go back to Settigns, General, Siri and tap the slider next to 'Allow "Hey Siri"' so it goes white, then tap once more so it goes green again. This will kick you back into the Hey Siri setup process that you presumably skipped last time. You'll be instructed to say the words "Hey Siri" three times, then a couple of more advanced phrases, and this should be enough to get Siri used to your intonations. Turn off the device's screen and check Hey Siri works, but you should be good to go. Is Siri's information up to date? Macworld's production editor, Rob Woodcock, writes: "Some of the information Siri provides is seriously out of date. In Tunbridge Wells, for example, it directs people to a hospital that closed down two years ago." (Rob is a great champion of Tunbridge Wells and its municipal facilities.) Solution: We wouldn't depend on Siri in life-or-death situations - such as medical emergencies - at this point. It remains a work in progress. But, like Maps, Siri is getting better. And without meaning any disrepect to the fine town of Tunbridge Wells, Siri will be at its best in larger cities. Of course, if you regularly use Siri, you'll have a good idea of its strengths in your home town, and the sorts of information it can be depended on to provide in a pinch. Read next: Apple accused of stealing Siri from Chinese firm How to use Siri in a noisy place Jim Martin was also displeased that Siri's auditory fussiness means he can't use it to work in his favoured location. "The pub would be too noisy for Siri to understand," he worried. "Probably." Speaking slowly and clearly directly into the microphone (and, as we mentioned previously, checking that the microphone is clear and unobstructed) will improve your chances of getting Siri to understand you, but our experience suggests that Siri is actually okay in moderately noisy places. Pub, yes. Late-night discotheque, perhaps not - in those places you're better off typing out searches and using menus manually. Macworld Masterclass: Make the most of Siri How to trust Siri Rick Lecoat doesn't yet feel confident enough to depend on Siri. "Got excited when I realised I could set an alarm or timer," he says, "but inevitably I then confirm it's set as intended - so benefit lost." Solution: When you checked, Rick, did it turn out that Siri had done the job as expected? From the way you describe this, it sounds like it did. As with most of these issues, our advice would be to keep on using the feature - confidence will come in time, after Siri has done its job five times, or 10 times, without a problem. For simple tasks it really can be handy. How to stop Siri being so annoying Gareth Llewellyn assured us that he only uses Siri "when I have a pressing need to be annoyed beyond belief". Solution: First, cheer yourself by asking Siri a few funny questions. Hopefully that'll soothe the annoyance a bit. If Siri's smug voice (and British Siri, with no offence intended to the voice artist, can be a bit pompous) is winding you up, put him on mute - go to Settings > General > Siri > Voice Feedback and select Hands-free Only. That way the responses will appear on screen rather than being spoken aloud (unless you plug in a hands-free kit). Siri is embarrassing to use Ryan J. Nicholson reckons Siri is "too embarrassing to use in public. People would just think I'm talking to a phone." Solution: Well, first of all you can use Siri with a hands-free kit, such as a Bluetooth headset, which if you're reasonably subtle will make people think you're having a real conversation with a person. It's also less likely to attract attention from muggers. Secondly, surely the embarrassment factor depends on where you use Siri? Whipping out the iPhone for a word with Siri in a nice pub full of middle-aged people with real jobs is probably going to make you look like a spiv, but a street in Dalston should be fine. A general rule is that if you'd feel self-conscious taking a photo with an iPad, using Siri is probably not on. We think voice control technology has a big future, and in the next few years you'll look less and less peculiar using Siri in public. Read next: The evolution of Siri: we assess Siri's school report Siri's personality is annoying Some Macworld readers find it hard to get on with Apple's chirpy personal assistant. "She never understands me," explained Sarah Taylor. "We fell out quite quickly." This sounds like many of our early relationships. iPad Pro 9.7in review | iPad mini 4 review Solution: You can change Siri's personality - sort of - by changing his voice. Go to Settings > General > Siri > Siri Voice and tap where it says British (Male). In the next screen you'll be able to switch to a female voice, or get an American or Australian voice instead. Siri's language is changed in a separate field on the same screen, so in theory you can stick to England (United Kingdom) while changing Siri's accent to UK or Australian. But in our extremely unscientific tests US-accented Siri seemed to struggle more with British idioms and accents than the UK default, even though he was still set to the English (United Kingdom) language. For this reason we'd recommend sticking to the gender change, but your mileage may vary. If all six of the gender/accent combinations get on your wick, you can always consider putting Siri on mute, as explained in the 'Siri is annoying' section. Finally, for the jailbreakers out there (standard disclaimer: jailbreaking your iPhone or iPad is likely to void your warranty, and may damage your device), it's possible to set a custom wallpaper for when Siri is active. It's hard to stay mad at Siri if he has Jesse Pinkman's face. Keep forgetting to use Siri Is this Siri's fault? Possibly - after all, if it's not providing a valuable service, why would we remember it's there? "I don't find it that useful and forget it's there most of the time," said Adrian R, who uses Siri "rarely". Solution: Start off with a couple of things that you know Siri can do easily - voice dialling and dictating reminders and appointments, say. After a while this will become second nature. You can build up your repertoire from there. If you're really struggling to remember that Siri is there, maybe you could change your wallpaper to this: And finally… Two more thoughts on Siri. Chris Towndrow informs us that "there's a nice bloke in our local Waitrose called Siri". Thanks for that. But the last word goes to Adam, who offers a melancholy insight into his romantic affairs: "I've always had Siri and I've never used it. Today's version of a condom."

The pledge comes as part of Apple's 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report, which was released on Wednesday and outlines how the company wants to move towards a 'closed-loop supply chain'. That means it will no longer be mining for materials in the future, though at this point it remains unclear how the company will get to that point and when. On top of its recycled material goals for products, Cupertino also says it has managed to use 99% recycled and responsibly sourced paper in its packaging, and is hoping to move towards 100%. Related: iPhone 8 The company states on its environment report page: "We’re moving toward a closed-loop supply chain. One day we’d like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products." In a recent interview with Vice, Apple’s VP of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, Lisa Jackson, also commented on Apple's desire to increase its use of recycled materials. She said the company is working towards “not necessarily having to source from the earth for everything that we need... We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it." It seems there's still a way to go until Apple gets to the point where it can stop mining for materials, though it has already shown off a number of ways in which it has tried to incorporate sustainable practices into its production process. Last year it demonstrated a recycling robot that deconstructs iPhone 6S handsets, recycling parts for use in other phones, and has carried out an audit of its supply chain following reports of children working in a cobalt mine in the Congo. In a page explaining its resource ambitions, Apple says: "To start, we’re encouraging more customers to recycle their old devices through Apple Renew. "And we’re piloting innovative new recycling techniques, like our line of disassembly robots, so we can put reclaimed materials to better use in new products. "It’s an ambitious goal that will require many years of collaboration across multiple Apple teams, our suppliers, and specialty recyclers — but our work is already under way."

Get at me: lwilliams@thinkprogress.org. Apr 20 Apple promises to stop mineral mining — but doesn’t yet know how to pull it off “It sounds crazy, but we’re working on it,” Apple wrote in its latest environmental impact report. Apple products appear on display at Macy’s flagship store in New York. CREDIT: AP Photo/Anne D’Innocenzio Just in time for Earth Day, Apple pledged to “stop mining the earth altogether” for rare minerals, metals, and materials used to create its products. But the iPhone manufacturer admits that it hasn’t quite figured out how to wean itself off mining. “We’re actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we’ve completely figured out how to do it,” Lisa Jackson, Apple SVP of environmental policy told Vice. “So we’re a little nervous, but we also think it’s really important, because as a sector we believe it’s where technology should be going.” Right now, many of the elements of Apple’s electronic devices require rare materials often found in conflict areas that pose both environmental and human risks. Apple has been a leader on cleaning up its supply chain, announcing in 2015, for instance, that it would audit all of its suppliers from the conflict-plagued and mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo. The paradox of Congo: How the world’s wealthiest country became home to the world’s poorest people thinkprogress.org Now the company aims to pivot toward investing in a closed-loop supply chain where products are made only from recycled or renewable materials. “For aluminum, we found that one of the best sources of recycled material was our own products and processes,” Apple wrote in its new sustainability report. “Our challenge is to recover the aluminum from our products without degrading its quality.” In addition to identifying better recycling techniques, Apple’s environmental report touted using 100 percent renewable energy in facilities across 24 countries, all of its data centers, and its headquarters in Cupertino, California. Apple also mapped its carbon footprint — 29,500,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions — 77 percent of which come from manufacturing. Most of that comes from electricity use, so Apple said it is “sourcing lower-carbon materials, partnering with our suppliers around the world to reduce their current energy use, and helping them switch to renewable energy.” 13 giant companies just made big climate pledges thinkprogress.org Apple’s green efforts have come a long way in recent years. A 2012 Greenpeace report on renewable energy use in tech named Apple one of the dirtiest users. Now, Apple leads the pack while Amazon and Microsoft have lagged behind. Thanks to Samantha Page.

By Damien McFerran Tablets  Shares 1. Introduction, design and display 2. What's it like to use? 3. Battery life and camera 4. Verdict and competition Our Verdict The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 has an iPad-like design, but not quite the quality. However it offers the flexibility of Android, the QHD screen is wonderful and strong audio, a decent amount of power and expandable storage sweeten the deal further. It’s just a shame the battery life isn’t better. For Brilliant 2K display Hi-Res audio support Fast chipset Against Mediocre battery life Build quality has issues Speakers poorly positioned Update: The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 is now listed in our best tablet of the year ranking. While Apple's iPad range has been a big seller since its inception in 2010, Android tablets have failed to achieve the same commercial success, despite Google's early enthusiasm for the concept. Asus is clearly of the opinion that if you can't beat 'em you should join 'em, because its latest slate is a dead ringer for the iPad Pro 9.7. It boasts a 9.7-inch 1536 x 2048 screen and a design language which is straight out of Apple's Cupertino offices. It’s also got fairly beefy specs on the inside, with power supplied by a MediaTek hexa-core chipset and 4GB of RAM, while a 5900mAh battery is on hand to keep things ticking over. Asus ZenPad 3S 10 price The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 costs £300/$300 Not currently available in Australia and no word on a release date there Couple that with a mid-range price of $300 (£300, around AU$515), which is well under what you’d pay for a recent Apple slate, and it starts to look like Asus could be on to a winner. But even in the mid-range competition is steep, with the likes of the Huawei MediaPad M2 10.0 and Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 competing for your cash, so the ZenPad 3S 10 needs to be more than just a cheap imitation to stand out. Design and display Thinner than an iPad at 5.8mm thick Premium, Apple-inspired design Slightly creaky build There's no getting around it - the ZenPad 3S 10 really does look an awful lot like an iPad.  The ZenPad 3S 10 ignores the widescreen aspect ratio so beloved by Android tablet makers – as Samsung also did with the recent Galaxy Tab S2 – and follows Apple's lead by adopting a 4:3 display, which naturally makes the 3S 10 stand out from many of its Google-based rivals. If you can overlook the cheeky way Asus has copied Apple's concept, there's a lot to like here from a purely physical perspective – this is one handsome tablet. The metal casing has elegant, diamond-cut bezels on the corners, while the edges have a gentle curve to them which makes it comfortable to hold. The volume and power buttons are located on the top-right corner of the device (assuming you're holding it in portrait orientation) and the only other physical input is the home button, which also doubles as a surprisingly fast and accurate fingerprint scanner. This is flanked by two capacitive buttons for back and multitasking, which illuminate briefly when you interact with the screen or any of the buttons. On the top edge, there's a 3.5mm headphone socket, which can output audio in Hi-Res, while the bottom is home to a USB Type-C port and two "NXP Amp powered speakers". Like so much else, the positioning of these speakers calls to mind an iPad – but in this case we wish Asus had revised things a little, as it's far too easy to cover one of the speaker grilles with your palm when you're holding the device. Front-facing speakers – one at each end of the device – would have been better, although that may have prevented Asus from achieving a thickness of just 5.8mm, which makes it thinner than the iPad Pro 9.7. The ZenPad 3S 10 is also incredibly lightweight for a tablet of these proportions, tipping the scales at around 430g. One element of Apple's design which Asus sadly hasn't been able to replicate is overall build quality; while the ZenPad 3S 10 looks and feels like a premium device – and, to be fair, it is – there's a notable flex on the back panel when you apply pressure with a finger. You can even hear the panel moving and pushing against the internal frame, which gives the impression that it's slightly hollow inside. The microSD card slot – which is found on the top-left edge and lets you expand beyond the tablet's 32GB of memory – rattled quite noticeably on our review unit, too. The tablet's IPS screen is perhaps its crowning glory, delivering pin-sharp definition, superb color replication and striking contrast – thanks in part to Asus' own VisualMaster technology.  It's still possible to pick out individual pixels despite the QHD resolution, but that's not unusual on tablets of this size and doesn't impact the visual spectacle. Viewing angles are rock-solid and you can tinker with how the screen looks via the preinstalled "Splendid" application, which offers a blue light filter option not entirely dissimilar to Apple's Night Shift mode. This reduces the display's blue light emission by up to 30%, which supposedly stops it keeping you awake when used late at night. 1 2 3 4 Current page: Introduction, design and display Next Page What's it like to use?

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Lawsuits allege CEQA violations related to Apple Valley's Project Jupiter Thursday Apr 20, 2017 at 8:58 AM Apr 20, 2017 at 4:14 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A trio of recently filed lawsuits allege violations that cast doubt on the Council-approved environmental review of a distribution center that, once constructed, is expected to bring the town $600,000 in annual property tax revenue. It’s estimated Project Jupiter — code name for the warehousing facility linked to discount retailer Big Lots — also will bring upwards of 500 jobs to Apple Valley, but town officials’ decision to forgo a new Environmental Impact Report (EIR) could delay the project that’s been in the works since 2014. In April 2016, the town prepared an initial study for Jupiter and recommended a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) that would “tier” from the 2006 North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan’s (NAVISP) EIR pursuant to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines. On Feb. 7, the Town Council adopted a resolution that, in part, approved the MND and cleared a path for submittal of a building plan; however, the suits claim the lack of an EIR is in violation of CEQA. The suits were filed by the Sierra Club, Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance (GSEJA) and Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), three groups that urged the Council to reject the MND and to prepare an original EIR during the Feb. 7 special meeting. On Tuesday, spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press the town is unable to comment on the specifics of active litigation, adding that the full EIR for the NAVISP anticipated projects such as Jupiter. Additionally, comments delivered by Mayor Pro Tem Art Bishop during the Feb. 7 meeting solidify the town’s stance that the EIR prepared in 2006, as well as the MND, are adequate enough to move the project forward. “We in Apple Valley are prepared both economically (and) environmentally ... not only for today but for tomorrow,” Bishop said. “Not only for the safety of the employees that will be working and building that facility, but for the employees that will work there for — I pray — a long, long time.” According to the Sierra Club’s filing, a MND can be prepared for a project only when “revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant project effects” and “there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the project as revised may have a significant effect on the environment.” With that said, the Sierra Club — citing some of the town’s own studies — argues the town was presented with substantial evidence that construction of the 1.3-million-square-foot distribution center may significantly affect air quality, biological resources and traffic in the area. “By adopting a MND for the Project when there is substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant environmental impacts; by failing to prepare an EIR; and by failing to adopt all feasible mitigation to reduce the Project’s significant impacts to the environment, the Town committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and the Project approvals must be set aside,” the Sierra Club filing shows. GSEJA’s filing also cites a town analysis to show that nitrogen oxides, atmospheric particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions could dramatically affect air quality near the project. “The Project’s 106.5 acres represents approximately 2 (percent) of the original total 4,937.5 acres covered by the NAVISP,” the GSEJA filing shows, “yet according to the Town’s own consultant, the Project would generate approximately 12 (percent) of thc total NOx emissions, 30 (percent) of the total PM10 emissions, and about 9 (percent) of the total CO emissions anticipated for the NAVISP as a whole.” Additionally, the Sierra Club filing noted that the project will generate about “3,108 daily vehicle trips, including 2,220 daily truck trips.” “Mobile emissions, particularly diesel emissions due to truck trips, are the largest source of air emissions due to the Project,” Sierra Club documents show. “In particular NOx emissions (a component of diesel emissions) are more than four times greater than the applicable threshold of significance.” And GSEJA’s suit claims that “if all projects across the Specific Plan area were as emissions-intensive as this one, the Specific-Plan-wide emissions would be at least 5,883 tons per year, which is over 235 times the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District’s annual significance threshold of 25 tons per year.” Meanwhile, LIUNA’s filing, which names town resident Timothy Carillo as a co-petitioner, alleges the MND failed to accurately survey for the presence of special status species likely to be found on the project site, including burrowing owls, golden eagles, prairie falcons, bats and pallid San Diego pocket mice, court documents show. Allegations also were raised related to inadequate study of leftover explosive materials from when areas of Apple Valley served as a World War II bombing range. GSEJA included in its filing a list of 20 possible mitigations that would have reduced the project’s environmental impact, adding that “virtually all of which the Town rejected or refused to impose.” Bishop’s reference to the safety of employees at the Feb. 7 meeting was also addressed in LIUNA’s filing. “LIUNA members may also be exposed to construction and operational hazards from air pollution emissions that have not been adequately analyzed or mitigated,” the suit shows. “The interests of LIUNA members are unique and will be directly impacted by the Project.” A status hearing on the petitions is scheduled for May 9, according to court records.
