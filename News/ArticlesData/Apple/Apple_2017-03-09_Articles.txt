Experts say the greater threat comes from criminals armed with new information about device vulnerabilities, thanks to the release of documents by Wikileaks. Wikileaks’ release Tuesday of a trove of purportedly leaked CIA documents — not confirmed as genuine but not disputed by the CIA — indicated that the intelligence agency had found numerous ways to get into iPhones and Android phones and even bypass the encryption of apps claimed to be secure. While the documents did not detail specific methods of attack, cybersecurity analysts said they provide a roadmap for bad actors to follow. “These exploits are in the wild now, everyone can use them, so everyone will,” said Gartner analyst and cybersecurity specialist Avivah Litan. “These are very advanced attack methods. It’s not clear how existing protections will fare against them. “It affects every corporate user, every consumer.” Also included, Litan said, was information about security flaws the CIA has found in laptops, PCs and TVs. Cybersecurity experts criticized Wikileaks for suddenly making public the information without giving companies, including Google and Apple, a chance to fix security holes in advance. “Now that it’s out, other people can use this leak to potentially exploit these same issues before the vendors can fix those flaws,” said Georgia Weidman, founder of cybersecurity startup Shevirah. “It’s lowered the barrier to entry for attackers.” On Thursday, controversial Wikileaks founder Julian Assange offered Apple, Google and other affected companies unreleased details about the purported CIA hacking tools. “We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured,” Assange said in a press conference on Facebook Live. “Once this material is effectively disarmed … we will publish additional details about what has been occurring.” Neither Apple nor Google responded immediately to questions about whether the details offered by Assange would be likely to help them secure their devices from intrusion. While Weidman said that source code for the CIA hacking tools could be helpful to companies in securing their devices, Litan said Google and Apple may not want assistance from the divisive Assange, and probably don’t need his help. The leaked documents should give the firms enough information to find vulnerabilities, Litan said. “These companies are very smart, they don’t need all the details,” she said. “They just need pointers, and there are enough pointers in there.” Apple on Tuesday moved to reassure consumers that their devices are safe. “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,” the Cupertino firm said in a statement. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.” Reading this on your phone or tablet?

Google followed suit Thursday morning. “As we’ve reviewed the documents, we’re confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities,” Heather Adkins, the company’s director of information security and privacy, said in a statement. “Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections. We’ve always made security a top priority and we continue to invest in our defenses.” However, analyst Litan noted that neither firm was claiming to be completely secure from attacks by the reported array of CIA hacking tools. “The bottom line,” Litan said, “is there’s still plenty of room for exploits.”           Tags:  Apple Google Samsung Security Technology Wikileaks Ethan Baron Ethan Baron is a business reporter at The Mercury News, and a native of Silicon Valley before it was Silicon Valley.

Apple regains top spot in New Zealand smartphone shipments Chris Keall Friday March 10, 2017 Share iPhone: back on top RELATED AUDIO: Samsung will bounce back, says IDC analyst Chayse Gordon Play Log in or subscribe to listen to audio. Pause Add to MyNBR Radio 0 0:00 0:10 Play NBR radio on Apple shipped the highest number of smartphones over the Christmas quarter, according to IDC’s smartphone shipment results for New Zealand, tracked from October to December 2016. Samsung, which was hit by the Galaxy Note 7 "fire phone" recall, slipped to second. It was the first time that Apple had claimed the slot since the first quarter of 2012.   Vendors shipped a record high volume of 672,000 smartphones during October to December 2016, up from 614,000 smartphones shipped over the same period in 2015. The top three vendors made up close to 80% of these shipments. Apple shipped 221,000 smartphones, Samsung fell to the number two position with 176,000 smartphone shipments, and Huawei closed the number three gap significantly reaching 143,000 smartphone shipments.   Chayse Gorton, client device analyst for IDC New Zealand, believes there are three key reasons contributing to Apples fourth quarter performance in the market.   Apple overcame stock constraints observed after the release of the iPhone 7 models late in the fourth quarter. "Even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated," he says.   Despite looking somewhat similar to the iPhone 6s, updated specifications were enough to entice many consumers to upgrade their Apple smartphone. Mr Gorton suggests, "It's hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability", rather he suggests "it is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior".    Publicity issues relating to competing vendors enticed a portion of consumers to make the switch to Apple. Samsung's battery cell issues in its recently released Note 7 smartphones, and the subsequent recall, not only led the devices to be excluded from IDC's tracker, but also to some consumers to question their loyalty to the vendor.          2016 was an exciting year, with the overall smartphone market growing 10% year on year, and despite fourth quarter vendor rankings, Samsung holding off Apple to retain the number one position for the year. Overall for 2016, Samsung held 32% share, Apple held 27% share, and Huawei held 14% share.   With Apple successfully winning a quarter for the first time in close to five years, and Huawei closing the gap in third place, it is safe to say the smartphone vendor battleground is shaping up for an interesting year. Earlier, Mr Gorton told NBR he thought Samsung would rebound from its Note 7 issue.  The Korean phone maker is set to unveil its new Galaxy range on March 15.

As to be expected, Apple is remaining more tight-lipped than ever when it comes to details around the iPhone 8. In this article, you’ll find everything we know so far about Apple’s next handset, the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 could release later than September https://t.co/F0w0wXRjCi pic.twitter.com/OXTD9q4MGQ — iDownloadBlog (@iDownloadBlog) March 6, 2017 When will the iPhone 8 be released? According to Business Insider, it’s almost a given that Apple’s next iPhone iteration will be released in September. The iPhone 5, the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 7 were released in September of 2012, 2014, and 2016. That being said, Apple is reportedly struggling to manufacture its high-end OLED phone screens ready in time for a September launch. With that in mind, some analysts have suggested that Apple will instead launch an iPhone 7S model in September and then introduce a radical overhaul of the iPhone line with the iPhone 8 later in the year. Which would be a drastic change for Apple. Whether or not Apple has the iPhone 8 ready for September, the company will reportedly release the iPhone 8 as a premium option alongside the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus anyway. iPhone 8 will likely be the most expensive smartphone Apple has ever released https://t.co/sR7bFC7Nfh pic.twitter.com/q2Aiy8JuGu — Forbes (@Forbes) March 6, 2017 How much will the iPhone 8 cost? As aforementioned, the iPhone 8 is expected to be the biggest overhaul in the iPhone line-up since its launch 10 years ago. However, it’s also expected to be Apple’s most expensive mobile device to date. According to Forbes, Apple’s next flagship phone could cost upwards of $1,000, which would be a considerable increase over the iPhone 7 at just over $700. With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that the aforementioned iPhone 7S models will be cheaper than the iPhone 8, offering the latest generation iPhone for those not all that interested in the new features offered by the iPhone 8. That being said, there’s always the possibility that Apple will surprise fans and take a very different route with the iPhone 8’s release.

We already know that the iPhone 8 will be the biggest overhaul yet in Apple’s smartphone lineup, especially in comparison to the iPhone 7’s relatively underwhelming release. So what should you expect from the revolutionary new iPhone? Undeniably the most reported rumored feature of the upcoming iPhone 8 is an all-new OLED display measuring a massive 5.8-inches. Such a display size would make the iPhone 8 the biggest mobile device ever made by Apple and the biggest mass-market mobile phone available at the moment. That being said, Apple will reportedly shrink the device’s bezels considerably, meaning that despite the larger screen, the iPhone 8’s body will actually be smaller than last year’s iPhone 7 Plus. Whether or not Apple will also offer a smaller model iPhone 8 remains to be seen, however, the iPhone 7S may instead fill that void. Apple patent hints facial recognition and 3D selfies are coming to iPhone 8 https://t.co/ozLXCOaHgj pic.twitter.com/hATzOUkjEO — TNW (@TheNextWeb) March 7, 2017 What’s more, Apple will reportedly use a portion of that large display as a “function area,” similar in nature to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro. This function area will reportedly adapt and change depending on what the user is doing on the phone and will also incorporate Apple’s iconic home button, which will be absent from the iPhone for the first time in 10 years. However, it’s worth remembering that any details around the iPhone 8 are currently purely speculative. Apple’s next and biggest iteration in their iPhone line-up will reportedly launch in September. Apple is expected to officially unveil the device at an event ahead of its release.

The US Patent and Trademark Office has granted the Cupertino heavyweight a patent for a mysterious technology that enables “enhanced face detection using depth information” through the application of specifically modified hardware and software modules. Follow TNW at SXSW 2017! We're covering the weird and wonderful tech at SXSW, join us in the fun. PARTY TIME While it remains unclear precisely how Apple might integrate the technology with its upcoming iPhone, the patent notes that the facial recognition apparatus will rely on a combination of camera modules, depth sensors and computer imaging techniques to generate depth maps and accurately identify faces in images.   The technology essentially breaks down images in smaller “windows” and proceeds to select one or more locations inside the image to “test for presence of human faces.” The method leverages depth information to make the overall process more accurate and less intensive. The patent further indicates the technology will likely be available for both still images and video. The method, however, does bring its own caveats. As pointed out, the technology becomes less reliable once more faces begin to appear at different locations and depths. This could lead to increased false detection rate. Credit: US Patent and Trademark Office News of this patent follows reports speculating the Big A could be ramping up its augmented reality efforts and possibly introducing a ‘revolutionary’ 3D selfie camera. What adds further credence to these claims is that Apple’s alleged 3D camera will fundamentally rely on infrared modules built by previously acquired 3D sensor manufacturer PrimeSense. The modules in question will purportedly be capable of projecting patterns of optical radiation onto a scene, which in turn will enable devices to split the image in corresponding depth maps. Esteemed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously forecast that the new and improved camera tech will likely land on the higher-priced premium iPhone model, which could surpass the $1,000 mark. Still, this is all speculation at this point and we might have to wait a few more years before we see the new technology in action. via AppleInsider Enhanced face detection using depth information on US Patent and Trademark Office Read next: Why AI will determine the future of fintech AppleGeariPhone Share on Facebook (483) Share on Twitter (275) Mix is a reporter from Amsterdam.

Apple have not held the number one position since the first quarter of 2012. Vendors shipped a record high volume of 672,000 smartphones during October to December 2016, up from 614,000 smartphones shipped over the same period in in 2015. The top three vendors made up close to 80% of these shipments. Apple shipped 221,000 smartphones, Samsung fell to the number two position with 176,000 smartphone shipments, and Huawei closed the number three gap significantly reaching 143,000 smartphone shipments. Chayse Gorton, Client Device Analyst for IDC New Zealand, believes there are three key reasons contributing to Apples fourth quarter performance in the market. Apple overcame stock constraints observed after the release of the iPhone 7 models late in the fourth quarter. Gorton says, “even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated”. Despite looking somewhat similar to the iPhone 6s, updated specifications were enough to entice many consumers to upgrade their Apple smartphone. Gorton suggests, “it’s hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability”, rather he suggests “it is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior”. Publicity issues relating to competing vendors enticed a portion of consumers to make the switch to Apple. Samsung’s battery cell issues in its recently released Note 7 smartphones, and the subsequent recall, not only led the devices to be excluded from IDC’s tracker, but also to some consumers to question their loyalty to the vendor. 2016 was an exciting year, with the overall smartphone market growing 10% year on year, and despite fourth quarter vendor rankings, Samsung holding off Apple to retain the number one position for the year. Overall for 2016, Samsung held 32% share, Apple held 27% share, and Huawei held 14% share. With Apple successfully winning a quarter for the first time in close to five years, and Huawei closing the gap in third place, it is safe to say the smartphone vendor battleground is shaping up for an interesting year. http://schema.org/MediaObject” > https://accounts.icharts.net/widget/assets/ichartwidget.css?v=2.1“> https://accounts.icharts.net/icharts/embed/MH/azSxN</a>&#8221; height=&#8221;516&#8243; width=&#8221;450&#8243; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243;> http://chartchannel.icharts.net/chartchannel/smartphone-shipments-new-zealand-2016q4-vendor-share_mhazsxnc“>iCharts http://chartchannel.icharts.net/chartchannel/smartphone-shipments-new-zealand-2016q4-vendor-share_mhazsxnc“> idcap_corpcomms@idc.com“> ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url  Print This Post Tweet     Blogroll China Economic Scan Compare house prices Deposit Rates Direct Broking – NZX & ASX Trading & Prices Findata – Market Data Good Returns Herald Business Interest.co.nz – Interest Rates News & Views National Business Review Property Talk Sharechat Stuff Business Value Cruncher – NZX Latest Business news Fletcher Building in trading halt NZ wool market improves at double auction New Zealand announces new executive appointment Landlord unlawfully rented converted garage Soft Plastic Recycling reaches Countdown Queenstown Mondelez confirms Dunedin exit Overnight motorway closures 18 – 25 March 2017 New Owners Continue Smokefree Outdoor Dining Thankyou Payroll expanding through equity crowdfunding NZ’s childhood favourite now available in all organic Mayor laments confirmation of Cadbury closure BP plans to halve NZ Refining stake, selling $86 mln shares Higgins employee’s 25-year skill base formally recognised Beachside apartment development 40 percent sold IPONZ world number one for online capabilities Text Links Recent Comments Lan: Unbelievable that a WEST AUSTR... jackp: Murray, when Key is involved t...

So, where did Apple land on the top 50 USPTO granted patent list for 2016? Number eleven with Samsung number two. From the EU's top 50 list of granted patents, Samsung came in number three and Apple didn't even make the list as noted from the EU's Excel spreadsheet below that anyone can download here.   So the next time an Android fan foams at the mouth about Apple being a patent maniac, point them to our report so that they could look in the mirror and see that Samsung is the patent filing freak, not Apple.   As someone who covers both Apple and Samsung granted patents, it's a joke at the level Samsung wins patents. This week alone Samsung was granted 213 patents versus 42 for Apple. And that's just one Android OEM.   If you happen to read any news that Apple files the most patents on the planet, make sure to label that site a supporter of FAKE NEWS.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Apple had already claimed to have already patched most of the exploits, and a recent report from The Wall Street Journal (via 9to5Mac) has revealed that Apple engineers are already working on patching the rest. According to Apple’s previous statement, “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.” The report from the WSJ also revealed that the company’s engineers had previously run into some trouble as the software used to hack their devices wasn’t being shared. However as you might recall, Wikileaks recently announced that they would be sharing the tools and working with these tech companies to help them fix the flaws that were discovered, so hopefully we can expect a patch in the near future that should address these issues. Of course this by no means puts an end to security flaws, holes, or exploits, but we guess at the very least it makes things a bit harder for hackers in the future, regardless of which side they are supposed to represent.

Apple has been scrambling trying to learn more about the remaining exploits and it looks like the help it needs is coming directly from Wikileaks. The organization said it plans to share everything it knows about the hacks with Apple, and it’s going to do the same for other tech companies the CIA targeted, too. Wikileaks giving Apple the CIA’s Phone hacking code The reported exploits were listed in thousands of pages Wikileaks released this week. Products from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and several other companies were listed as targets for CIA surveillance through exploits the agency wasn’t sharing, raising concerns about who was being monitored and if other governments were taking advantage of the same hacks. The exploits were leaked as part of a document collection Wikileaks is calling Vault 7. Apple said most of the exploits listed in the documents have already been patched, and it’s actively looking into the rest. The problem Apple is facing is that without the code the CIA is using, tracking down and patching the exploits is difficult at best. Wikileaks: Share and Share Alike Since the CIA isn’t interested in sharing the code, Wikileaks will. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said, “We have decided to work with [manufacturers] to give them exclusive access to the additional technological details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out.” After the companies patch the exploits Wikileaks plans to publish the hacks, according to NPR. Mr. Assange went on to say the CIA is incompetent because it failed to protect the hacks it uses. CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak made it clear how the agency feels about Mr. Assange saying, “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.” Wikileaks isn’t offering up a time frame for when it will release the CIA’s exploits. The fact that they’re coming at some point makes it imperative we update our iPhones and iPads as soon as Apple’s security patches are released. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: CIA, exploit, iPhone, spy, WikiLeaks 5 Comments Add a comment geoduck March 9, 2017 I believe there are laws to prevent the passing or accepting of classified information. As these hacks and tools are still classified some overzealous prosecutor could theoretically go after Apple et.al. for accepting this information from Wikileaks. March 9, 2017 at 5:30 EDT PM skipaq March 9, 2017 Legally, the CIA is supposed to share the vulnerabilities it discovers with manufacturers. It is shameful that Wikileaks is involved at all. March 9, 2017 at 5:57 EDT PM d'monder March 9, 2017 Wish Wikileaks would’ve told the tech companies first. Until Apple releases some updates (hopefully very soon now), we gotta live with published open exploits. March 9, 2017 at 6:16 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 10, 2017 Assange hadn’t been in the news for a while and he was probably getting yancy about not getting any attention. March 10, 2017 at 7:56 EDT AM Interested Observer March 11, 2017 The CIA obviously knows all about being “not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.” March 11, 2017 at 6:04 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

I didn’t, until I stumbled upon this by accident, like some of my other tips. Creating subfolders lets you organize your notes in more detailed ways that make sense to you. Here’s how to do it on macOS. Apple Notes Subfolders For macOS When Apple Notes got a makeover with iOS 9 in 2015, I migrated my notes from Evernote. I didn’t have an elaborate system set up in Evernote, so despite the lack of certain features in Notes, it worked for me. There aren’t a lot of ways to organize notes in Apple Notes. Actually, there are just two: folders and subfolders. I knew about folders, of course, but I had no idea it was possible to create subfolders. And creating one is easy. Creating a subfolder: just drag a folder into another. To create a subfolder in Notes on your Mac, all you have to do is drag-and-drop one folder into another. That’s it! Keep in mind that if you delete a folder, then all of the subfolders and notes will also be deleted. Now here’s the caveat: Unfortunately, it’s not possible to create subfolders in iOS Notes. I’m not sure why, and it seems arbitrary for Apple to not allow this. So you’ll have to create your subfolders on macOS, and they will sync over to iOS.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 March 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Seven things worth knowing about the global mobile phone market Dizzying figure: Around 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in 2016. — dpa Consumers are often fixated on the latest incremental improvements being touted by smartphone brands at fairs like the recent Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  Meanwhile the mobile phone industry has exploded to dizzying heights. Here are a few key facts and figures to remind you of the bigger picture of this multi-billion-dollar market.  1. 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in one year  Around 1.5 billion smartphones were bought in 2016. This marks an increase of between 2% and 5% on the previous years. The estimates of the various IT market researchers differ.  2. The world's biggest market: China  Chinese smartphone vendors are now among the largest in the world, thanks mainly to the size of the home market. Huawei, Oppo and BBK are in the global top five, after Samsung and Apple, and together hold a 21% market share.  3. The biggest profit-maker: Apple  When it comes to profitability, Apple – which doesn’t offer cheap devices – remains the undisputed leader, as it has been for years. Market researchers estimate that more than 90% of the profit in the smartphone sector goes to Apple. Chinese vendors are often satisfied with narrow margins and some don’t even make it out of the red.  4. Sales have been cooling  2015 sales were more than 10% up on the previous year, but a cooling down in the smartphone market in 2016 has been put down to economic turbulence in the largest smartphone market, China, as well as in other countries such as Russia.  5. The biggest battle: Apple versus Samsung  Samsung and Apple are the world's largest smartphone vendors, with the iPhone manufacturer edging out the South Koreans this year selling 78 million iPhones and staking out 18% of the market.   6. The widest reach: Android  When it comes to smartphone operating systems, Google’s Android software dominates with a market share of over 80%. The remainder is largely taken by Apple’s iOS – other operating systems such as Windows Phone or Blackberry OS are practically at 0%. 7. 7.4 billion phone connections  Last year around 7.4 billion phone connections were made worldwide, according to expert estimates. By the year 2020 that number will be almost 8.4 billion, IT market researcher Gartner predicts. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested CEO of Australia's Atlassian says he'll meet seven-day Tesla batteries deadline IBM researchers take storage down to the atomic level Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

(Reuters/Danish Siddiqui) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Messaging March 09, 2017 Quartz india Apple’s newest iPhones have just cost too much to be a big hit in India, and the company hopes reviving a discontinued model can expand its minuscule market share in Asia’s third-largest economy. Local brands like Micromax and Lava sell dirt-cheap handsets, and the Cupertino, California, giant faces additional competition from Chinese players like Oppo, Vivo, and Gionee, who’ve made a mark in the mid-price range. When Apple tried to reduce retail prices by selling cheaper, refurbished iPhones, the Indian government shelved those efforts, saying it would add to the country’s plethora of e-waste. Apple’s market share has continued to slip, and is now down to a dismal 2%. Apple has finally decided to slash prices in India. It has resurrected a 32GB version of its iPhone 6—ditched when the iPhone 7 launched at the end of 2016—with a new retail price of Rs28,999 ($435), CNET reported. When the model was first launched in 2014, the 16GB variant cost Rs53,500 ($802). That’s a big cut. But will it be enough lure more buyers in a country where the average smartphone costs $158? The cost of high pricing Apple looks to India, one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world, as its next frontier for growth. “Apple’s growth in China has slowed, and short of launching the next iPhone, there is little Apple can do to change that,” Avi Greengart, research director of consumer platforms and devices at GlobalData, told Quartz. “India, however, is pure opportunity for Apple.” In the past year, it has made headway. After chief executive Tim Cook attempted to woo Indians by visiting temples and attending Bollywood parties, Apple struck a notable partnership with Reliance Jio, one of the fastest growing mobile operators. Apple also secured permission to set up a distribution center on the outskirts of Mumbai. Just last month, the company solidified plans to start manufacturing in the tech hub of Bangalore. Affordability is a high priority, even for consumers buying luxury goods like smartphones. India has a much lower per capita income, $1,598, than China’s $8,028. And for Apple, reducing prices can conflict with the brand’s aspirational value. But without a cut, India’s price-sensitive market will be hard to convince. The return of the iPhone 6 could be a middle ground. “Apple has two main problems in India—distribution and pricing,” Greengart says. “Relaunching the older iPhone 6 at a lower price could really help Apple make progress as an aspirational device, without diluting the premium it needs to maintain on current products.” Apple also introduced the 32GB version of the iPhone 6 in markets like Taiwan and China, aiming to lure less wealthy consumers. The iPhone is not available through the company’s own physical or online stores. Instead, third-party vendors and telcos are selling it. In India, it’s retailing on Amazon. Competitors have upped their game Cutting down prices is a promising tactic in India, but only if it makes the product more competitive. “The new generations of consumers aren’t as enamored with the Apple brand as were the early adapters,” Carnegie Mellon University fellow Vivek Wadhwa told Quartz. “And Indians won’t pay this kind of money for old models. If they can afford to spend Rs30,000, they will want the latest and greatest.” Most Indians now own Chinese phones that offer bigger screens and an improved user interface, while supporting multiple regional Indian languages. The Chinese brands have also been investing in marketing campaigns and expanding their retail presence. Guangdong-based Oppo, for example, recently set up 35,000 sales points and 180 service centers across India, Bloomberg reported Apple’s services are still light-weight competitors in India. Apple Maps is laden with glitches, thanks to insufficient testing and erroneous data. When Apple Music launched in India in 2015, it couldn’t compete with the multitude of cheaper local music streaming apps like Saavn, Gaana, and Hungaama. And with its pricy package, it only caters to the more affluent buyer. “[Apple] needs to develop a new set of (cheaper) products that are geared towards Indian users and have these in multiple languages,” says Wadhwa. “I give Apple zero chances of success—unless it wakes up and figures out the Indian market.” Most Popular A court’s decision in a Maine labor dispute hinged on the absence of an Oxford comma Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Apple's flagship solution for all of that woe came by the way of the AirPods, $229 headphones with absolutely no wires. For the price, I like AirPods, but they aren't without problems. Fortunately, the Apple-owned Beats has a solution for users who want Bluetooth headphones without those problems, and it comes by way of the new $199 Beats X earbuds. The Beats X are the third product from Beats (and the fourth from all of Apple) to use the new W1 Bluetooth chipset. This Apple-designed chipset should allow for better battery life. It also makes pairing with an Apple device a total snap — as long as your iPhone runs iOS 10.1 or higher. All I had to do to pair was turn the Beats X and bring them near my phone. A "Connect" button instantly popped up and I was off — music ready to be heard wirelessly. Popping the Beats X into my ears was a pleasant experience too. There was none of the typical soreness — even after using them for hours at a time. Beats includes a choice between four different ear tips. For my own tiny ears the smallest tips worked best — and due to the neck strap I didn't have to worry about a bud popping out and disappearing. Like a number of wireless earbuds on the market, including the super popular Jaybirds X3s (and will.i.am's Buttons), the Beats X go with a necklace design. When you don't have Beats X in your ears, they have magnetic tips that connect around your neck, looking like... a necklace. I made fun of the Buttons for having a similar feature; I now take that back. It's a great way to keep the headphones around your neck when not in use, without losing them. Buttons still look idiotic, but this magnetic connector is a total win. The carrying case the Beats X comes with is really bad. I never figured out how to properly stuff the headphones into the case. Also on the necklace is a controller to control volume, call pickup, and to skip or pause a track. Unlike the Jaybirds X3 the controller is light enough that it never tugs an earbud out of the ear. It also solved my biggest complaint with Apple's AirPods — being forced to control the volume with Siri only. The Beats X battery is also nice and light, and resides in the chunky bits that rest on your neck. Plugging the Beats X into the Lightning port that anchors one side of the neck band for 5 minutes gave me another 2 hours of battery life, and fully charged I managed eight hours. That pales in comparison to the 40 (!) you'll get with Beats Solo 3s, and the charging mechanism isn't as good as the carrying case that come with AirPods, but the Beats X hit a nice middle ground. And thanks to the necklace design these things actually work when I'm being active. Even though AirPods fit well in my ears, I would never feel comfortable running with them. I ran with Beats X, and endured a monstrous spin class, without giving it a second thought. They might not be as fitness-focused as Powerbeats 3s, but they work great for active users. They sound great too. There is more bass than you'd get with AirPods or crummy Apple EarPods, but they don't sound overly heavy. Listening to Future's HDNRXX, the bass notes came through exactly as they should. On a track like Remy Ma's "Shether," each and every devastating blow came through loud and clear. I haven't used the Powerbeats 3, but the Beats X sound about the same as the older Powerbeats 2 earphones. Highs and mids were crisp, and bass, while not overly booming, is very much present. The microphone on the cable works fine for voice calls too. All told, Beats X are an excellent alternative to the AirPods. They're great for anyone who wants the easy way to connect to an iPhone, but would also like better battery life and playback controls. Sure, the Beats X don't look as cool as the earring like AirPods, but if your prioritise function over form they're practically perfect. README Even without using wingtips, Beats X stayed in my ears during strenuous activity. At $199), these are pricier than the similarly designed, and similarly sounding Jaybird X3. If you're an Android user and don't care about the Beats name, those are just as good. Pairing with an iPhone is genuinely so easy, it's one of my favourite things ever. The included Lightning cable for charging is very short. This is probably good if you're using it in a car or with a power pack, but might be short in other scenarios. As of right now, Beats does not make these in rose gold, which is absolutely a missed opportunity. Comments scarnon @scarnon Mar 10, 2017, 1:15pm Anyone in the market for this kind of product should check out Sony's XB70BT wireless ear buds. I recently got them swapped over from my shitty Sol Republic Shadow's that I had already had replaced... All the reviews I was able to see say the Sonys have a better bass response than the Beats... They feel like a premium product and the bluetooth range on these is waaaay more than 20m its pretty insane! Check em out or check out some reviews before pumping your money into the Beats brand ;) Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Home World news WikiLeaks aid on CIA software holes could be mixed blessing WikiLeaks aid on CIA software holes could be mixed blessing WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools - and that puts the tech industry in a bind. By: Associated Press | New York | Published: March 10, 2017 5:09 AM While companies have a responsibility – not to mention financial incentive – to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. (Reuters) WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools – and that puts the tech industry in a bind. While companies have a responsibility – not to mention financial incentive – to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. And it’s not even clear at this point exactly what kind of information WikiLeaks has to offer. THE PROMISE WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Thursday that the anti-secrecy site will work with technology companies to help defend them against software vulnerabilities in everyday gadgets such as phones and TVs. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the purported CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. ”We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out,” Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as ”cyberweapons” would be published to the world ”once this material is effectively disarmed by us.” Terms for disclosure, if any, weren’t immediately known. Nor was it known how much detail WikiLeaks has on specific vulnerabilities, rather than just the tools capable of exploiting them. Also Watch: LEGAL QUESTIONS Tech companies could run into legal difficulties in accepting the offer, especially if they have government contracts or employees with security clearances. ”The unauthorized release of classified documents does not mean it’s unclassified,” said Stewart Baker, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security and former legal counsel for the National Security Agency. ”Doing business with WikiLeaks and reviewing classified documents poses a real risk for at least their government contracting arms and their cleared employees,” Baker said. But it’s tough to prosecute cases involving classified documents, said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. At some point, he and other experts said, courts and the administration may consider such material as having passed into the public domain. TRUST MATTERS But tech companies might face a bigger problem with public perception. ”They don’t want to be seen as endorsing or supporting an organization with a tainted reputation and an unclear agenda,” Cattanach said. For instance, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails, some embarrassing, from breached Democratic Party computers and the account of a top aide to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. Those emails were stolen by hackers connected to the Russian government, an act U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian attempt to help Donald Trump win the presidency. ”You are getting in bed with someone who is … happy to harm the interests of the United States in whatever way they can,” Baker said. ”That does raise concerns of an ethical sort for companies that take their nation seriously.” Also Watch: Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the civil-liberties group Center for Democracy and Technology, said companies would have to navigate with care and assume that any discussions will ultimately become public, given WikiLeaks’ past and ”Assange’s philosophy of radical transparency.” A BETTER PATH Ideally, the CIA would have shared such vulnerabilities directly with companies, as other government agencies have long done. In such a case, companies would not only be dealing with a known entity in an above-board fashion, they might also obtain a more nuanced understanding of the problems than might be apparent in documents or lines of computer code. And if companies could learn details about how the CIA found these vulnerabilities, they might also find additional vulnerabilities using the same technique, said Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute. But there are risks as well. Should tech companies obtain the actual hacking tools, Ullrich said, they’d have to treat them with great caution. Some, for instance, might have unadvertised features that could, for instance, start extracting data as soon as they launch. Please Wait while comments are loading...

A perfect example of the Bokeh Effect could be seen in the photo below that came from a recent Apple TV ad. The target is the fisherman while the background is gently out of focus so the eye can focus on the target of the photo. To use this feature in iPhone 7 Plus, the user chooses to take their photo in "Portrait Mode" which delivers the Bokeh Effect automatically.   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a pair of Apple's patent applications covering this technology. The first filing is titled "Photo-realistic Shallow Depth-of-Field Rendering from Focal Stacks," and the second is titled "Depth Map Calculation in a Stereo Camera System."   The first invention states that it's an invention covering "a method for generating an image with a selected level of background blur.   The method includes capturing, by a first image capture device, a plurality of frames of a scene, wherein each of the plurality of frames has a different focus depth, obtaining a depth map of the scene, determining a target object and a background in the scene based on the depth map, determining a goal blur for the background, and selecting, for each pixel in an output image, a corresponding pixel from the focus stack. The method also includes selecting, for each pixel corresponding to the target object, the corresponding pixel from a frame in the focus stack where the target object is in focus, and selecting, for each pixel corresponding to the background, the corresponding pixel from a frame in the focus stack where the background corresponds to the goal blur, and generating, the output image using the selected corresponding pixels." For full details, check out Apple's patent application here.   The second invention states that an invention covering "a method for generating a depth map.   The method includes obtaining a first image of a scene from a first image capture unit, the first image having a first depth-of-field (DOF) and a first number of pixels, obtaining a second image of the scene from a second image capture unit, the second image having a second DOF that is different than the first DOF, the second image having the first number of pixels, wherein each pixel in the second image has a corresponding pixel in the first image, generating a plurality of third images, each corresponding to a blurred version of the second image at each of a plurality of specified depths, generating a plurality of fourth images, each representing a difference between the first image and one of the plurality of third images, and generating a depth map having the first number of pixels, wherein each pixel in the depth map is based on a plurality of pixels, wherein each of the plurality of pixels corresponds to the pixel in one of the plurality of fourth images. For full details, check out Apple's patent application here.   In the first patent, we're able to see patent FIG. 2 above illustrating an example of a multi-camera system being used for capturing stereo image data; In patent FIG. 4 we're able to see a flow chart form, an example method of generating an image with a selected level of background blur using a multi-camera system; and from the second patent we're able to see patent FIG. 3 below that presents another flow chart method for generating a depth map using a stereo camera system.   Both of Apple's patent applications were filed back on September 24, 2015. These are now considered patents fulfilled.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

And while everyone is paying attention to the rumored specs and features of the new tablets, the Cupertino giant appears to be silently working on a new Apple Pencil that could debut alongside the touchscreen devices or at a later date. This Thursday, Apple was awarded by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office new patents that contain information on what the company is working on for the iPad writing and sketching tool. The two new patents, with application numbers 20170068342 and 20170068339, are entitled “Stylus for electronic devices.” Both primarily detail a new user input system for a stylus that is presumed to work with Apple’s iPads.  What’s striking about the new Apple patents, however, is not the more new user input mechanism, but the attached illustrations on how the Apple Pencil could recharge its built-in battery using the Smart Connector on the side of the iPad Pro. If this is indeed the direction Apple is taking its technologically advanced pencil, then it’s clear that it wants to do away with the the use of the Lightning connector to refuel the Apple Pencil on the said iPad model.  The Apple Pencil in the patents is described as a peripheral that gets its power from the iPad Pro. In addition, there is also mention of magnets that would make it possible for the touch contacts of both the writing tool and the tablet to always correctly line up for charging purposes. This way, users won’t have to worry about having to put the Apple Pencil in a particular position just to make the charging mechanism work.  The images depicting the matching Smart Connector port on the Apple Pencil and the iPad were first spotted by Apple World Today. The publication also noted how the application filings for the new patents contained information about a “laptop with a touch screen” and an “active stylus precision tip.” This new information further suggests that the next Apple Pencil installment  could come with new features or an improved functionality overall.  Apple Insider says the new patents seem to corroborate a previous rumor that claims Apple is working on the next-generation Pencil that could magnetically attach to the iPad Pro for safekeeping. What that rumor didn’t mention is the possibility that the magnetic system could also provide a new means of charging the new Apple Pencil.  It’s not uncommon for Apple to be awarded with new patents. The  company has already trademarked numerous inventions. Unfortunately, not all of them see the light of the day. It’s good if these new patents will reach their fruition and materialize into a new product this year or the near future.  Apple could be working on a more advanced Apple Pencil.

We have yet to see Apple officially bring much innovation in this space to the iPhone (hopefully we will later this year), however there are a couple tricks you can use to charge up faster than normal… AirPods We’ll look at two ways for how you can charge your iPhone faster and you can also use them both at the same time to reduce your charging time even more. Charge iPhone faster by Using an iPad power adapter The first trick is to use an iPad power adapter (charging brick) instead of the one that came with your iPhone. iPads include a 12W, 2.1A power adapter in the box, compared to the 5W, 1A adapter that comes with iPhones. Apple even has a support document stating that it’s safe to use the 12W power adapter with other devices, including the iPhone, Apple Watch and other accessories and will usually provide faster charging times. I usually see a full charge take about 3 hours for my iPhone 7 Plus with the 5W brick and just over 2 hours with the 12W brick. If you don’t already have a 10 or 12W power adapter (10W came with older iPads) you can pick up an official Apple one up for about $20. While it’s usually best to use Apple official chargers, Anker makes some quality options. They offer a 12W model with 2 USB ports for $7 on Amazon, it has 4.4/5 stars with over 1,000 reviews. They also sell a new model with 2 USB ports and 12W and a few extra features for $12, one with 4 USB ports and a USB-C port for $26, and a solid 5,000 mAh portable option for $19. All of these power adapters from Anker will charge up your iPhone faster than the brick that comes standard from Apple. Charge iPhone faster by turning on Airplane Mode It isn’t always an option or convenient to turn on Airplane Mode, but if you can this will also significantly shorten your charging time. If you’re not familiar with Airplane Mode follow along below: From the Lock or Home screen swipe from the bottom of the screen up. Tap on the airplane icon on the left hand side. You’ll see the Airplane Mode icon in the top left hand part of your screen (status bar). You can also navigate to Settings → Airplane Mode which is the first item at the top. Note that you won’t receive phone calls, messages, or have an internet connection as long as you leave Airplane Mode on. However, if you’re near another device, like your iPad or Mac or can do without connectivity for a bit, you’ll reap the fast charging reward. My iPhone 7 Plus charges almost twice as fast when using both of these tricks. Just don’t forget to turn Airplane Mode off when you’re charged up. Do you have any other ways you’ve discovered to charge your iPhone faster? Share them in the comments below. Michael Potuck @michaelpotuck Michael is an editor for 9to5Mac and 9to5Google.

What’s New in Version 4.2 Various improvements and performance enhancements.

Good Grodd, even just typing those words from Apple’s epic poem known as the iTunes Terms of Service document is enough to make me want to take a nap. Yes, it’s important for people to understand the contracts they legally agree to, but how could anyone stand to read something so boring? Artist R. Sikoryak has the answer. Terms and Conditions turns Apple’s jargon into a comic book anyone can get into. Terms and Conditions is a 96-page satirical graphic novel that takes the entirety of Apple’s legal document and turns it into illustrated homages to other comics. Each section and subsection become its own little short story picture book starring Steve Jobs popping up in some other piece of classic sequential art. It’s like a great internet remix of bad comic strip. Ever wanted to see the Apple co-founder as Snoopy? How about Steve Jobs as Astro Boy? You’ll spot the famous turtleneck alongside Wonder Woman, Garfield, The Simpsons, and more, all while reading word balloons full of very dry and technical iTunes rules. Lots of artists and eras get shout outs. It’s like Lego Dimensions for coma-inducing corporate-speak. If you want a taste of this cartoonist’s take on legalese, you can check out R. Sikoryak’s original Terms and Conditions Tumblr blog. But the new graphic novel out this week collects and presents every strip from the “unabridged” adaptation in new, color, printed forms.

But that might be a bit of plain old urban myth. The simple home is generally seen as the place where much of the foundation of Apple was developed, and it’s been depicted—perhaps with a little wishful thinking—as the epicenter of the creativity and genius of a few young geeks who “thought differently.” That is certainly one point of view, seen in popular culture and movies like Pirates of Silicon Valley. However, this might be an overstatement at best. In a 2014 interview, co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak said “[w]e did no designs there, no breadboarding, no prototyping, no planning of products. We did no manufacturing there.” According to Wozniak, it was more of a practical solution to their lack of available funds. “The garage didn’t serve much purpose, except it was something for us to feel was our home,” said Wozniak. “We had no money. You have to work out of your home when you have no money.” Still, the garage is seen as the birthplace of Apple Computers. Now and then people are seen taking photos of themselves in front of what today has been declared a historic landmark by the Los Altos Historical Commission. #computers#technology#history Know Before You Go Los Altos is about 10 miles west of San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley. The Apple garage is plainly visible from the street, but is private property. If you visit and take photos, be careful not to disturb the residents.

  SOFTPEDIA®   Windows   Drivers   Games   Mac   Android   Linux   News Softpedia > News > Security FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! WikiLeaks Will Work with Tech Companies to Fix Security Flaws Exploited by CIA GO Vault 7 reveals the extensive hacking powers of the CIA Mar 9, 2017 21:43 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  WikiLeaks will work with Google, Apple and other tech companies to fix flaws that the CIA has taken advantage of to hack phones, computers, and other devices. The announcement was made by Julian Assange and comes as a reaction to the heavy criticism brought by the public against WikiLeaks for exposing the data trove for shock value without taking the extra step to help secure the services used by billions of people.  Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said during an online news conference that they would work with Apple, Google and all other technology companies to fix all issues, topping the list of vulnerabilities the companies discovered themselves among the available files. During the same news conference, Assange accused the CIA of withholding information about the vulnerabilities the agency was exploiting in American technology, especially after it realized that documents describing the flaws had been leaked weeks ago. A rush to patch things up Google, Apple, and the Linux Foundation are just some of the companies that have already stepped forward and said they fixed "most" of the vulnerabilities the WikiLeaks documents talked about. "There's a limited ability to try and produce security fixes for iPhones, for Samsung TVs, for Android phones produced by Google, for Microsoft, for Linux, because the exact technical details are not known. We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured," Assange said. This is a bit of a weird role to see Assange in, given his past statements - a defender of tech companies. "Why has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft, and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems," Assange added. For its part, the CIA published a full response in which it mostly attacks Assange and his credibility. It then defends its general purpose - to gather intelligence by any means necessary, adding that any spying that it performs does not involve Americans.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Patent Confirms Hidden Antenna in the iPhone 7 Battery Case to Ensure Quality Data Reception | Main | A Pair of Apple Patents Covering the 'Portrait Mode' Feature found in the iPhone 7 Plus Model Surfaced Today » March 09, 2017 A Major Tactile Output Patent Surfaces Covering Trackpads, iDevice Displays and even a Feature for Foldable Devices   Apple began filing patents regarding displays and trackpads that could one day provide tactile feedback since at least 2010. In 2015 Patently Apple posted an IP report titled "Apple Invents an Advanced Diamond Layered Trackpad that Delivers Next-Gen Tactile Sensations Including Texture." Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that once again advances the possibility that Apple is getting closer to delivering next-gen tactile experiences for displays, trackpads, device covers, fabric device housings and more. It could assist in delivering the feel of fabrics or textures. It could be used to create an interface for braille and extend through to CarPlay displays and beyond. Apple's patent application feels more like a master patent trying to cover the widest range of applications without ever getting too specific to let us know what we may experience first. The patent even extends to touching on a feature that Apple may use with future folding smartphones.   Apple's Patent Background   Electronic devices often include displays for presenting images to a user. Touch screen displays have touch sensors to gather touch input from a user. Touch input and force input can also be gathered using track pads.   When gathering user input such as touch input, a user's finger or other external object may slide across the surface of a touch screen display or track pad with little or no resistance. This lack of tactile feedback can reduce the ability of the user to accurately supply input to an electronic device.   To provide improved feedback as a user is interacting with a touch screen display, the display may be provided with haptic feedback capabilities. A screen may, for example, be provided with a vibrator. When a user selects an on-screen option, the vibrator may vibrate the display to provide the user with tactile information indicating that the on-screen option has been selected.   Vibrating input-output devices such as displays provide more tactile feedback than devices without vibrators, but cannot provide user with as much tactile feedback as a real-life keyboard or other physical input device. It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide improved haptic feedback arrangements for components such as displays and track pads.   Apple's invention covers Input-output devices such as a track pad in a MacBook. The input-output devices may include components such as touch sensors and force sensors for gathering input from a user. Display structures may include a display such as an organic light-emitting diode display, a liquid crystal display, or other display that can present visual information to the user. The display may be a flexible display.   To provide the user with tactile output, an output device such as a display or track pad may be provided with electroactive polymer structures, electromagnetic actuators, and other tactile output devices.   The tactile output devices may provide protrusions, indentations, selectively stiffened and softened areas, and other tactile output for a user. A user of a display may, for example, be provided with deformed portions that surround an on-screen option or a highlighted item.   The deformed portions provide the user of the touch screen display with tactile feedback as the user is providing touch input to interact with information displayed on the touch screen display.   In Apple's patent FIG. 17 presented below we're able to see a perspective view of a MacBook having a track pad of the type that may be used to gather touch input and provide a user with tactile output; FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional side view of an illustrative deformable input device with a touch sensor; FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional side view of an illustrative deformable input device of the type shown in FIG. 4 in which a portion of the device has been deformed to provide a user with tactile output.   Fluid Based Methodology: Apple's patent FIG. 18 noted above is a cross-sectional side view of an illustrative fluid-based tactile output device.   Apple further notes that a tactile output device may be formed on top of a rigid or flexible display. In this type of configuration, a flexible polymer layer or other structures in the tactile output device may be deformed to produce tactile output for a user.   While displays, touch pads, and other components may be selectively deformed, it should be noted that housing structures or other movable structures in a device may be moved using shape memory metal actuators, electromagnetic actuators, microelectromechanical systems devices, fluid-based actuators, electroactive polymer devices, and other actuators.   If desired, a display may be formed from a mesh-shaped polymer substrate having an array of openings. Micro-light-emitting diodes or other light-producing structures may be mounted on the mesh-shaped polymer substrate. Actuators for a tactile output device may be located in the openings. The mesh-shaped substrate, micro-light-emitting diodes, and tactile output device components may be embedded in a flexible polymer layer.   A Future Foldable Device Application   Electroactive polymer actuators or other actuators may be used to automatically open and close a foldable electronic device with a flexible display.   Control circuitry may place the device in an open position or a closed position by applying electric fields to the electroactive polymer or by otherwise controlling actuators in the electronic device.   In November 2016 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Wins Surprising Patent for a Future Bendable or Foldable iPhone using Advanced Carbon Nanotube Structures." Today's patent application revelation provides us with a tiny clue that Apple is working a very unique feature, that for now we can only partly understand.   Tactile Applications to Extend to a Wide Range of Future Devices   Although Apple illustrates a future MacBook and a generic tablet-like device as examples of devices using this next generation of tactile applications, Apple makes it clear that it could apply to a wide range of future devices such as an iPhone, iPod, iPad, computer monitor, Apple Watch and other wearables, while it may also be embedded into displays in a vehicle or kiosk. Beyond the normal range of devices listed in patents, Apple goes far beyond into new applications described as follows: "If desired, tactile output can be provided through surfaces in device 10 that are not associated with display 14 such as a track pad surface, a housing surface, a fabric surface in a cover, case, or bag, a fabric surface in a watch band, a fabric surface or other surface that covers seating or the interior surfaces of a vehicle or room, a surface that covers a portion of a piece of furniture, or other surfaces.   Tactile output can be provided by a device that also gathers touch input (e.g., to provide tactile feedback associated with a user's on-screen touch manipulation of an object, menu option, etc.) and/or may be provided on a surface of a device that does not include a touch sensor for gathering touch input (e.g., the inner surface of a watch band, etc.). The surface that provides the user with tactile output may be curved or planar."   Beyond tactile for touch with a user's fingers, Apple also notes that it could be used with Apple Pencil. Apple notes in patent point #40: "Tactile output may be sensed using a stylus, brush, or other inanimate object that contacts the display.   Another Tactile Output Application includes Braille   The pattern of deformed portions of layers 52 may be used to form Braille characters, may be used to create button outlines and other on-screen features that help a user locate the boundaries of selectable on-screen options and other displayed content, may be used to create tactile feedback as a user is interacting with a touch sensitive item displayed on layers 52 (e.g., feedback that lets a user know that a drag and drop operation on a particular on-screen item is being performed satisfactorily), may be used to display tactile output associated with a text message or other electronic communication with a remote user, may be used to enhance video content and images, or may be used to provide other tactile output to a user. The tactile output may be supplemental (e.g., to help inform a user of the location of the borders of on-screen items that are already delineated visually) and/or may be used in lieu of displayed image content (e.g., to produce Braille characters for visually impaired users in the absence of any visual output in layers 52).   Another Tactile Device Methodology   Apple's patent FIG. 16 is a perspective view of an illustrative micro-light-emitting diode array for a display having a mesh shaped substrate and an actuator formed in an opening in the substrate for providing tactile output.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

As noted by Lee in the comments below, there aren’t any obvious changes on the front end. – Bryan] Apple’s support forums are down. The company didn’t specify what it was doing, but the graphic put in place of the forums says, “We are busy updating Apple Support Communities for you and will be back shortly.” Message put in place of Apple Support Communities Apple Support Communities That message could mean Apple is adding features for users, modifying the back end, or both. Being mostly pedantic, one could even interpret “updating” to mean “fixing something that broke,” but I imagine Apple is bringing something new to its forums. Apple Support Communities are quite active and popular with many of its customers. Folks use them to learn how to do things and to complain about problems they encounter with their devices and software. We’ll update this post when they go back online.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Apple Support Communities, support 3 Comments Add a comment Lee Dronick March 9, 2017 It looks like the site is back up.

Oh, and I had not made a genius bar appointment of any kind. I called Apple and eventually I was told that they had made a mistake on their end. Maybe there was a system wide problem?

Each set to arrive as major updates to Apple’s main software platforms – in their own right, the latest seeds include both user-facing improvements alongside those often less-obvious bug fixes, and in the specific case of iOS.3 (Beta 5) there are already reports that Apple’s TV app -currently U.S only- is finally showing up for some users in Canada, with this release. Apple, Inc Meanwhile on the less user-centric front, (in terms of new features), the latest version of tvOS specifically includes a number of developer-focused improvements, including; accelerated scrolling support for UIKit and TVMLKit apps, alongside Device Enrollment Program (DEP) support, expanded mobile device management support … and, in addition, also brings with it support for the ‘VideoToolbox’ framework. Which just leaves watchOS. watchOS 3.2 (Beta 5) is all about refining Theatre Mode: Theater Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown. Apple has this week also seeded macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (Beta 5) to developers. Upon its public release, later this year, the new version of the desktop OS will introduce full support for Night Mode. Each of this week’s updates are available from either the Developer Center, or by heading over to beta.apple.com for those users who have already enrolled their device(s) in Apple’s Public Beta Program. In the case of watchOS 3.2 (Beta 5), Apple’s special beta providing profile must first be installed on the device you are wishing to install the software on – before the update will show as being available for over-the-air download via the official Watch app. Continue Reading You may also like...

The author is solely responsible for the content, and any opinions do not necessarily reflect those of Autoblog and its editors. "You don't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don't have to understand any of this stuff ..." -Steve Jobs, Apple designer Steve Jobs enjoyed driving powerful luxury cars. Could this have been the early inspiration for Apple to get involved with autonomous automobiles? Another creative genius, Frank Lloyd Wright, also enjoyed fast and beautiful vehicles. He tried designing a few, but he had better success as an architect than as a carchitect. At the time he practiced his art, the automobile was in its infancy. Cars were crafted from wood, just as horse-drawn wagons had been constructed for hundreds of years. Heavy they were, but weight did not matter at a time when fuel was inexpensive and plentiful. Today, the auto industry is shedding weight wherever it can to improve fuel consumption and lessen emissions. New materials are helping designers and engineers to accomplish that objective. Why then is it a good thing that we praise carbon frames and carbon body panels when we condemn carbon fuel? That's a 'weighty' question. It had started with wood. Why would wood not be the choice material in the early automobiles, when it was well known for centuries in wagons wheels and cherished chariots of all types. When horseless carriages were converted into 'auto-buggies', they retained their wood frame. Skilled craftspersons also created the body structures. These were covered with treated canvas, before being painted. (BTW, that feature is making a modern comeback.) As in every occupation, people experimented: Some cars were built differently, using diverse materials: Already the Model T combined wood and metal; a Hanomag of the 1920s had a wicker body; the budget version of the steel version. Even when steel frames were used, many manufacturers sent the running gear (called 'chassis', from French) to coachbuilders to complete the automobile by fitting a wood body to the frame. Boat builders were skilled in this type of work, and the style of car we still know today as a 'boat-tail' is a holdover from that era. As the automobile matured, fewer skilled craftspersons were on hand, and steel and aluminum panels were used to cover the wood-framed body. Already during the second decade of the last century, forward-thinking individuals were envisioning a better way to make automobiles. During a lecture at an early meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), someone interrupted the presenter H. Jay Hayes by asking, "What do you think about the controversial theory of combining the body and frame into one unit?" He surprised his audience by announcing that his coach-building company would produce 3,000 cars just like that, starting the week after the SAE conference, named the Ruler Frameless. Hayes explained the advantages of a combined frame and body unit: making the car smaller and lighter, reducing cost and vibration. It was difficult for automakers to abandon the frame, and complicated to produce cars in that radical new way. It took many years before one of the mass-producers attempted to fabricate a unibody. 'Unibody' is also known as 'monocoque'; (from the Greek mono (single) and the French coque, meaning shell.) In the meantime, frames made progress in their own right; new alloys were developed, ladder frames advanced into perimeters frames; the X-frame improved roll-stiffness for better handling, and so on. The first popular mass-produced unibody car came in 1928 from DKW (now Audi) with a fabric-covered wood frame. Today, Audi builds cars with an aluminum 'spaceframe'. The Chrysler Airflow and the Citroen Traction Avant of 1934 used stressed body panels, and the Opel Olympia of 1935 was General Motors' first unibody car. The Volkswagen Beetle had a platform frame to which the body attached, making it extremely stiff. An additional benefit of the platform frame made it possible to adopt different body shapes, the early Porsche, Karmann Ghia, the VW 'Micro Bus', dune-buggies, and others. Most pickup trucks, vans, and SUVs of today still use a body-on-frame construction, while the 'crossovers' are frameless. Honda's Ridgeline is a unibody exception. Manufacturing cars that way is almost universal today. Open-wheel racecars (IndyCars and Formula 1) and prototype sports cars (Le Mans type) have gone a step further in monocoque construction. Through the marvels of modern chemistry, the body of these cars is stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. Fiberglass cars (and boats) have proven their advantage over many years, but compared to mass-produced cars, their numbers are still small. Because of the urgent need to lower weight and fuel consumption, and thereby emission, modern cars utilize innovative materials, stronger and lighter than fiberglass, namely carbon fiber. You may know that fiberglass takes hours to 'cure' or harden. Efforts are underway to 'bake' carbon fiber and resin combinations in autoclaves to reduce manufacturing times to less than six minutes. Under high pressure and temperature, resin is injected into the mold where a cloth-like weave of carbon and other fibers is placed. Variations of the chemical ingredients dictate whether a composite part is flexible or rigid – leaf springs are produced from fiberglass regularly. After all the progress, wood still has a place in many motorists' mind: the eternal popularity of the 'Woodie'. Even recent engineering students are exploring the strengths of wood and others fibers when they built the 'Splinter' supercar. Long live the Woodie! As newer fuel efficiency rules and CO2 restrictions are pending, many manufacturers prepare to mass-produce major components and complete unibody vehicles from carbon fiber composites. Stronger than steel, but less than half the weight, these new cars are 'paving the road' for zero emission electric vehicles. New styles with good performance and efficiency are surpassing cars of the ICE (internal combustion engine) age; they will assure sustainable personal mobility for millions of future motorists in the current rEVolution of the automobile.

Scott Lindsay No comments yet Tech Guru 78 Views Related Automatic troubleshooting and maintenance for Windows 10 New search feature in Photos is awesome Choose the default location where your files are saved March 9, 2017 Sync your Mac’s Desktop & Documents files across all your Apple devices Do you work between your Mac and your iPhone? If you do, one thing that I love is that I can be working on my MacBook and when I leave the house, I can continue to work on my projects on my iPhone. Any changes I make in either place is automatically updated so the newest version appears on all my OS devices. Here’s how to set it up so you can have the same experience. You will need to use your iCloud in order to use this feature because everything is saved there and synced every time you make any changes or when you add or delete files. One issue you may find though, is your iCloud Drive can fill up fast using the free 5 gigabytes Apple gives you. If your iCloud fills up, you will need to upgrade your storage so it holds more. It isn’t expensive and I’ll show you where to do this later in this article. I love the fact that when I am standing in line at the bank, the grocery store, or any other place that takes my time away from working, I can access my files on my iPhone and keep working. Now, this may not be practical for many of you, but as a writer, it is priceless for me. To enable this feature, select System Preferences from the Apple menu and then choose iCloud. When the window opens, to the right of iCloud Drive and select the Options button. Here you can select/deselect the apps that will be allowed to store documents in your iCloud. Be certain to checkmark the box: “Desktop & Documents Folders. I also recommend you select everything else, except for Weather, unless you find that important. If you have limited space on your Mac, you can checkmark the box: The full contents of iCloud Drive will be stored on this Mac if you have enough space. Older Documents will be stored only in iCloud when space is needed. Once you have made your choices, select Done at the bottom. In the iCloud preferences window, you can choose to save other items in your iCloud, such as Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendars, etc. Select everything you want to save in your iCloud by check-marking the corresponding box. Do you see the Manage button at the bottom-right? Go ahead and click it and we can talk about storage. This next window that opens, allows you to manage all the things you have requested to be saved in your iCloud. Just click each one and you will see options to the right. Now, if you are low on iCloud space, select the Change Storage Plan button. When it opens, you can change from the 5 gigabytes free plan to one that may suit your needs a little better. Keep in mind, if you select something too high or too low, you can always change it here and Apple will adjust your payments. If you want to downgrade your plan, just select the Downgrade Options button and enter your Apple ID password to continue. If you are going to store a copy of all your photos, you will most likely need more space. Since I do mostly documents, I have managed to get by with just paying the 99 cents a month for 50 gigabytes, but I am going to up my plan as I have started to save my photos in my iCloud too. Make your choice and just follow the instructions to continue. Once you are done, close all your windows. Now, you will want to go to your iPhone and make the same changes. Select Settings and then select iCloud. Here you can select all the things you want saved in your iCloud by moving the slider. Next, select iCloud Drive and enable it. Then, turn on all the items you want saved into your iCloud Drive from your iPhone by moving the slider over. Also, if you want to use your cellular data to sync your items, move the slider. If you don’t enable this, when your iPhone gets in range of a Wi-Fi network that you are connected to, it will sync your items then. If you have an iPad or iPod Touch, you can enable your iCloud drive on these devices by following the instructions for an iPhone, as they will be similar.

(inset) Edward Snowden, former NSA contractor. afp Four years ago, Edward J Snowden’s disclosures that the federal government was hacking America’s leading technology companies threw the industry into turmoil. Now, WikiLeaks has shaken the tech world again by releasing documents on Tuesday that appear to show that the CIA had acquired an array of cyberweapons that could be used to break into Apple and Android smartphones, Windows computers, automotive computer systems, and even smart televisions to conduct surveillance on unwitting users. Major technology companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, declined to comment as they tried to assess how badly their core products had been compromised. But one thing clearly had been ruptured, yet again: trust between intelligence agencies and Silicon Valley. “After the Snowden disclosures, the Obama administration worked hard to re-establish relationships and government-industry partnerships,” said David Gutelius, chief executive of the marketing technology company Motiva, who has worked with the federal government on national security projects. “This leak will challenge those ties to some extent. But I don’t see companies simply walking away from the table as a result of this. Government and industry still need one another.” The tense relationship between the technology industry and government agencies has been well documented. After the disclosures by Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the government appeared to give some ground to the industry, which was angered by previously unknown snooping on their products and embarrassed by disclosures of their cooperation with intelligence agencies. The government allowed companies to describe in broad terms the number of secret court orders for access to customer information that they receive. President Barack Obama also promised that the government would share knowledge of security flaws so that they could be fixed. But last year, relations soured again after Apple resisted a Justice Department request for help accessing the iPhone of one of the attackers in the 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Califor­nia. As the company’s chief executive, Timothy Cook, explained in a letter to customers at the time, “The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.” In that case, the government eventually found a way into the phone without Apple’s assistance. The documents posted by WikiLeaks suggest that the CIA had obtained information on 14 security flaws in Apple’s iOS operating system for phones and tablets. The leaked documents also identified at least two dozen flaws in Android, the most popular operating system for smartphones, which was developed by Alphabet’s Google division. It is unclear how many of the vulnerabilities described by WikiLeaks still exist. Some of the flaws listed date back several years and have been fixed. The documents released by WikiLeaks reveal numerous efforts by the CIA to take control of Microsoft Windows, the dominant operating system for personal computers, using malware. They include techniques for infecting DVDs and USB storage devices with malware that can be spread to computers when they are plugged in. “We’re aware of the report and are looking into it,” Microsoft said in a statement. Security experts said it was not surprising that the government had stockpiled flaws in major technology products to use for spying. “The real scandal and damaging thing is not knowing these things exist, but that the CIA could be so careless with them that they leaked out,” said Matthew Green, an assistant professor in the department of computer science at Johns Hopkins University. Inside technology companies, the revelations set off a scramble to assess the potential damage to the security of their products. The vulnerabilities, some of which were already known in the security community, could leave individual users of computers, mobile phones and other devices open to being snooped on. Technology companies are likely to plug the holes, however, even as new ones are discovered by spy agencies and others. The more serious near-term effect could be on the reputation of the CIA and the relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence community. Denelle Dixon, chief legal and business officer at Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser and was mentioned in the WikiLeaks trove, said that if the reports were accurate, the CIA and WikiLeaks were undermining the security of the internet. “The CIA seems to be stockpiling vulnerabilities, and WikiLeaks seems to be using that trove for shock value rather than coordinating disclosure to the affected companies to give them a chance to fix it and protect users,” Dixon said in a statement. “Although today’s disclosures are jarring, we hope this raises awareness of the severity of these issues and the urgency of collaborating on reforms.” Disrupting status quo Oren Falkowitz, a former NSA official and the chief executive of the cyberdefence firm Area 1 Security, said that WikiLeaks, run by Julian Assange, had again succeeded in disrupting the status quo, as it did during last year’s presidential election with the release of emails from the Democratic National Committee. “If you understand the Assange playbook,” Falkowitz said, “a lot of it is just to create chaos.” But Falkowitz added that perhaps the most important message behind Tuesday’s leaks was that neither government agencies nor companies can trust their employees to keep their most precious information secret. “We expect governments to be involved in espionage,” he said. “What we don’t expect is that the people within these organisations would create vulnerabilities by disclosing them.” In a statement accompanying the documents, WikiLeaks said that the security flaws could easily fall into the wrong hands. “Once a single cy­ber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose’ it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike,” the organisation said. It said it was still reviewing whether to release any of the underlying software code. The security flaws described by WikiLeaks are intended to target individual phones. They do not appear to give the intelligence agencies the ability to intercept electronic communications en masse. On Twitter, Matthew Blaze, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote that he knew of no way for people to reliably protect their phones from a “state-level adversary.” Email this page Print this page Tweet Go to Top Videos Amarinder Singh takes oath as Punjab CM...

Author Carter Dotson Posted On2017-03-09 14:51:52 News Something odd has been afoot on the App Store with releases recently. Bit City comes out on Monday; Zach Gage's new game Typeshift comes out on a Saturday; Card Thief has been submitted but they can't say the release yet. I've heard from a couple of devs that something is happening with their games soon that they're not at liberty to discuss, including some more unorthodox release timing. The reasons have seemed unclear, but the unspoken reason for all this is usually "Apple told us to do this." As to why Apple would do some things beyond them being Apple, weird is what they do, who ever knows? Well, Apple just provided a big reason for all theses shenanigans with the new "Celebrating Indie Games" promotion running from March 9th-20th. For the next 12 days, we’re celebrating the best independent game developers on the planet. https://t.co/M7fhi8CuWb pic.twitter.com/QdOXFxg0n3 — App Store Games (@AppStoreGames) March 9, 2017 The App Store right now features a varietty of great games from independent developers over the past few years, including a number of classic titles. Mushroom 11 [$4.99] is the first up with editor's choice, though I bet that's a revolving slot with some of the announced and unannounced titles. And hmm, I wonder if that sudden Kingdom: New Lands [$9.99] delay that popped up out of nowhere has anything to do with the game's sudden release! Strangeness is afoot, and I'm sure some interesting games are coming as well... Players Upset About Recent 'Marvel Contest of Champions' Changes Organize "#BoycottMCOC Movement" We Have More Info on 'Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series' TrencH This is a good strange. Something to keep us on our toes. HelperMonkey Hooray! Apple is putting its weight behind premium gaming! For 12 days... (12/365 = Apple FULLY supports premium gaming, 3% of the time.) Michal Hochmajer WROOONG! They acknowledge My bulletproof criticism of the appstore here on TA. They also know my birth day. So only right conclusion is: Apple want give me nice present!

09, 2017, 14:30 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Global and China CMOS Camera System Industry Report, 2016-2020" report to their offering. In 2015, the global CCM (CMOS Camera Module) market size reported USD16.611 billion, up 3.8% from a year earlier but the lowest growth rate since 2010. In 2016, as the shipment of Apple phones with the highest single price of CCM fell, the world CCM market was at low ebb and down 0.5%. Due to the dual-camera stimulus in 2017, the global market rebounds substantially with the growth rate of 4.3% and the size estimated to be USD17.232 billion in 2017 and USD18.512 billion in 2020. In 2016, Chinese manufacturers made remarkable achievements, while South Korean counterparts saw a drop or slight rise in revenue due to their heavy reliance on Apple and Samsung. Among Chinese players, Q-Tech enjoys the highest growth rate up to 84.5%, followed by Truly, both of which benefited from the outstanding performance of big customers OPPO and VIVO. It is anticipated that monochrome dual-camera with same pixel will be the mainstream for smart phone brands except Apple in the future, as it is more affordable and can improve nightscape significantly (visible effect betterment for consumers), while Apple will persist in duel-camera design enriching depth of focus. Smart phones tend to be highly homogenized. Although they are still not quite satisfied with the dual-cameras, consumers are more impressed with dual-cameras than mono-camera. So, dual-camera is expected to be a standard configuration in high-end smart phones, and the penetration rate till 2020 would be as high up to 30-40%. In 2016, the CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) market size approximated USD10.516 billion, rising by 5.6% from a year ago, but with an obvious fall in the speed of growth compared with the growth rate of 13.5% in 2015, mainly because medium- and high-end products are monopolized by Sony and the manufacturers in low- and medium-end fields are hard to break through the technological barriers and do nothing but hit the price war even in the vehicle field. Although influenced by factors like the Earthquake and the Appreciation of Japanese Yen, Sony still monopolized the medium- and high-end fields by dint of its overwhelming performance superiority and saw an upsurge of 32.9% in its revenue in 2016; by contrast, other players excluding Panasonic and Hynix saw decline. It is expected that, in 2017, the CIS market will grow 4.0%, Sony will see a growth rate of at least 10%, and most others will continue to suffer losses. In spite of being not much expected, the mobile phone market is still the most important market and Sony still monopolizes the high-end mobile phone market. In 2016, Largan Precision's revenue dropped for the first time over the ten years due to its excessive dependence on Apple's orders, but Largan saw its gross margin further rise from 57.4% in 2015 to 66.2%, showing the strengthened technical competence. Sunny consolidated its hegemony in Chinese market with its revenue surging 52% and gross margin rising from 32.5% to 38.2% (in the first half of 2016), still far behind Largan's but space left for improvement. Largan earnestly draws lessons from heavy reliance on Apple and actively develop new customers, which poses great pressure on Sunny. Currently holding a 33% market share and ranking first in the vehicle camera field worldwide, Sunny is probable to be challenged by Largan and S.Korean Sekonix in the future.

In today’s interview with Reuters, Apple’s speech team head Alex Acero offered a behind-the-scenes look at how Siri is being taught new languages, a process that involves script-writing, capturing voices in multiple accents and dialects and using machine learning and artificial intelligence to build and evolve new language models over time. The system requires a team of people tasked with reading passages of manually transcribed text. Before actually updating Siri, Apple first rolls out Dictation support for a new language. Siri currently speaks 21 languages in 36 countries. By comparison, Microsoft’s Cortana supports eight languages tailored for thirteen countries, Google Assistant speaks four languages while Amazon’s Alexa works only in English and German. Teaching Siri a new language entails the following steps: People read custom passages of text in a range of accents and dialects Recordings are transcribed by hand so Siri knows exactly what it’s supposed to be learning They also capture sounds in a range of voices A new language model is built that tries to predict words sequences Apple rolls out Dictation support for the new language before it’s added to Siri—that’s why the Diction feature supports more languages than Siri (the upcoming macOS Sierra 10.12.4 software update, for instance, will enable Dictation support for Shanghainese, a Chinese dialect spoken only around that city). Dictation lets Apple capture anonymized audio recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words. The audio is manually transcribed by humans, a process that Acero claims helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. It’s only after enough data has been gathered that Apple commissions an actor to record voices for Siri. When a new Siri language is ready for prime time, it’s released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions. Apple’s been investing large sums into artificial intelligence and machine learning to help the language models evolve over time as Siri learns more about what users ask. They update Siri every two weeks with more tweaks, said Acero. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube One possible problem with Apple’s approach, according to Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo, is that you can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. Other personal assistants, including Google Now and Microsoft Cortana, mitigate the scaling issue by synthesizing the answers, something Siri is not very good at. Viv, a startup founded by Siri’s original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. “The only way to leapfrog today’s limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them.” Although Siri now speaks more languages than her rivals (Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their respective assistants), the user is still left with a sub-par experience because, as I mentioned, other assistants are better at understanding context and providing more conversational responses. The Cupertino company’s $200 million acquisition of Australia-based machine learning startup Turi in August 2016 should help improve Siri’s language and knowledge models. Apple is expected to show off enhanced Siri capabilities (which may or may not be exclusive to iPhone 8) at its annual pilgrimage for developers which kicks off with a keynote on June 5. Siri improvements may include multi-language support. iOS 10 supports typing in two languages without needing to switch keyboards so perhaps Siri will soon understand multiple languages without requiring you to manually choose one in Settings → Siri → Language? A multi-language Siri should work great on Apple TV, too. A November 2015 interview with several Apple TV project managers suggested Apple initially limited Siri on the set-top box to just eight countries due to the differences in the pronunciation of actor names, films and directors in various languages and dialects.

 Apple's top manufacturer asks the government to open up its wallet if Trump wants more US factories Kif Leswing Mar. 9, 2017, 1:32 PM 4,724 facebook linkedin twitter email print Foxconn Chairman Terry GouAP President Donald Trump has said several times that he wants Apple to manufacture iPhones and other products in the United States.  If Apple were to build phones in the United States, it would require the help of Foxconn, its primary manufacturing partner, which builds iPhones and other products in its factories in China. Foxconn's chairman suggested on Thursday that if Trump wants to see electronics made-in-America, he should be willing to open the government's wallet and offer incentives and tax breaks. "Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They'll need to pass bills first, and we'll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first," Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said after a groundbreaking ceremony in China last week, according to Nikkei. Gou suggested that rumored plans for Foxconn to build a $7 billion flat-panel screen factory in the U.S. will depend on governments addressing "investment issues." "I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months' time," he said. Gou also said that the United States might not have the skilled labor or supply chain for high-tech manufacturing. Late Apple founder Steve Jobs used similar arguments when he told Barack Obama why Apple did not manufacture iPhones in the United States.  "No one is willing to see a trade war happen. I am not willing to choose between [the U.S. and China]. Why should I give up on any market?" Gou reportedly said.  Government subsidies are a core part of Foxconn's business model  A Foxconn facility.Kin Cheung/AP Foxconn isn't shy about asking for government subsidies. The manufacturing giant receives billions of dollars in perks, tax breaks, and subsidies from China, The New York Times reported in December. When Gou discussed the display panel factory, he suggested that Pennsylvania could offer incentives. "I have to tell other states to hurry up or we'll go ahead and sign with Pennsylvania," Gou said. New York state has also reached out to Foxconn about possible incentives for a display plant, too. Foxconn in 2013 pledged to hire 50,000 U.S. workers for a facility is Harrisberg, Pennsylvania, but the factory was never built, according to the Washington Post. Nikkei reports that Gou said he had recently visited Washington D.C., but declined to comment on whether he met with Trump.  Apple likes to play down the possibility of assembling iPhones in the United States, but it says that parts built in the U.S. eventually make it into phones — 8,000 suppliers in 31 states provide parts and equipment for building iPhones and Macs, according to Apple.  SEE ALSO: There's speculation that Apple could build a TV — because of Trump More: Apple Trump Foxconn facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple's top manufacturer asks the government to open up its wallet if Trump wants more US factories Apple's top manufacturer asks the government to open up its wallet if Trump wants more US factories President Donald Trump has said several times...

In 2015, the global CCM (CMOS Camera Module) market size reported USD16.611 billion, up 3.8% from a year earlier but the lowest growth rate since 2010. In 2016, as the shipment of Apple phones with the highest single price of CCM fell, the world CCM market was at low ebb and down 0.5%. Due to the dual-camera stimulus in 2017, the global market rebounds substantially with the growth rate of 4.3% and the size estimated to be USD17.232 billion in 2017 and USD18.512 billion in 2020. In 2016, Chinese manufacturers made remarkable achievements, while South Korean counterparts saw a drop or slight rise in revenue due to their heavy reliance on Apple and Samsung. Among Chinese players, Q-Tech enjoys the highest growth rate up to 84.5%, followed by Truly, both of which benefited from the outstanding performance of big customers OPPO and VIVO. It is anticipated that monochrome dual-camera with same pixel will be the mainstream for smart phone brands except Apple in the future, as it is more affordable and can improve nightscape significantly (visible effect betterment for consumers), while Apple will persist in duel-camera design enriching depth of focus. Smart phones tend to be highly homogenized. Although they are still not quite satisfied with the dual-cameras, consumers are more impressed with dual-cameras than mono-camera. So, dual-camera is expected to be a standard configuration in high-end smart phones, and the penetration rate till 2020 would be as high up to 30-40%. In 2016, the CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) market size approximated USD10.516 billion, rising by 5.6% from a year ago, but with an obvious fall in the speed of growth compared with the growth rate of 13.5% in 2015, mainly because medium- and high-end products are monopolized by Sony and the manufacturers in low- and medium-end fields are hard to break through the technological barriers and do nothing but hit the price war even in the vehicle field. Although influenced by factors like the Earthquake and the Appreciation of Japanese Yen, Sony still monopolized the medium- and high-end fields by dint of its overwhelming performance superiority and saw an upsurge of 32.9% in its revenue in 2016; by contrast, other players excluding Panasonic and Hynix saw decline. It is expected that, in 2017, the CIS market will grow 4.0%, Sony will see a growth rate of at least 10%, and most others will continue to suffer losses. In spite of being not much expected, the mobile phone market is still the most important market and Sony still monopolizes the high-end mobile phone market. In 2016, Largan Precision's revenue dropped for the first time over the ten years due to its excessive dependence on Apple's orders, but Largan saw its gross margin further rise from 57.4% in 2015 to 66.2%, showing the strengthened technical competence.

The investment gave Apple a seat on Didi’s board. At the time, it was rumored that the investment would give Apple access to vital driving data it needed for the development of Apple car or Project Titan. But Didi seems to have its own self-driving car ambitions. Image Credit: Automobile Italia/Flickr Didi has a direct presence in the mecca of self-driving car industry According to Recode, Didi Chuxing’s new research lab in Mountain View, California would focus on “intelligent-driving systems” and artificial intelligence-based security for transportation. It shows the Chinese company’s interest in self-driving cars. The Mountain View office would give Didi Labs an opportunity to recruit top talent in the self-driving car industry. Google, Apple, Uber, Tesla, and many other autonomous driving startups have a presence in the nearby areas. It will be Didi’s first major expansion outside China. The ride-hailing company has expanded to India, Brazil, and Southeast Asia through investments in local ride-hailing startups. The Mountain View-based Didi Labs will be led by Dr. Fengim Gong, Didi’s VP of information security and the co-founder of Palo Alto Networks. Will Didi and Apple partner in the future? The company has also hired Charlie Miller to lead its security and safety development programs. Miller gained recognition after hacking a moving Jeep on a highway. He left Uber’s self-driving program just a few days ago. Didi has also poached Jia Zhaoyin from Google. Zhaoyin was a senior software engineer at Google’s Waymo. There doesn’t seem to be a direct connection between Didi’s new facility and the secretive Apple car project. Apple’s investment in Didi was certainly unusual considering Apple had historically made only low-profile acquisitions. Tim Cook said at the time that the investment was driven by “a number of strategic reasons.” There have been speculations that the investment could lead to a partnership between Didi and Apple in the future as the iPhone maker has also been working on self-driving cars. Consumers excited about the Apple car The Apple car project has met with some roadblocks since last year. Initially, the Cupertino company was working on a full-fledged car. But after the departure of key employees, the project was scaled back to focus mainly on the autonomous driving technology. It would leave the door open for Apple to build its own car in the future or join hands with a third-party manufacturer. A survey conducted by investment research firm Baird revealed last month that customers were most excited about the Apple car. Baird analyst asked participants which Apple product they wanted to see in the next few years. The majority of the 3,000 respondents wanted an Apple car.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) rumor mill today is a possible reveal date for new iPad devices. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Thursday. iPad Reveal: A new rumor claims that Apple will show off its next generation of iPad tablets on April 4, 2017, reports BGR. This rumor is based on rumored availability dates for many of AAPL’s next generation tablets, many of which are April 4. The rumor also claims that the tech company will hold a special event to introduce the tablets. It claims this event will take place at the new Steve Jobs. The theater is set to open in early April. MacBook Pro: Apple is now selling refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro laptops through its online store, MacRumors noted. The new option allows customers to purchase refurbished 2016 MacBook Pro computers with various different specs. One thing that all of these refurbished MacBook Pro laptops have in common is that they lack the Touch Bar that was introduced last year. Many of them also seem to be high-end laptops, but listings change over time and others will likely start showing up soon. App Store: Apple is now restricting iOS app updates that change app permissions without App Store approval, reports AppleInsider. This means that many apps that download their own updates outside of the App Store may not be able to do so in the future. This restriction has always been in place since AAPL created the App Store, but it hasn’t strongly enforced it until just recently. This means it may take app developers longer to push out updates in the future due to having to wait for App Store approval.

Foxconn chairman Terry Gou told reporters at a ceremony marking the start of the construction of an $8.8 billion display plant in Guangzhou, China that he had just returned from Washington without confirming he met with anyone from President Donald Trump’s administration. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Delayed? 3D Sensor Won't Be Ready For September Launch, Report Says In December, the company confirmed to International Business Times its exploration of an expansion in the U.S. saying they were in “preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion” of current operations in the country. Foxconn’s expansion plans came after criticism from Trump over U.S. companies’ manufacturing of their products overseas. Trump vowed to implement a 45 percent tariff on goods made in China, where many Apple products and parts are made. However, the company’s chairman raised uncertainties over previous plans because he wasn’t sure U.S. officials could work quickly enough to attract foreign investors like Foxconn to build large facilities in the United States.   "I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months' time," he said, adding that the United States also lacks the skilled labor and comprehensive supply chain the display industry needs. "Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They'll need to pass bills first, and we'll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first," Gou added. Apple and Foxconn Manufacturing: U.S. VS. China Trump strongly criticized China for stealing American jobs throughout his presidential campaign. Now, Foxconn seems to be stuck between the U.S. and China, with Gou strongly avoiding siding with a country. "I am not willing to choose between [the U.S. and China]. Why should I give up on any market?" he said. "It is in the interest of the entire humanity that China and the U.S., the top two economies in the world, can get along peacefully," Gou added. "They are in the process of gambling with each other, and I can foresee that the two will eventually work together to grow [their] economies and deliver beneficial outcome for many. If they don't, then everyone will be losers." Apple, which accounts for over 50 percent of Foxconn’s revenue, previously said the U.S. did not have enough skilled workers for the manufacturing of iPhones. Read: Trump Says Apple CEO Tim Cook Has 'Eyes Open' To US Production, Wants To Do 'Something Major' "Even if Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff, it is still possible that manufacturers will decide to continue production overseas as long as the costs together with the tariffs are lower than the amount they need to spend on building and running production lines in the U.S," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview with CBS last year. However, in January, Trump said he spoke to Cook about making iPhones in the U.S., adding that the CEO has his "eyes open to it." Meanwhile, a Reuters report found Foxconn lost its bidding ground for Toshiba Corp's memory chip business because of its close ties to China. The Japanese government is concerned about the "transference of key technology" if the winning bidder has a close relationship to China, sources close to the matter told Reuters.

But Apple plays it down. Here's why. The best iPhone may actually be the one Apple seems to have forgotten about. I've had this conversation with taxi drivers, friends, and even other smartphone experts. The iPhone SE's invisibility shows how important Apple's marketing is to its sales: if it makes a great product but doesn't talk about it, nobody knows it exists. But there's a reason Apple keeps the iPhone SE in the shadows. Fun-Sized Fun Phone The iPhone SE puts the iPhone 6s's processor and the iPhone 6's modem into the iPhone 5s's body, but it's more than just those parts. Because the screen is smaller than the iPhone 6s, the phone is faster since the processor is pushing fewer pixels. The 4-inch device is compatible with all the latest iOS software, but the smaller screen doesn't swallow you the way newer, larger phones do. It remains a tool rather than an all-absorbing media landscape. This is the iPhone you're less likely to dive into, so you're more likely to spend time looking at and thinking about the world around you. You're also less likely to drop it. It's the life-compatible iPhone. Sure, this goes counter to current phablet trends that keep us plugged into the internet at all times. Apple has the iPhone 7 Plus for that kind of user. The SE is for those who actually have offline things we love in our lives. It's also the Apple that closes the digital divide, a tiny bit. While it isn't a cheap phone at $399 (you can get a perfectly good Blu smartphone for $149), it's 40 percent cheaper than the iPhone 7, bringing iOS-exclusive apps and iMessage to people who don't have a ton of free cash but feel they need to be connected to Apple's ecosystem. Why Apple Hides the SE So why doesn't Apple promote the SE? It's too good a value. Apple is a public company, and the stock market loves to see average selling prices (ASPs) go up. By using dual cameras to make the iPhone 7 Plus more compelling than the iPhone 7, Apple drove up its ASPs to record highs over the past year. AppleInsider says Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that the 7 Plus has a "higher proportion of new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past." That seems to be a successful strategy for Apple, as the company's stock price has been on a steady upwards cruise since November. But pushing the iPhone SE would dramatically depress Apple's ASPs. Even if SEs didn't replace 7 Plus purchases, the average of a bucket with a lot of SEs and 7 Pluses in it is less than the average of a smaller bucket of 7 Pluses alone. Apple also created a "middle thing" problem with its current lineup. The 7 Plus, at the high end, is super compelling and the SE is less expensive, so the "regular" iPhone 7 is the least appealing phone. Related iPhone SE vs. iPhone 6s: Specs and Design Compared iPhone SE vs. iPhone 6s: Specs and Design Compared Updating the iPhone SE this year would bring it too close in power to the iPhone 7, thereby potentially depressing ASPs again. As the SE has the iPhone 6s processor, the only way to do a processor bump would be to push it to iPhone 7 levels. That might bring potential iPhone 7 customers down to the SE, which Apple doesn't want to do. Current rumors have the iPhone SE getting a minor update later this month, perhaps with 128GB of storage and some new colors. That will keep the SE from becoming so appealing that it upsets Apple's whole cart. But if you're looking for a pocketable, no-nonsense smartphone, the SE should still be near the top of your list.

However, there are a few obstacles in the way that would prevent the company from doing so. Apple engineers quickly began calling colleagues to bring them up to speed on the data dump and to coordinate the company’s response to this new security threat, according to a person familiar with the situation The biggest challenge for tech companies is that the documents leaked by WikiLeaks is reportedly only 1% of the amount of data the CIA holds, which means larger vulnerabilities may be at risk. It’s a scenario that could very well repeat itself again if WikiLeaks discloses new secrets allegedly taken from the CIA. The group says that it has now disclosed just 1% of the documents in its possession. “If it is the case that they have so much more, that, I think, will have a lot of people quite nervous,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies with King’s College London. Apple on Tuesday said that many of the exploits found in the leak has already been patched. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. Luckily, the AP reports that WikiLeaks will be giving the CIA hacking tools to tech companies. This could possibly mean that companies such as Apple will be able to patch these exploits much quicker.

But when they do eventually become the norm, which ones will Britons buy? Auto Trader research found people would prefer a vehicle made by established manufacturers like Ford and Audi - or from a firm known for its cars, like Tesla - over brands not associated with motoring, including Apple, Amazon and Google. Ford leads the way: UK drivers said they are most likely to buy an autonomous car made by the American brand which has accelerated its technology development in the last 24 months The country's biggest online marketplace for used cars surveyed 5,500 UK motorists about their future buying thoughts to understand which carmakers will be in demand. While a high number of motorists admitted they're not currently interested in fully-automated vehicles, they did give an impression of which dealership they'll be ordering their driverless cars from. Just one in five said they will definitely buy a driverless car in the coming years, though acceptance of autonomous vehicles is expected to improve as the technology nears mainstream levels.

Those chose to picked from the names listed highlighted how consumers are skewed towards existing car makers instead of tech brands with automotive desires. Of the top 10 most chosen, just Google infiltrated the list of car maker brands. Ford, Audi and electric car specialist Tesla came out on top.  Apple, Amazon and Uber made it into the top 15, however.  MOST DRIVERS WOULD BUY AUTONOMOUS CAR FROM FORD, AUDI AND TESLA Car brand Selected by* Trust in brand Brand image Positive experience Perceived technology Perceived safety Affordability Ford 7.68% 79% 50% 83% 43% 64% 69% Audi 6.17% 82% 67% 62% 65% 70% 40% Tesla 5.95% 76% 62% 15% 92% 84% 43% Mercedes-Benz 5.95% 89% 51% 70% 78% 85% 18% BMW 5.80% 78% 56% 65% 83% 81% 27% Volkswagen 4.74% 84% 44% 75% 65% 73% 54% Honda 4.67% 87% 52% 73% 65% 63% 50% Toyota 4.44% 86% 47% 68% 69% 73% 49% Google 3.24% 58% 44% 79% 88% 51% 47% Nissan 2.94% 77% 77% 69% 54% 49% 69% Apple 2.41% 91% 75% 56% 97% 53% 25% Volvo 2.33% 90% 42% 58% 71% 87% 35% Hyundai 1.36% 72% 39% 78% 83% 39% 72% Amazon 1.28% 59% 53% 94% 71% 65% 53% Uber 0.68% 89% 56% 67% 56% 67% 44% *When asked to choose a brand that they find most appealing when considering fully-autonomous vehicles, regardless of their attitude to the technology itself, 40.29% declined to choose any brands offered Source: Auto Trader March 2017 Market Report based on 5,500 respondents Tesla, which is very much at the forefront of available semi-autonomous vehicle technology, was highly rated by buyers looking into fully autonomous models Drivers were then asked to rank the reasons why they selected their favoured brand with the options being: brand trust; brand image; past positive experience; perceived technology; perceived safety; and affordability.  The results showed that the four most voted for carmakers were selected for different reasons. The highest factor for top-placed Ford was positive experiences in the past while Audi and Mercedes-Benz won people over based on the trust they'd developed in the two luxury brands. Telsa was the third highest choice, with a 92 per cent rating for perceived technology. Only Apple scored higher on that factor - 97 per cent - but was just the eleventh most chosen brand among motorists. Uber and Amazon propped up the table, while Apple and Google mixed it among traditional car brands. Familiarity was key for consumers when they chose Ford as their go-to autonomous car brand - previous experience of owning vehicles like the Fiesta and Focus would see them return to the blue oval brand Jon Quirk, editor at Auto Trader, said motorists' opinion on driverless cars was 'polarised'.  'Auto Trader’s Market Report shares some good news for car manufacturers, with nine car makers featuring in the top ten brands motorist’s find most appealing today when considering driverless cars,' he said. 'There will be plenty of collaboration between car makers and tech companies on autonomous cars in the future, but it’s clear that when it comes to choosing a brand that motorists find most appealing for autonomous cars today, positive past experiences, perceived technology and trust in the brand are some of the most important factors to consider. 'Car manufacturers have a clear headstart against tech companies here as they’ve delivered tried and tested on-road products and established trust in their brands in the process. 'Focusing on what’s important to car buyers as considerations change around fuel type, efficiency and tech/connectivity features should cement this further - putting car makers in poll position to win the automotive space race.' Apple scored highly for trust, but struggled on other fronts as consumers swerved tech brands Despite making moves to test autonomous technology on the roads, drivers felt less enthused about buying an Uber-made vehicle in the future Motorists have a limited understanding of autonomous cars  The research also showed that there's still to learn about a driverless future. Only 21 per cent of the respondents claimed to know what a fully-autonomous vehicle was, with awareness dropping off among older drivers. Interestingly, 19 per cent of those surveyed said they didn't think semi-autonomous cars would be on the road in their lifetime, despite many new cars available on the market today offering semi-driverless technology, such as automatic braking, self-parking and lane assist. When asked for their predictions on when fully-autonomous cars will be available to consumers, 32 per cent said in the next 10+ years, with almost a quarter (23 per cent) agreeing that they won't be available in their lifetime.  That contrasts with industry research from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and KPMG which predicted that fully-automated cars will be available in the UK by 2030.  Don't say 'driverless'  Establishing clear definitions of which vehicles can be safely used in automated mode is going to be a crucial part of bringing the technology onto the UK’s roads, the Association of British Insurers said on Monday. Don't use the term 'driverless', carmakers: That was the warning from the ABI The ABI said it was pleased the Government will take responsibility for specifying which vehicles can be used autonomously and when, suggesting it will help consumers understand the capabilities of their vehicles and make it simpler for insurers to provide appropriate cover. Insurers also argued that vehicle manufacturers should be responsible in how they describe their cars; the term 'driverless' should never be used it the driver is still required to be alert and available to intervene in the event of a problem, they declared. Ben Howarth, senior policy adviser on motor and liability at the ABI, said: 'There will need to be a clear system to establish which vehicles can safely be used in autonomous mode, and we look forward to hearing more from the Government about how these standards will be agreed.  'Helping drivers understand what their vehicles are capable of will be vital to the safe and successful roll out of these new technologies.'  SAVE MONEY ON MOTORING Car insurance Compare policies Warranties Get covered Breakdown cover Find the best deals Personal loans Borrow for a car Insurance tips Reduce your costs Share or comment on this article e-mail 22 shares Mortgage rates set to rise this year as US rate hikes...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Humor Image Source: Shutterstock Conan mocks Republican Congressman with a hilarious Apple healthcare ad Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 9th, 2017 at 8:46 AM Share Tweet In the wake of Congressman Jason Chaffetz’s controversial remarks regarding the cost of an iPhone relative to the cost of purchasing affordable health care, Conan O’Brien last night rolled out a mock Apple Healthcare ad showcasing how various Apple products could comically pull double duty as medical tools and instruments. Don't Miss: IBM invented a way to store data on a single atom For those unfamiliar with the extent of Chaffetz’s remarks, the Utah Congressman this week said that low-income Americans might be able to afford better health care if they weren’t so intent on spending money on a brand new iPhone every year. Chaffetz’s full remarks on the issue read as follows: Well we’re getting rid of the individual mandate. We’re getting rid of those things that people said they don’t want. And you know what? Americans have choices. And they’ve got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions for themselves. Predictably, Chaffetz’s remarks sparked a wave of criticism from Democrats and elicited an avalanche of fiery retorts from the Twitterverse. With that as a backdrop, the writers over at CONAN figured that one doesn’t necessarily need to choose between adequate health care and premium Apple products. On the contrary, why not kill two birds with one stone and use the iPhone, the MacBook and other Apple products as makeshift medical devices? Need to check out what’s happening with your eyes, ears and throat? No problem. Just use the iPhone’s built-in flashlight feature. Need to apply some stitches post-surgery? Don’t even trip. Just use the thick white cord from Apple’s EarPods. The full sketch can be seen below. The ad closes out with the following tagline: “Apple, the only healthcare you need. And soon, the only healthcare you’ll have.” While it’s always fun to see late night hosts either skewer Apple or incorporate Apple products into their sketches, I personally think that this recent effort from Conan is pretty sub-par. The premise is solid, but the execution seemed lazy at best. If you feel otherwise, feel free to chime-in in the comment section below and set me straight.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 09, 2017 12:58pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Analyst: The Top Tech Stock Isn't Apple, Alphabet Or Amazon - It's Skyworks Solutions Big Names Aren't Big In This Tech ETF, But Big Returns Are Intel And Mobileye: Desperation For Growth Or Strategic Masterstroke? (Seeking Alpha) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) may launch the much anticipated iPhone 8 a bit later than expected. 9to5Mac, citing a Digitimes report, suggested Apple is working on its own fingerprint sensor that will also act as a built-in sensor. It appears Apple is making its own system in-house rather than rely on technologies supplied by Synaptics, Incorporated (NASDAQ: SYNA) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM), so these Apple suppliers may be left out of the supply chain. In addition, the Digitimes report suggested Apple won't even begin mass production of the iPhone 8 until September as the company's own custom fingerprint system is proving to be more complicated to manufacturer. By comparison, the iPhone 7 was released in early September See Also: A Look At Apple's New Patents Offers A Glimpse Of The iPhone 8 9to5Mac did note Digitimes' track record is "somewhat sketchy" and contrasts a prior DigiTimes report that suggested Apple is developing three new iPhones and production of two of these devices will begin in July and become available for a September launch. These two phones will offer a modest upgrade from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, but the third phone will launch later on in the year. STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) (NYSE: STM) was mentioned by French Apple news website iGeneration as one of the companies whose technology could be included in the iPhone 8. The publication suggested STM may provide 3D sensors and technologies to support augmented reality applications and facial recognition. The report may be consistent with STM's CEO Carlo Bozotti, who acknowledged the company won a contract that will generate substantial revenue in the second quarter of 2017.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT CONTACT NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES iPad Diaries: Optimizing Apple Notes TouchRetouch Review: Object Removal Made Easy GAget: Google Analytics Widgets and Alerts for macOS iPad Diaries: Optimizing Apple Notes By Federico Viticci iPad Diaries is a regular series about using the iPad as a primary computer. You can find more installments here and subscribe to the dedicated RSS feed. I've been using Apple Notes every day since its relaunch with iOS 9 in 2015. Apple's refreshed note-taking app landed with impeccable timing: it supported the then-new iPad Split View in the first beta of the OS released in June, and Apple deftly positioned Notes as a nimble, multi-purpose tool that many saw as a much-needed escape from Evernote's bloated confusion. I almost couldn't believe that I was switching to Apple Notes – for years, it had been derided as the epitome of démodé skeuomorphism – but the app felt refreshing and capable. Notes in 2017 isn't too different from its iOS 9 debut. Apple added integration with the Pencil in late 2015, private notes with iOS 9.3, and they brought sharing and collaboration features in iOS 10, but the app's core experience is still based on the foundation laid two years ago. Unlike, say, Apple Music or Apple News, Notes has remained familiar and unassuming, which gives it an aura of trustworthiness and efficiency I don't perceive in other built-in Apple apps (except for Safari). I keep some of my most important documents in Notes – from bank statements to health records – and anything I want to save for later tends to be captured with Notes' extension. Apple Notes is my brain's temporary storage unit – the place where I archive little bits of everything before I even have time to think about them, process them, and act on them. Some of the content I save in Notes is eventually transformed into DEVONthink archives or Trello cards; other notes live in the app and they're continuously edited to reflect what's on my mind. I rely on Apple Notes and it's one of my most used Apple apps (again, along with Safari).1 Apple Notes, however, is not a great pro iPad app. Notes falters where other Apple software falls short: it's entrenched in iPhone paradigms at the expense of more advanced controls and customization options for iPad users. While Apple showed some promising steps towards "power-user features" with the three-pane layout added in iOS 10, I've long wished for a deeper degree of personalization in Notes for iOS. And given Apple's reluctance to tweak Notes' structure and functionality, I've come up with my own workarounds.

JOIN FOR $5 PER MONTH JOIN FOR $50 PER YEAR A Folder for Shared Notes In my workflow, sharing notes over iCloud with friends and colleagues has become as commonplace as sharing a link to a Dropbox file. I have notes shared with my girlfriend; notes that I use as reference material for the MacStories team; and notes with scripts and workflows I made for friends that I share as private wikis. I love the simplicity of Notes collaboration, but I wish I could view all notes that have been shared at a glance. All my shared notes in a folder. Apple Notes doesn't have a smart folder or search filter for 'All Shared Notes', but I recently realized that I could manually create a folder and drop shared notes into it to keep them all in one place for quick access. Now, whenever I'm working on a note I know I'll end up sharing, I move it to my 'Shared' folder; then, when someone asks me for a link to that note again, I can open the folder, find the note, and copy the link. This process requires more manual management on my end, but it's the best compromise I've found given Notes' lack of smart folders or a tagging system where the same note can live in multiple locations.2 Until Apple adds a dedicated screen for shared notes, I'm going to store them in a folder. Emoji in Folder Names Another aspect of Apple Notes that I don't like is the absence of visual differentiation between folder names in the app's sidebar. Aside from missing any kind of sorting option for folders3, Notes doesn't let you assign colored labels or indicators to folder names, resulting in a dull list of folders, sorted alphabetically, with no highlights or colors to mark up the important ones. For a while now, I've been putting emoji next to the names of folders I frequently access. My Shared, Articles, Private, Personal, and Travel folders have been customized with emoji that make them stand out when I open Notes and want to find something in a couple of seconds. Human eyes parse symbols and colors faster than words, so emoji are the perfect complement to Apple Notes' folder naming system. Plus, they add some much needed flair to the app. But there's more: as you can see from the screenshot above, some of my folders have an emoji before the name, while others feature an emoji at the end. The choice is not random. Because iOS Notes defaults to sorting folders alphabetically, some of my frequently used folders (such as Shared and Private) ended up floating towards the bottom of the sidebar, which made them harder to find. If you put an emoji before the name of a folder, though, Notes' alphabetical sorting will put emoji at the top of the list, before folders starting with a number or the letter "A".4 This way, important folders are both highlighted with emoji and they're available underneath the top-level 'Notes' folder. Other folders where the emoji is at the end of the name are just highlighted – they don't get promoted to the top of the sidebar, but they're still easier to find. Notes Sub-Folders on iOS with Puffin One of the most glaring omissions from Notes on iOS is the inability to create sub-folders by nesting a folder inside another. This feature is available on Notes for Mac via drag & drop; despite the two years Apple had to achieve feature parity with the desktop version, iOS can only sync sub-folders from the Mac, but not create them. In previous years, this forced me to fire up Notes on my MacBook just to add a new sub-folder and make it sync with iCloud. A few weeks ago, I remembered that Puffin – an alternative web browser that I don't use on a regular basis – offered a trackpad feature to simulate having a mouse on iOS. I haven't seen the same option in other browsers5, but I understand how it might be useful for those websites that, in 2017, still don't adapt to modern web standards and touch interactions. By simulating the hover properties of a mouse cursor, Puffin can ensure compatibility with websites that are broken in iOS Safari. Drag & drop with trackpad mode in Puffin. Out of curiosity, I enabled trackpad mode in Puffin and headed over to iCloud.com and opened the Notes web app. I didn't think it would work, but I enabled the gesture to simulate drag & drop, selected a folder, and dragged it into another one. The process didn't feel as natural or smooth as the real Safari for Mac, but it worked: Puffin's trackpad mode managed to create a sub-folder, which synced back to my iPad in a couple of seconds. There are some caveats. For one, everything feels somewhat buggy – the web app is slow to load in Puffin, emoji aren't displayed correctly, and you can't expand existing sub-folders because clicking the triangle button will do nothing. Clearly, Puffin's trackpad mode is a workaround to overcome the lack of basic drag & drop and hover states on iOS. However, if all you need to do is nest a folder into another one and don't own or want to use a Mac, Puffin for iOS should get the job done. Self-Sharing and Note Launchers When I reviewed Bear last year, I praised the app's support for individual note links, which allowed me to reference and open specific notes directly from outside Bear (an aspect that I also lauded when I covered DEVONthink). Ever since I moved back to Notes, I've been trying to replicate that functionality without asking Siri to open a note. While not ideal, I've found a way to create launchers for specific notes that I can use anywhere on my iPad. When you share a note with someone, iOS generates an icloud.com/notes link with a unique reference to the note; tapping that link displays a 'Retrieving...' dialog for a couple of seconds before Notes launches, opening the associated note. Obviously, you wouldn't want to share notes with other people just to create re-usable links, but there's an easier way: share a note with yourself, copy the link, and use it as a launcher elsewhere. I can launch specific notes with iCloud.com shareable URLs and Magic Launcher. Here's what I did: I shared every note I wanted to access more easily by adding my phone number as a collaborator. In a note, you can tap the collaboration button in the toolbar, select 'Copy Link' as an option, and then add yourself to the note. After doing this, you won't see your profile picture in the list of collaborators, but you'll have a unique link to the note available in your clipboard. You can then turn this link into a launcher for Launch Center Pro, Workflow, and any other launcher utility you might have installed. I created a few Notes launchers in Magic Launcher (which I've been using as a widget dashboard lately) and I'm saving a lot of time as I don't have to search for notes manually anymore. You'll always see this dialog for a second before launching a note URL. There are downsides to this method. Notes protected with a password or Touch ID can't be shared, so you won't be able to create launchers for them. Furthermore, because these links depend on resolving an icloud.com URL before opening, you'll always get the 'Retrieving...' dialog upon tapping Notes links, which won't work if you're offline. Despite the limitations of this workaround, I've found note links to be an effective solution to the problem of referencing different notes and jumping between them. I wish there was a better way, but at least I can quickly open specific notes now. Apple Notes has become the default location for quickly archiving and outlining anything I don't want to forget. Notes isn't a replacement for more advanced apps like DEVONthink, and I would love to see Apple expand the app's feature set with deeper search filters, smart folders, and a modernized interface. In two years, however, I've come to accept Notes' quirks and shortcomings, and I've optimized the app to my iPad needs. Notes is dependable, straightforward, and surprisingly powerful – three essential characteristics for one of my most-used iPad apps. As I feared when I reviewed Bear last year, I couldn't stick to the app because of its lack of sharing features and issues with conflict resolution. Bear is an excellent note-taking app, but I was missing Apple Notes too much. ↩︎ In an app like Bear, for instance, I'd tag the same work-related shared note with "macstories" and "shared", and the note would appear in two separate tag screens. This isn't possible with Notes. ↩︎ It'd be nice to sort folders by modification date, for example, or to display badges on folders that contain shared notes that have been updated on another device. ↩︎ Interestingly, emoji are also sorted. I assume it's done alphabetically based on the official character description that isn't exposed to the user. Strangely enough, sorting is different in the Mac app and emoji aren't prioritized in the sidebar. ↩︎ I was surprised to see that trackpad mode isn't included in iCab's ever-growing list of advanced settings. ↩︎ Tags: iPad Diaries Sign Up Unlock MacStories Extras Club MacStories offers exclusive access to extra MacStories content, delivered every week; it’s also a way to support us directly.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Apple Genius Training in Cupertino Reportedly Coming to End  March 9, 2017March 9, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Joe Rossignol at MacRumors: For years, Apple has sent new Genius hires to its Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino, or sometimes an auxiliary campus in Austin or Atlanta, to receive hands-on training for up to three weeks. Recently, however, Apple appears to have stopped offering these group-based trips, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s off-site Genius Training program has been replaced by an in-store, self-guided experience using company-provided reference materials, according to a source. The training now involves watching web-based seminars through the Apple Technical Learning Administration System, or ATLAS, another source said. I went to Cupertino for my training in October 2007. While I am confident that the experience has changed in the intermediate decade, I can say that the two weeks I spent in California were well worth it. Apple’s training space is on Bubb Road, around the corner from the Infinite Loop campus. Inside the front doors stood a Genius Bar that we used exactly zero times during my training: (Wow, the iPhone camera sure has gotten better over the years.) Beyond the fake Bar were a couple of large classrooms with movable tables where we spent ten days in class. My two-week course was split into several segments. We spent five days on software then took the software exam on Friday. I had already been helping the Geniuses in my store, so this was a bit easier for me than the subsequent hardware training and exam. At Bubb, I discharged my first CRT and took apart my first aluminum iMac. I learned how to organize screws as you take something apart in a way that is logical, something I still do today around the house. I’ve uploaded my class notes here if you’re interested in what a 21 year-old Stephen thought was important to remember. I took them on a Clamshell iBook G3 because the hard drive in my PowerBook had given up the ghost like two days before my trip. I got some looks lugging that thing around. There was also time dedicated to learning GCRM, the system Apple was using then to manage repairs and device swaps. I have a folder of 44 PDFs generated from that part of the training alone. We also spent time role-playing and learning customer service skills. The Genius Bar works best when it is staffed with nerdy people who are also good at talking to and dealing with actual humans. All of that software and service training can easily take place in Store. Apple’s repair certification program is more complex than it used to be, so I wonder what repair training looks like without a lab full of Macs dedicated to being taken apart over and over. Will Apple Stores keep practice Macs around? Will it be all hands-on training with another technician?1 Beyond all of it though, getting to go to Cupertino2 was a real mark of pride for myself and other Geniuses. It made me feel like I was part of something much bigger, and much more important, than just my local retail store. The first morning, we got to go to a meeting inside Infinite Loop with Ron Johnson, the head of Apple Retail at the time. We got to eat at Cafe Macs and enjoy the surrounding area on the company’s dime. I happened to be there for the Mac OS X Leopard launch Beer Bash, and it was a ton of fun. Getting trained in the back of a mall store doesn’t include all of that, and I think it’s a bummer to see it go away. I’m sure getting rid of these trips is just another budgetary or logistical decision to come out of “new Apple,” but I am glad I got to do it. This is how we would learn how to take apart new machines that weren’t covered on our most recent certifications. I was super jealous that someone else got to open the first MacBook Air our Genius Room ever saw. ↩ Some Geniuses have been trained at Apple’s campus in Austin, Texas (and even Cork, Ireland) over the years, too, but I think the point I am about to make still stands. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | March 9, 2017 -- 16:58 GMT (08:58 PST) | Topic: Security (Image: file photo) Several tech giants have said they are examining a trove of documents leaked earlier this week that purport to show the CIA's ability to hack into phones, computers, and smart TVs. The documents, released by WikiLeaks, did not contain exploit code that could be used by hackers to carry out attacks, but the documents do provide details of vulnerabilities that may help security researchers identify some flaws in tech products, including Android devices and iPhones. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung were all named in the thousands of released documents, which are believed to have come from the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence. national security Leaked secret CIA files detail tools for hacking iPhones, Android, smart TVs Classified files point to a covert effort by the CIA to develop exploits for vulnerabilities in popular phones for surveillance. Read More The CIA has so far not commented directly on the authenticity of the leak, but on Wednesday it suggested that the release had damaged national security by helping its adversaries "with tools and information to do us harm." WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a Thursday press conference that he will give the tech companies "exclusive access" to some of the technical details it has of the CIA's hacking tools, as part of an effort to expedite the security patching process. But so far there has been no such evidence of sharing files with tech companies, however. Apple said in a statement that it will "rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities" it finds in its Macs or iPhone software. Google, too, said it will "implement any further necessary protections" and that its analysis is ongoing. Microsoft said it was "looking into" the reports, but didn't comment further. But security experts say that many of the vulnerabilities have already been patched. Jon Sawyer, an Android security researcher, said that most of the Android bugs listed have been already patched. "The list seems to be limited to Android 2.2 to 4.4.4 -- we are on Android 7.1.1 now," said Sawyer. He said that many of the bugs related to legacy versions of Android and older devices. "Vague descriptions of bugs is no more worrisome than the fact they know any software has unknown vulnerabilities," he said, adding that Google was "in no worse position than they were a week ago." An analysis by F-Secure showed that the majority of Android users are still using Android 4.4. Google's own statistics shows that the software version is third behind Android 5 and Android 6. Will Strafach, an iOS security researcher, said that "essentially, there is nothing" in the documents that point to working vulnerabilities of iOS 10 and later. Almost 80 percent of users are currently on a version of iOS 10, says Apple. Strafach said the Samsung smart TV vulnerability, which required an older firmware version and physical access to the device, had also been fixed. In a brief statement, a Samsung spokesperson said the company was "urgently looking into the matter." Linux, the open-source operating system, was also listed in the cache of documents. "Linux is a very widely used operating system, with a huge installed base all around the world, so it is not surprising that state agencies from many countries would target Linux along with the many closed source platforms that they have sought to compromise," said Nicko van Someren, chief technology officer at The Linux Foundation, speaking to BBC News. US government pushed tech firms to hand over source code If source code gets into the wrong hands, the damage would be incalculable. Read More He emphasized that the rapid release of security patches "enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users faster." But the status of other products isn't fully known. In the cache, close to two-dozen antivirus products, including Kaspersky, Symantec, and Avast, were listed as having vulnerabilities that were exploitable by the CIA. According to the Associated Press, the CIA used unflattering terms to deride antivirus makers, many of which the agency exploited through vulnerabilities in their software. In one case, a flaw in Kaspersky antivirus allowed the CIA to "bypass Kaspersky's protections," but founder Eugene Kaspersky told an AP reporter that the vulnerability was fixed "years ago." Avira, another antivirus maker, said it fixed a "minor vulnerability" within hours of the documents' release. Cindy Cohn, director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the CIA had "failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities." "Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans," she said. WikiLeaks said so far it has released only a fraction of what it says it obtained, and that more files will be released in the coming days and weeks.

By Steve Ranger | March 9, 2017 -- 16:37 GMT (08:37 PST) | Topic: Enterprise Software Hacker using laptop. Lots of digits on the computer screen. WikiLeaks will give tech companies access to technical details of the security flaws in their products held in its cache of CIA files. Earlier this week WikiLeaks published a over 8,000 documents - apparently internal CIA files - detailing the intelligence agency's hacking programmes, including a hoard of hacks and zero-day exploits targeting products from some of the world's best known tech brands including Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft. Apple and Google have responded to the leaks by saying that some of the vulnerabilities listed in the documents have already been patched; Apple said it was working 'rapidly' to fix others. In an online press conference WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has now said the organisation will offer additional tech details to tech companies to help them fix the problems. Assange said: "Hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secured, and once this material is effectively disarmed by us, by removing critical components we will publish additional details about has been occurring." He said: "We are going to work with some of these manufacturers that have called for it, to try and get those antidotes out there before we publish more information that could give clues to cyber-mafia or other intelligence agencies on how to do this." But he said there were questions as to whether cyber criminals and other intelligence agencies already have that information. The CIA "weren't securing it very well so it's quite possible that numerous people could have it," he said. "Even if WikiLeaks doesn't publish any of these cyberweapons I think it is hard to stop the spread elsewhere, which might have already occurred." The FBI and CIA have also launched an inquiry into how WikiLeaks was able to publish the documents. Assange predicted that some flaws could be fixed rapidly while others will take more time. For some flaws the issue may be less about fixing the flaw but getting the fix to customers if they need to update software on their devices "Only people who are aware of its can fix the problem," he said.

 A prominent UBS analyst explains why he thinks Apple is a monopoly Kif Leswing Mar. 9, 2017, 11:31 AM 3,033 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Apple only holds 17.9% of smartphone market share, but one prominent analyst still thinks the world's most valuable company may function like a monopoly. "Is Apple an anti-fragile monopoly?" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich asks in a note distributed to clients on Thursday.  Milunovitch points to Apple's pricing power as one sign that it may have an monopoly-like moat around its most profitable businesses.  "One characteristic of monopolies is pricing power. iPhone's ASP of almost $700 last quarter has rebounded to an all-time high despite currency pressure and could further rise with the iPhone 8," he writes. Other smartphone makers must compete on price, one of the reasons the iPhone accounted for 79% of global smartphone profits, according to a recent estimate.  Milunovich cites independent Apple analyst Horace Dediu while making the case that Apple may be "developing a greater ability to compete and adapt" than its rivals like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, which all sport much higher PE ratios than Apple.  "[Deidu] argues that Apple's position is less fragile than it first appears, which investors are picking up on with increased emphasis on services and the installed base. Although Apple is viewed as less powerful than its large cap tech brethren, it exhibits superior pricing power," Milunovitch writes. While Google's cost-per-click is declining, the average price of the iPhone is staying high.  UBS The note also touches on Nassim Taleb's concept of "anti-fragility" as it applies to Apple, which is a way of looking at companies that benefit from volatility and change.

The next-generation store will be located at 4835 River City Drive, just down the street from its current store at 4712 River City Drive in the open-air shopping complex. Apple's existing St. Johns Town Center store opened in March 2005 Apple's new 9,100-square-foot store is situated between Tesla and Tory Burch stores near the southeast end of the Town Center. The space, which was vacated by Forever 21 last year, is over twice as large as its current store, which opened in March 2005. The older location will likely close by Saturday. Elsewhere, Apple plans to double the size of its Woodland Mall store in Grand Rapids, Michigan to 8,000 square feet, according to MLive. And in China, a store with a beautiful staircase is set to open at Jinmao Place in Nanjing in the near future. Apple has yet to announce an official grand opening date. (Thanks, Larry!)

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Technology News | Thu Mar 9, 2017 | 11:00am EST Apple's Siri learns Shanghainese as voice assistants race to cover languages A woman speaks on her iPhone as she walks on a busy street in downtown Shanghai. REUTERS/Aly Song By Stephen Nellis | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO With the broad release of Google Assistant last week, the voice-assistant wars are in full swing, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and now Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google all offering electronic assistants to take your commands. Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri's original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. "Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv.

What is Dashboard? Introduced with OS X Tiger in 2005, Dashboard acts as a host for all manner of mini-apps (widgets). (Take a look at the image above -- an Apple PR image from 2005, it's amusing how many references to "Yosemite" you'll find. Along with a Dashboard icon in the Menu bar). Your Mac ships with a range of widgets, including contacts, a puzzle game, flight tracker, calendar, clock, and weather app. You can enable new widgets by tapping the + icon at the lower left of the Dashboard environment. You can find and install even more widgets from a range of third party developers when you tap the ‘More Widgets’ button. (Here is the complete collection). Dashboard widgets can be useful, but Apple has been deprecating their importance in the last couple of OS releases (it hasn’t had a significant improvement in years). That’s why it makes sense to use Notifications widgets if one you need is available to minimize the workflow impact if Dashboard support is removed from macOS in future. However, with hundreds of Dashboard widgets available in contrast to a handful of Notifications equivalents, you may still find work for idle Dashboards to do. How to launch Dashboard Originally an icon to access Dashboard was hosted in the Dock by default. This changed in OS X Yosemite and you may now need to enable it. To enable Dashboard: Open System Preferences>Mission Control. Set Dashboard to Off, As Space, or As Overlay Off is self-explanatory. You can access Dashboard in its own Space, or as an Overlay atop your Desktop. My personal favorite is Overlay because it gives me the information I need without removing me from my workspace. At the bottom of the preferences pan you will see your Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts. Show Dashboard is probably set to appear when you press F12, but you can change this if you wish. To access Dashboard: Once you have enabled it here are the many ways to access your Dashboard: Tell Siri to “Open Dashboard” Tap Command-Space, type ‘Dashboard’ in the search box, hit Return Double-click its icon in your Applications folder (Or drag the icon back to its rightful place in your Dock for future use). Use Launchpad Tap F12 (or another function button you may assign) Swipe up with three fingers on your trackpad to access Mission Control. Tap ‘Dashboard’. Create a Hot Corner shortcut to Dashboard in Mission Control How to create a Web clipping Dashboard becomes a powerful tool if you want to keep an eye on multiple Websites without interrupting whatever it is you are trying to get done. An Apple watcher might want to keep up with an element of a few sites, such as the top stories on MacSurfer or MacDailyNews; or new posts on my AppleMust. You might want to keep an eye on the status of a recent order; watch the most recent links on Reddit; or monitor sales on Amazon, it's completely up to you! To create a Web clipping in Dashboard just navigate to the website you want to keep an eye on and choose File>Open In Dashboard… A purple border will appear at the top of the now greyed-out page, along with an exhortation to “Select part of the webpage, and then click Add.” Move your cursor to the portion of the page that you want to monitor. A box will appear above that area and the greyed-out effect will disappear. You can adjust the size of the box using pull handles, once you have the right areas selected tap ‘Add’ and you’ll be taken to Dashboard view where you will watch your new Web clipping appear, containing content sourced from the area of the page you want to watch. In future, you will be able to take a quick glance at these pages just by accessing your Dashboard, enabling you to keep up with the headlines while you try to remain focused on the task at hand. Editing the clips You can edit the way clips look: Tap the small ‘I’ at the bottom right of the widget to access the settings for that clip. You can choose between six slightly different appearances and change the size of a clip by tapping “Edit” and dragging the corners to a new size. To remove a widget from Dashboard, click the Remove (–) button in the lower-left corner of the Dashboard, then click the unwanted widget's close button (X). Tip: You can refresh the contents of a web clipping in the Dashboard window. Tap on it to bring it to the front of the Dashboard and hit Command-R. An unusual animation will appear and the clipping will refresh with new content, if available. I hope you manage to squeeze a little joy from using Dashboard.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → Apple Genius Training in Cupertino Reportedly Coming to End  March 9, 2017March 9, 2017 ⌘ Permalink Joe Rossignol at MacRumors: For years, Apple has sent new Genius hires to its Infinite Loop headquarters in Cupertino, or sometimes an auxiliary campus in Austin or Atlanta, to receive hands-on training for up to three weeks. Recently, however, Apple appears to have stopped offering these group-based trips, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s off-site Genius Training program has been replaced by an in-store, self-guided experience using company-provided reference materials, according to a source. The training now involves watching web-based seminars through the Apple Technical Learning Administration System, or ATLAS, another source said. I went to Cupertino for my training in October 2007. While I am confident that the experience has changed in the intermediate decade, I can say that the two weeks I spent in California were well worth it. Apple’s training space is on Bubb Road, around the corner from the Infinite Loop campus. Inside the front doors stood a Genius Bar that we used exactly zero times during my training: (Wow, the iPhone camera sure has gotten better over the years.) Beyond the fake Bar were a couple of large classrooms with movable tables where we spent ten days in class. My two-week course was split into several segments. We spent five days on software then took the software exam on Friday. I had already been helping the Geniuses in my store, so this was a bit easier for me than the subsequent hardware training and exam. At Bubb, I discharged my first CRT and took apart my first aluminum iMac. I learned how to organize screws as you take something apart in a way that is logical, something I still do today around the house. I’ve uploaded my class notes here if you’re interested in what a 21 year-old Stephen thought was important to remember. I took them on a Clamshell iBook G3 because the hard drive in my PowerBook had given up the ghost like two days before my trip. I got some looks lugging that thing around. There was also time dedicated to learning GCRM, the system Apple was using then to manage repairs and device swaps. I have a folder of 44 PDFs generated from that part of the training alone. We also spent time role-playing and learning customer service skills. The Genius Bar works best when it is staffed with nerdy people who are also good at talking to and dealing with actual humans. All of that software and service training can easily take place in Store. Apple’s repair certification program is more complex than it used to be, so I wonder what repair training looks like without a lab full of Macs dedicated to being taken apart over and over. Will Apple Stores keep practice Macs around? Will it be all hands-on training with another technician?1 Beyond all of it though, getting to go to Cupertino2 was a real mark of pride for myself and other Geniuses. It made me feel like I was part of something much bigger, and much more important, than just my local retail store. The first morning, we got to go to a meeting inside Infinite Loop with Ron Johnson, the head of Apple Retail at the time. We got to eat at Cafe Macs and enjoy the surrounding area on the company’s dime. I happened to be there for the Mac OS X Leopard launch Beer Bash, and it was a ton of fun. Getting trained in the back of a mall store doesn’t include all of that, and I think it’s a bummer to see it go away. I’m sure getting rid of these trips is just another budgetary or logistical decision to come out of “new Apple,” but I am glad I got to do it. This is how we would learn how to take apart new machines that weren’t covered on our most recent certifications. I was super jealous that someone else got to open the first MacBook Air our Genius Room ever saw. ↩ Some Geniuses have been trained at Apple’s campus in Austin, Texas (and even Cork, Ireland) over the years, too, but I think the point I am about to make still stands. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → New 512 T-shirt!

The virtual assistant is available in 24 languages across 36 countries. Meanwhile, Google’s Assistant is only capable of five languages, and Amazon’s Alexa supporting two. iOS 10.3 introduced yet another language, Shanghainese, giving Apple yet another arm in the race. In an interview with Reuters, Apple’s head of speech explains how Siri learns a new language. Alex Acero, who joined Apple in 2013 and is currently the head of speech, explains the story. He says that Siri was originally powered by Nuance, but was then replaced by an Apple in-house voice platform that relies on machine learning to understand voices and words. In terms of learning new languages, Acero explains that Apple brings in real people who speak the language to read various paragraphs and word lists, spanning across several different accents. The human speech is then recorded and broken down by other humans. This way, the company can ensure accuracy and correct errors. This data is then fed into a machine learning algorithmic training model. This computer transcription data model will then attempt to predict words and can be improved over time. Rather than jumping right to Siri, Apple then publishes the languages on iOS and macOS as dictation languages. This way, Apple can gain an even wider range of data (anonymously) to put in its database. These real-world audio sample obviously contain background noise, pauses and slurs, which can help Siri learn this information in the future. Again, this data is transcribed by real humans. These steps are repeated until Apple feels it is comfortable enough to release the language to Siri. At this point, Apple will hire voice actors to record audio so that Siri is able to give you voice feedback when asked a question.

"Following" : "Follow"}} March 09, 2017 11:17am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Apple Closes Above $140, New All-Time High Goldman Highlights Positive iPhone Data Out of China, Taiwan Nvidia: CompuBench Shows That Vega Is No Match For The 1080 Ti (Seeking Alpha) Based on views from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) observer Horace Dediu, UBS said in a note competition only helps, which gives it an edge over the FANG stocks, namely Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL). 3 Competencies Analyst Steven Milunovich highlighted Apple's three competencies, namely its ability to be either integrated or modular as circumstances require, a relentless focus on the job to be done and being in a constant state of high competition, which serves to keep attention on the product. These competencies, according to the analyst, help it to develop a greater ability to compete and adapt despite facing more competitive threats than the FANG group. Antifragility & Monopoly – Apple's Narrative UBS referred to the two concepts regarding Apple's narrative, namely antifragility and monopoly, as identified by Dediu. Antifragility refers to things that benefit from volatility and change. Dediu feels Apple's position is less fragile than its first appears, with increased emphasis on services and installed base. Pricing Power Confirms Monopoly According to Dediu, Apple exhibits superior pricing power. UBS also noted that Warren Buffett is convinced Apple has a moat similar to The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). Taking a jibe at the Doubting Thomas among the press over Apple's leadership, Dediu clarified that one characteristic of monopolies is pricing power. While Apple's iPhone ASP of about $700 in its calendar year fourth quarter has rebounded to an all-time high, Dediu noted that Google's cost per click has been declining. Dediu sees the possibility of iPhone ASP going higher with the iPhone 8. Apple enjoys 90 percent of smartphone industry profits, Dediu noted. UBS rates Apple a Buy, with a 12-month price target of $151.

Engst Tim Cook called them a “cultural phenomenon.” They’re backordered for six weeks on the Apple online store right now, and some independent Apple resellers tell me they can’t get any to sell. Apple’s new AirPods wireless earbuds are unquestionably an engineering feat, and while reviewers such as our own Julio Ojeda-Zapata and Josh Centers have identified a few weak points, the AirPods are generally well-received (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). The main negative is the $159 price, which makes the likelihood of losing or damaging one of the AirPods all the more worrying. While that price may seem high, most of the full-fledged competitors to the AirPods are at least as expensive, if not more so (see “CES 2017: Gadget Finds on the CES Show Floor, Days 3 and 4,” 11 January 2017). So what if I told you that you could buy a competing product for less than a tenth the price? Seriously. Don’t expect it to be as good as the AirPods, not by a long shot, but for somewhere between $5 and $20, you can buy a single Bluetooth earbud that does basically what the AirPods do — put a speaker and microphone in your ear without awkward wires. I first heard about this product category from a Cornell running buddy, Rob Kurcoba, who bought his first earbud from a Chinese reseller on eBay. At only $6.99, it was incredibly cheap, but he had to wait six weeks for it to arrive via slow boat. He paired it with an Android Wear smartwatch that could play music, the Sony Smartwatch 3 SWR50, and started wearing it on his solo runs. Soon, he was evangelizing it to the rest of us when we ran with the High Noon Athletic Club. Amused by his excitement, I looked on Amazon and was amazed to discover that the single-ear Bluetooth earbud had become almost a generic item, with numerous companies selling products that look nearly identical. I chose a $15 Nocobot model that had slightly better reviews than the others and got it a few days later — no need to wait for the slow boat with Amazon. It paired with my iPhone and my Apple Watch, and worked fine for listening to podcasts while doing yard work and a few times while running. This was all before the AirPods came out, and I lost track of it once yard work stopped for the year. But after the AirPods were announced and finally started to trickle out to users, I was a guest on MacBreak Weekly and mentioned the earbud while we were talking about the AirPods. That comment hit a nerve with listeners, generating lots of requests for more details. So here we are! Nocobot Bluetooth Earbud -- The earbud I bought and recommended on MacBreak Weekly was manufactured by a company called Nocobot and sold by another firm called Duto. It cost $14.99 and came with a custom four-inch USB charging cable with a needle-like tip that plugs into a tiny hole in the earbud. In my testing, battery life is about 3.5 hours of audio; I’m not entirely sure how quickly it recharges because there’s no way to check how fully charged it is. The earbud itself is black, and shaped like an old-style hearing aid, in the sense that it’s designed to fit snugly into your right ear. That’s either a plus or a minus, depending on your ear. It fits tightly in my ear — so well, in fact, that I have to pop it out by pulling up on the top of my ear and pushing gently from the back. It feels a little odd initially, but after a few minutes, I stop noticing it. I could easily see it not fitting in someone else’s ear. It fits only in your right ear, and in case my use of the singular hasn’t made this clear, it’s only a single earbud — your left ear remains uncovered. I consider that a plus for running or biking, where covering both ears is dangerous, but it’s a liability for when you want to block the outside world. The earbud has a single button that you use for pairing, toggling power, and starting and stopping audio: Press and hold the button for 5–10 seconds to put it into pairing mode. Press and hold the button for 3–4 seconds to turn it on or off. Press and hold the button for 1–2 seconds to switch its audio feedback between Chinese and English. Press the button quickly to start or stop the audio, or to answer and hang up calls. Press the button twice quickly to redial the last number called. The annoying part of the button is that it’s somewhat stiff, and pressing it means pushing in on your ear, which can be a bit uncomfortable. On the plus side, it’s unlikely to be pushed accidentally in your pocket or bag. Its only other interface is a recorded voice that tells you that it’s powering on or off, that the device is connected, if it’s ready to pair, and when you end a call. It also tells you when the battery is getting low, and I once heard it say “Battery high.” The quality of the audio is good, but not great. I mostly use it for podcasts while working outside, where it’s totally fine. When I first used it to listen to music while running, I experienced some skips and dropouts. I was able to resolve those by moving the Apple Watch to my right wrist or, when I’ve had the iPhone in a waist belt, sliding it around to the right side or front. The volume is loud enough for most environments, but some additional power would have been nice at times. Put bluntly, this is not an audiophile solution. I hadn’t used the Nocobot earbud’s microphone for calls of any sort until writing this article since I very seldom talk on the iPhone. When I called Josh, he reported that I sounded OK, but not great. For me, his audio was nice and clear, though not quite as loud as I would have liked. Using the iPhone’s built-in speaker and mic worked noticeably better for both of us. Our Skype test was less successful, likely due to the slow hotel Wi-Fi network I was using. The earbud can’t invoke or be used with Siri, unfortunately. You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t linked to this earbud yet. That’s because the particular one I bought isn’t available on Amazon anymore. Nor can I find any indication that Nocobot and Duto are even in business. We’re talking about sketchy Chinese companies here — that’s why it’s so cheap. However, the $14.99 G-Cord Ultra Lightweight Wireless Bluetooth Hands-Free Earbud looks identical, down to the logo on the button, so if you’re looking for one of these, give the G-Cord a try. QCY Q26 Bluetooth Earbud -- After I mentioned the Nocobot earbud on MacBreak Weekly, a listener recommended a competing product from QCY, which is a higher profile brand, to judge from a Google search. At its heart, the QCY Q26 is extremely similar to the Nocobot, being a single-ear Bluetooth earbud controlled by presses on a single button and responding via audio feedback. It costs $13.59 from Amazon and comes in a variety of colors. The QCY Q26 uses a stalk-like industrial design that has pros and cons. On the plus side, it should fit in anyone’s ear, and it comes with three sizes of rubber ear tips so you can choose the one that best matches your ear. That design also enables it to block sound better than the Nocobot earbud. Although it’s designed to go in your right ear, with the button on the top, you can flip it over and put it in your left ear, with the button facing down. It might not work well for calls in that orientation. Either way, the button is easier to press than the Nocobot’s button because you can pinch the QCY Q26 between your fingers while pressing. It’s not all good, though. The stalk design means that it doesn’t fit into your ear nearly as snugly as the Nocobot, and I’d be more concerned about it falling out accidentally. Plus, I find that the rubber ear tip blocks so much external noise that it almost feels like my ear has water in it — it’s somewhere between disconcerting and uncomfortable. (The Nocobot doesn’t block the ear canal as much, avoiding that situation.) The QCY Q26’s button is easily pressed in your pocket or bag, which can turn it on and run the battery down inadvertently or even pocket dial if it’s pressed twice in quick succession. Battery life isn’t quite as good as the Nocobot, at about 3 hours in my testing. The QCY Q26 comes with a micro USB cable for charging, and it plugs into a port on the other side of the earbud from the button. The port has a cover that’s devilishly hard to open; I can get it open only with the sharp point of a safety pin. Controlling the QCY Q26 is almost identical to the Nocobot, with a long press to put it into pairing mode, shorter presses to turn it on and off, quick presses to control audio or answer/hang up calls, and double presses to redial the last number. The audio feedback is similar too, though it doesn’t seem to talk in Chinese. Audio quality in comparison with the Nocobot is both better and worse. The QCY Q26 has a bit more oomph, and when Josh and I tested the microphone quality, he reported that it was a little better, but still reminiscent of AM radio. The rubber ear tip does block more ambient noise too. However, music sounded a bit muddier, and at least in my test unit, there’s a quiet background hiss. You don’t hear it when audio is playing at any significant volume, but it’s noticeable when the volume is very low or off. Plus, when I tried to use it while running with my iPhone in a waist belt, audio cut in and out enough that I stopped and swapped it for the Nocobot. It was fine when I used it to listen to music while standing at my desk, however. Making a Choice -- I won’t pretend that either of these earbuds is anywhere near as good as Apple’s AirPods. Their Bluetooth pairing can be annoying, audio quality isn’t as good, battery life is shorter, it’s more difficult to plug in their charging cables, their microphone quality is weak, and neither supports Siri or voice commands. And heck, you only get one, something that AirPods allow but don’t require. But these earbuds are so cheap that you may not care. I wrote this while at the ASMC Summit, a conference for independent Apple resellers, and when I showed these two little earbuds to one attendee, he said that he didn’t even bring his AirPods to the conference for fear of losing them. Just as the best digital camera is the one in your pocket, the best earbud is the one you have with you. Also, I’m talking about a category that contains much more than these two entrants. When you search for “Bluetooth earbud” on Amazon, you’ll see a variety of comparable products with slightly different industrial designs that you might find more compelling. Some are as cheap as $5, and there’s no reason I can see to spend more than $20 given how similar they look. I wouldn’t expect any of them to last for all that long, and they’d be easy to lose, but a super low price makes up for a lot of sins. My friend Rob, who got me started with these earbuds a year ago, tells me that he has since bought eight more, four of which he’s given away to family and friends. Of those he kept, he lost two and one broke, but at $7 each, he doesn’t feel bad about it. So hey, if you’re looking for a cheap wireless audio solution for one ear, give one of these earbuds a try. It’s not a big investment if it doesn’t work, and you might be pleasantly surprised.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Gustavson  2017-03-09 13:57 I like this stereo pair, connected by a wire that also provides a handy way to keep track of them hanging around your neck when not using one or both. (Run the wire behind your head.) I had no problem pairing. They work similarly to the ones reported on above. Maybe a bit too loud by default, but phone controls handle that easily. About $22. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LWZ6XZA/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Reply David Meyers  2017-03-10 17:11 If you don't mind a wire between the buds, there are several terrific options for around $30 or so on Amazon. I really like the SoundPEATS Q12 (in the ear) and Q9A (loop over the ear - very very secure) a lot. They've got a true wireless pair - which look identical to the Q9A but without the wire between the two - for about $50. Audio quality is quite good. Unfortunately, they both stink for phone calls. It's the phone call quality which is really making me consider AirPods. For calls, I use a Plantronics Voyager Edge (and when you think about pricing -- that Edge is about half the price of a pair of AirPods, which makes the AirPods not seem quite so outrageous.)

Great place for a battery fire. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:58 Brings new meaning to "My ears are burning!" :-) I can't find any indication that anyone has ever had such a problem, and the batteries are awfully small, so I'd be surprised if could happen. Reply Scott  2017-03-15 18:52 It's like I was predicting the future! http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/15/520269673/womans-headphones-caught-fire-midflight-australian-authorities-say Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-16 09:14 Hah—I saw that yesterday too! Given that your email address starts with "heimdall," I suppose extraordinary senses would be among your super powers. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-03-15 14:11 I have one of the millions of knock-offs of that single ear bud. I got it off of Amazon for maybe $8. It's a perfectly acceptable speaker for my intended uses - out running or driving in the car. I've had it with me on numerous 5k runs, and never once worried about losing it. The quality is decent - I'm no audiophile, so I'm not one to ask about specifics. But I have it to keep my pace and check my stats (and listen to my phone when I'm in our Bluetoothless, AUX-less car), and it functions in that regard perfectly. I will note that it does play both channels of audio in that one speaker, so you don't lose half of your music to a missing earbud, which is nice.

That means many more of us will be able to take advantage of Google's latest and smartest AI. There are some things both the Google Assistant and Siri are excellent at-like pulling up emails or showing photos you've taken in the last week in a specific city (Apple really seems to be catching up to Google in the image analysis department). But there are some things Google just does better. So stop with the Apple envy and read about some of the key areas where Google Assistant has the edge over Apple's own digital AI. 1) Getting instant answers from the web Image: Screenshots Some of Google's instant answers might be on the dubious side but Google Assistant seems better at pulling nuggets of information from the web. It correctly responded to "who won the Best Director Oscar?" and "who wrote The Body In The Library?" with Damien Chazelle and Agatha Christie respectively. Siri, in contrast, gave us a list of movies (not including La La Land) for the answer to the first question, and listed the results of a Bing search for the second (which, to be fair, included Agatha Christie in the snippet previews). Obviously Siri gets a lot of questions right too, but Google Assistant seems to be ahead here. 2) Finding places nearby Image: Screenshots Both Siri and Google Assistant do a decent enough job of finding restaurants, bars, and other kind of businesses nearby, but Google's app came out on top in our tests, not just on the places it returned, but on the interface: results are presented in a simple carousel and you can quickly jump to a Google Maps view. Over on Siri the results list is more difficult to parse and appears to cast a wider net. Your mileage may vary depending on your location and the data these apps have to work with, but where we're from Google Assistant is currently more useful. 3) Remembering what you've already said Images: Screenshots Out of the gate Google Assistant promised smart, contextual responses, so if you asked follow-up questions it would respond sensibly. However it wasn't always as smart as we would have liked , and Siri is now just as good at dealing with those follow-up questions, so you can ask both apps for the weather in Sydney, then say "and New York?" and get the right answer. Where Google Assistant still has the edge is remembering stuff about you (predictably enough for a Google service). Tell the Google Assistant your favorite soccer team, and it remembers that information; Siri just lists soccer fixtures. It's not a huge feature, but now you don't have to out yourself as a Manchester United fan at the bar, and instead can just ask "how did my favorite team do?" 4) Speaking in foreign languages Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is just more loquacious than Siri full stop, but one area where this really comes in handy is with getting short phrases translated. Ask Google Assistant to say "how are you?" or "what's the time?" in Spanish and you get the answers read back to you with authentic accents. Siri simply searches Wolfram Alpha for a translation, so it doesn't really work for phrases and you don't get the added bonus of hearing the pronunciation. If you're a long way from home and need to find a bathroom, then Google Assistant is far more helpful (provided you have a decent data plan). 5) Going beyond being an assistant Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is much more than an assistant, despite the name: it will read you poetry, tell you a joke, or play a game with you. At the moment Siri can't do any of those things, and returns a rather evasive response (though to give it credit, it will direct you to the App Store if you ask to play a game). It's perhaps a sign of Google's ambition for its new Assistant app, as a whole new interface for the web and your phone rather than just an add-on. It's also fair to say it's still more rough around the edges than Siri is, but Apple's got its work cut out if it wants to keep pace with what Google's doing.

Buried in the patent filing is a patent figure that shows that Apple is considering a future version of the Smart Keyboard that offers a secondary display in place of the physical keyboard that could accommodate a virtual keyboard that could also provide artists with another canvas option and gamers the ability to have a virtual game controller.   Apple's patent FIG. 20 presented below illustrates a partial plan view of an alternative embodiment of an iPad Pro Smart Keyboard that offers a display assembly # 704 in place of a keyboard assembly.   The display assembly may provide for a system with dual display capabilities (not shown). Further, the display assembly can change its visual appearance to present a keyboard assembly used as an input feature by touching the display. In other words, the display could present a virtual keyboard, something like the Lenovo virtual keyboard notebook that we illustrate in our cover graphic.   While the idea now has a home via the Smart Keyboard already being on the market, it's a concept that Apple has been kicking around for years now. It first surfaced in 2014 and 2015 but was originally filed in 2012.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

While the link to the iCloud Activation Lock webpage is now dead and the associated support document detailing Activation Lock no longer references the tool, UnlockBoot has discovered that potential buyers in the market for a secondhand iOS device can still check Activation Lock status by IMEI through Apple’s Support website. IMPORTANT: The workaround doesn’t always work properly so your mileage may vary. As explained before, Apple most likely took down the iCloud Activation Lock web tool for security purposes, to stop hacks relying on stolen serial numbers. iCloud Activation Lock allowed anyone to check if a used iPhone, iPad, iPod touch or Apple Watch was lifted. Some folks have been known to leverage the tool when reactivating a bricked device: hackers would typically enter a device’s IMEI on the now erstwhile iCloud Activation Lock webpage to decipher its serial number, then change the hardcoded serial number stored on the device to bypass Activation Lock. How to check Activation Lock status via Apple Support pages 1) Visit Apple’s Support website in your browser. 2) Select iPhone from the list of devices. 3) Click any search category related to hardware, like Battery or Repairs & Physical Damage, then select a specific problem like “Buttons not working”. 4) On the next page, click Send in for Repair. 5) On the next screen, enter your device’s serial number, IMEI or MEID to check its Activation Lock status. If Find My iPhone and Activation Lock are enabled on the device, you should see a message saying “Sorry but we can’t create a repair while Find my iPhone is active”. Tip: If you don’t see this option listed, go back and select a different device problem. We fully expect to see Apple remove this obvious loophole soon.

A new report from Reuters notes that Siri can speak and understand 21 different languages, with localized dialect support for over 36 countries in total. By comparison, Microsoft Cortana supports only eight languages for 13 countries, Google’s Assistant speaks four, and Amazon’s Alexa is limited to only English and German. Reuters also notes that Siri will also be adding support for Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. Alex Acero, the head of Apple’s speech team for Siri, explained to Reuters the process Apple uses in adding new language support to Siri. Acero notes that they begin by bringing in people to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, and then transcribe those passages by hand to provide an exact representation that the system can compare to and learn from. A range of sounds and variety of voices is used to improve recognition quality, and then a language model is built to try and predict typical word sequences. Apple then deploys “dictation mode” to capture a small percentage of anonymized audio recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, which are transcribed by humans, resulting in about a 50 percent reduction in the rate of errors in speech recognition. One sufficient data has been gathered, Apple records a voice actor to speak for Siri in the new language, and then releases the new language with a list of answers to what Apple expects to be the most common questions. Siri then learns during real-world use about what users ask, and Apple tweaks Siri on an ongoing basis to refine the process and improve the quality of speech recognition and answers, pushing out updates about every two weeks. Comments Siri is Nuance, the crappy voice recognition that you love to hate when you call the airlines, banks, etc. Posted by Kyle Lyles on 2017-03-09 19:08:03 Great...so even more people worldwide can be frustrated with Siri's ineptness at understanding common phrases and commands.

The report, which is the largest study of brands based on emotions, also found that for women, the top three most intimate brands are Disney, Apple and Amazon. Brand Intimacy is defined as a new paradigm that leverages and strengthens the emotional bonds between a person and a brand. According to the 2017 report, top ranked intimate brands continued to outperform the S&P and Fortune 500 indices in revenue and profit over the past 10 years. The remaining brands in the top 10 most intimate for women are: Target, Netflix, Honda, Samsung, Whole Foods, Toyota and Google. For men, the top 10 brands are: Apple, Harley Davidson, Nintendo, Chevrolet, Amazon, HBO, Xbox, BMW, Whole Foods and Google. “From our study, it’s clear that brands have work to do when it comes to women and Brand Intimacy,” stated Rina Plapler, partner at MBLM. “Brands need to focus on building meaningful relationships with their customers, not focus on targeting them by gender. Relying on traditional gender stereotypes can be limiting, instead utilizing archetypes and creating relationships with consumers can be effective in appealing to both women and men.” MBLM has seen that some brands target women overtly, while others attract women as a part of their overall strategy. Women are responsible for 70-80 percent of purchasing decisions, which is likely why brands are trying to appeal to the group. However, the study shows that brands are falling short with women. The average Brand Intimacy quotient for women was only slightly below men – 29.1 versus 29.8; however, certain industries are struggling to reach women. Women formed more intimate bonds with brands in retail, consumer goods, health & hygiene, apps & social platforms and fast food. The other 10 industries all have stronger bonds with men: apparel, automotive, beverages, financial services, hospitality & theme parks, insurance & investing, luxury, media & entertainment, tech & telecom and travel. This year, other gender findings in the U.S. include: Top 10 brands for both women and men fit into four industries: technology & telecommunications, automotive, media & entertainment and retail. With the exception of retail, these are all industries that men are more intimate with than women For women, fulfillment – which is associated with exceeding expectations and delivering superior service, quality and efficacy – is the most important archetype Women outscored men on the indulgence archetype, centered around moments of pampering and gratification, and had the same score for ritual, ingraining a brand into daily actions, more than habitual behavior Age is an important consideration in branding; however, MBLM found it is not as influential as gender Income is a metric that reveals more similarities among women than it does differences. Amazon is a top five brand for every income group This year’s report contains the most comprehensive rankings of brands based on emotion, analyzing the responses of 6,000 consumers and 54,000 brand evaluations across 15 industries in the U.S., Mexico and UAE. MBLM’s reports and interactive Brand Ranking Tool showcase the performance of almost 400 brands, revealing the characteristics and intensity of the consumer bonds. To download the full Brand Intimacy 2017 Report or explore the Ranking Tool please visit: http://mblm.com/brandintimacy/. Methodology During 2016, Praxis Research Partners conducted an online quantitative survey among 6,000 consumers in the United States (3,000), Mexico (2,000), and the United Arab Emirates (1,000). Participants were respondents who were screened for age (i.e. 18 to 64 years of age) and annual household income ($35,000 or more) in the U.S. and socioeconomic levels in Mexico and the UAE (A, B, and C socioeconomic levels). Quotas were established to ensure that the sample mirrored census data for age, gender, income/socioeconomic level, and region. The survey was designed primarily to understand the extent to which consumers have relationships with brands and the strength of those relationships, from fairly detached to highly intimate. It is important to note that this study provides more than a mere ranking of brand performance and was specifically designed to provide prescriptive guidance to marketers. We modeled data from a total of 54,000 brand evaluations to quantify the mechanisms that drive intimacy. Through factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and other sophisticated analytic techniques, the research allows marketers to better understand which levers need to be pulled to build intimacy between brands and consumers. About MBLM: Founded in 2004, MBLM is the Brand Intimacy Agency, which is dedicated to creating greater emotional connections between people, brands and technology.

Recently, however, Apple appears to have stopped offering these group-oriented trips, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple's off-site Genius Training program has been replaced by an in-store, self-guided experience using company-provided reference materials, according to a source. The training now involves watching web-based seminars through the Apple Technical Learning Administration System, or ATLAS, another source said. In Cupertino, Apple had a small training facility with a mock Genius Bar and Macs set aside specifically for trainees to take apart and perform test repairs on. But with the switch to web-based seminars, Apple is allegedly providing "virtual take aparts" only now, with no physical hardware. "This means that many customers who check their computers in for repair may have their device serviced by someone who has never physically worked on their model of computer before," said a person familiar with the matter. A handful of Geniuses have shared photos of their training experience on social networks over the years, with one person calling it a "life-changing experience" and others echoing similar positivity. One source described it to us as a "rite of passage" and "a milestone in the career" of an Apple retail employee. Apple's Genius Training program was for years a rite of passage for Apple Retail employees: not only a training opportunity, but a chance to visit one of Apple's corporate campuses, to get questions answered at the source, and, for those who headed to Cupertino, to experience Silicon Valley and the Apple culture. The traditional "selfie" in front of One Infinite Loop was a milestone in the career of every Apple Genius.Apple Store managers have been quietly informing new Genius hires of the changes in recent weeks. It is unclear if the off-site training is permanently discontinued, or if it could return to Infinite Loop or Apple's new campus in the future. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, we revealed a new Apple retail position called Technical Expert, which falls between Technical Specialist and Genius. These employees are able to provide mobile repairs, a task previously limited to Geniuses, and troubleshooting for software and products like the Apple Watch and Apple TV.

It also promotes a high degree of loyalty to a company by the employees. Now they just sit in a room by themselves? I think the quality of support is going to drop dramatically.

When I worked there from 2005-2010, they sent the Creatives and Genius crew to Cali for a month to do hands on training and then in store work. It was the best experience ever. When we got back, we brought back that corporate vide and culture to the store on the retail level. The entire store benefited from a few of us going out there. It brought the store morale up. It was like an award to go to corporate and train. Now that they will do it in the store level, this will not bring the same benefits that it once did. Loyalty will go down and those employees will be more likely to leave Apple sooner than in the past. I would have still been there as a Creative if I wasn't recruited to go elsewhere.

Rating: 33 Votes happyslayer 1 week ago This seems to be a continuing trend. My last two visits to the Genius Bar have been, in my opinion, less than good. Not a lot of help at the time (and it now takes 3-5 days to even get an appointment!) and they just took the laptops and sent them away for repairs, meaning I or my customer was without a laptop for 5 days. This new "training" philosophy seems to only accentuate that; the techs at the stores will no longer be able to do any actual repairs onsite, just send them away to hardware-trained techs elsewhere. I think the Geniuses are now just software/Apple ID issue support people now. Not actual hardware support.

In order to fulfill their pledge, Ibiden plans to invest in more than 20 new renewable energy facilities, including a state-of-the-art floating solar photovoltaic system constructed on a converted lumber yard. Ibiden’s projects are expected to produce 12MW of solar power, helping to limit Japan’s carbon emissions. Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, said in a press release, “Renewable energy investments are good for the environment and good for business.” Together with its suppliers, Apple expects to be generating over 2.5 billion KWhs per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018. The company estimates that equals taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year.

We also reported on Google Assistant being made available to their Android partners but limited to English with others on the way. Amazon's Alexa only speaks English and German while Microsoft's Cortana offers eight languages tailored for 13 countries. In contrast Apple has the lead on this front by the widest of margins with Siri supporting 21 languages localized for 36 countries. It's a very important capability in iDevices where most sales are outside the United States.    Today we learn that Apple is extending their lead with Siri as it appears that Shanghainese is coming next, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai.   At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences.   Then Apple deploys "dictation mode," its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half.   After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks."

As for the remaining exploits, Apple engineers are working to address them as well, according to The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. A person familiar with the situation told the paper that Apple engineers have been coordinating the company’s response to this new security threat. There’s just one “minor” problem: the 8,761 documents in the WikiLeaks dump reportedly amount to just one percent of the the material the non-profit organization holds. “If it is the case that they have so much more, that, I think, will have a lot of people quite nervous,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies with King’s College London. “While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,” Apple said in Tuesday. WikiLeaks earlier this week published documents, purportedly taken from the CIA, describing the spy agency’s tactics and intrusion capabilities for computers and other gadgets like routers, televisions and mobile devices, including iPhones and iPads. Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and others affected by the leak believe that at least two organizations have access to hacking code that exploits their products, the CIA and WikiLeaks. The problem is, neither one is sharing this software, making it difficult for technology giants to fix any potential exploits. consideration for those writing about CIA leaks: you may want to see what those who work in infosec are saying instead of sensationalizing. — Will Strafach (@chronic) March 9, 2017 Networking equipment maker Cisco, for example, said that without more information on the exact tools and malware involved, the scope of action that can be taken is “limited.” For what it’s worth, iOS hacker Will Strafach aka Chronic said that by definition, any jailbreakable devices will be exploitable. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube He called the latest Wall Street Journal report “incredibly misleading” and explained to BGR that nothing in the CIA dump threatens up-to-date iPhones and iPads so consider sending this to anyone asking if they should worry. “We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates,” Apple said two days ago.

Apple's flagship solution for all of that woe came by the way of the  AirPods , $160 headphones with absolutely no wires. For the price, I like AirPods, but they aren't without problems. Fortunately, the Apple-owned Beats has a solution for users who want Bluetooth headphones without those problems, and it comes by way of the new $150 Beats X earbuds. The Beats X are the third product from Beats (and the fourth from all of Apple) to use the new W1 Bluetooth chipset . This Apple-designed chipset should allow for better battery life. It also makes pairing with an Apple device a total snap-as long as your iPhone runs iOS 10.1 or higher. All I had to do to pair was turn the Beats X and bring them near my phone. A "Connect" button instantly popped up and I was off-music ready to be heard wirelessly.  Popping the Beats X into my ears was a pleasant experience too. There was none of the typical soreness-even after using them for hours at a time. Beats includes a choice between four different ear tips. For my own tiny ears the smallest tips worked best- and due to the neck strap I didn't have to worry about a bud popping out and disappearing. Like a number of wireless earbuds on the market, including the super popular Jaybirds X3s (and will.i.am's Buttons), the Beats X go with a necklace design. When you don't have Beats X in your ears, they have magnetic tips that connect around your neck, looking like... a necklace. I made fun of the Buttons for having a similar feature; I now take that back. It's a great way to keep the headphones around your neck when not in use, without losing them. Buttons still look idiotic, but this magnetic connector is a total win. The carrying case the Beats X comes with is really bad. I never figured out how to properly stuff the headphones into the case. Also on the necklace is a controller to control volume, call pickup, and to skip or pause a track. Unlike the Jaybirds X3 the controller is light enough that it never tugs an earbud out of the ear. It also solved my biggest complaint with Apple's AirPods-being forced to control the volume with Siri only. The Beats X battery is also nice and light, and resides in the chunky bits that rest on your neck. Plugging the Beats X into the Lightning port that anchors one side of the neck band for 5 minutes gave me another 2 hours of battery life, and fully charged I managed eight hours. That pales in comparison to the 40 (!) you'll get with Beats Solo 3s, and the charging mechanism isn't as good as the carrying case that come with AirPods, but the Beats X hit a nice middle ground. And thanks to the necklace design these things actually work when I'm being active. Even though AirPods fit well in my ears, I would never feel comfortable running with them. I ran with Beats X, and endured a monstrous spin class, without giving it a second thought. They might not be as fitness-focused as Powerbeats 3s, but they work great for active users. They sound great too. There is more bass than you'd get with AirPods or crummy Apple EarPods, but they don't sound overly heavy. Listening to Future's HDNRXX , the bass notes came through exactly as they should. On a track like Remy Ma's "Shether," each and every devastating blow came through loud and clear. I haven't used the Powerbeats 3, but the Beats X sound about the same as the older Powerbeats 2 earphones. Highs and mids were crisp, and bass, while not overly booming, is very much present. The microphone on the cable works fine for voice calls too. All told, Beats X are excellent $150 alternative to the $160 AirPods. They're great for anyone who wants the easy way to connect to an iPhone, but would also like better battery life and playback controls. Sure, the Beats X don't look as cool as the earring like Airpods, but if your prioritize function over form they're practically perfect. README Registering the Beats X will net users a free $30 iTunes gift card, which is a nice bonus. Even without using wingtips, Beats X stayed in my ears during strenuous activity. At $150, these are pricier than the similarly designed, and similarly sounding Jaybird X3 . If you're an Android user and don't care about the Beats name, those are just as good. Pairing with an iPhone is genuinely so easy, it's one of my favorite things ever. The included Lightning cable for charging is very short. This is probably good if you're using it in a car or with a power pack, but might be short in other scenarios. As of right now, Beats does not make these in rose gold, which is absolutely a missed opportunity.

Views count: 559 Tags: nigerian bulletin nigerians in diaspora nigerians that work at apple Oluogunjobi Social Member Curators Nigerians in different fields excel anywhere across the world. Here is a list of some that work at Apple, a multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, United States. 1. Tope Bello: With a background in urban and regional planning, from the University of Lagos, and a master’s in geospatial information sciences from the University of Texas, Tope is a seasoned geospatial software designer. His career kicked off at ESRI, a US-based GIS software company, where he spent almost a decade honing his skills. Tope joined Apple in November 2016 to work on the Apple Maps team in California. In his free time, Tope loves to play football and is also an ardent follower of basketball. 2. Debola Olufon: Debola Olufon has a history with Apple, dating as far back as 2010. In his humble beginnings, he started off as a floor worker for Apple Retail in London. As a workshop facilitator, he provided training for members of the public and press on new Apple products. He took on a couple other roles after then, including ‘mentor & recruitment coordinator’ and ‘Apple Expert’. Not satisfied with his position, he proceeded to the London Metropolitan University to obtain a post-grad diploma in HR management (CIPD). He has since returned to take on the role of HR Admin at Apple in London. 3. Sefunmi Osinaike: Sefunmi Osinaike describes himself as an “advocate for entrepreneurship as a means for solving distinctive problems”. True to his claim, he co-founded Pave, a time management tool for students, while still studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Looking for a challenge to expand his horizon, Sefunmi decided to take on the corporate world, cutting his first teeth as a Program Manager at Microsoft’s Redmond HQ. By August of 2016, he had moved on to join Apple at the company’s Cupertino HQ, where he works in product operations which puts him at the heart of iPhone production. But don’t expect him to leak any details about the upcoming iPhone 8; you’ll have to wait until launch day in September/October. 4. Tobi Ayanleke: obi Ayanleke is an alumnus of Airforce Comprehensive School, Ibadan, Nigeria. Before joining Apple in November 2016, he was the country support manager for HP in Nigeria and Ghana, a position which he held for 2 years. With a wealth of experience in supply chain, IT service delivery and operations management, and an MBA in global management to boot, Tobi had little trouble sealing a sales management position at Apple in Canada. 5. Adejoh Ogbe: 2 years after he graduated with a degree in geography and town planning from the Kogi State University, Adejoh Ogbe proceeded to the University of Northern Iowa to obtain a master’s in Geography. There he worked on a “spacial analysis of foreclosure and neighbourhood characteristics in Miami metropolitan area, Florida” for his dissertation. Adejoh joined Apple, as a GIS technician consultant from Apex, in January 2016. 6. Emmanuel Chukwuezi: Emmanuel Chukwuezi is a senior iOS and Mac support specialist at Apple’s European Headquarters in Ireland. Before then, he worked as an enterprise account manager at eir Business, a Dublin-based telecommunications company, for 5 years. Emmaneul is an alumnus of the University of Calabar, in Nigeria, and the University of Portsmouth, UK. -- Credits: techpoint   Oluogunjobi, Mar 9, 2017 #1 You may like Comments [You must log in or sign up to reply here.] Show Ignored Content Log in with Facebook Your name or email address: Do you already have an account?

Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Which tablet is better? by Sean Keach 09 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro: Samsung is taking the fight to Apple with a workhorse Android tablet, but can it compete with the hugely impressive flagship iPad? Here’s what you need to know. Landing two years after its predecessor, the Galaxy Tab S3 is Samsung's crowning glory when it comes to Android tablets. This attractive and powerful machine is sure to be one of the most popular tablets available in 2017, and we're excited to review it shortly. But it's going up against a real titan: Apple's iPad Pro. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is well designed and crammed with high-end features; it's definitely capable of giving Samsung's tablet a run for its money. So which tablet is the right one for you? In this article, I’ll answer the following questions: How are the designs different? How do the Tab S3 and iPad Pro specs compare? Which tablet has better software? Which tablet is better value for money? Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 or iPad Pro? Alternatively, scroll down to the bottom of the page for a summary. Related: Best Android Tablets 2017 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro Design – What’s the difference? It’s hard to fault either tablet when it comes to design. Galaxy Tab S3 The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 design hasn’t changed significantly from its predecessor, but this isn't a bad thing. It's retained the same near-10-inch form factor and a very similar frontage, with a Home button and capacitive navigation buttons loaded onto the bezel. The Tab S3 has a quad-speaker arrangement, plus a glass rear and metal framing around the edges. There's also a S Pen stylus included this time around, which is a first for the Galaxy Tab S-series. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is also 10-inches(-ish) and boasts a slim 6.1mm chassis. It also reeks of Apple's minimalist design language; it's about as inoffensive a device that you can lay your hands on. You'll almost certainly find it attractive, especially if you're a long-time iPhone user. That said, Apple devices are becoming same-y of late, so maybe you'll enjoy mixing things up with a less conventional Galaxy Tab S3 instead. iPad Pro Here’s our Reviews Editor Alastair Stevenson's take on the tablet designs: "The Galaxy Tab S3 is the best-looking Android tablet I've seen in some time, and its S Pen stylus is good enough to take on the iPad Pro's Apple Pencil. The big question is whether its 820 CPU will be able to match the iPad's stellar performance" Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro – Which tablet is the most powerful? We won’t be able to offer a proper comparison until we’ve fully reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, but we can weigh up its specs against the iPad Pro. Both tablets have similar size screens at the same resolution, so there shouldn't be too much difference when it comes to sharpness. That said, the Tab S3 uses an AMOLED screen, whereas the iPad Pro has an LCD screen. While the the iPad Pro's panel is one of the best we've seen in a tablet, the Tab S3 will benefit from superior contrast and black levels since it doesn't have a traditional backlight. It will be interesting to see how they compare side-by-side for colour accuracy. Galaxy Tab S3 When it comes to performance, while we don't have benchmarks to compare just yet, we suspect the iPad Pro will have a performance edge. Why? Because Apple's A9X chip in the iPad Pro is known to be very powerful, while the Snapdragon 820 chip in the Samsung is by no means the latest chip on the market. We’re still waiting on final details regarding Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S3 camera, but we do know that the iPad Pro has a relatively decent snapper. In our review, Evan Kypreos compared it to the camera on the iPhone 5. If Samsung can top that, then Apple could have cause for concern. iPad Pro The bigger problem for the Tab S3 is the battery, however. While the two tablets share similar specs in most areas, the iPad Pro has a much larger battery. At 7,306mAh, compared to just 6,000mAh on the Tab S3, the iPad Pro's battery is some 20% larger than that of the Samsung. That's a significant difference. For a full spec comparison, check out the table below: Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Apple iPad Pro (9.7-inch) Screen 9.6 inches 9.7 inches Display Resolution 1,536 x 2,048 (266ppi) 1,536 x 2,048 (264ppi) Aspect Ratio 4:3 4:3 Chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 Apple A9X RAM 4GB 2GB Storage 32/128GB 32/128/256GB Rear Camera 12-megapixel 12-megapixel Front Camera 5-megapixel 5-megapixel Headphone Jack Yes Yes Connectivity Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB-C Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB Lightning Fingerprint Scanner Yes Yes Battery Size 6,000mAh 7,306mAh Related: Best Tablet 2017 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro OS – Which tablet has better software? You could endlessly debate the benefits of iOS versus Android, but we think iOS retains an edge on tablets due to its superior collection of tablet-specific apps. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 runs on Android 7.0 Nougat – that’s Google’s latest mobile OS. Android has come a long way in terms of productivity, and now offers quick replies for notifications and app multi-tasking. The software looks decent aesthetically, too, thanks to the "Material Design" changes first introduced with Android 5.0. The big advantage of Android is that it offers greater customisability, and therefore a much more “free” experience. Galaxy Tab S3 By comparison, iOS 10 – as featured on the iPad Pro – is a little more locked down than Android, but the trade-off is simplicity: for first-timers, or those used to an iPhone, Apple’s software is arguably easier to get to grips with. And like Google, Apple has made plenty of changes to promote productivity on the iPad, including a side-by-side mode for apps, a picture-in-picture option for videos, and the addition of an Apple Pencil stylus. Ironically, many of those features were first pioneered by Samsung with its TouchWiz Android skin, but what used to be a strength for Samsung on tablets is now more even. iPad Pro However, it’s important to remember that if you use an Android phone, you’ll find using the Android tablet easier, while the same is true for iPhone users who’ll benefit when upgrading to an iPad Pro. In addition, if you’re already investing in Google services and have paid-for apps on the Play Store (or similarly in iOS and the App Store) then it’s easier and more financially sensible to stick with the platform you’re already using. Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro Price – Which tablet is better value for money? We don't have final pricing for the Galaxy Tab S3 yet, so we'll be updating this section when that information becomes available. What we do know is that it's going up against the iPad Pro, whose price starts at £549 – and rises well above that, depending on the specification of the device you opt for. Given that the Galaxy Tab S2 was around the £300 mark, it will be interesting to see what Samsung charges for its latest device. If Samsung sticks with a similar price then the Tab S3 could be a serious bargain. iPad Pro Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 vs iPad Pro Summary – What’s the difference? Here’s a quick overview of the key differences between the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 and the Apple iPad Pro. Design: Apple and Samsung showcase their impressive design pedigrees with their respective tablets. Both are slim, light, and come with a bundled stylus. Pick either and you'll probably be chuffed to show it off. Specs: It's tough to make a like-for-like comparison with the two tablets, thanks to the varying nature of Apple vs Android components. What we do know is that they should be similarly powerful, both offering relatively new chips, high-resolution displays, and capable cameras. Price: We're still waiting on Galaxy Tab S3 pricing, but the Apple iPad Pro starts from £549. Value: Until we have pricing information, we can't favour one tablet over the other in terms of value.

The AAPL suppliers list has only been available to the public since 2012. The first was published in the wake of complaints about working conditions in the factories overseas where nearly all of Apple Inc.'s (Nasdaq: AAPL) products are manufactured. While those concerns get less attention now, the Apple suppliers list has become a handy tool for investors looking for fresh ways to profit from Apple's success without necessarily buying Apple stock. Apple updates the list once per year. The first list of Apple suppliers named 150 companies. The 2016 list (inclusive as of the end of 2015) provides the top 200 Apple suppliers. We've duplicated the 2016 Apple suppliers list here, with a few reader-friendly changes. First, we eliminated the duplication in Apple's version of the list, which contains multiple entries for a lot of the companies. We've also added the ticker symbols for any stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges. A word of caution: Stocks that trade on the OTC markets (also known as the pink sheets) tend to be thinly traded.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Imagination Technologies Introduces new Furian Architecture to Power 4K Graphics & Mixed Reality for Next-Gen iPhones | Main | Apple's Siri Currently speaks more Languages than all of their Competitors Combined with Shanghainese on the Way » March 09, 2017 Apple Reveals new Attachment and Recharging Solutions for the Next Generation of Apple Pencil   Apple Pencil was well received when first debuting with the iPad Pro. But the fact that the pencil didn't magnetically connect to the iPad for storage was a drawback as was how it was awkwardly charged. Apple has to date published a number of new proposals regarding future methods of attaching Apple Pencil to the iPad and Smart Keyboard along with a separate accessory. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that provides the most logical solution that addresses both initial drawbacks of the first generation of Apple Pencil.   Today the U.S. patent office published seven Apple Pencil patents that dive into the technical aspects of the Pencil in-depth. One example is titled "Active Stylus Precision Tip" and another is titled "Preprocessing for Nonlinear Stylus Profiles."   In one of the remaining patents, Apple buried two patent figures that we illustrate below that clearly present us with Apple's most logical Apple Pencil solutions to date. Apple illustrates how Apple Pencil could be magnetically attached to future iPad Pro models while recharging the Pencil simultaneously.   Apple's patent FIG. 11E noted above depicts a stylus incorporating a power connector that is configured to electrically couple to an external surface of an electronic device; FIG. 11F depicts the stylus and electronic device of FIG. 11E in a mated configuration.   In FIG. 11E above the iPad Pro includes external electrical contacts. The contact group 1110 on the iPad Pro is configured to interface with the contact group 1112 on the Apple Pencil to facilitate data and/or power transactions.   In some embodiments, the iPad Pro includes one or more magnets that are configured to attract the Apple Pencil in a manner such that the contact group 1110 interfaces (e.g., mates with) the contact group 1112, such as shown in FIG. 11F.   Of course logic doesn't always prevail in the end, but it sure looks like the right solution for the next generation Apple Pencil that could be introduced when Apple refreshes their iPad lineup in the weeks (or months) ahead.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q4 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Technology News | Thu Mar 9, 2017 | 11:44pm IST Apple's Siri learns Shanghainese as voice assistants race to cover languages FULL COVERAGE: INDIA ELECTIONS 2017 Luke Peters demonstrates Siri, an application which uses voice recognition and detection on the iPhone 4S, outside the Apple store in Covent Garden, London October 14, 2011. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/Files By Stephen Nellis | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO With the broad release of Google Assistant last week, the voice-assistant wars are in full swing, with Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and now Alphabet Inc's Google all offering electronic assistants to take your commands. Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri's original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. "Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. "The only way to leapfrog today's limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them."

Read on for the iPad Pro 2's likely release date, specs, new features, design & UK price rumours. Latest: a new 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a bezel-free screen and no Home button has been predicted for an early-April unveiling, as part of the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus by David Price | 16 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the iPad Pro 2 be released in the UK (or whatever they call the next version of the iPad Pro for 2017)? And what new features will be added to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads? The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and equipped with a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the new iPad Pro 2 for 2017, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models for 2017, as well as our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. Check back regularly for the latest iPad Pro 2 rumours. Updated, 14 March 2017, with analyst predictions of new Apple announcements between 20 and 24 March; on 9 Mar, with predictions that the iPad Pro 2 will have an A10X processor, up to 6GB of RAM and a MacBook Pro-style 'Touch Bar' feature; and previously with rumours about a possible iPad Pro 2 delay, and a stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro with a 10.5in screen, a dual-lens camera and a new 'wine' colour option. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK When will the iPad Pro 2 come out? Late March 2017 still seems a good bet, although it could be slightly later. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) "Reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors claim that Apple will announce new products in late March 2017, with the most likely dates between 20 and 24 March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, do not specify the products Apple will unveil, or even that there will be a press event to accompany the announcements; indeed, given the imminence of those dates time is starting to run out for one. (Apple generally sends out invitations about 10 days ahead of an event.) It's possible that Apple will quietly send out a press release and update its online stores; or maybe it will be a last-minute thing. DigiTimes, meanwhile, quotes "Taiwan-based supply chain makers" who say production of the planned 10.5-inch iPad has been brought forward to March (from a previously planned May-June schedule) and will be unveiled at an event in early April. This event will mark the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus, the site says. (Apple has announced that Apple Park will open in April 2017, although work on the headquarters will continue for some time afterwards.)  In January 2017 the Chinese-language site Wei Feng reported a rumour from Apple's Asian supply-chain, which claimed the iPad Pro 2 would launch in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," the site reports, as interpreted by Google Chrome's built-in translation. Then in February, new reports emerged from Japanese website Mac Otakara that backed up the claims at the iPad Pro 2 would arrive in March, also suggesting that there would be a new 7.9in iPad Pro, 9.7in iPad Pro, 10.5in iPad Pro and a 12.9in iPad Pro. During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until spring 2017. March is generally when Apple holds its first event of the year. However, DigiTimes believes Apple will delay the release date of some 2017 iPads: namely the new 10.5in iPad, which we go into detail about below, and the iPad Pro 2. The site claims that Apple will announce the iPad Pro 2, along with a the 10.5in iPad and a cheaper 9.7in iPad to replace the iPad Air 2, at an event in March. While the new 9.7in iPad should ship fairly soon after the announcement, sources claim the iPad Pro 2 and 10.5in iPad won't be released until May or June. Time will tell, and we'll keep you in the loop. One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Both theories have downsides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch together) in March 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. Then again, the company would have been in almost as tricky a position if it did a full refresh in September, presumably upsetting a bunch of people who just bought new devices. Three major iPad updates in the space of 12 months might just be taking the mickey. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours Will Apple launch a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro? The latest rumours suggest that after the lack of an iPad Pro update in autumn 2016, Apple will make up for this in 2017 by launching an entirely new size of iPad. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch regular iPad and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three other iPads, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus means Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. Ming-Chi Kuo has reiterated his prediction in a January 2017 report, once again claiming that new iPad models for Q2 2017 will be 12.9-inch, 10-10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch.  He notes that the 12.9-inch model will be "the second generation of the existing 12.9" iPad Pro," that the new in-between size will be "the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design," and that the 9.7-inch model will be "the low-priced option." The first two will run on a new A10X chip, with the latter on an A9 chip. With that in mind, it looks like the likeliest outcome would be for the 12.9-inch model to be a new iPad Pro 2, the 10-10.5-inch model to be a smaller Pro, and the lower-price 9.7-inch model simply branded as the iPad. Once again, there was no mention of a successor to the 7.9-inch mini, adding fuel to the speculation that it will be phased out by Apple - unless it plans to stick the 'mini' name on the 9.7-inch model. Kuo also notes that while he expects another decline in the volume of iPads shipped in 2017 - down to 35-37 million - this is set to be a smaller decline than seen in 2016, and will be offset by a rise in the average selling price of the devices, leading him to conclude that the "worst has passed for Apple's iPad." Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. What design changes will we see in the iPad Pro 2? Let's talk next about the iPad Pro 2's design. Apple Pencil changes Mac Observer has reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. This rumour was backed up in January 2017, when a report by the Czech-language website LetemSvetemApplem also claimed that magnets will enable you to attach the Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pro 2, citing "information directly from suppliers in China". The site also predicts that the next Apple Pencil will have a clip on the side, like a pen, which would stop it from rolling away across the nearest table - and also mean you can clip it to your pocket. Read more: Apple Pencil 2 rumours Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working exclusively on tablets presently seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. 'Touch Bar' menu bar An odd but increasingly widespread rumour proposes that the iPhone 8 will feature a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Now the rumour has mutated - apparently the iPad Pro 2 is going to get a Touch Bar function area too! It's not an immediately compelling concept, given that the Touch Bar on the MacBook offers a mini touchscreen strip between the non-touch-sensitive main screen and non-customisable keyboard - a sort of overlap between the two - so you don't need to reach up to use a full touchscreen and get tired arms, but on iPhone/iPad there's no such compromise to be made. The entire screen is accessible, and this would appear to be a reduction in functionality compared to a full-chassis conventional touchscreen. The thinking seems to be that this will take the place of the Home button and lower bezel area of the iPad, replacing these with a customisable touch-sensitive area that will ordinarily be occupied by frequently used menus and icons. What isn't clear is whether this area will be accessible when viewing photos and videos full screen. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. What tech specs will the iPad Pro 2 include? Let's look next at the internal changes expected from the next iPad. Processor This is an easy one. We strongly expect the iPad Pro 2 to include a modified version of the A10 Fusion chip featured in the iPhone 7 - a strategy Apple usually follows with the iPad it releases shortly after a new iPhone. This modified processor will probably be called the A10X, or A10X Fusion. The Chinese-language site Anzhuo agrees, predicting "iPad Pro 2 will be equipped with A10X chip". RAM The iPad Pro came with 2GB of RAM (in the case of the 9.7-inch model) or 4GB (on the 12.90-inch version). We're fairly sure Apple will offer 4GB across the iPad Pro 2 range, but some believe it might be more generous. Anzhuo, in the same article linked above, thinks we can expect 4GB and 6GB options - matched presumably to the medium and large-screen models, although the site doesn't specify this. Leaked photos, videos and concept illustrations of the iPad Pro 2 This is where we will post the best and most convincing leaked photos and concept designs and videos created by artists and designers. Still from iPad Pro 2 concept video Concept video of iPad Pro 2 We'll start with this stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro 2 in all its (imagined) glory. The iPad depicted here has a 10.5-inch, 4K screen and a dual-lens rear-facing camera, and comes in six colours: adding white, purple ('wine'), and the black and Jet Black options from the iPhone 7 to the currently available gold and Rose Gold. Photos of iPad Pro 2 AppleInsider has published two photos ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, which were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article. Our iPad Pro 2 new features wishlist The iPad Pro tablets are great, but they're not perfect. Here are a few new features and design tweaks we'd like to see in the second-gen iPad Pro. Bring the 9.7in Pro's new features across to the 12.9in model An issue we've addressed several times across this article concerns the disappointment felt by a number of 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners when the cheaper and in many respects better 9.7-inch iPad Pro was launched six months later. So the first thing we'd ask for is consistency. To achieve this the larger Pro model needs to get: A 12-megapixel rear-facing camera (up from 8Mp) A 5Mp front-facing camera (up from 1.2Mp) 4K video recording Live Photos Display with True Tone and 'wide colour' A 32GB cellular buying option A pink colour option Better keyboard accessory (for 9.7-inch model) The Pros are explicitly aimed at business users, and for this reason it was critical to get some good keyboard accessories. Apple's own Smart Keyboard is a strong offering in the larger size - even though it's expensive, and Macworld is divided on the issue of whether Logitech's less attractive Create keyboard offers a better typing experience - but the 9.7-inch version is a different matter. As a result of the smaller keys typing accuracy is weaker; the lower weight means it feels less satisfying under the fingers. (The design looks great, however, and is magnificently slim and light from a portability point of view. And the Smart Connector - and the fact that you never have to worry about battery life - is wonderful too.) We feel that Apple needs to create - or persuade a third-party accessory maker to create - a 9.7-inch keyboard you can really type on. And this may involve some compromises. It may need to have a foldout design (sounds ugly, right?) so that it could fit in larger keys. It might need to be heavier (thereby reducing portability) in order to feel better and reduce movement on the desk. But whatever happens, the smaller Pro needs an updated accessory line-up in order to compete as a business tool. Read next: Best iPad keyboards More (smaller) Home screen icons This is a software change rather than a hardware one, but it's frustrating that Apple doesn't allow you to fit more app icons on the screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At present you're allowed 20 app icons (or folders), plus up to six in the Dock, and this is exactly the same that you're allowed on the 9.7-inch iPads, which feels like a waste of the extra space. By default, the icons are the same size, so there's far more empty space on the screen. You can select a zoom view, with larger icons, but we'd prefer the option to have a grid of 5x6 icons, plus a seventh icon in the Dock. iOS 10 We expect the new iPad Pro 2 to ship with iOS 10 pre-installed. Apple's latest mobile operating system brought more than 100 new and updated features. However, no special iPad-only features that have yet been announced or discovered on iOS 10 - so we hope Apple will address this during their March 2017 presentation. iOS 11 will come out in autumn 2017; if the iPad Pro 2 doesn't come out until then - which would be a disappointment, frankly - then it will come with that OS preinstalled instead. Processor We expect the iPad Pro 2 to be shipped with the A10X, a variant on the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumours suggest the A10X will be an upgraded A9X built on a smaller FinFET technology. This would point towards a release date of spring 2017, with a new 10nm processor included within the iPad Pro 2. Might we also see 4K (3840x2160) recording abilities? Some rumours suggest that the feature will be integrated within the OS, as the likes of the nVidia and AMD mobile-generation graphics cards might make an appearance within the iPad Pro 2.  Design & display There are certain rumours suggesting that the iPad Pro 2 will feature an OLED or a flexible AMOLED display. Both are possibilities, but it's unlikely Apple will change their display manufacturing process. Nevertheless, it's a speculation some have - as Apple is losing its market share in the tablet industry and with ever growing competition, analysts predict Apple needs to react in a drastic fashion to interest consumers to stay or switch to an Apple product. Some say that the next iPad Pro 2 will feature a borderless design, providing a much better user experience and again, a more unique tablet in the market.  It's also rumoured that the new 12.9in iPad will be 0.3mm thicker, which would be a surprise - especially if it adds better battery life. Through this rumour by Japanese site Makotakara (spotted by 9to5Mac), we could see various design changes, such as the removal of the famous home button - not only on the iPad, but also on the upcoming iPhone 8.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Turn Your Wired Headphones Wireless With This Tool ProPK Staff 1 week ago As Apple also moves towards a “jack-less headphone” future with the introduction of the iPhone 7, more and more users are concerned about the way they will keep track of their headphones. Furthermore, even before Apple’s iPhone started this, popular Android phone makers Like Motorola had already started ditching the headphone jack in favor of Bluetooth and USB Type-C headphones. Now come every phone announcement, users are worried whether their beloved headphone jack would still be there or not. However, consumers need not be concerned about this anymore since the company, Podo Labs, has made a new device that connects your headphones to it with wires and to your phones via Bluetooth. Thus a wireless connection is created with your phones. The “Jack” For Your Phone The device, “Jack,” is very simple to use and smaller than a credit card but packed with plenty of features. Any type of headphones can be plugged into this device and paired with your smartphone via Bluetooth. The device is clip-on so its quite easy to just attach it to your shirt, bags, or even to just put it in the pocket. There are some other pretty nifty features the Jack brings to the table: It can also act as a Bluetooth adapter for speakers, turning them into wireless ones so you can share music to your speakers without connecting your devices to your speakers. If your car only has an auxiliary 3.5mm port, this gadget can help your car music go wireless. An even more interesting use-case is that you can connect Jack to your TV’s audio jack and stream audio over your Bluetooth headphones without disturbing anyone else in the room. And if you have two of these, you can use standard headphones as well. You can share music wirelessly with your friends who Jack. Its as simple as pressing the share button and you can let your friends stream your music without any delay. Jack can be connected to two devices simultaneously and audio can be switched from one of those two to the other one on the go. Podo Labs says the Jack supports Bluetooth’s “aptX” technology, which can “CD quality” music over Bluetooth. The battery life for this device is pretty good too, it can last 12 hours on average on a full charge. Backed by Funded Today and Kickstarter Podo Labs is currently trying to raise money for “Jack” by partnering up with Funded Today for more backers than they will receive at only Kickstarter, which is also where they are trying to get funding from. The introduction of the device into this market has been met with great enthusiasm and the Kickstarter campaign has already managed to gather more money than the goal the company had set out. “Jack” is a great device for all those people who want to keep using their wired headphones rather than shift to the alternative headphones that Apple introduced with the iPhone 7. Price Price is currently set at $29 for a single pre-order of Jack. If you are willing to pay $49, you can get two Jacks or one Jack with a set of premium headphones and a carrying case. Similarly, the more you’re willing to pay the more gadgets you get. When the gadget goes on retail after the campaign, the price is set at $40. You can get more info on the price and Jack at its kickstarter page here. Shipping to all countries including Pakistan is available.

BREAKING: Julian Assange: WikiLeaks has decided to give details of CIA hacking tools to tech companies . — The Associated Press (@AP) March 9, 2017 The WSJ reports that Apple engineers are working to address the remaining iOS exploits reportedly used by the CIA, but they and other tech companies are being hampered by two factors. The first is lack of any access to the code itself. Apple engineers quickly began calling colleagues to bring them up to speed on the data dump and to coordinate the company’s response to this new security threat, according to a person familiar with the situation […] Companies now find themselves in a difficult position: They believe that at least two organizations have access to hacking code that exploits their products — the CIA and WikiLeaks — but neither one is sharing this software … Anker braided Lightning cables Cisco – whose devices were also targeted – says that this severely limits the ability of engineers to plug the holes described in the documents. Cisco, which makes routers and other internet equipment, said that without more information on the exact tools and malware involved, “the scope of action that can be taken […] is limited.” One possibility is that the leaks may force the government to disclose the vulnerabilities to tech companies through the Vulnerability Equities Process, but even if this happens, it is likely to take considerable time. Officials are discussing whether to use that process to disclose more information about the issues described in the documents released by WikiLeaks, but that is likely to involve a lengthy interagency review, said one person familiar with the situation. The second challenge is that the vulnerabilities described to date may be just the tip of the iceberg. It has been claimed that the 8,761 documents so far released by Wikileaks amounts to just 1% of the material it holds – meaning that a great many additional vulnerabilities exist. It’s a scenario that could very well repeat itself again if WikiLeaks discloses new secrets allegedly taken from the CIA. The group says that it has now disclosed just 1% of the documents in its possession. “If it is the case that they have so much more, that, I think, will have a lot of people quite nervous,” said Thomas Rid, a professor of security studies with King’s College London. Apple said on Tuesday that ‘many’ of the exploits described in the first data dump had already been patched, but did not give any indication of the approximate percentage. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue to work rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. Google issued a statement using similar wording to Apple, stating that it was confident that ‘many’ of the vulnerabilities have already been addressed.

Linux Foundation on Vault 7: Frequent Security Updates Protect Linux Users GO Getting lots of security updates means Linux likely patched all those vulnerabilities the CIA discovered Mar 9, 2017 13:20 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  The Linux Foundation has come out to speak about the Vault 7 revelations via WikiLeaks regarding CIA's hacking powers which extend to Linux devices, claiming that thanks to the open-source nature of Linux, the operating system is constantly updated with new security fixes, likely covering all those vulnerabilities the CIA may have discovered and exploited.  "Linux is a very widely used operating system, with a huge installed base all around the world, so it is not surprising that state agencies from many countries would target Linux along with the many closed source platforms that they have sought to compromise," Nicko van Someren, CTO at the Linux Foundation, told the Inquirer. "Linux is an incredibly active open source project. Thousands of professional developers and volunteers - including many of the most talented in the world - are constantly contributing improvements and fixes to the project. This allows the kernel team to release updates every few days - one of the fastest release cycles in the industry. Rapid release cycles enable the open source community to fix vulnerabilities and release those fixes to users fasters," he added. Apple has likely fixed everything too Linux isn't the only company to come up with a response to the WikiLeaks trove of documents regarding the CIA's hacking tools. Apple has also come forward saying that it has fixed many of the vulnerabilities referenced in the Wiki files. Apple's spokesperson expresses the company's commitment to safeguarding their customers' privacy and security. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates," the company said. Apple added that about 80% of users are running the latest version of iOS, so they should be quite protected. Unless, of course, CIA found another zero-day vulnerability in there too, or one that was left unpatched because Apple didn't know about it. That, however, is the problem with just about any type of software. The documents exposed by WikiLeaks include charts detailing iOS exploits that would allow the CIA to turn iPhones into spying gear and, in some cases, to even control the devices. According to the same files, the CIA developed some of the exploits, while others were purchased or copied. The same was done in regards to Android vulnerabilities, which Google addressed already.  By opening Vault 7, WikiLeaks tried to shock the world with what the CIA can do and how extensive its operations are. However, that's the CIA's job so it shouldn't really surprise anyone that it has developed malware and viruses and exploits based on zero-day vulnerabilities to get the job done. What should upset everyone, however, is that they've taken advantage of these zero-day vulnerabilities instead of informing tech companies about them in order to protect billions of users, something they've been asked repeatedly. After all, if the CIA hackers could find the bug, others could too and those individuals may not be after tapping the phone of a few select targets. #Linux#WikiLeaks#Vault7#Apple subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news WikiLeaks Opens Vault 7: CIA's Entire Hacking Capacity Macs Targeted by Xagent Malware Linked to Russian Team That Hacked DNC Ransomware Attacks Shift Towards Businesses Cryptkeeper Linux Encryption App Fails at Job, Has One Letter Skeleton Key - "P" Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Linux users should be safe thanks to frequent updates Related Apps Passware Encryption Analyzer: Seamlessly find all password-protected files on your computer and find out how to overcome their encryption with this application Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic: A complete password recovery and e-discovery solution that can help you decrypt and obtain passwords from almost any file and website Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Bitcoin Password: This easy to use application can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet password by using customizable dictionary, brute force or mixed attacks GridinSoft Anti-Malware: Scan your computer for malware and dangerous files, adware and other malicious components with the help of this intuitive application Passware Password Recovery Kit Basic: A fast and efficient password recovery software that can reveal email, Internet and network passwords and decrypt documents altogether Adlice PEViewer: Analyze the structure of running processes and executable files on your computer to detect potentially dangerous activity on your system Reader comments The Fappening 2.0 Is Starting: Emma Watson, Amanda Seyfried Photos Dumped Online more on: The Fappening i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 9, 2017 at 7:30AM In 2015, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus series of smartphones. The unique selling point for those devices at the time was the inclusion of 3D Touch functionality. 3D Touch, according to Apple, allows compatible devices to sense "how deeply users press the display." Developing this functionality was certainly non-trivial, and implementing it obviously increased the bill of materials of the iPhone 6s-series relative to the prior-generation iPhone 6-series devices. Image source: Apple. According to DigiTimes, which doesn't cite specific sources, the current 3D Touch solution, which is "glass based," costs about $9. The report then goes on to say that Apple's next-generation OLED-based iPhone will require a fundamentally different "thin film-based 3D touch sensor." That different sensor structure is expected to cost "over US$15," meaning that cost per device goes up by at least $6. Why the OLED iPhone will be so expensive The OLED iPhone that Apple is expected to release at some point soon is expected to be priced significantly higher than the standard iPhone models. Although some may view this as an Apple "money grab," the reality is that this new phone is likely to be much more expensive to manufacture than its non-OLED counterparts. The OLED displays themselves are likely to be more expensive than the LCDs that Apple uses in other devices, clearly the 3D Touch implementation will get more expensive, and I wouldn't be surprised if the industrial design of the OLED iPhone is just more expensive to build in general. These costs add up, which means that for Apple to simply maintain the same gross profit margin percentage on those devices as it does on its non-OLED iPhones, it needs to charge more. Customers will likely pay for value The bad news is that prices for something like an OLED iPhone are going to necessarily be higher than LCD-equipped iPhones. The good news, though, is that those cost-adders aren't being implemented just because Apple feels like making a more expensive phone -- these are features that Apple thinks customers are likely going to be willing to pay for. Apple already saw a mix shift up toward its iPhone 7 Plus from the iPhone 7 in the early innings of the iPhone 7-series product cycle, likely driven by the dual-camera functionality on the former. If camera functionality is enough to drive a meaningful mix shift up, then a better industrial design and superior display should be enough to drive a large portion of the iPhone customer base toward a relatively expensive iPhone. Segmentation will be key While I do think there will be many customers interested in -- and willing to pay a premium for -- a more expensive OLED-based iPhone, there will be individuals who can't or simply won't pay for all those extra features. For those customers, Apple still needs to put out compelling new products. Apple is rumored to be updating the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models with superior internals in what would be a typical "s" release. Simply updating the current-generation phones with better internals and features should drive the value proposition of those products up while keeping the price points the same. The point, though, is that Apple will need to be smart about how it segments its product lines -- it needs to continue to offer compelling products at familiar price points while exploiting the latent demand for higher-end, higher-priced, and ultimately more feature-rich iPhones. If Apple can pull that off, its iPhone business could be poised to enjoy significant revenue and profit growth in the coming product cycle -- and potentially beyond.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Even our communications with our spouses, with our clergy members, with our attorneys are not absolutely private in America […] There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach … Anker braided Lightning cables Comey argued that as a judge had the legal right ‘in appropriate circumstances’ to compel testimony from American citizens on any communication, the same principle should apply to electronic monitoring. The FBI director last year said that Apple should be legally compelled to created a weakened version of iOS dubbed ‘GovOS’ to allow the government to access iPhones. Apple fought a court order, resulting in a congressional hearing. While Comey initially argued that this would be a one-off in the San Bernardino shooting case, he later admitted that it would ‘likely’ set a precedent – and went on to say that further litigation was likely. Comey revealed that the FBI lawfully gained access to 2,800 devices in the last four months of 2016, but was unable to retrieve data from 43% of them. I’ve argued in the past that assurances of legal processes to determine when backdoors and master keys might be used and of no comfort given the inevitability of such tools getting into the wrong hands. Comey himself tacitly admitted as such when stating that he personally puts a piece of tape over the webcam on his laptop, and that his staff routinely use webcam covers. Only this week, Wikileaks released more than 8,000 documents in support of claims that the CIA had a hacking unit devoted to attacking iOS, Android, Windows and Samsung TVs – and that it had lost control of most of the malware it developed or bought.

The behind-the-scenes look appears amid claims that Apple has squandered its lead in the voice-assistant space, with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all advancing the features of their respective assistants recently. But for a smartphone market in which most sales are outside the U.S., Siri's big advantage over the other assistants is underlined in the number of languages it can speak. Microsoft is said to have an editorial team of 29 people who work to customize Cortana for local markets, while Google and Amazon say they plan to add more languages soon. But it's a game of catch-up: Apple already has 21 languages, localized for 36 countries. That compares favorably to Microsoft's Cortana (eight), Google Assistant (four), and Amazon's Alexa (two). At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half.Once the required amount of data has been gathered and a voice actor has recorded the Siri responses in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple believes will be the most common questions. Siri then learns more about what users ask, with additional tweaks made via updates every two weeks. The drawback to Apple's script-writing approach is that it does not scale, according to Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Oslo. "You can't hire enough writers to come up with the system you'd need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers," he told Reuters. "That's years off." But it's something the founders of Viv – Siri's original creators – are actively working on. "Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv, which was acquired by Samsung last year. "The only way to leapfrog today's limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them." Consumers should soon get a taste of how far they've come. Viv technology will power Bixby, Samsung's new virtual assistant, set to feature in the Galaxy S8, which launches at the end of this month.

Rating: 15 Votes Jnesbitt82 1 week ago The problem is, Siri isn't as capable as some of its competitors. In that regard, Siri has less to do. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Siri is able to master more languages over the fewer task that it can do. Hopefully, all of the R&D Apple has been doing and investing in these past few months will help Siri become what it was intended to be all along. Rating: 13 Votes vertical smile 1 week ago Siri's big advantage over the other assistants is underlined in the number of languages it can speak. So, Siri can use many different languages to refer the user to the internet for answers to simple questions/requests. This gets so annoying. I once thought Siri was a great feature that would only get better. Now it seems Siri hardly evolved over the years, and just make me frustrated with my iPhone. And, if you have only a bar of service, then it hardly works, but takes about 30 seconds to let you know it has a problem and try again later. Maybe it will get better.

In contrast, Google’s Assistant can only understand five languages and Alexa (popularized by the Amazon Echo) just two, English and German. iOS 10.3 is introducing another language, Shanghainese, extending its international advantage even more. In an interview with Reuters, Apple’s head of speech explains how Siri is taught to learn a whole new language … The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here Alex Acero currently leads the speech team at Apple, who joined the company in 2013. Siri voice recognition was once powered by Nuance, Apple replaced it a couple of a years ago with a custom-built in-house voice platform that relies heavily on machine learning to improve its understanding of words. In terms of picking up a new language, Acero explains that the process starts by bringing in real people who can speak the new language to read various paragraphs and word lists, spanning different dialects and accents. The human speech is recorded and transcribed by other humans. This forms a canonical representation of words and how they sound aloud, dictated by real people to ensure accuracy. This raw training data is then fed into an algorithmic machine training model. The computer language model attempts to predict the transcription of arbitrary strings of words. The algorithm can improve automatically over time as it is trained with more data. Apple will tune the data a little internally and then move onto the next step. Instead of jumping straight to Siri, Apple releases the new language as a feature of iOS and macOS dictation, available on the iPhone keyboard by pressing the microphone key next to the spacebar. This allows Apple to gain more speech samples (sent anonymously) from a much wider base of people. These real-world audio clips naturally incorporate background noise and non-perfect speech like coughing, pauses and slurring. Apple takes the samples and transcribes them by humans, then using this newly verified pairing of audio and text as more input data for the language model. The report says this secondary process cuts the dictation error rate in half. Apple repeats this procedure until it feels it has made the system accurate enough that is ready to roll out as a headline Siri feature. Separately, voice actors record speech sequences so that Siri can synthesize audio and perform text-to-speech with replies. The language is then released with a software update, just like how Shanghainese will be a part of iOS 10.3 and macOS 10.12.4. Siri is seeded with preset answers to the ‘most common queries’; this enables Siri to answer questions like ‘tell me a joke’. Questions like ‘find nearby restaurants’ are handled dynamically, of course. Eventually, artificial intelligence will be able to answer general conversational questions without the need for scripted database of human-written replies. That is not really possible today; Siri and all of its competitors currently rely on humans to write jokes and short answers. Acero says that Apple looks at what real-world users ask once Siri has been deployed in a new language and updates the database of human answers every two weeks.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / The iPhone 8 might not fill any stockings this Christmas The iPhone 8 might not fill any stockings this Christmas by Jamie Hinks 09 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments Apple fans could be forced to wait for the eagerly anticipated iPhone 10th anniversary edition due to a reported component shortage. One of the huge questions ahead of Apple’s official aunch is what form the iPhone 8 will take, with the latest reports claiming it will get a 3D camera. But it seems that camera component is exactly what is apparently causing the delay. STMicrelectronics, the Franco-Italian company responsible for the feature, is reportedly struggling to cope with the capacity required by Apple. Related: iPhone 7 review Specifically, a lack of “laser time imagers” is holding up production of the 3D imaging component inside the shiny new Apple handset. What's more, the delay will reportedly last "months" not weeks. At this rate it could be a struggle to get the iPhone 7 successor out before Christmas. Apple is said to be planning on unveiling not two, but three iPhone models later this year, and the anniversary edition is the most intriguing by some way. It will hit the market alongside the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, costing as much as $1,000 if reports are to be believed, and for that price a 3D camera is the least we can expect. Given that it doesn’t even have a name yet, the production facilities will need to start burning the midnight oil soon to get the iPhone 8/X/Edition out this year. Come September we will have a better idea about what exactly Apple has in-store, so stay tuned. Watch: What we know about the iPhone 8 Which of the new iPhone models are you going to buy?

Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict words sequences.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Technology News | Thu Mar 9, 2017 | 11:00am EST Apple's Siri learns Shanghainese as voice assistants race to cover languages A woman speaks on her iPhone as she walks on a busy street in downtown Shanghai. REUTERS/Aly Song By Stephen Nellis | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO With the broad release of Google Assistant last week, the voice-assistant wars are in full swing, with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and now Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google all offering electronic assistants to take your commands. Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks.

"Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. "The only way to leapfrog today's limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them." (Story corrects "language model" in paragraph 10 to "acoustic model".)

Posted: March 9, 2017 4:08 a.m. FILE - This Feb. 19, 2014, file photo, shows WhatsApp and Facebook app icons on a smartphone in New York. So, you use messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal or have smart TVs and PCs. Should you worry that the CIA is listening to your conversations? The short answer is no. The long answer is maybe, but it’s unlikely. Revelations by WikiLeaks describing secret CIA hacking tools the government uses to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs, if true, could certainly have real-life implications for anyone who uses internet-connected technology.(AP Photo/Patrick Sison, File) FILE - This April 13, 2016, file photo shows the seal of the Central Intelligence Agency at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. An alleged CIA surveillance program disclosed by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, March 7, 2017, purportedly targeted security weaknesses in smart TVs, smartphones, personal computers and even cars, and enabled snooping that could circumvent encryption on communications apps such as Facebook’s WhatsApp. WikiLeaks is, for now, withholding details on the specific hacks used. But WikiLeaks claims that the data and documents it obtained reveal a broad program to bypass security measures on everyday products. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) By TED BRIDIS, RAPHAEL SATTER and JACK GILLUM Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — The anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks raised the prospect Wednesday of sharing sensitive details it uncovered about CIA hacking tools with leading technology companies whose flagship products and services were targeted by the government’s hacker-spies. If that sharing should take place, the unusual cooperation would give companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and others an opportunity to identify and repair any flaws in their software and devices that were being exploited by U.S. spy agencies and some foreign allies, as described in nearly 9,000 pages of secret CIA files WikiLeaks published on Tuesday. The documents, which the White House declined anew Wednesday to confirm as authentic, describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features for computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs. They include the world’s most popular technology platforms, including Apple’s iPhones and iPads, Google’s Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. “This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. “This alleged leak should concern every single American.” Spicer defended then-candidate Donald Trump’s comment in October 2016 — “I love WikiLeaks!” — after it published during the presidential campaign private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. Spicer said there was a “massive, massive difference” between WikiLeaks publishing stolen, personal emails of a political figure and files about national security tools used by the CIA. The CIA has declined to confirm that the documents are authentic. But on Wednesday, the agency said Americans should be “deeply troubled” by the disclosures. WikiLeaks has not released the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. The group indicated it was still considering its options but said in a statement Wednesday: “Tech companies are saying they need more details of CIA attack techniques to fix them faster. Should WikiLeaks work directly with them?” It wasn’t clear whether WikiLeaks — a strident critic of Google and Facebook, among others — was serious about such action. A message seeking additional details from WikiLeaks was not immediately returned, and an attempt to speak to founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on Tuesday was rebuffed. Security experts said WikiLeaks was obligated to work privately with technology companies to disclose previously unknown software flaws, known as zero-day vulnerabilities because consumers would have no time to discover how to defend themselves against their use, and with companies that design protection software. WikiLeaks has said the latest files apparently have been circulating among former U.S. government hackers and contractors. “The clear move is to notify vendors,” said Chris Wysopal, co-founder and chief technology officer of Veracode Inc. “If WikiLeaks has this data then it’s likely others have this data, too. The binaries and source code that contain zero days should be shared with people who build detection and signatures for a living.” The political fallout and damage to U.S. intelligence operations was still being assessed. The former head of the CIA and National Security Agency, Michael Hayden, sought to assure people the U.S. would use such cyber weapons only against foreign targets. “I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American,” Hayden said Tuesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “But there are people out there that you want us to spy on. You want us to have the ability to actually turn on that listening device inside the TV, to learn that person’s intentions.” One clear risk is that WikiLeaks revealed enough details to give foreign governments better opportunities to trace any of the sophisticated hacking tools they might discover back to the CIA, damaging the ability to disguise a U.S. government hacker’s involvement. “That’s a huge problem,” said Adriel T. Desautels, the chief executive at Netragard LLC, which formerly sold zero-day exploits to governments and companies. “Our capabilities are now diminished.” Some vendors were already sifting through the disclosures to fix flaws in their software. The first confirmed patch came from Avira Operations GmbH & Co., a German antivirus vendor, which told The Associated Press it fixed what it described as “a minor vulnerability” within a few hours of the WikiLeaks release. Apple said many of its security vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks were already fixed. In a statement late Tuesday, it said its initial analysis showed that the latest version of the iOS system software for iPhones and iPads fixed many of those flaws. Apple said it will “continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.” Google hasn’t commented yet. The WikiLeaks disclosures were an extraordinary coup for a group that has already rocked American diplomacy with the release of 250,000 State Department cables, embarrassed the U.S. military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and upended the U.S. presidential election by publishing Democratic Party emails. The new releases are all the more remarkable given that WikiLeaks’ founder Assange is midway through his fifth year at the Ecuadorean Embassy. He received political asylum after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for an allegation of rape. Last year, a United Nations panel declared that the U.K. and Sweden were detaining him arbitrarily, but there’s no suggestion that Swedish or British authorities will budge on their desire to detain and extradite him. Meanwhile, the upcoming second round of Ecuador’s presidential contest may mean Assange’s welcome at the embassy is wearing thin. The front-runner in the race, Guillermo Lasso, has said he would evict Assange, an action Assange says could eventually lead to his extradition to the United States. ——— Satter reported from Paris.

But will it ever make money? By Emily Bary March 7, 2017 6:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Spotify has built a sizeable lead over Apple in the world of streaming music. Photo: Jason Davis/Getty Images Apple, the pioneer in selling digital music, has clearly met its match when it comes to streaming. Last week, Spotify announced it had reached 50 million paid streaming subscribers. That’s more than double Apple’s base for its newer streaming service called Apple Music. And while streaming seems to be offsetting much of the revenue lost to disappearing CD sales, it’s still not clear that it’s good business. More from Barron’s Next Key Executive Calls Pandora ’Overvalued’ What Warren Buffett Learned About the iPhone at Dairy Queen When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get The Cheapest Fare One notable media executive had some harsh words for streaming music services during a speech at a Deutsche Bank investor conference on Monday. “We think it’s a very unattractive business,” said Liberty Media CEO Greg Maffei, noting the high cost of music rights. “You’ve seen that with Spotify now with 50 million users [and] still not profitable.” Granted, Maffei has a horse in the ring. His company controls Sirius XM Holdings, the satellite-radio business, and streaming music isn’t exactly good for radio. (Though Liberty has been floated as a potential buyer of Pandora Media, Maffei said Monday that such a scenario was “unlikely” to happen.) In the end, Spotify might end up being the more attractive takeover candidate among streaming-music companies, according to one Wall Street analyst. “Stop thinking about Spotify as a music service and start thinking about it as a media platform that simply started with music, but has the potential to be so much more,” BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield wrote last week. “Homescreen-worthy apps like Spotify that are sustainably used daily, let alone hourly, are nearly impossible to create,” he added. Greenfield sees the potential for Spotify to become a platform where other companies can push add-on services, much the way Amazon.com allows users to buy subscriptions to Showtime and HBO through Prime Video. Big Picture: Spotify is lapping Apple when it comes to streaming music, but the win comes at a high cost.

March 09, 2017 04:39 PM WASHINGTON (AP) — WikiLeaks will work with technology companies to help defend them against the CIA's hacking tools, founder Julian Assange said Thursday. The move sets up a potential conflict between Silicon Valley firms eager to protect their products and an intelligence agency stung by the radical transparency group's disclosures. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he purportedly revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. Advertisement – Content Continues Below "We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as "cyberweapons" would be published to the world "once this material is effectively disarmed by us." The CIA did not respond directly to Assange's offer, but it appeared to take a dim view of the announcement. "As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said, adding that the CIA's work would continue "despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk." Assange had plenty of criticism for the agency himself, blasting it for having lost control of its "entire cyberweapons arsenal," something he described as "a historic act of devastating incompetence." The fate of the arsenal is not completely clear. WikiLeaks has not released the actual digital espionage tools themselves, just documentation related to them which describe in various levels of detail how the CIA bypasses anti-viruses, hacks into smartphones and even hijacks smart TVs. Assange has not explicitly said how he knows that the arsenal is circulating or even that he has a full copy. Assange did offer some hints, suggesting that spies, former intelligence officials and contractors had been sharing the cyberespionage tools behind the CIA's back — potentially to feed the for-profit market in spy software. "WikiLeaks discovered the material as a result of it being passed around a number of different members of the U.S. intelligence community, out of control, in an unauthorized fashion," Assange said. "It looks like not only is that material being spread around contractors and former American computer hackers for hire, but now may be in the black market." If true, that would be a serious concern for ordinary internet users. There are already signs that international law enforcement is worried. Europol's chief Rob Wainwright told The Associated Press that the CIA breach could provide "a handy how-to-do hacking manual" for nefarious actors of all stripes. "There is a potential here for a much more widespread impact in the way that it might fuel an increase in cybercriminal activity," he said. Assange said the CIA breach showed that this kind of technology was nearly impossible to keep under wraps — or under control. "The technology is designed to be unaccountable, untraceable; it's designed to remove traces of its activity," he said. The probability of Assange being taken up on his offer is uncertain. Some of the alleged CIA cyberespionage tools disclosed by WikiLeaks are obsolete, meaning that his help may not be needed in many cases. Even in the case of live vulnerabilities it's not clear how Assange's offer would be seen by American companies or how the mechanics of such a collaboration might work given the CIA's hostility. Even under normal circumstances, the process of flagging software flaws to technology companies can be fraught. "When vendors receive information about a vulnerability, they look at it from a political perspective," said Adriel T. Desautels, the chief executive at Netragard LLC. "Especially with highly complex ones, they can sit in the hands of a vendor for years, two to three years, until they receive external pressure to move on something." Assange appeared to nod to those concerns in his conference, saying it was up to the public to demand that companies moved quickly on WikiLeaks' offer. "It is important to put pressure on those companies," he said. ___ Satter reported from Paris. Associated Press Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that purported CIA tools are not aimed at "defeating encryption" but at hijacking computers.

WikiLeaks' CIA hacking dump shakes tech firms By Reuters Frankfurt, 9 Mar 2017 Read in this story Stay of execution The leaked documents list a wealth of security attacks on smartphones. Tech companies must rapidly step up information-sharing to protect users from prying eyes, a security software executive said yesterday after WikiLeaks released a trove of data purporting to show the CIA can hack all manner of devices. Dozens of firms rushed to contain the damage from possible security weak points following the anti-secrecy organisation's revelations, although some said they needed far more information on what the US intelligence agency was up to before they could thwart suspected but previously hidden attacks. Sinan Eren, vice-president of Czech anti-virus software maker Avast, called on mobile software makers Apple and Google to supply security firms with privileged access to their devices to offer immediate fixes to known bugs. "We can prevent attacks in real-time if we are given the hooks into the mobile operating system," Eren said in a phone interview from Silicon Valley, where he is located. "If we can drive a paradigm shift where mobile platforms don't shut off access, we'll be better able to detect when hackers are hiding in a mobile [phone]," he said.   See also WikiLeaks releases files on CIA cyber spying tools Turkey blocks WikiLeaks after mass e-mail leak WikiLeaks CIAAvast, which counts more than 400 million users of its anti-virus software worldwide, was named in the WikiLeaks documents as one of the security vendors targeted by the CIA in a leaked page labelled "secret" but lacking further details. The leaks – which WikiLeaks described as the biggest in the Central Intelligence Agency's history – had enough technical details for security experts and product vendors to recognise that widespread compromises exist. However, they provided few specifics needed to offer quick fixes. Reuters could not immediately verify the validity of the published documents, but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials appeared to be legitimate. The 8 761 leaked documents list a wealth of security attacks on Apple and Google Android smartphones carried by billions of consumers, as well as top computer operating systems – Windows, Linux and Apple Mac – and six of the world's main Web browsers. Apple said in a statement that nearly 80% of iPhone users run its current iOS software with the latest security patches. "Many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS; we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," Apple said on Tuesday. The statement made no reference to attacks on its computer software. Google declined to comment, while a Microsoft spokeswoman said: "We're aware of the report and are looking into it." Widely-used routers from Silicon Valley-based Cisco were listed as targets, as were those supplied by Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE and Taiwanese supplier Zyxel for their devices used in China and Pakistan. Cisco security team members said in a blog post that because WikiLeaks has not released any of the actual hacking exploits, "the scope of action that can be taken by Cisco is limited". Omar Santos, a principal engineer in Cisco's security response unit, said malware appears to be targeting whole families of Cisco devices but is designed to remain hidden so as to steal data unnoticed. He said Cisco assumes WikiLeaks will eventually disclose the hacks, allowing it to fix them. Huawei declined to comment. ZTE and Zyxel were not immediately available to respond. Stay of execution Messaging apps protected by full software encryption also appear to be vulnerable to hacking of the smartphones themselves, communications app provider Telegram said in a blog post. But one positive outcome may be that device and software makers will be able to close up these holes, it said. "This is not an app issue. It is relevant on the level of devices and operating systems like iOS and Android," Telegram stated, adding: "The good news is that for the moment all of this is irrelevant for the majority of Telegram users. If the CIA is not on your back, you shouldn't start worrying just yet." The WikiLeaks collection contains a mix of copious data and empty files marked "secret" that promised more details to come on attacks against more than 15 security software firms. US cyber security expert Robert Graham said WikiLeaks provided enough detail to recognise some known vulnerabilities. "One anti-virus researcher has told me that a virus they once suspected came from the Russians or Chinese can now be attributed to the CIA, as it matches the description perfectly to something in the leak," Graham said in a blog post. Some security experts said the CIA's possible use of tools from other spy agencies raised the risk of false attribution for targeted cyber attacks by the US intelligence agency. He said CIA cyber spying efforts could be set back years. The CIA and White House declined to comment. "We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents," CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. WikiLeaks said it aims to provoke a political and legal debate about the CIA's cyber arsenal. However, it was holding back, for now, much of the technical documentation that would allow other hackers and cyber criminals to exploit the hacks, while putting vendors on notice to expect further revelations. The organisation said in a statement it is "avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyber weapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's programme and how such 'weapons' should be analysed, disarmed and published". It described sophisticated tools for targeting the devices of individual users, in contrast to the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden of mass data collection on millions of Web and phone users worldwide.

Republican leaders wanted to push their measure through two House committees by week’s end — Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce. But they hit a torrent of resistance from Democrats who oppose the seven-year GOP effort to unravel former President Barack Obama’s health care law. Outnumbered Democrats used the panels’ sessions for political messaging Wednesday, futilely offering amendments aimed at preventing the bill from raising deficits, kicking people off coverage or boosting consumer’s out-of-pocket costs. They even tried, unsuccessfully, to insert language pressuring President Donald Trump to release his income tax returns. The pivotal challenge for Republican leaders was coming not from Democrats but from rebellion in their own ranks and potent outside groups. If that upheaval should snowball and crush the legislation, it would be a shattering defeat for Trump and the GOP, so leaders were hoping passage by both House committees this week would bolster them with momentum. Just as ominous as GOP unrest was hostility from three organizations instrumental in the 2010 enactment of Obama’s overhaul: The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and AARP, the nation’s largest advocacy group for older people. ___ Will WikiLeaks work with tech firms to defeat CIA hacking? WASHINGTON (AP) — The anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks raised the prospect Wednesday of sharing sensitive details it uncovered about CIA hacking tools with leading technology companies whose flagship products and services were targeted by the government’s hacker-spies. If that sharing should take place, the unusual cooperation would give companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and others an opportunity to identify and repair any flaws in their software and devices that were being exploited by U.S. spy agencies and some foreign allies, as described in nearly 9,000 pages of secret CIA files WikiLeaks published on Tuesday. The documents, which the White House declined anew Wednesday to confirm as authentic, describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features for computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs. They include the world’s most popular technology platforms, including Apple’s iPhones and iPads, Google’s Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. “This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. “This alleged leak should concern every single American.” Spicer defended then-candidate Donald Trump’s comment in October 2016 — “I love WikiLeaks!” — after it published during the presidential campaign private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager. Spicer said there was a “massive, massive difference” between WikiLeaks publishing stolen, personal emails of a political figure and files about national security tools used by the CIA. ___ Women go on strike in US to show their economic clout PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Many American women stayed home from work, joined rallies or wore red Wednesday to demonstrate how vital they are to the U.S. economy, as International Women’s Day was observed with a multitude of events around the world. The Day Without a Woman protest in the U.S. was put together by organizers of the vast women’s marches that drew more than 1 million Americans the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The turnout on the streets this time was much smaller in many places, with crowds often numbering in the hundreds. There were no immediate estimates of how many women heeded the call to skip work. “Trump is terrifying. His entire administration, they have no respect for women or our rights,” said 49-year-old Adina Ferber, who took a vacation day from her job at an art gallery to attend a demonstration in New York City. “They need to deal with us as an economic force.” The U.S. event — inspired in part by the Day Without an Immigrant protest held last month — was part of the U.N.-designated International Women’s Day. ___ Probe sought after AP report on church abuse allegations A district attorney has asked the state to investigate two assistant prosecutors after an Associated Press story that quoted former congregants of a North Carolina church as saying the men derailed criminal probes into allegations of abuse by sect leaders. David Learner said Wednesday that he wants the State Bureau of Investigation to look into the accusations against his employees, who are members of the evangelical Word of Faith Fellowship church. The AP story, released Monday, cited nine former Word of Faith members who said Frank Webster and Chris Back provided legal advice, helped at strategy sessions and participated in a mock trial for four congregants charged with harassing a former member. The ex-congregants also said that Back and Webster, who is sect leader Jane Whaley’s son-in-law, helped derail a social services investigation into child abuse in 2015 and attended meetings where Whaley warned congregants to lie to investigators about abuse incidents. “This is long overdue,” said Rick Cooper, a U.S. Navy veteran who spent more than 20 years as a congregant at Word of Faith and raised nine children in the church. “I’m glad they’re finally taking this seriously.” ___ IS gunmen in white lab coats kill 30 in Kabul hospital KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Gunmen wearing white lab coats stormed a military hospital in Afghanistan’s capital on Wednesday, killing at least 30 people and wounding dozens in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. The attack on the 400-bed military facility, located near two civilian hospitals in Kabul’s heavily-guarded diplomatic quarter, set off clashes with security forces that lasted several hours. The brazen assault reflected the capability of militant groups in Afghanistan to stage large-scale and complex attacks in the heart of Kabul, underscoring the challenges the government continues to face to improve security for ordinary Afghans. Gen. Dawlat Waziri, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said there were “more than 30 killed and more than 50 wounded” in the attack. Afghan forces battled the attackers floor by floor, he added. The ministry said the attackers were dressed like health workers. According to Waziri, four gunmen were involved, including two suicide bombers who detonated their explosives vests once the group was inside the hospital. ___ In her words: Casey Anthony talks to AP about Caylee’s death WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Casey Anthony — the Florida woman accused, then acquitted, of killing her 2-year-old daughter — spoke with The Associated Press five times over a weeklong period. During the interviews, she talked about her love for her daughter, Caylee Marie, and showed photos of her and artwork she finger-painted. Anthony maintains her innocence in the death and insists she doesn’t know how the last hours of Caylee’s life unfolded. ___ THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: “You were convicted of one thing.” ANTHONY: “Lying to the cops. People lie to the cops every day. Cops lie to people every day; I’m just one of the unfortunate idiots who admitted that they lied. “ AP: “Was the lying out of panic?” ___ FBI’s Comey: ‘You’re stuck with me for another 6 1/2 years’ BOSTON (AP) — FBI Director James Comey said Wednesday he plans to serve his entire 10-year term, even as controversy swirls over his attempt to rebut President Donald Trump’s claim that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the election. “You’re stuck with me for another 6½ years,” Comey said during a cybersecurity conference at Boston College. Comey was appointed 3½ years ago by then-President Barack Obama. Controversy erupted last weekend after Trump tweeted that Obama had tapped his phones at Trump Tower during the election. Trump offered no evidence of his claim. Comey asked the Justice Department to publicly reject the allegation as false. Comey did not reference the wiretapping controversy during his speech to law enforcement officials and private-sector business leaders. ___ ‘Fearless Girl’ statue stares down Wall Street’s iconic bull NEW YORK (AP) — A new statue of a resolute young girl now faces Wall Street’s famous Charging Bull, erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women’s Day to make a point: There’s a dearth of women on the boards of the largest U.S. corporations. State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors. Artist Kristen Visbal’s “Fearless Girl” drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot. The girl, sculpted in bronze, appears to be staring down the bronze bull, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high. “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,” reads a plaque at her feet. ___ Study: Climate change goosed odds of freakishly hot February WASHINGTON (AP) — A freakishly balmy February broke more than 11,700 local daily records for warmth in the United States, but it didn’t quite beat 1954 for the warmest February on record, climate scientists said. The average temperature last month was 41.2 degrees — 7.3 degrees warmer than normal but three-tenths a degree behind the record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday. It was unseasonably toasty for most of the country east of the Rockies, but a cool Pacific Northwest kept the national record from falling, said NOAA climate scientist Jake Crouch. Chicago had no snow. Oklahoma hit 99 degrees. Texas and Louisiana had their hottest February. NOAA said local weather stations broke or tied warm temperature records 11,743 times but set cold records only 418 times. An international science team’s computer analysis of causes of extreme weather calculated that man-made global warming tripled the likelihood for the nation’s unusually warm February. The mostly private team of researchers, called World Weather Attribution, uses accepted scientific techniques to figure if climate change plays a role in extreme events based on computer simulations of real world conditions and those without heat-trapping gases. ___ Caveman menu: Woolly rhino in Belgium, mushrooms in Spain WASHINGTON (AP) — Eating like a caveman meant chowing down on woolly rhinos and sheep in Belgium, but munching on mushrooms, pine nuts and moss in Spain. It all depended on where they lived, new research shows. Scientists got a sneak peek into the kitchen of three Neanderthals by scraping off the plaque stuck on their teeth and examining the DNA. What they found smashes a common public misconception that the caveman diet was mostly meat. They also found hints that one sickly teen used primitive versions of penicillin and aspirin to help ease his pain. The dental plaque provides a lifelong record of what went in the Neanderthals’ mouths and the bacteria that lived in their guts, said study co-author Alan Cooper, director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA in Adelaide. “It’s like a fossil,” he said. While past studies showed varied Neanderthal diets, genetic testing allowed researchers to say what kind of meat or mushrooms they ate, Cooper said. The 42,000-year-old Belgian Neanderthal’s menu of sheep and woolly rhino reflected what roamed in the plains around the Neanderthal’s home, he said. The research is in Wednesday’s journal Nature .

Tope Bello With a background in urban and regional planning, from the University of Lagos, and a master’s in geospatial information sciences from the University of Texas, Tope is a seasoned geospatial software designer. His career kicked off at ESRI, a US-based GIS software company, where he spent almost a decade honing his skills. Tope joined Apple in November 2016 to work on the Apple Maps team in California. In his free time, Tope loves to play football and is also an ardent follower of basketball. Debola Olufon Debola Olufon has a history with Apple, dating as far back as 2010. In his humble beginnings, he started off as a floor worker for Apple Retail in London. As a workshop facilitator, he provided training for members of the public and press on new Apple products. He took on a couple other roles after then, including ‘mentor & recruitment coordinator’ and ‘Apple Expert’. Not satisfied with his position, he proceeded to the London Metropolitan University to obtain a post-grad diploma in HR management (CIPD). He has since returned to take on the role of HR Admin at Apple in London. Sefunmi Osinaike Sefunmi Osinaike describes himself as an “advocate for entrepreneurship as a means for solving distinctive problems”. True to his claim, he co-founded Pave, a time management tool for students, while still studying electrical and computer engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Looking for a challenge to expand his horizon, Sefunmi decided to take on the corporate world, cutting his first teeth as a Program Manager at Microsoft’s Redmond HQ. By August of 2016, he had moved on to join Apple at the company’s Cupertino HQ, where he works in product operations which puts him at the heart of iPhone production. But don’t expect him to leak any details about the upcoming iPhone 8; you’ll have to wait until launch day in September/October. Tobi Ayanleke Tobi Ayanleke is an alumnus of Airforce Comprehensive School, Ibadan, Nigeria. Before joining Apple in November 2016, he was the country support manager for HP in Nigeria and Ghana, a position which he held for 2 years. With a wealth of experience in supply chain, IT service delivery and operations management, and an MBA in global management to boot, Tobi had little trouble sealing a sales management position at Apple in Canada. Adejoh Ogbe 2 years after he graduated with a degree in geography and town planning from the Kogi State University, Adejoh Ogbe proceeded to the University of Northern Iowa to obtain a master’s in Geography. There he worked on a “spacial analysis of foreclosure and neighbourhood characteristics in Miami metropolitan area, Florida” for his dissertation. Adejoh joined Apple, as a GIS technician consultant from Apex, in January 2016. Emmanuel Chukwuezi Emmanuel Chukwuezi is a senior iOS and Mac support specialist at Apple’s European Headquarters in Ireland. Before then, he worked as an enterprise account manager at eir Business, a Dublin-based telecommunications company, for 5 years. Emmaneul is an alumnus of the University of Calabar, in Nigeria, and the University of Portsmouth, UK.

Apple is a distant second with 215.5 million iPhones. However, high average selling prices and high margins gave Apple the lions share of the profits - close to 80% of worldwide profits from smartphones ended up in its pockets, some $44.9 billion out of $53.7 billion total. In comparison, Samsung Mobile brought in 14.6% or $8.3 billion - a number certainly impacted by the Galaxy Note7 recall. Comparing operating profit margins, Apples was 32.4% while Samsungs was 11.6% Huawei is #3 in market share - the Honor series alone sold 72.2 million, the higher-end Ascend series did 65.7 million. Those individual lines outsold Xiaomis whole line-up, the young company managed 46.4 million. Thats a big drop from the 65 million units Xiaomi sold in 2015. Anyway, Vivo and Oppo did well for themselves too. Vivos X series sold 33.7 million, the Y series 25.6 million. Oppos R series outsold both at 38.4 billion. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, each of which took in about 1.5% of global profits. The primary market for these companies is China, where the average smartphone sells for between $260 and $520.

If that sharing should take place, the unusual cooperation would give companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and others an opportunity to identify and repair any flaws in their software and devices that were being exploited by US spy agencies and some foreign allies, as described in nearly 9,000 pages of secret CIA files WikiLeaks published on Tuesday. The documents, which the White House declined anew Wednesday to confirm as authentic, describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features for computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs. They include the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. "This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. "This alleged leak should concern every single American." Spicer defended then-candidate Donald Trump's comment in October 2016 - "I love WikiLeaks!" - after it published during the presidential campaign private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager. Spicer said there was a "massive, massive difference" between WikiLeaks publishing stolen, personal emails of a political figure and files about national security tools used by the CIA. The CIA has declined to confirm that the documents are authentic. But on Wednesday, the agency said Americans should be "deeply troubled" by the disclosures. WikiLeaks has not released the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. The group indicated it was still considering its options but said in a statement Wednesday: "Tech companies are saying they need more details of CIA attack techniques to fix them faster. Should WikiLeaks work directly with them?" It wasn't clear whether WikiLeaks - a strident critic of Google and Facebook, among others - was serious about such action. A message seeking additional details from WikiLeaks was not immediately returned, and an attempt to speak to founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on Tuesday was rebuffed. Security experts said WikiLeaks was obligated to work privately with technology companies to disclose previously unknown software flaws, known as zero-day vulnerabilities because consumers would have no time to discover how to defend themselves against their use, and with companies that design protection software. WikiLeaks has said the latest files apparently have been circulating among former US government hackers and contractors. "The clear move is to notify vendors," said Chris Wysopal, co-founder and chief technology officer of Veracode Inc. "If WikiLeaks has this data then it's likely others have this data, too. The binaries and source code that contain zero days should be shared with people who build detection and signatures for a living." The political fallout and damage to US intelligence operations was still being assessed. The former head of the CIA and National Security Agency, Michael Hayden, sought to assure people the US would use such cyber weapons only against foreign targets. "I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American," Hayden said Tuesday night on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." "But there are people out there that you want us to spy on. You want us to have the ability to actually turn on that listening device inside the TV, to learn that person's intentions." One clear risk is that WikiLeaks revealed enough details to give foreign governments better opportunities to trace any of the sophisticated hacking tools they might discover back to the CIA, damaging the ability to disguise a US government hacker's involvement. "That's a huge problem," said Adriel T. Desautels, the chief executive at Netragard LLC, which formerly sold zero-day exploits to governments and companies. "Our capabilities are now diminished." Some vendors were already sifting through the disclosures to fix flaws in their software. The first confirmed patch came from Avira Operations GmbH & Co., a German antivirus vendor, which told The Associated Press it fixed what it described as "a minor vulnerability" within a few hours of the WikiLeaks release. WikiLeaks' CIA Hacking Dump Sends Tech Firms Scrambling for Fixes Apple said many of its security vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks were already fixed. In a statement late Tuesday, it said its initial analysis showed that the latest version of the iOS system software for iPhones and iPads fixed many of those flaws. Apple said it will "continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities." Google hasn't commented yet. The WikiLeaks disclosures were an extraordinary coup for a group that has already rocked American diplomacy with the release of 250,000 State Department cables, embarrassed the US military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and upended the US presidential election by publishing Democratic Party emails. The new releases are all the more remarkable given that WikiLeaks' founder Assange is midway through his fifth year at the Ecuadorean Embassy. He received political asylum after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for an allegation of rape. Last year, a United Nations panel declared that the UK and Sweden were detaining him arbitrarily, but there's no suggestion that Swedish or British authorities will budge on their desire to detain and extradite him. Meanwhile, the upcoming second round of Ecuador's presidential contest may mean Assange's welcome at the embassy is wearing thin. The front-runner in the race, Guillermo Lasso, has said he would evict Assange, an action Assange says could eventually lead to his extradition to the United States.

Basically what this does is that it creates a list of websites and articles that you can save to read at a later time when you’re free. Granted there are other apps and services such as Pocket to help with that, but reading list is built into the browser itself. That being said, it seems that Google could be introducing a similar feature of their own. According to 9to5Mac, Google recently pushed out a stable build of Chrome 57 to Mac, Windows, and Linux users, which means that the mobile version is probably around the corner, and as you can see in the screenshot above, Chrome iOS appears to have a reading list feature of its own. However it seems that Google might have actually done a better job with it than Apple because according to the report, Google has managed to separate the articles you’ve saved in “Unread” and “Pages You’ve Read” categories, meaning that you’ll be able to see which articles you’ve already gone through and which you haven’t, which should cut down the confusion. It’s not really a groundbreaking feature but it is one of those quality of life improvements that Apple should have included in Safari. No word on when the latest Chrome will be released for iOS, but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Chrome, Google, iOS and safari.

According to International Business Times, the Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. “HoloLens support was earlier reportedly not said to be included in the Surface Pro 5, since HoloLens is not a consumer device. But with the company rolling out the technology to more affordable VR headsets, the tablet is expected to offer HoloLens support.” The Surface Pro 5 will likely support Microsoft’s HoloLens. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The article adds that the Surface Pro 5 will also support Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creator’s Update, which is expected to be the biggest Windows update since Windows 10. According to iTech Post, the Surface Pro 5 will be compatible with Surface Dial support. “Moreover, the Surface Dial is also expected to be compatible with the next-gen Surface Pro tablet. This relatively new Microsoft product was launched in October and has primarily been designed for the Surface Studio.” The article explains that the Surface Dial is a Bluetooth-enabled accessory that is very much like a mouse. However, it has a dfferent set of features that can have custom functionalities depending on the user’s needs. Digital Trends talks about some other features. “The Surface Pro 4 uses sixth-generation Intel Core processors and offers an excellent 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, 2,736 x 1,824-pixel resolution, and 267 PPI. Anticipated — and logical — Surface Pro 5 updates, therefore, include a move to seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display option.” The article adds that in order to make the device as thin as possible, USB-3 ports may be replaced with USB-C ports — something Apple has been doing for the past year. Other possibilities listed include a wireless charging pen and a larger capacity battery. The Surface Pro 5 will definitely compete with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, although the MacBook Pro isn’t a touch-enabled or pen-enabled device. The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar hasn’t been as well received as Apple had hoped. Many have complained about the battery life and believe that is way overpriced. Digital Trends gives the Pro a very mixed three-star review. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has received mixed reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] “Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is a beautiful machine, but it has several flaws, and it’s far too expensive,” says critic Matt Smith, who adds that there are many cheaper Windows machines that have overall better features. Many in the comments section agree with the author. “I couldn’t agree with you more… last good macbook was from 2011,” says Tomas Stejcek. “This is the BEST REVIEW I have read of the new Mac laptop, and trust me, i have read many. Tech reviewers and other industry observers (like myself) agree that this new Mac simply is overpriced for the cost and under implemented for the technology,” claims Mike Drips. However, there are certainly a lot of happy MacBook Pro with Touch Bar owners on Twitter. I'm so in love with my MacBook Pro!!! touch bar is lit. Best decision I ever made — Marisol Valenzuela (@marisolv_3) February 19, 2017 Michael, I've been using my new 2016 MacBook Pro for a couple of weeks and absolutely love it and the touchbar (had a 2011 model). https://t.co/R0Aaq99ZcG — Erich Robinson (@ErichRobinson) January 14, 2017 Besides the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the Surface Pro 5 will compete with laptop hybrids from Dell, HP, Lenovo, and even Samsung, who is about to release the Galaxy Book, which is very much like the Surface Pro except that it includes the keyboard cover. Do you think the Surface Pro 5 will be as successful as the Surface Pro 4? Let us know in the comments section.

Microsoft on WikiLeaks CIA Files: Windows 10 Systems Are Safe GO Microsoft says that systems running Windows 10 are not vulnerable to CIA attacks, as the files mention dated bugs Mar 10, 2017 01:17 GMT  ·  By Gabriela Vatu  ·  Share:  Microsoft has finally issued a statement regarding the WikiLeaks Vault 7 leak of CIA documents regarding the agency's hacking powers, saying that computers running Windows 10 software should be safe.  According to Microsoft's statement, the vulnerabilities mentioned in the CIA files were dated and appeared to target older systems. "We take security issues very seriously and are continuing a deeper analysis to determine if additional steps are necessary to further protect our customers," the company said. Should any additional threats be discovered, Microsoft promises to inform customers. There is no mention whether people using previous Windows versions are safe from CIA attacks or not. Apple, Google, Linux claim users are safe  Microsoft's statement falls in line with what we've been hearing from all over the tech community. Apple and Google have said that customers running their latest software appear to be safe from vulnerabilities and that most of the issues mentioned in the WikiLeaks files have already been fixed. It's unclear what vulnerabilities are yet to be patched or whether there really are any. The Linux Foundation has also addressed the issue with a rather relaxed statement. They said that given the open-source nature of the operating system, with security updates being released every few days, there are little chances for users to be in danger from the CIA as any vulnerabilities they might have been able to exploit have long since been fixed. The major problem exposed by the CIA files WikiLeaks dumped the other day is the fact that the agency expressed a desire to stockpile zero-day vulnerabilities and find ways to exploit them. If its hackers didn't find the security holes, the CIA bought it off the Internet. Such vulnerabilities in iOS and Android were used by the CIA to create malware which got them full access to a target's phone, bypassing even encryption layers set down by apps such as WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. This, of course, is the exact type of thing any serious malware can do. By refusing to disclose these zero-days to the affected companies, however, the CIA put billions of users at risk. After all, if the CIA found the vulnerability, who's to say other didn't too? Samsung and LG are still looking into the situation and are expected to release statements on the matter too. #Microsoft#Windows 10#WikiLeaks#Vault 7#Google subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news WikiLeaks Will Work with Tech Companies to Fix Security Flaws Exploited by CIA Linux Foundation on Vault 7: Frequent Security Updates Protect Linux Users Google: We've Already Fixed Most Bugs Exposed in WikiLeaks' Vault 7 Files Don't Give Up on Encrypted Messaging Apps Because of the Vault 7 CIA Revelations Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Windows 10 is safe from the CIA Related Apps Passware Encryption Analyzer: Seamlessly find all password-protected files on your computer and find out how to overcome their encryption with this application Passware Password Recovery Kit Forensic: A complete password recovery and e-discovery solution that can help you decrypt and obtain passwords from almost any file and website Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Bitcoin Password: This easy to use application can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet password by using customizable dictionary, brute force or mixed attacks GridinSoft Anti-Malware: Scan your computer for malware and dangerous files, adware and other malicious components with the help of this intuitive application Passware Password Recovery Kit Basic: A fast and efficient password recovery software that can reveal email, Internet and network passwords and decrypt documents altogether Adlice PEViewer: Analyze the structure of running processes and executable files on your computer to detect potentially dangerous activity on your system Reader comments Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots more on: bots i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Nintendo is beginning to use mobile platforms to unlock value in its franchises, but the company is still very dependent on performance of new hardware. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 9, 2017 at 5:24PM Nintendo's turnaround effort hinges on sales of the Switch console. Image source: NVIDIA Inc.  Nintendo's (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) stock is up 50% over the last year following launches of mobile games Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run, as well as the potential of the new Switch gaming console to return Nintendo to growth mode. The recent efforts of Nintendo in mobile gaming demonstrate that the company has large untapped potential on mobile platforms. If management can find the right mobile strategy, it could unlock value in its deep library of intellectual property. Nintendo's untapped potential in mobile gaming Pokemon Go has been downloaded 650 million times since its launch last summer, and is one of the top-grossing games in Apple's app store. But Pokemon Go is developed by Niantic, not Nintendo. Through its fiscal second quarter ending in September 2016, Nintendo earned a small licensing fee of $115 million for the Pokemon name to be used by Niantic. This is a drop in the bucket compared to Nintendo's market value of $24 billion. Still, the successful launch of the game led to growth in Nintendo software sales of past titles in the Pokemon series and also drove a 10% increase in Nintendo 3DS family hardware sales in the second half of 2016. These crossover sales show how a successful mobile-gaming strategy could supplement Nintendo's hardware business long term.  Super Mario Run has been downloaded 78 million times since its December 2016 launch. It's free to download with limited accessibility, and if players wish, they can pay $10 to unlock the full game. Out of the 78 million who downloaded the game, more than 5% chose to pay $10, generating $53 million in revenue for Nintendo. While this conversion rate is better than that of a lot of games that charge less than $5, it was below management's expectations of achieving an ambitious double-digit conversion rate. Mario Bros. is one of Nintendo's most popular franchises, and management wants the game to be enjoyed by everyone, from children to adults. To achieve this, management added an Easy Mode and is currently working on a tutorial, as well as how-to-play videos, to make the game easier to understand for those who have never played a Mario game before. It's unclear if these initiatives will serve as obstacles hindering potential players from buying the game. After all, many mobile games are played for the ease and accessibility of doing something fun to kill time. A different pay model The problem is that Super Mario Run is not among the top 100 highest-grossing games in Apple's app store. Nintendo has released four mobile games so far. Super Mario Run is the best-selling out of the first four, but to really move the needle, Nintendo needs several games to be toward the top of the charts. Management may also need to think about changing its pay model to a traditional free-to-play one. This model has proven very profitable for top game developers. Instead of charging Mario players $10 to unlock the full game, Nintendo could charge micro-transactions for a series of content over time. The potential financial impact for Nintendo could be significant if it can develop the right mobile strategy and sustain a steady cadence of mobile releases through the year. For example, in 2016, Activision Blizzard's King Digital Entertainment generated $537 million in operating income based on a handful of hit mobile games, including Candy Crush and Bubble Witch. However, it's not clear whether Nintendo will ever be as successful as other mobile developers. Mobile is a very crowded field, is completely new for Nintendo, and, more important, may not be in the company's DNA. Nintendo switches it up For now, the company's success completely hinges on its new Switch console, which launched March 3. Management hopes to sell 2 million units in March, and analysts expect up to 11 million units sold within the first year. This would put Switch on pace to sell probably between 30 million to 50 million units in the next three to five years, or less than half of Wii's 101.63 million units sold since its launch just over 10 years ago. The Wii was Nintendo's most successful console in company history, helping Nintendo reach a peak of $18.7 billion in net sales and $5.6 billion in operating income for fiscal year 2009.   These results fueled a rocket ride in the stock up to a peak of about $75 per share in early 2008. Is the stock a good bet? NTDOY data by YCharts. For the current fiscal year ending in March 2017, management is forecasting 20 billion Japanese yen in operating income. There is plenty of upside potential for Nintendo's stock if Switch is a runaway success like the Wii. With Nintendo's family friendly approach to gaming, deep franchise library, and healthy balance sheet, I would never want to bet against the company. I have shares in Nintendo tucked away just in case. However, Nintendo has a shaky history with hardware sales. If a company hasn't demonstrated consistent growth in its track record, investors shouldn't expect the future to look any different.   John Ballard owns shares of Activision Blizzard and Nintendo.

WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. ASSOCIATED PRESS WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange speaks in this video made available Thursday. ASSOCIATED PRESS WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. While companies have a responsibility — not to mention financial incentive — to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. And it’s not even clear at this point exactly what kind of information WikiLeaks has to offer. THE PROMISE WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said today that the anti-secrecy site will work with technology companies to help defend them against software vulnerabilities in everyday gadgets such as phones and TVs. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the purported CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. “We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out,” Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as “cyberweapons” would be published to the world “once this material is effectively disarmed by us.” Terms for disclosure, if any, weren’t immediately known. Nor was it known how much detail WikiLeaks has on specific vulnerabilities, rather than just the tools capable of exploiting them. LEGAL QUESTIONS Tech companies could run into legal difficulties in accepting the offer, especially if they have government contracts or employees with security clearances. “The unauthorized release of classified documents does not mean it’s unclassified,” said Stewart Baker, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security and former legal counsel for the National Security Agency. “Doing business with WikiLeaks and reviewing classified documents poses a real risk for at least their government contracting arms and their cleared employees,” Baker said. But it’s tough to prosecute cases involving classified documents, said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. At some point, he and other experts said, courts and the administration may consider such material as having passed into the public domain. TRUST MATTERS But tech companies might face a bigger problem with public perception. “They don’t want to be seen as endorsing or supporting an organization with a tainted reputation and an unclear agenda,” Cattanach said. For instance, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails, some embarrassing, from breached Democratic Party computers and the account of a top aide to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. Those emails were stolen by hackers connected to the Russian government, an act U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian attempt to help Donald Trump win the presidency. “You are getting in bed with someone who is ... happy to harm the interests of the United States in whatever way they can,” Baker said. “That does raise concerns of an ethical sort for companies that take their nation seriously.” Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the civil-liberties group Center for Democracy and Technology, said companies would have to navigate with care and assume that any discussions will ultimately become public, given WikiLeaks’ past and “Assange’s philosophy of radical transparency.” A BETTER PATH Ideally, the CIA would have shared such vulnerabilities directly with companies, as other government agencies have long done. In such a case, companies would not only be dealing with a known entity in an above-board fashion, they might also obtain a more nuanced understanding of the problems than might be apparent in documents or lines of computer code. And if companies could learn details about how the CIA found these vulnerabilities, they might also find additional vulnerabilities using the same technique, said Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute. But there are risks as well. Should tech companies obtain the actual hacking tools, Ullrich said, they’d have to treat them with great caution. Some, for instance, might have unadvertised features that could, for instance, start extracting data as soon as they launch. Raphael Satter in Paris, Paisley Dodds in London, Deb Riechmann in Washington and Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report. This story has been corrected to reflect that purported CIA tools are not aimed at “defeating encryption” but at hijacking computers.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 10 March 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Apple, Samsung vow to fix flaws, after CIA hacking report Opportunistic agency: The CIA was exploiting weaknesses in hardware and software systems – without informing manufacturers of the flaws in question. — AFP Relaxnews Apple and Samsung vowed Wednesday to quickly fix any vulnerabilities in their products following WikiLeaks' disclosure of an alleged CIA hacking arsenal capable of breaking into iPhones and other devices. The archive released on Tuesday claims to show the CIA exploiting weaknesses it discovers in hardware and software systems – without informing manufacturers of the flaws in question. "While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities," Apple said in an e-mailed statement. "We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates." Samsung offered a similar response. "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung," a statement from the South Korean electronics giant said. "We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter." WikiLeaks claims the documents it released on Tuesday are part of a vast trove of leaked CIA documents, tools and code representing "the majority of its hacking arsenal." The CIA would neither confirm nor deny the documents were genuine. According to the documents, the CIA has produced more than 1,000 malware systems -- viruses, trojans, and other software that can infiltrate and take control of target electronics. These hacking tools have allegedly targeted iPhones, Android systems such as the personal phone reportedly still used by President Donald Trump, popular Microsoft software, and Samsung smart TVs. —  AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Off the catwalk, bloggers and editors vie for fashion fans’ attention Oracle's cloud transition helps 3rd-quarter profit beat Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

(FILES) This file photo taken on February 05, 2016 shows WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange coming out on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy to address the media in central London. Photo: BEN STANSALL, AFP/Getty Images WikiLeaks will share CIA hacking data with tech companies 1 / 1 Back to Gallery WikiLeaks will turn over all the details it has on the CIA’s alleged hacking arsenal so that tech companies like Apple and Google can patch holes and fix vulnerabilities in their technology before the activist group makes the code publicly available online, the organization’s founder announced Thursday. Julian Assange took questions on the CIA leak in a lengthy online news conference broadcast on Twitter from Ecuador’s Embassy in London, where Assange has been since he was granted political asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on rape accusations, which he has denied. Assange said the organization would work with tech companies whose products appeared to be targets of CIA cyberattacks that included breaking into phones, computers, cars and televisions. “WikiLeaks has a lot more information about what has been going on with the cyberweapons program. After considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure,” Assange said. He did not detail how WikiLeaks would securely pass the information on to tech firms or to which companies the data would be distributed. Once companies have had a chance to ensure that consumer devices are properly protected, Assange said, the group will release the code showing how the CIA managed to break into phones, work around encrypted messaging apps and avoid detection by software designed to defend against cyberattacks. WikiLeaks published a cache of nearly 9,000 documents that the group said had been leaked by a CIA contractor. Though the CIA itself has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, several cybersecurity experts interviewed by The Chronicle, including some with previous government experience, said the trove of data appears legitimate. The initial document release on Tuesday was only a piece of a greater stash of information WikiLeaks said it had hesitated to reveal, due to the sensitive nature of the information and how extensively it could endanger people’s personal data. In a statement that accompanied the documents, WikiLeaks said it avoided “the distribution of ‘armed’ cyberweapons” before those tools could be disabled and rendered relatively benign. Companies named in the leak, including Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung, said this week that they are investigating the claims and patching security holes. According to the leaked documents, the CIA discovered and kept secret 14 methods of exploiting Apple devices. Those vulnerabilities are known as zero-day attacks, meaning they pounce on security defects unknown even to the company itself and, therefore, have no known fix. The spy agency also collected 24 “weaponized” zero-day exploits against Android devices, the documents said, and engaged in an attack called “Weeping Angel” that turned Samsung Smart TVs into listening devices by putting the television sets in a fake off-mode while hackers used them to record conversations. Security experts were outraged over the leak, in part, they said, because by keeping information about technological vulnerabilities to itself, the spy agency could have put the personal data of countless people at risk of being hacked by cybercriminals or other countries. Assange suggested during Thursday’s news conference that the CIA may have used some of these tools to spy on Americans, which would be a violation of the agency’s legal mandate. He said WikiLeaks had received a list of more than 22,000 IP addresses — numbers that correspond with individual computers — associated with U.S. computers that could have been used in CIA attacks or targeted by CIA hackers. Those IP addresses have not be released nor independently verified. The CIA has denied that it uses electronic surveillance against Americans, and many cybersecurity experts cautioned against trusting Assange, whom many consider to be a tool of Russia. Samsung, Google and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Assange’s offer. Marissa Lang is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The renowned naturalist will narrate stories inspired by some of the most famous documentaries of his career as young viewers use their touch screens to help him on his way. New to the CBeebies Storytime app, the series will begin with David And The Gorilla Quest, based on his encounter with mountain gorillas in Rwanda during his 1978 trip for BBC Natural History's Life On Earth series. Children will have the chance to pick the adventurer's kit, track the gorillas' path through the jungle, and move aside plants so the young Sir David can get through. "I am thrilled that we've brought to life many fond memories of my exploration of the natural world for young children to enjoy and learn," Sir David said. Designed for children aged 0-6, Attenborough's Adventures will help them learn to read as they explore the animal expert's expeditions since his early days filming Zoo Quest in the 1950s, to his debut with virtual reality in last year's Attenborough And The Giant Dinosaur. CBeebies controller Kay Benbow said: "Each story is brought to life with magical things to touch, swipe and play with, and questions to help develop comprehension skills, so the grown-up and child can enjoy reading, playing and learning together. "Sir David has led an extraordinary life, and we're over the moon that his enthralling tales are now helping children to learn while being inspired by the natural world." As the series progresses, young viewers will also follow Sir David in search of dinosaurs, dragons, treasure and a hidden city. The full list of five stories includes: Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Giant Dinosaur Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Hidden City Attenborough's Adventures: David and the Dragon Attenborough's Adventures: David the Treasure Hunter Available to download on Apple, Android and Kindle Fire devices, the series is produced by Laura Howard of the BBC Natural History Unit and illustrated by Will Rose.

Siri is the oldest of the bunch, and researchers including Oren Etzioni, chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle, said Apple has squandered its lead when it comes to understanding speech and answering questions. But there is at least one thing Siri can do that the other assistants cannot: speak 21 languages localized for 36 countries, a very important capability in a smartphone market where most sales are outside the United States. Microsoft Cortana, by contrast, has eight languages tailored for 13 countries. Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. Amazon's Alexa features only English and German. Siri will even soon start to learn Shanghainese, a special dialect of Wu Chinese spoken only around Shanghai. The language issue shows the type of hurdle that digital assistants still need to clear if they are to become ubiquitous tools for operating smartphones and other devices. Speaking languages natively is complicated for any assistant. If someone asks for a football score in Britain, for example, even though the language is English, the assistant must know to say “two-nil” instead of “two-nothing.” At Microsoft, an editorial team of 29 people works to customize Cortana for local markets. In Mexico, for example, a published children’s book author writes Cortana’s lines to stand out from other Spanish-speaking countries. “They really pride themselves on what’s truly Mexican. (Cortana) has a lot of answers that are clever and funny and have to do with what it means to be Mexican,” said Jonathan Foster, who heads the team of writers at Microsoft. Google and Amazon said they plan to bring more languages to their assistants but declined to comment further. At Apple, the company starts working on a new language by bringing in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from, said Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, an acoustic model is built that tries to predict words sequences. Then Apple deploys “dictation mode,” its text-to-speech translator, in the new language, Acero said. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. After enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, Siri is released with answers to what Apple estimates will be the most common questions, Acero said. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. But script-writing does not scale, said Charles Jolley, creator of an intelligent assistant named Ozlo. “You can’t hire enough writers to come up with the system you’d need in every language. You have to synthesize the answers,” he said. That is years off, he said. The founders of Viv, a startup founded by Siri's original creators that Samsung acquired last year, is working on just that. "Viv was built to specifically address the scaling issue for intelligent assistants," said Dag Kittlaus, the CEO and co-founder of Viv. "The only way to leapfrog today's limited functionality versions is to open the system up and let the world teach them."

For the longest time, it has felt like there were only two real options for a smartphone: Apple’s iPhone or Samsung’s Galaxy line. But with the release of the Google Pixel last fall, and now the LG G6, the discussion is starting to get more interesting. I had the opportunity to spend an hour with the G6 at an LG preview event here in Toronto, and based on my short time with the device, colour me impressed. This year couldn’t be more perfect for LG to challenge the Samsung and Apple giants – especially with the iPhone 7’s mediocre release, and the hit Samsung’s brand has taken throughout a mistake-riddled year. The big guys are starting to look vulnerable, and the G6 may be coming at the best time to take advantage of that. But before we get into my first impressions, let’s see what’s new with the latest LG smartphone. The flashy new G6 The first thing you’ll notice about the G6 is its aluminum and glass look that really makes the device look like it belongs in the same conversation as some of the other smartphone giants. The redesign is simple and fitting for what consumers look for in a smartphone in the present day. In Canada, the G6 is available in platinum and black. LG is taking advantage of the space provided on the phone by making it nearly bezel-free. The South Korean company is really emphasizing is the new 5.7 inch QHD+ (2,800 x 1,440 resolution) FullVision screen with a 18:9, or 2:1, aspect ratio, expanding on the traditional 16:9 screen we are used to. While this largely means there is now more viewing space on the phone, it also means users can take square photos in an exact 1:1 ratio – a huge benefit for Instagram users. This ties into the new camera features on the device. The G6 has dual 13 MP rear cameras that include a 125-degree lens on a wide angle for panoramic shots, and a 5 MP front camera with an expanded 100-degree field of vision. These changes will largely reduce edge distortion in the photos you take. Further photography features take advantage of that new 18:9 aspect ratio with square camera functionality. Users can take pictures in a 1:1 square box, while simultaneously taking a look at final product or editing photos in a second 1:1 square box beside it. Square camera mode comes with four shooting options: Snap – Splits the screen in half so that you can take a picture on one-half and view it straight away on the other half as described above. Grid – Use the top square to take pictures that will create a four photo grid on the bottom square. Guide – Allows you to take an image from your gallery and overlay it on the top screen to capture a second image with the same composition. Match – This captures two images, one on the top and one on the bottom, and then combines them. With the G6, LG claims this is the first smartphone to support Dolby Vision and HDR 10 – the audio-visual standards that we are used to seeing in high-end televisions. While in theory, this is a great addition, it may be ahead of its time. Netflix doesn’t yet support that type of quality on the Netflix mobile app, so this addition may go largely unused for the time being. Additionally, the G6 will be one of the first smartphones beside the Pixel to be integrated with the virtual assistant, Google Assistant. In Canada and the U.S., the G6 features wireless charging. It’s also reached IP68 certification, meaning you won’t have to worry if you accidentally get your LG phone wet anymore. The full tech specs of the G6 are below. First impressions The square camera features are fun. While the different modes are fairly gimmicky, they are welcome additions to any photography arsenal. Plus, a gif feature that combines two to 100 images from the gallery is a great addition. The G6 just looks great. LG has ditched the ugly design features of the past, and now has a device that looks like it belongs with the higher-end smartphones we are accustomed too. The upgraded display looks beautiful, and I’m excited to see what else you can do with that new aspect ratio. Can I browse Instagram and Twitter in perfect squares at the same time? Otherwise, I’ll have to get more hands-on with the device to properly see if it can stack against the current smartphone giants. We’ll have to see how the battery life stacks up, and it is disappointing to see that it only supports 32 GB of internal storage considering the emphasis put on the camera and video features. Additionally, we don’t know a price yet. I’m certainly impressed by this first showing, but whether or not the G6 is worthy of the price tag commanded by the iPhone and Galaxy line is yet to be determined. The LG G6 is expected to release in Canada this spring.

Assange said his group will work with technology companies to help defeat the Central Intelligence Agency’s hacking tools. Assange says “we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out.” (WikiLeaks via AP) WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange speaks in this video made available Thursday March 9, 2017. Assange said his group will work with technology companies to help defeat the Central Intelligence Agency’s hacking tools. Assange says “we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out.” (WikiLeaks via AP) By SCOTT SHANE / THE NEW YORK TIMES Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said Thursday that the anti-secrecy organization would work with Apple, Google and other technology companies to fix flaws that have allowed the CIA to hack into the phones, computers and other devices they produce. Speaking from London in an online news conference, Assange accused the CIA of withholding information about the vulnerabilities the agency was exploiting in U.S. technology even after it realized documents describing the flaws had been leaked weeks ago. While some companies have already fixed the weaknesses revealed in a batch of secret CIA documents made public by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, Assange said, others say they need more technical information on the hacking techniques. “There’s a limited ability to try and produce security fixes for iPhones, for Samsung TVs, for Android phones produced by Google, for Microsoft, for Linux, because the exact technical details are not known,” Assange said. “We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured.” For Assange, it was a remarkable turning of the tables. He spoke from the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he sought refuge in 2012 from a sexual assault investigation in Sweden and has lived ever since. He has frequently been accused by U.S. officials of being an enemy of the United States and an ally of Russia, especially since WikiLeaks released emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign that were believed to have come from Russian government hackers. But Thursday the Australian-born Assange presented himself as a defender of some of the most prominent U.S. technology companies against their own government’s overreaching and double-dealing. “Why has the Central Intelligence Agency not acted with speed to come together with Apple, Microsoft and other manufacturers to defend us all from its own weapons systems?” Assange asked. Calmly fielding questions submitted via Twitter, Assange sought to insert himself into the strained relationship between the government and Silicon Valley, where some executives see their products’ reputations as being endangered by aggressive U.S. espionage efforts. The CIA responded with an unusually full response, attacking Assange’s credibility and noting that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits. “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,” Heather Fritz Horniak, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.” The statement declined to acknowledge the authenticity of the more than 8,000 documents from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence that WikiLeaks posted online, although officials have said privately that the leaked material is genuine. But the statement defended the agency’s use of “innovative, cutting-edge” methods to gather intelligence. The statement also asserted that the WikiLeaks revelations were damaging national security. “The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community’s ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries,” the statement said. WikiLeaks said Tuesday that the CIA documents it was releasing, which appeared to show the agency could compromise iPhones, Android phones and even internet-connected televisions, were only the first phase of a much larger set of disclosures to come regarding the agency’s hacking program. It claimed to have received the documents from an unnamed source who hoped the revelations would provoke a public debate over the U.S. use of cyberweapons. The disclosure has set off a hunt for the leaker, who officials have said was most likely an agency insider or contractor.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) stands well above the competition of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) in one key area: language. Although most of these assistants are similar in many ways, language is a dividing factor, yielding a larger target audience. Apple’s Siri can support 21 languages across 36 country dialects. Google’s Assistant is only capable of understanding four languages, while Alexa from Amazon only knows two. Even Cortana from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) only supports eight languages. With Apple’s next update, iOS 10.3, the company is introducing another language, Shanghainese, further expanding its stranglehold on this field. Alex Acero, head of the speech team at Apple, illustrated the process of how Siri learns a new language in a recent interview with Reuters. Siri begins learning a new language after Apple brings in humans to read passages in a range of accents and dialects, which are then transcribed by hand so the computer has an exact representation of the spoken text to learn from. Apple also captures a range of sounds in a variety of voices. From there, a language model is built that tries to predict word sequences. The next step in the process involves Apple’s “dictation mode,” a text-to-speech translator in the new language. When customers use dictation mode, Apple captures a small percentage of the audio recordings and makes them anonymous. The recordings, complete with background noise and mumbled words, are transcribed by humans, a process that helps cut the speech recognition error rate in half. Accordingly, when enough data has been gathered and a voice actor has been recorded to play Siri in a new language, it is released with answers to what are expected to be the most common questions. Once released, Siri learns more about what real-world users ask and is updated every two weeks with more tweaks. Shares of Apple were last seen at $138.60 on Thursday, with a consensus analyst price target of $142.46 and a 52-week trading range of $89.47 to $140.28. Alphabet shares were trading at $855.90. The stock has a 52-week range of $672.66 to $867.00 and a consensus price target of $988.95. Amazon was trading at $852.38, in a 52-week range of $538.58 to $860.86. The consensus analyst target is $942.32. Microsoft shares were last seen at $64.91. The consensus price target is $69.48, and the 52-week range is $48.04 to $65.91.

A British court Monday gave WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange permission to continue his legal battle to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex crimes allegations. (AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) NEW YORK (AP) — WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in a bind. While companies have a responsibility — not to mention financial incentive — to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. And it’s not even clear at this point exactly what kind of information WikiLeaks has to offer. THE PROMISE WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Thursday that the anti-secrecy site will work with technology companies to help defend them against software vulnerabilities in everyday gadgets such as phones and TVs. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the purported CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. “We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out,” Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as “cyberweapons” would be published to the world “once this material is effectively disarmed by us.” Terms for disclosure, if any, weren’t immediately known. Nor was it known how much detail WikiLeaks has on specific vulnerabilities, rather than just the tools capable of exploiting them. LEGAL QUESTIONS Tech companies could run into legal difficulties in accepting the offer, especially if they have government contracts or employees with security clearances. “The unauthorized release of classified documents does not mean it’s unclassified,” said Stewart Baker, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security and former legal counsel for the National Security Agency. “Doing business with WikiLeaks and reviewing classified documents poses a real risk for at least their government contracting arms and their cleared employees,” Baker said. But it’s tough to prosecute cases involving classified documents, said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. At some point, he and other experts said, courts and the administration may consider such material as having passed into the public domain. TRUST MATTERS But tech companies might face a bigger problem with public perception. “They don’t want to be seen as endorsing or supporting an organization with a tainted reputation and an unclear agenda,” Cattanach said. For instance, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails, some embarrassing, from breached Democratic Party computers and the account of a top aide to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. Those emails were stolen by hackers connected to the Russian government, an act U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian attempt to help Donald Trump win the presidency. “You are getting in bed with someone who is … happy to harm the interests of the United States in whatever way they can,” Baker said. “That does raise concerns of an ethical sort for companies that take their nation seriously.” Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist with the civil-liberties group Center for Democracy and Technology, said companies would have to navigate with care and assume that any discussions will ultimately become public, given WikiLeaks’ past and “Assange’s philosophy of radical transparency.” A BETTER PATH Ideally, the CIA would have shared such vulnerabilities directly with companies, as other government agencies have long done. In such a case, companies would not only be dealing with a known entity in an above-board fashion, they might also obtain a more nuanced understanding of the problems than might be apparent in documents or lines of computer code. And if companies could learn details about how the CIA found these vulnerabilities, they might also find additional vulnerabilities using the same technique, said Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute. But there are risks as well. Should tech companies obtain the actual hacking tools, Ullrich said, they’d have to treat them with great caution. Some, for instance, might have unadvertised features that could, for instance, start extracting data as soon as they launch.

Skip to content Home News Sports Metro Plus Politics Business Entertainment Opinion Editorial Columnists Jobs Sections Search for: Opinion Before you come to America Published March 10, 2017March 10, 2017 Share Tweet Pin it +1 Fola Ojo Fola Ojo My mission was to cover a Field Hockey International competition in Washington DC as a reporter for this newspaper. With $120 tucked away in my wallet for the week-long sporting event, I hopped on the British Caledonian (now British Airways) flight from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos en route Gatwick Airport heading to the JFK Airport, New York. We arrived at the “Big Apple” and then took a luxurious bus shuttle down Highway 95 South heading to the seat of the US Government. The sprawling, big four-lane freeway tore through New York City to Newark, all the way through Philly and Wilmington. The massively asphalted concrete snaked by Baltimore and then into Washington DC. America’s rattling beauty made me temporarily forget my loved ones in Imesi-Ile. It was my first time travelling 5,000 miles away from my ageing parents. High-rising structures I sighted in DC dwarfed the tallest building I had ever seen in Cocoa House Building in Ibadan. Major and side streets were brightly illuminated. America the Beautiful. “O beautiful for spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountain majesties, Above the fruited plain! America! America!  God shed his grace on thee; And crown thy good with brotherhood; From sea to shining sea!”. I’m still singing the song. It took me only a few days to decide making this new place home. Friends I made came from different parts of the world. America opened its door to all of us. You will rule here if only you play by the rules. You want to be rich quick through backdoor means? If that’s your choice, think twice. There will be a cooling off in the calaboose for your criminal foolishness. This is a land of laws. In some countries around the world, it is suicide to sing the Christian hymnal or celebrate Christmas. If you did, pictures of your chopped-off head and twitching body stump will go viral on YouTube in a video made by fanatics who believe it is blasphemous worshipping another god. But in America, churches spring up often as well as mosques. Buddhist temples are also offered bank loans to set up. You are free to believe whatever or whoever you believe; or not believe at all. It is true that over many years, nations have taken advantage of “kinder and gentler” America. Her benevolence has been mistaken for weakness by some ignoramuses. But America’s displayed compassion is a strength lodged in the bones and marrows of her very existence and foundation. When two planes slammed into the Twin Towers in New York September 11, 2001, everything changed. The crashed plane in Pennsylvania and the one that rammed into the Pentagon in Washington DC stunned Americans. They were angry at the insult and assault that hit them. It was a slap on the face of a nation that prides itself as the greatest on earth. If you are from New York, you will hate that slap more. And a man born and bred in New York is now America’s 45th President. During the campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump promised to ban some Muslims coming into the country. I guess it was a way any thoroughbred New Yorker may want to react to the bushwhack by Islamic terrorists. The 58-storeyed, 664-foot-high mixed-use Trump Tower is cited only four miles from the site of the carnage. Trump said he saw innocent Americans jump off from the towers as the buildings blew up in raging inferno. The memory is too grim to blot out, he said. Thousands died weeks and months and years afterward from all manner of respiratory illnesses. Many are disabled till today. I side with Americans who do not agree with the president that a blanket ban on all Muslims is necessary. I believe that terrorists who want to harm America may be few; but I also concur that identifying who-is-who is a steep assignment. Trump’s recently signed Executive Order screening visa holders and refugees from six nations takes effect in about six days. This President is adamant about banning some crude elements from the American soil. America is not what it was when I came here. It is very different today even from three months ago. Harvard-trained lawyer, Khizr Khan, who was born in Pakistan, immigrated to the US and  became a US citizen 30 years ago. His 27-year-old son, Humayun, enlisted in the US Marines; but was killed in a suicide bomber attack in Iraq 2004. Senior Khan criticised Trump for his stand on Muslims in a speech at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia last summer. Mr. Khan was scheduled to travel to Canada this past Monday to deliver a speech.  But he received a message from the organisers of the event on Sunday that his “travel privileges are being reviewed”. Any US citizen with a passport may freely travel in-and-out of the country. Who is behind Khan’s travel travail? Khan is not telling. The safety and security of the country are a priority for the Commander-In-Chief.  He is building a wall against “bad dudes” and pushing away Jihadists. Trump’s loyalty and commitment is to America first; he’s made it clear before he was elected. There are still many immigrants who love this country; and they and their children have laid their lives on the line defending her. Unfortunately, there are also men who want to kill the innocent on this soil in the name of their god. As long as poverty, squalour, and impoverishment reign freely in developing and underdeveloped nations of the world, millions will not cease to seek better lives in the land of the free. It is last, best hope of earth, according to Abraham Lincoln. Juxtaposing the millieu when I left home with what’s prevalent today, Nigeria was a masterful mix of Paradise and Las Vegas with Disney land between and Dubai betwixt. Today, nothing is working. Graduates are jobless. Power is grounded. Robbers are hounding. And the future is uncertain and bleak. For as long as there is hardship and an unguaranteed future, Nigerians will continue to join others seeking greener pastures in America. Before you take a flight out to America, expect to be embarrassed at the port of entry if you are addicted to lies. Get ready for hours of drills. That you have a valid visa does not mean you will be allowed entry; it’s stated on your visa documents. You don’t have any legal right to be admitted into any country you are not a citizen or legal resident of. The screening officers are not mean men; they are just doing their jobs to make America safe. If you are reading this, answer this question: Will you live abroad for decades if your country is liveable? Will you make another country home if your original home is good? Only 36 per cent of Americans hold a valid passport; 70 per cent have never stepped out of the country; 5.7million live abroad; and a big chunk of them do because of compelling military assignments. In other words, far less live abroad voluntarily. The biggest reason Americans stay back at home is that their backyard is as diverse as it is enormous. So, why travel when everything you are looking for abroad is in your backyard?  Beautiful beaches; magnificent mountains; deserts that are desserts for souls; fanciful forests; all manner of people, all manner of ethnic foods; and reliable infrastructures that make it convenient for travels. Americans have built America for Americans. Nigeria does not even create an environment for her citizens to help build and rebuild. The good ones are killed or maimed! If you hate the present Trump Trauma as you plan to come to America, it is time you held your leaders’ feet to the fire compelling them to make your country great too.

Assange said his group will work with technology companies to help defeat the Central Intelligence Agency's hacking tools. Assange says "we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out." (WikiLeaks via AP) comments NEW YORK — WikiLeaks has offered to help the likes of Google and Apple identify the software holes used by purported CIA hacking tools — and that puts the tech industry in something of a bind. While companies have both a responsibility and financial incentive to fix problems in their software, accepting help from WikiLeaks raises legal and ethical questions. And it's not even clear at this point exactly what kind of assistance WikiLeaks can offer. THE PROMISE WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Thursday that the anti-secrecy site will help technology companies find and fix software vulnerabilities in everyday gadgets such as phones and TVs. In an online news conference, Assange said some companies had asked for more details about the purported CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he revealed in a massive disclosure on Tuesday. "We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said. The digital blueprints for what he described as "cyberweapons" would be published to the world "once this material is effectively disarmed by us." Any conditions WikiLeaks might set for its cooperation weren't immediately known. Nor was it clear if WikiLeaks holds additional details on specific vulnerabilities, or merely the tools designed to exploit them. Apple declined comment on the WikiLeaks offer, and Google didn't respond to requests for comment. Microsoft said it hopes that anyone with knowledge of software vulnerabilities would report them through the company's usual channels. LEGAL QUESTIONS Tech companies could run into legal difficulties in accepting the offer, especially if they have government contracts or employees with security clearances. "The unauthorized release of classified documents does not mean it's unclassified," said Stewart Baker, a former official at the Department of Homeland Security and former legal counsel for the National Security Agency. "Doing business with WikiLeaks and reviewing classified documents poses a real risk for at least their government contracting arms and their cleared employees." Other lawyers, however, are convinced that much of the information in the documents is so widely known that they are now part of the public domain. That means tech companies would be unlikely to face any legal liability for digging deeper with WikiLeaks. Alternatively, suppose tech companies don't accept WikiLeaks' offer to help fix any security flaws — and are subsequently hacked. At that point, they could face charges of negligence, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are much stricter than in the U.S., said Michael Zweiback, a former assistant U.S. attorney and cybercrime adviser now in private practice. GETTING TOO CLOSE TO WIKILEAKS Public perception might be a bigger problem. "They don't want to be seen as endorsing or supporting an organization with a tainted reputation and an unclear agenda," said Robert Cattanach, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney. During the 2016 election, WikiLeaks published thousands of emails, some embarrassing, from breached Democratic Party computers and the account of a top aide to Hillary Clinton. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded those emails were stolen by hackers connected to the Russian government in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the presidency. The CIA did not respond directly to Assange's offer, but it appeared to take a dim view of it. "Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said. But most tech companies already have digital hotlines to receive tips about security weaknesses, even if they come from unsavory characters. So it wouldn't break new ground for them to consult with a shadowy organization such as WikiLeaks. A BETTER PATH Ideally, the CIA would have shared such vulnerabilities directly with companies, as other government agencies have long done. In that case, companies would not only be dealing with a known entity in an aboveboard fashion, they might also obtain a more nuanced understanding of the problems than their engineers could glean from documents or lines of computer code. And if companies could learn details about how the CIA found these vulnerabilities, they might also find additional holes using the same technique, said Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute. And there are risks obtaining actual hacking tools from WikiLeaks. Some might have unadvertised features that could, for instance, start extracting data as soon as they launch. Ullrich said the CIA also might have left some traps to attack people running its exploits. If these aren't detailed in the documents, only the CIA would be able to help tech companies avoid setting them off. If all goes well, WikiLeaks could emerge looking better than some parts of the U.S. government. "I am not a fan of WikiLeaks, but I don't think it is fair to throw rocks at everything they do," said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a group specializing in online privacy and other digital rights. "What WikiLeaks is demonstrating is that the CIA does not have the best interests of these companies at heart." BETTER THAN NOTHING There's one more unknown, which is just how much help WikiLeaks can actually provide. Apple, Google and Microsoft say they've already rendered many of the alleged CIA cyberespionage tools obsolete with earlier updates that patched related software holes. Still, the companies will probably want to check out what WikiLeaks has, assuming that the organization hasn't set unreasonable conditions on its cooperation. Some privacy and security experts believe the CIA's own refusal to contact the affected companies about the vulnerabilities gives them little choice. "We all should have better security, and certainly at this point, not trying to fixing them makes no sense," Cohn said. ___ Liedtke reported from San Ramon, Calif. Raphael Satter in Paris, Paisley Dodds in London and Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that purported CIA tools are not aimed at "defeating encryption" but at hijacking computers.

The newly announced PowerVR Furian offers improvements over Imagination's current-standing tech, with 35% greater GFLOPS density and 80% greater fillrate density. This essentially translates to noticeably improved performance in day-to-day casual gaming and user interface experiences, but the Furian's capabilities don't stop there. In addition to optimizing multiple graphics APIs, like OpenCL 2.0, OpenVX 1.1, and Vulkan, the chip tech also promises 70%-90% gaming density improvement - a boon to more demanding games on mobile devices. This power is especially handy when aforementioned demanding games use augmented reality or virtual reality - two capabilities Imagination specifically had in mind when making the architecture for Furian.   Will it make it to iPhone 8? Imagination's technologies have made repeat appearances in Apple's A-series chips, making it likely we'll see a modified PowerVR Furian GPU featured in upcoming iPhones. In fact, a variant of Furian's predecessor, the PowerVR Rogue, was recently used in the Apple A10 chipset that powers the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.   While it would seem logical to conclude that the iPhone maker has eyes for Furian, Apple has also been showing signs of wanting to go make its own chips independently, even going so far as considering buying Imagination Technologies outright last year. That said, Imagination says the first products utilizing its latest graphics tech will be unveiled "mid-2017," which could come just in time if Furian is expected to debut inside the iPhone 8 later this year.

Photographer: Andrew Testa/The New York Times WASHINGTON — Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, said Thursday that the anti-secrecy organization would work with Apple, Google and other technology companies to fix flaws that have allowed the CIA to hack into the phones, computers and other devices they produce. Speaking from London in an online news conference, Assange accused the CIA of withholding information about the vulnerabilities the agency was exploiting in U.S. technology even after it realized documents describing the flaws had been leaked weeks ago. While some companies have already fixed the weaknesses revealed in a batch of secret CIA documents made public by WikiLeaks on Tuesday, Assange said, others say they need more technical information on the hacking techniques. “There’s a limited ability to try and produce security fixes for iPhones, for Samsung TVs, for Android phones produced by Google, for Microsoft, for Linux, because the exact technical details are not known,” Assange said. “We have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details we have, so that fixes can be developed and pushed out so people can be secured.” For Assange, it was a remarkable turning of the tables. He presented himself as a defender of some of the most prominent U.S. technology companies against their own government’s overreaching and double-dealing. The CIA responded with an unusually full response, attacking Assange’s credibility and noting that any spying it does is restricted by law to foreigners and foreign countries, with Americans off limits. “As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity,” Heather Fritz Horniak, an agency spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.” The statement declined to acknowledge the authenticity of the more than 8,000 documents from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence that WikiLeaks posted online, although officials have said privately that the leaked material is genuine. The disclosure has set off a hunt for the leaker, who officials have said was most likely an agency insider or contractor.

Before these changes, developers on Apple's iOS and Mac App Stores had the ability to change description text, and "What's New?" information at will. However, since the change, developers can only make changes to the Privacy Policy of an application. If a developer wishes to make changes to an app description, such as changing a typo, the only way to do so is to create a new app version with the desired changes made and submit it to App Review, the screening service for the App Store, to be approved. This could mean greater inconvenience for developers, who could now have to contend with a longer App Review queue, as more updates which only include minor changes await the approval of App Review. Apple has not released a statement or offered any reasoning for the changes, which come amid reports that malware on Google's Play Store has been forcing users to give apps five-star reviews in order to avoid adverts. Update: Apple has since reverted the changes and developers are now able to edit app information without App Review approval, as before.

Assange, who is living in Ecuador's embassy in London, spoke on Facebook Live. His appearance came two days after WikiLeaks published 7,818 pages of documents and 943 attachments that are part of what it says is the "largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency." "The Central Intelligence Agency lost control of its entire cyberweapons arsenal," Assange said. "This is an historic act of devastating incompetence to have created such an arsenal and stored it all in one place and not secured it." WikiLeaks said the documents, called Vault 7, contain several hundred million lines of code, providing "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA." WikiLeaks did not release the computer code because Assange said Thursday he doesn't want "journalists and people of the world, our sources, being hacked using these weapons." He wants to first give the information to companies such as Apple, Google and Samsung. "We have decided to work with [manufacturers] to give them exclusive access to the additional technological details we have so that fixes can be developed and pushed out," Assange said. "Once this material is effectively disarmed by us we will publish additional details." Assange didn't say when the code would be handed over to the companies. The programs have allowed the CIA to tap into phones -- Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows -- and Samsung smart TVs, WikiLeaks said. Tech companies, including Google and Apple, said many vulnerabilities exposed in the documents have already been patched. And Microsoft said most of the issues apparently involved older technology corrected with more modern systems. CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said the CIA is prohibited from conducting electronic surveillance targeting individuals in the United States. "As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity," Boyd told NBC News on Thursday. "Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries." The FBI launched a criminal investigation into the document dump. Since 2012, Assange, 45, an Australian citizen, has lived in exile to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he has been accused of sexual assault. Assange also could be extradited to the United States, where he could be prosecuted for WikiLeaks' release of classified U.S. embassy cables.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Will your next operating system be a game engine? Will your next operating system be a game engine? By Aaron Krumins on March 9, 2017 at 3:00 pm Comment If you’re not a gaming enthusiast, you probably aren’t familiar with software engines like the Unreal Engine or Unity Engine. That’s because until recently, outside the world of computer games, these software packages didn’t possess a great deal of relevance. All that stands to change in the near future, and we have virtual reality to thank for it. To understand the coming ascendancy of the game engine as the primary platform for personal computing, let’s take a macroscopic look at the development of the operating system, dating back to MS-DOS era. For those familiar with the command prompt, the original MS-DOS was a glowing one-dimensional command line into which we GUI-less humans could type commands. With the advent of Apple’s original Macintosh (later called the Macintosh 128K), a seismic shift took place with and we gained the “desktop” OS, replete with low-res folders that could be dragged about with a mouse. And that’s where we have pretty much been stuck for the last three decades, at least on the desktop. Apple’s embrace of touch launched a new world of smartphone interfaces, but the desktop and laptop markets have continued to refine principles first articulated decades ago. But it was likely inevitable that the two-dimensional user interface would give way to a three-dimensional one. Now the first stirrings of such a revolution are upon us as can be seen in the advent of augmented and virtual reality. How would you like it if instead of relegating old files to a trash bin, you could heave them sorcerer-style into a glowing inferno straight out of Mordor, smiling with satisfaction as they crackle and pop in the ghoulish half-light? (Sounds distracting -Ed). I take it as a fait accompli that AR and VR will gain ascendancy in the mainstream, for the same reason we prefer three-dimensional interactions with our friends to two-dimensional ones. This is where game engines have a leg up on other software platforms, having been working in 3D environments for a long time. Granted, some of the early 3D games like Doom and Myst felt pretty stilted. But we have come a long way since then, as anyone who has experienced Witcher 3 will understand. In a recent conversation with VentureBeats, Tim Sweeney of Unreal Engine fame explained how the folks at Epic Games are positioning themselves for a VR-first world, one in which the bulk of our computing time is spent in virtual worlds. By creating an easy-to-use system in which non-nerds can navigate 3D content and populate virtual worlds, Sweeney and company are creating the Lego system of the future — the one in which a large percentage of the population stands to spend an enormous amount of time. I recently had a chance to test drive the latest software tools in Unreal Engine. I was shocked by how easy it was to grab a 3D model off the internet and place it into a virtual reality landscape that could be viewed on a smartphone headset like the Samsung Gear VR. While not exactly child’s play, it was within the reach of a non-programmer, and from previews of Epic’s forthcoming VR Editor, the process stands to only get easier. Check out the above video for a peak at how one might envision moving files about in an operating system of the future.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← Kansas – Carry On Wayward Son It’s still winter…. → CIA contractors likely source of latest WikiLeaks release: U.S. officials Posted on March 9, 2017 by Shalom Reuters Contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the Central Intelligence Agency’s use of hacking tools to anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on Tuesday.   According to the documents, CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones, devices running Google’s Android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software. The White House said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump was “extremely concerned” about the CIA security breach that led to the WikiLeaks release. “Anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law,” spokesman Sean Spicer said. The two officials told Reuters they believed the published documents about CIA hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. One of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the CIA have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that WikiLeaks published, and then going over their computer logs, emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible. On Tuesday in a press release, WikiLeaks itself said the CIA had “lost control” of an archive of hacking methods and it appeared to have been circulated “among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.” The CIA, which is the United States’ civilian foreign intelligence service, declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents. The agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad “to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries” and to be “innovative, cutting-edge, and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad.” The CIA is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the United States and “does not do so”, the statement added. CONTRACTORS MUST BE ‘LOYAL TO AMERICA’ A U.S. government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the CIA both to open investigations into such leaks. U.S. officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of WikiLeaks and its personnel. A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded. It is not clear if the investigation of the latest CIA leaks is part of the probe. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) while working for the National Security Agency. U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and a Democrat on the intelligence committee, said the government needed to stop the breaches. “I think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce, because you have to be loyal to America to work for an intelligence agency, otherwise don’t do it,” Feinstein said. Both U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the CIA breach, congressional officials said. Some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities, though an interagency review process set up under former President Barack Obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure. Those concerns would grow if U.S. authorities did not notify companies that CIA documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised. Apple, Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a CIA breach before WikiLeaks made its files public. At Apple, none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic, though analysis was continuing, according to a person who spoke with engineers there. Google’s director of information security and privacy, Heather Adkins, said in a statement: “As we’ve reviewed the documents, we’re confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android (operating systems) already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities. Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections.” LARGER NUMBER OF CONTRACTORS One reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by Russian intelligence, another official said, is that so far there is no evidence that Russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published. One European official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the WikiLeaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between European intelligence agencies and U.S. counterparts, which share concerns about Russian intelligence operations. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to tilt last year’s U.S. presidential election in Trump’s favor, including by hacking into Democratic Party emails. Moscow has denied the allegation. One major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has “exploded” because of federal budget constraints, the first U.S. official said. U.S. intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the “internet of things” that connects cars, home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks, or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector, the official said. Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents. A person familiar with WikiLeaks’ activities said the group has had the CIA hacking material for months, and that the release of the material was in the works “for a long time.” In Germany on Wednesday, the chief federal prosecutor’s office said that it would review the WikiLeaks documents because some suggested that the CIA ran a hacking hub from the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt. “We will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators,” a spokesman for the federal prosecutor’s office told Reuters. Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit Washington on March 14 for her first meeting with Trump, who has sharply criticized Berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    In 2009, scientists at the Arecbio Observatory in Puerto Rico started receiving a signal from space. It was a historic discovery. The Observatory had been searching for signs of extra-terrestrial signals, and one was starting to some in from about 25 light years away. The scientists asked NASA to use the Hubble Telescope to determine the source. The $3 billion satellite couldn’t pinpoint anything to explain where the signal was coming from. But the signals were decipherable. Located in the VHF band, it turned out to be 47-year old signals bounced back from earth, specifically the BBC program Doctor Who. The BBC was excited—many of these episodes had been lost, seemingly forever. After all, these episodes aired in the days when tape storage was expensive and the thought of reruns hadn’t been developed. That means there are no little green men, or an imminent Dalek invasion— at least that we know of. But what could have been an extra-terrestrial communication turned out to be an opportunity to get back something once thought lost here on Earth. As investors, it seems that lost opportunities are the most painful losses of all. Everyone can relate to selling a stock before a huge move higher. Or selling a company at a loss that would have eventually delivered life-changing returns. I get it. I kick myself sometimes over what might have been too. For instance, back in 2003, I was considering investing in McDonald’s (MCD). We all know the company and what it does. But it had fallen on hard times, posting its first quarterly loss in its history. In the rush to increase same-store sales, the company started a $1 Big Mac promotion that ended up costing around $1.10 per Big Mac sold. Things righted eventually, but I didn’t buy until early 2009, in the low $50’s. While that was still a bit of a discount from the stock’s pre-crash peak, I missed the chance to buy at $15 near the panic-lows of 2003. But, as I keep telling myself, so what? I’ve made money on the stock, just at a later time. And the commodity stocks I invested in during the early 2000’s did better than McDonald’s would have. Yet, sometimes, I still kick myself mentally for giving into short-term fear and ignoring the bargain. I know if I’m kicking myself over a seemingly lost opportunity, I’m not alone. Many investors think the same way. It’s the way our minds are wired! But that’s even worse than crying over spilled milk—at least that’s something that happens. We’re not Time Lords. We can’t change the past. And it’s not worth our time in the present to do so. It’s important to look back only to learn the lessons we need to do better in the future. Fortunately, that’s something we can do. We can avoid future missed opportunities by finding quality names that are out of favor in the present. Since the start of the year, as markets have crept higher, a few companies haven’t gone along for the ride. In fact, they’re down double digits as I write. And chances are, at some point in the future, investors buying today would look back and be grateful that they picked up shares. That’s because the companies I’m talking about are industry leaders that have simply fallen prey to short-term, but recoverable bad news. In other words, some of today’s best opportunities are values hiding in plain sight. Not buying them could be a future lost opportunity. For instance, consider chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM). It’s a position down double-digits year to date, even as the market surges higher. The company was hit by a $1 billion lawsuit by Apple (AAPL) last month. But why should a company facing a $1 billion lawsuit lose multiples of that in its market cap? It shouldn’t. That’s especially true when you consider Apple’s claim. They’re saying the company charged more for wireless chips used in iPhones and the like. Yet Qualcomm simply licenses out their technology. They charge a fixed rate based on the sale cost. If Apple doesn’t like how much they’re paying Qualcomm, they could fix it by charging less for their iPhones. That’s why I don’t see merit in the lawsuit—but I do see an opportunity in shares here. I’ve been buying up shares to add to an already sizeable position. I think Qualcomm’s future prospects are that tremendous. Another opportunity today is in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) space. Shares are better off than they were a year ago, when the Fed first announced a series of rate hikes. But fears of an interest rate hike later this month have sent shares down in recent days. I don’t see interest rates going significantly higher for a long time. There’s too much debt in the system, and raising rates too quickly would send the economy into a tailspin. Thus, a slow-moving central bank should keep interest-rate sensitive stocks like REITs from getting hurt operationally over the next few years. In the REIT space, Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) stands out to me as a bargain. That’s because this REIT invests in healthcare facilities, a growing demographic need that can bypass a lot of the short-term interest rate fears that currently impact the REIT market. In early 2015, shares of the REIT peaked at $44.50. Two years later, they’re trading near $30. That’s a 33 percent drop in two years, but one that seems on the mend. And with a dividend yield of nearly 8 percent, investors are getting paid well while this opportunity plays out. With dividends representing a huge portion of an investor’s return over a lifetime in the markets, buying today’s high yielders at a discount means income now without having to buy high-priced bonds that might sell off as the Fed raises rates. As with recovering seemingly lost episodes of Doctor Who, the name of the game is patience. Investors who wait for the best companies can get them at great prices if they’re willing to wait. They risk overpaying otherwise. It’s worth getting the best, even if you have to wait. Sometimes there are many opportunities to buy quality names at a great price, sometimes not. Quality investments at a reasonable price are few today, but they’re out there. Brave the fear for the best profits. Andrew Packer is a Senior Financial Editor with Newsmax Media.

Thursday, March 9, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Half the AirPods for a Tenth the Price Adam C. Engst: I won’t pretend that either of these earbuds is anywhere near as good as Apple’s AirPods. They’re not: their Bluetooth pairing can be annoying, audio quality won’t be as good, battery life is shorter, it’s more difficult to plug in their charging cables, their microphone quality is weak, and neither supports Siri or voice commands. And heck, you only get one, something that AirPods allow but don’t require. But these earbuds are so cheap that you may not care. I wrote this while at the ASMC Summit, a conference for independent Apple resellers, and when I showed these two little earbuds to one attendee, he said that he didn’t even bring his AirPods to the conference for fear of losing them. Just as the best digital camera is the one in your pocket, the best earbud is the one you have with you. Also, I’m talking about a category which has many more than these two entrants. When you search for “Bluetooth earbud” on Amazon, you’ll see a variety of comparable products with slightly different industrial designs that you might find more compelling. Some are as cheap as $5, and there’s no reason I can see to spend more than $20 given how similar they look. I wouldn’t expect any of them to last for all that long, and they’d be easy to lose, but a super low price makes up for a lot of sins. Prior to getting AirPods, I used a Jawbone headset, which had many of the same issues, except that it cost almost as much as the AirPods. Even so, I usually preferred it to wired earbuds. So even if you don’t want AirPods, I recommend giving one of these a try. AirPods Audio Bluetooth iOS Jawbone Comments Stay up-to-date by subscribing to the Comments RSS Feed for this post.

Sign up now close New study finds zero-day flaws live for 7 years, supporting stockpiling Liam Tung (CSO Online) on 10 March, 2017 02:43 0 - - - - print email Life span of 200 zero-days from one exploit developer. Credit: RAND Corporation On the heels of WikiLeaks’s CIA hacking kit dump, RAND Corporation has released a study that looked at 200 zero-day exploits, some of which have remained un-patched and under wraps since 2002. The study, which offers a rare look into the life of zero-day exploits, found the average life expectancy of an exploit was 6.9 years after initial discovery. The exploit’s life ends when it is patched by the vendor, either because it was publicly disclosed or a second person finds the flaw and reports it to the vendor. ”The relatively long life expectancy of 6.9 years means that zero-day vulnerabilities—in particular the ones that exploits are created for gray, or government, market use—are likely old,” the report notes. The report is relevant to discussions about WikiLeaks’ Tuesday release of more than 8,000 documents sketching out dozens of hacking tools the CIA had allegedly acquired for use in surveillance operations between 2013 and 2016. WikiLeaks hasn't released the source code. The exploits detailed are for flaws in major operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS, as well as browsers. Google and Apple have said that their respective mobile users are shielded from most of the flaws in the WikiLeaks dump. The leak has raised questions whether spy agencies are stockpiling the exploits. Firefox maker Mozilla called on the CIA and WikiLeaks to disclose these bugs to vendors in order to protect users. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said that documents suggested the CIA hadn't followed the US Government's Vulnerabilities Equities Process, which guides whether agencies like the NSA and CIA withhold the flaw for its own use, or disclose it for the vendor to fix. The CIA has said that it does not use these exploits to target US citizens. Read more ​Office 365 Deployment: Do you have what it takes? The 200 zero-day exploits RAND acquired for its analysis are un-patched flaws affecting software from 64 vendors, including Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, Google, Citrix, LinkSys, and CryptoCat. The oldest date back to 2002 and the newest were found in 2016. RAND said it was supplied the zero days from a vulnerability research organization it calls BUSBY, which consists of 18 hackers. RAND’s statistical analysis found that within one year 5.7 percent of a given stockpile of zero-day vulnerabilities will have been discovered by an outsider, resulting in a “collision” or two researchers finding the same bug. The data suggests that most zero days held by agencies like the CIA are exclusive to them for several years. The report’s authors argue that the low collision rate (5.7 percent a year) and the long average lifespan (6.9 years) of zero days lends support to the argument that holders not disclose the bug. That’s because disclosing a vulnerability may only offer modest protection for users, and therefore keeping quiet about it —or “stockpiling” the vulnerabilities — may be reasonable for entities like governments looking defend their own systems and potentially exploit flaws in others', the firm writes.

But deciding whether to stockpile or publicly disclose a zero-day vulnerability—or its corresponding exploit—is a game of tradeoffs, particularly for governments.” The study also looked at number of other features of the zero day market, including the price of buying bugs, the cost of finding and developing an exploit, and hacker wages. It also compares career span of exploit developers compared with white hat bug hunters, for example those who earn rewards from Google and Microsoft bounties. Excluding researchers who found just one bug, the study found 284 white hat hackers career spanned 2.49 years compared with 18 BUSBY exploit developers’ 4.49 year average.

Mushroom 11, a newly released puzzle platformer, is the main feature in the App Store right now, with Monument Valley, Device 6, Super Hexagon, Transistor, and Superbrothers: Sword & Sorcery also receiving top billing at the current time. There are also a number of categories that have been updated with a selection of indie games, inclduing "Indie games celebrate innovation," "Outstanding gameplay," "Unforgettable stories" and "Incredible sound design." According to our sister site TouchArcade, Apple's indie games promotion may be the reason some high profile indie titles are coming out over the course of the next few days, including Bit City, Typeshift, and Card Thief. Most of the highlighted apps aren't on sale during this promotion, but it gives iOS gamers a way to find quality games that they may have missed. 6 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) ArtOfWarfare 1 week ago It'll be interesting to see what the Switch does to the iOS game market. You can build Switch games in Unity, same as iOS games. The Switch Dev kit is rumored to be ~$500, so the barrier to entry will be quite a bit lower than on past Nintendo systems. Will we see a lot of former iOS game developers move to the Switch? Will games made for the Switch come out on iOS? Could end up being a win-win situation... although the Switch comes with physical controls, whereas iOS games really can't be built with the assumption the player will have a proper controller. Rating: 2 Votes Fzang 1 week ago It'll be interesting to see what the Switch does to the iOS game market. Probably not much. The iPhone has had impressive specs for years, but has only managed to cement itself as the king of freemium garbage.

IMHO a gaming platform not based Android won't have the chance to change the gaming landscape. The war has been fought. The Switch - with all its fantastic power and features - will be a niche product. A desirable one, but niche nonetheless. Initiatives like Unity will make the platform a less no-go.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Health Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Health Apple Acquisition: Israeli Facial Recognition Tech Startup Posted By: James AlryckPosted date: March 09, 2017In: Technology Apple Inc. is known for its innovative technological advances, sleek product designs, and simple user interfaces. Aligning with their values, Apple has purchased an Israeli startup company Realface. Known for its development of the facial recognition system, Realface has changed the game of social media forever. However, leveraging their buying power, Apple is now the proud owner of the game changing technology. Apple has purchased two other Israeli startups over the past few years. In 2013, Apple purchased a 3D sensing startup PrimeSense. PrimeSense was aiming to interest gaming companies to implement the motion sensing technology into video game consoles such as Microsoft’s Xbox Kinnect technology. But, they were happy to oblige when Apple offered them between 300 and 350 million dollars, according to a report by TechCrunch. Then, in 2015, Apple purchased LinX. A tech startup which develops high end cameras for mobile devices. How will it change the game? Originally, the technology was designed to assemble photos of an individual from different social media platforms similar to Facebook’s tagging feature. But currently people are speculating that Apple has more mundane features in mind for the AI technology. According to a recent article by Forbes, Apple plans on using the facial technology to increase the ease of securing the next generation of Iphone. Currently the standard in mitigating the ease-of-access issue with security concerns on the Iphone is the “Touch ID” function which utilizes the unique finger print of the owner to unlock the phone and authenticate purchases in the Itunes store. Apple’s pitch when releasing Touch ID was that you are already putting your finger on the button to activate the phones screen, so why not unlock it as well. A practical ease-of-access solution. Apparently taking this a step further Apple say, why put your finger on your phone when you’re already looking at it. Realface + Emotient May Equal a Potent Combination Earlier this year Apple also acquired San Diego-based startup Emotient. A company specializing in futuristic technology that utilizes micro expressions to detect human emotions. According to Fortune the gobbling up of AI based micro expression technology has been the popular thing to do in Silicon Valley. Citing aqcuisitions by two of the heaviest hitters in tech, Facebook and Google. What didn’t make Fortune list was mobile companies. So even with the social media giants already well into the development of facial recognition AI, leave it to Apple to blaze the trail for mobile devices. But what could Apple be doing with the Technology? My intuition tells me that the most innovative mobile company ever will use the most advanced technology available to simply unlock the device. It seems to me that Apple’s software engineers will get their hands on the code for Realface and Emotient and begin developing applications beyond our wildest dreams. We know currently that websites monitor user search habits to create a unique advertising experience. What if Apple took that to another level? Apple now has the tools in front of them to create a mobile advertising experience based on the emotions of the phone owner. You unlock your phone feeling sad on a week day. Prepare for movie times and ice cream deals. You open your phone on a weekend feeling happy. Groupon and event advertisements fill your web browser. I am obviously just speculating here, but we must consider all of the companies Apple has purchased if we truly want to predict what is coming next.  Post Views: 515 Like 0 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Share 0 Related Articles What can we expect from the Final Fantasy VII Remake?

MI5 and CIA have been spying on us through our TVs – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 15 C Harare Friday, March 17, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home International MI5 and CIA have been spying on us through our TVs International News MI5 and CIA have been spying on us through our TVs Mar 9, 2017 0 1551 By Richard Hartley-Parkinson | Metro | Samsung is ‘urgently’ investigating claims from WikiLeaks that intelligence agencies have used the firm’s smart TVs as part of tools to spy on users. The whistleblowing website has published thousands of documents it claims reveal the various hacking tools used by the CIA in the US, including techniques which target various consumer software, including Windows, Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS software. The leaked report also claims software was developed to turn Samsung smart TVs into listening devices, a project codenamed Weeping Angel which the report claims also included input from the UK’s MI5. The Korean technology giant has now said it is investigating the claims made by WikiLeaks. ‘Protecting consumers’ privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung,’ the company said in a statement. ‘We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter.’ The leaked documents claim a ‘fake-off’ mode was created which tricked users into believing their TV screen was off when instead it was secretly recording audio that would be sent to CIA servers once the screen was turned back on and an internet connection re-established. Many modern, internet-connected TVs come with voice control options, meaning a microphone is placed inside the device in order to pick up voice commands issued by users. In 2015, Samsung warned users not to speak of ‘personal or sensitive information’ within listening distance of some its smart TVs as that information ‘will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party’ after it emerged that, once activated, the voice control feature would ‘listen’ to what was being said and share it with Samsung or third parties. And MI5 says it needs to be able to access communications or other information in order to gain ‘valuable intelligence’ in national security investigations. The IP Act introduced a strengthened authorisation regime for the use of EI, including a requirement for bulk operations to be ‘foreign-focused’ and signed off by a judicial commissioner. Apple also responded to the report by reiterating its stance on consumer privacy, but it also urged users to ensure their devices are running the most up-to-date software to ensure their security. ‘Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ privacy and security,’ the iPhone maker said in a statement. ‘The technology built into today’s iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we’re constantly working to keep it that way. ‘Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80% of users running the latest version of our operating system. ‘While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. ‘We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.’ Google declined to comment on WikiLeaks’ claims. The Home Office said it does not comment on intelligence matters or leaked documents.

The decision to provide the more detailed specifications came after tech firms began reaching out to WikiLeaks in hopes of learning more about the government's hacking techniques. Assange said his organization will grant access to companies—including Apple, Google and Samsung—so they can see vulnerabilities discovered in their operating systems. "We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out," Assange said. Assange explained WikiLeaks decided not to publish said details because it didn't want "journalists and people of the world, our sources, being hacked using these weapons." Apple addressed the reported security flaws documented in the data dump on Wednesday, stating the vulnerabilities had already been fixed. Likewise, Google said it had reviewed the documents and believed that its operating systems were secure and not at risk of attack from the leaked hacks.  International Business Times reached out to Google, Apple and Samsung to learn if the companies had been in touch with WikiLeaks or had received any additional documents from the organization. The companies have yet to provide an answer. It is unclear just how much detail WikiLeaks left out of its cache of information gathered from the CIA's hacking operations, which it released on Tuesday. Dubbed Vault 7, the data dump contained 8,761 files that detailed the CIA's hacking arsenal.  Revealed within the documents is a dedicated team of hackers who produce malware and other malicious programs designed to infect mobiles devices, including developers working to infect iOS and Android phones and tablets. The leak also included details as to how the CIA is able to spy on conversations through a hacked smart TV.  "The Central Intelligence Agency lost control of its entire cyberweapons arsenal," Assange said at his press conference, held at the Embassy of Ecuador in London. "This is an historic act of devastating incompetence to have created such an arsenal and stored it all in one place and not secured it."

Posted 10 Mar 2017 00:15 Updated 10 Mar 2017 04:45 WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy, in central London, Britain February 5, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO: Wikileaks will provide technology companies with exclusive access to CIA hacking tools that it possesses so they can patch software flaws, founder Julian Assange said on Thursday, presenting Silicon Valley with a potential dilemma on how to deal with the anti-secrecy group. If the offer is legitimate, it would place technology companies in the unusual position of relying on Assange, a man believed by some U.S. officials and lawmakers to be an untrustworthy pawn of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to share cyber vulnerabilities stockpiled by a secretive U.S. spy agency. It was not clear how WikiLeaks intended to cooperate with the companies. The group published documents on Tuesday describing secret Central Intelligence Agency hacking tools and snippets of computer code. It did not publish the full programs that would be needed to actually conduct cyber exploits against phones, computers and Internet-connected televisions. "Considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that the fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure," Assange said during an online press conference from the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Assange took refuge at the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape, which he denies. Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc , whose wares are subject to attacks described in the documents, said in response to Assange that they welcomed submissions of any vulnerabilities through normal reporting channels. "We've seen Julian Assange's statement and have not yet been contacted," a Microsoft representative said. "Our preferred method for anyone with knowledge of security issues, including the CIA or Wikileaks, is to submit details to us at secure@microsoft.com so we can review information and take any necessary steps to protect customers." Representatives of Alphabet Inc's Google , Apple Inc , Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei, whose products were also featured in the CIA catalog, did not answer requests for comment. Responding to Assange, CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu, said in a statement: "As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity." "Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries." WikiLeaks' disclosures this week caused alarmed in the technology world and among consumers because of the potential privacy implications of the cyber espionage tactics that were described. One file described a program known as Weeping Angel that purportedly could take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. Other documents described ways to hack into Apple iPhones, devices running Google's Android software and other gadgets in a way that could observe communications before they are protected by end-to-end encryption offered by messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. Several companies have already said they are confident that their recent security updates have accounted for the purported flaws described in the CIA documents. Apple said in a statement on Tuesday that "many of the issues" leaked had already been patched in the latest version of its operating system. WikiLeaks' publication of the documents reignited a debate about whether U.S. intelligence agencies should hoard serious cyber security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public. An interagency process created under former President Barack Obama called for erring on the side of disclosure. CIA SECURITY President Donald Trump believes changes are needed to safeguard secrets at the CIA, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Thursday. "He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated." Two U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday that intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of a breach at the CIA, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said contractors likely breached security and handed over the documents to WikiLeaks. The CIA has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents leaked, but the officials said they believed the pages about hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton while working for the National Security Agency. Assange said he possessed "a lot more information" about the CIA's cyber arsenal that would be released soon. He criticized the CIA for "devastating incompetence" for not being able to control access to such sensitive material, and asked whether Obama or Trump were made aware of the breaches. Assange's group released Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign that U.S. intelligence agencies say were hacked by Russia to try to tilt the election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He is regarded with distaste by many in Washington, although Trump, then the Republican candidate, supported the group's email releases last year. Ben Sasse, a Republican senator, said in a statement on Thursday that Assange should "spend the rest of his life wearing an orange jumpsuit." He is "an enemy of the American people and an ally to Vladimir Putin" who has "has dedicated his life’s work to endangering innocent lives, abetting despots, and stoking a crisis of confidence in the West," Sasse said.

The announcement came two days after WikiLeaks published close to 9,000 documents purportedly detailing CIA efforts to hack smart phones, smart TVs and other devices for covert surveillance operations. The CIA has yet to acknowledge the authenticity of these documents. The initial document dump didn’t include any actual hacking tools, but merely described which devices and operating systems had been affected. Some of the affected tech companies have since chimed in to assure consumers that their products are safe. Google said Wednesday that its security updates “already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities.” Apple used very similar wording in a release Tuesday, claiming that many of the issues were already resolved thanks to previous security patches. Related New WikiLeaks Document Dump Suggests the Use of Smart TVs for Surveillance Samsung told Variety Wednesday that it was “urgently looking into the matter.” A handful of the published documents had detailed attempts to turn some of the company’s older smart TVs into wiretapping devices, with plans to use integrated microphones to record conversations. A security expert with experience in smart TV hacking told Variety Tuesday that many of the technical details in those documents checked out, but that the efforts were best described as a work in progress. WikiLeaks’ now-announced plan to share vulnerabilities with manufacturers before releasing them more widely actually follows a long-established practice in security circles. Dubbed responsible disclosure, the idea is to balance the public’s right to know about vulnerabilities in the products they own with the ability of manufacturers to fix those vulnerabilities before anyone abuses them. The problem is that companies like Google often depend on partners, including phone carriers, to distribute patches to their products. This can leave older phones vulnerable to hacks even if more recent version of Google’s Android operating system have been patched.

The anti-secrecy group published documents on Tuesday describing secret Central Intelligence Agency hacking tools and snippets of computer code. It did not publish the full programs that would be needed to actually conduct cyber exploits against phones, computers and Internet-connected televisions.Representatives of Alphabet Inc's Google Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), all of whose wares are subject to attacks described in the documents, did not immediately respond to requests for comment before regular business hours on the U.S. West Coast."Considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that the fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure," Assange said during a press conference broadcast via Facebook Live.Responding to Assange's comments, CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu, said in a statement, "As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity.""Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries." The disclosures alarmed the technology world and among consumers concerned about the potential privacy implications of the cyber espionage tactics that were described.One file described a programme known as Weeping Angel that purportedly could take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room.Other documents described ways to hack into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhones, devices running Google's (GOOGL.O) Android software and other gadgets in a way that could observe communications before they are protected by end-to-end encryption offered by messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. Several companies have already said they are confident that their recent security updates have already accounted for the purported flaws described in the CIA documents. Apple said in a statement on Tuesday that "many of the issues" leaked had already been patched in the latest version of its operating system.WikiLeaks' publication of the documents reignited a debate about whether U.S. intelligence agencies should hoard serious cyber security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public. An interagency process created under former President Barack Obama called for erring on the side of disclosure.President Donald Trump believed changes were needed to safeguard secrets at the CIA, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Thursday. "He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated."Two U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday that intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of a breach at the CIA, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said contractors likely breached security and handed over the documents to WikiLeaks. The CIA has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents leaked, but the officials said they believed the pages about hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic.Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH.N) while working for the National Security Agency.Assange said he possessed "a lot more information" about the CIA's cyber arsenal that would be released soon. He criticized the CIA for "devastating incompetence" for not being able to control access to such sensitive material. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the populist UK Independence Party, visited Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London earlier on Thursday. A representative for Farage said he was unaware what was discussed.Assange has been holed up since 2012 at the embassy, where he fled to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape, which he denies.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), may operate in similar consumer electronics and software sectors but their business models are rather different and quite interesting to contrast. At Apple, the spectre of Steve Jobs still looms large and the company remains very guarded about the few consumer products it develops in-house. Google’s corporate restructuring into the Alphabet holding company, on the other hand, is a clear acknowledgement of attempts to spread Google from its search engine beginnings to further investments in life sciences, robotics, home appliances and much more.  On February 24th, online business and design blog Co.Design, a feature published by tech business news outlet Fast Company, released visualizations of “innovation signatures” for Apple and Google. These blob-like formations indicate both how many patents have been earned by individual employees as well as the number of connections with co-inventors from within each company. The innovation signatures render some interesting discoveries, notably that innovation at Apple is more highly concentrated in the hands of fewer inventors. Despite that, on average, Apple still lists more inventors per patent than Google does. The conclusion: “Google has a more distributed, open-source approach to new products.” That is one way to characterize the findings, but if you scratch even lightly below the surface there is far more to be told. Apple has long utilized a business model with a heavy focus on research and development, investing in innovation to improve its successful consumer electronics products, obtaining patents and then dominating an entire sector. In the past we have referred to this Apple business model as innovate, patent, dominate, repeat. By contrast, Google has operated in more of an open innovation environment. For example, Apple sells more smartphones than Google, but more Android phones are sold overall because more companies are selling Android phones. This is not surprising for those familiar with Apple’s long history of tightly controlling its products, which dates back to the early days of the PC movement. Given the growing tide of efficient infringement among tech businesses, it is no doubt much easier for a company such as Google to operate in an open innovation way, applying open source principles to patented technologies from outside of the company as well as from those inside the company and partners. In fact, these excellent visualizations almost certainly show why Google has for so long pursued an agenda to weaken the U.S. patent system. When you have such disparate innovation that lacks focus you simply cannot afford to license all the rights you will trample. Ignoring rights as if they don’t exist seems to be the Google solution. One way to characterize Google’s disparate innovation based activities is to say that the company engages in wide ranging innovation activities in a variety of different technology areas. Another way, and perhaps a far more accurate way, is to notice that Google’s innovation activities are rather scattered and lack focus. As a result of their different R&D operations, both Google and Apple may be financially successful in the current moment but Apple has a more diversified portfolio of successful products, seemingly ironic in the face of a higher concentration of patents among inventors.  Before anyone challenges the previous statement about Apple’s diversified portfolio, let’s go to the numbers. Alphabet’s earnings report for 2016’s fourth quarter shows that revenues from its Google segment brought in $89.5 billion of the $90.3 total revenues earned by the company during the quarter and nearly $80 billion of the Google segment revenues came from advertising. By contrast, Apple’s earning report for the first quarter of 2017 does show that iPhone sales outpace all other sectors, contributing $54.4 billion to quarterly net sales, but Apple’s iPad, Mac and Services sectors each contributed between $5.5 billion to $7.2 billion to net sales on the quarter, and other products such as Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats® products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories collectively contributed just over $4 billion to net sales. See page 23 of Apple’s earning report.  The meaning of this comparison couldn’t be any more clear. Google revenue, and therefore the revenue of Alphabet, is almost completely dependent upon Google search and the advertising revenue it creates. Only $800 million in revenue came into Alphabet that was not attributable to Google, which hardly seems possible given Alphabet’s far reaching operations. To call Alphabet highly leveraged on Google would be an extreme understatement. But it just isn’t leverage on Google, Alphabet is highly leveraged on advertising revenue.  Given Alphabet’s extraordinarily heavy reliance on Google’s advertising revenues, a corporate regime that is friendlier to open source ideals should leave investors asking serious questions. What does this mean? What explains Google’s choices? Are they engaging in a form of scatter-shot innovation that throws things up against the wall to see what sticks? Is there any coherent strategy, or is the company just aimlessly looking for the next revenue stream before search advertising revenues eventually begin to fall? For the moment Google dominates searching, but as de facto defunct search engines like HotBot, Dogpile, Altavista and MetaCrawler can attest, you are never more than a couple genius geeks, a dorm room and a beautiful algorithm away from the next tech revolution taking over.  If it were not for efficient infringement it would be impossible for one company to be involved in as many different areas of endeavor as Google/Alphabet have attempted. The only feasible way for them to hunt for the next revenue stream seems to be to scatter-shot innovation by going in numerous different directions without any real focus. Of course, that requires them to ignore the rights of others and pretend we live in an open source world without any patent rights. Ironically, it is this disparate and uncoordinated approach to innovating that is also preventing Google from developing any kind of mastery outside of their core search competency and revenue generating model.* Open source is a path to destruction for any company unless you want to be a service company, and as a service company you are always (and significantly) limited because there are only so many hours in a day you can sell and only so much scale you can achieve. Perhaps the open source focus innovation focus Google pursues will be successful, but if history is a guide the future may not appear all that rosy. One need only to look at the example of Sun Microsystems, which decided in 2006 to make its Java software platform an open source platform. Within a few years Sun’s corporate struggles grew because revenues from services sold through open source platforms are limited compared to what can be earned from leveraging patented technologies.  What this all means for the future depends on your time horizon and a number of events that cannot be predicted with any real accuracy. Google will still dominate search tomorrow, and the day after that, but you are never that far away from what’s next, which can appear suddenly and rip through an industry like a tornado. While Apple has their struggles with respect to putting what are best considered beta products into the streams of commerce since the death of Steve Jobs, their tight innovative focus based on proprietary technology seems better poised to win the future than does the Google approach, which looks a lot like a rather desperate technology giant noticing the early stages of decline and not seeing a future without the cash cow that is advertising revenue. ______________ * Some will no doubt point to Android as a great success, but let’s be honest. Google has failed at virtually everything they try other than search, and Android was pretty clearly a knock-off of the iPhone.

Paul Morinville March 9, 2017 4:22 pm “Android was pretty clearly a knock-off of the iPhone.” For sure the iPhone, but also Palm, Nokia, Microsoft, and dozens of other companies and thousands of inventors that contributed to the development of the smart phone. Over 150,000 patents make up the smart phone. When Google bought Android (a camera operating system) they had NO patents on the smart phone. After being sued, they bought Motorola Mobility for $12B, kept the patents and resold the company for $2B. That gave them 17,000 patents to counter sue the companies who actually invented the smart phones, which protected them from injunctive relief by forcing settlements. Google saw the opportunity that could be made with their brand, money and search results to take the smart phone market. Patents be damned. Inventors be damned. If it is good for Google, it is good. That is when they really started upping the ante in Washington dumping millions of dollars in political contributions to crony lawmakers. That is what patent reform is all about. It is about the smart phone and who owns the technology and the resulting lucrative data on the users, which feeds a multi-billion dollar revenue stream and importantly, plenty of loose cash and favorable search results to bribe politicians who help them. Google is a very evil company. Steve March 9, 2017 5:30 pm Paul, You must check this case on the PTAB platform that went completely below radar detection: http://drrichswier.com/2016/11/28/floridian-sues-google-for-fraud-and-perjury/ Patrick March 9, 2017 9:30 pm Paul, You must check this case on the PTAB platform that went completely below radar detection: http://drrichswier.com/2016/11/28/floridian-sues-google-for-fraud-and-perjury/ Night Writer March 9, 2017 10:27 pm 1) Google said that the biggest fear is to loose their search monopoly overnight to an innovative start-up. 2) 90 percent of their income comes from their search engine. 3) They have been extremely lame at innovating after their initial start-up. EG March 10, 2017 8:30 am “Google is a very evil company.” Hey Paul, Whether or not Google is a “very evil company,” their practices relating to purloining the technologies of others, including their lobbying of Congress to render the US IP system ineffective, is most definitely “very evil.” EG March 10, 2017 8:33 am Hey Paul, Taking a phrase from President Reagan phrase, may be we should refer to Google as “The Evil Empire of the Internet World”? Kind of catchy, in a warped sense. Independent Inventor March 10, 2017 11:02 am Gene — doesn’t the PTO owe an FOIA answer to atty Gary Shuster re Lee today? Anon March 10, 2017 12:33 pm II, Yes. Eric Berend March 10, 2017 3:51 pm Palm did the original “heavy lifting” of hardware and software development to bring a device with integrated functions in a handheld form to the general business and consumer markets. Android rips off Palm; which “nobody” in the IT world cares about, as a so-called “loser”. Linus Torvalds’ collectivist open source development of Linux performed, by far, the greatest portion of so-called “Android” operating system capability. In my opinion, it should be known as an ‘Android’ variant of Linux. Apple’s focused development of ‘haptic’ (e.g., kinesthetic) interface elements integrated into branches of the “*nix” OS family, delivered the ‘touch’ controls now familiar to smartphone usage. The company accomplished this, on its own variant of BSD ‘Unix’ branch; without resort to the Linux codebase. Therefore, it is accurate to regard Google’s so-called “Android” operating system as a mere copy, however illegitimate, of Linux and iOS. There is literally no innovation present, there – merely the leveraging of OS user community coherence based on Linux against the potential of competing technologies: in a manner, much as what people discovered, in the era of Microsoft’s anti-technological ‘FUD’. What is it exactly, that Google/Alphabet purports to have “innovated”; let alone ‘invented’; here? Is ANYTHING they do, NOT pirated from an actual inventor; aside from their own original “flash of genius” search algorithm? Night Writer March 12, 2017 12:13 pm Kind of makes me wonder what incentives Google has in place for their employees to invent. Open Innovation Platform March 13, 2017 7:11 am Open Innovation and Open Source is the way to gain competitive advantage and only Patent Attorneys don’t want admit that. Why? There’s less work for them there. Open Innovation and Open Source make your products more competitive and more accessible that increase your market share. Anon March 13, 2017 2:41 pm OIP, Your “commercial” is simply not true. In either of the technical side or if the aspersion side. On the technical side, you simply ignore the plain logic that anything being shared cannot be a distinguishing factor, and thus cannot be a competitor advantage. On the aspersion side, your claim amounts to an accusation that patent attorneys do not live by their code of ethics. Such ignoble and patently false accusations may slip by the filters every now and then, but your time atop your little soap box will be quite short. Night Writer March 13, 2017 7:13 pm Open source usually means open copying of commercial products. Be real. Linux copied Unix and copied existing code sharing that was on the Internet from the start. I remember nethack from the mid-1980’s (yes I am that old) that was very much like Linux in group development. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

TV app on iOS 10.3 beta 5 in Canada The fifth beta of iOS 10.3 seeded to developers and public testers on Wednesday appears to include the TV app in place of the Videos app for some Canadian users, including myself. For context, my iPhone 7 Plus's region is set to Canada and I am signed into an Apple ID account linked to the Canadian store. While the TV app can be opened, it is not fully functional. The "Watch Now" tab directs users to the "Store" tab, which does not load properly. The main "Library" tab listing TV shows and movies in a user's iTunes library does work, as does the "Search" tab, which integrates with apps such as Netflix. Additionally, a few Canadian users on Reddit claim they do not see the TV app on iOS 10.3 beta 5. Given this is pre-release software, it is unclear if Apple is actually testing the TV app beyond the United States, or if there is simply a bug or glitch. We'll know for sure when iOS 10.3 is officially released. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple launched the TV app on iOS 10.2 in the United States to simplify the television-watching experience and help users discover new TV shows and movies to watch. The app provides a unified experience for accessing your TV shows and movies across multiple video apps, such as Netflix, Hulu, and HBO GO.

If the offer is legitimate, it would place technology companies in the unusual position of relying on Assange, a man believed by some U.S. officials and lawmakers to be an untrustworthy pawn of Russian President Vladimir Putin, to share cyber vulnerabilities stockpiled by a secretive U.S. spy agency. It was not clear how WikiLeaks intended to cooperate with the companies. The group published documents on Tuesday describing secret Central Intelligence Agency hacking tools and snippets of computer code. It did not publish the full programs that would be needed to actually conduct cyber exploits against phones, computers and Internet-connected televisions. "Considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that the fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure," Assange said during an online press conference from the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Assange took refuge at the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape, which he denies. Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc, whose wares are subject to attacks described in the documents, said in response to Assange that they welcomed submissions of any vulnerabilities through normal reporting channels. "We've seen Julian Assange's statement and have not yet been contacted," a Microsoft representative said. "Our preferred method for anyone with knowledge of security issues, including the CIA or Wikileaks, is to submit details to us at secure@microsoft.com so we can review information and take any necessary steps to protect customers." Representatives of Alphabet Inc's Google, Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei[HWT.UL], whose products were also featured in the CIA catalog, did not answer requests for comment. Responding to Assange, CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu, said in a statement: "As we’ve said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity." "Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries." WikiLeaks' disclosures this week caused alarmed in the technology world and among consumers because of the potential privacy implications of the cyber espionage tactics that were described. One file described a program known as Weeping Angel that purportedly could take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. Other documents described ways to hack into Apple iPhones, devices running Google's Android software and other gadgets in a way that could observe communications before they are protected by end-to-end encryption offered by messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. Several companies have already said they are confident that their recent security updates have accounted for the purported flaws described in the CIA documents. Apple said in a statement on Tuesday that "many of the issues" leaked had already been patched in the latest version of its operating system. WikiLeaks' publication of the documents reignited a debate about whether U.S. intelligence agencies should hoard serious cyber security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public. An interagency process created under former President Barack Obama called for erring on the side of disclosure. CIA SECURITY President Donald Trump believes changes are needed to safeguard secrets at the CIA, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Thursday. "He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated." Two U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday that intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of a breach at the CIA, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said contractors likely breached security and handed over the documents to WikiLeaks. The CIA has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents leaked, but the officials said they believed the pages about hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton while working for the National Security Agency. Assange said he possessed "a lot more information" about the CIA's cyber arsenal that would be released soon. He criticized the CIA for "devastating incompetence" for not being able to control access to such sensitive material, and asked whether Obama or Trump were made aware of the breaches. Assange's group released Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential campaign that U.S. intelligence agencies say were hacked by Russia to try to tilt the election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He is regarded with distaste by many in Washington, although Trump, then the Republican candidate, supported the group's email releases last year. Ben Sasse, a Republican senator, said in a statement on Thursday that Assange should "spend the rest of his life wearing an orange jumpsuit." He is "an enemy of the American people and an ally to Vladimir Putin" who has "has dedicated his life’s work to endangering innocent lives, abetting despots, and stoking a crisis of confidence in the West," Sasse said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 March 2017 by Military News Metatron (OTC PINK: MRNJ) Announces Special Dividend with Circa Pictures (OTC PINK: CPPD) Plus Cannabis & Private Security App Update NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 9, 2017 / We are pleased to report we received shares from Circa pictures (OTC PINK: CPPD). Metatron (OTC PINK: MRNJ) will be issuing a special stock distribution of Circa shares to Metatron shareholders as of record 3/26/2017, ratio 7 MRNJ to 1 CPPD, rounded up, pay date 4/8/2017, subject to FINRA approval. Metatron continues to work with Circa Pictures toward the launch of its unique video crowdfunding platform for new movie, television, and streaming media projects. The Company is currently exploring opportunities for app and media distribution through Circa’s relationship with Zumm Everything Android and its proprietary streaming media player www.zummusa.com. Zumm will be an exhibitor at Salt Lake Comic Con on March 17th and 18th. Metatron will likely launch a new Self-Help/ Meditations App on the Zumm platform. Link to Zumm Promos: https://youtu.be/x6Px0B_l1S4 https://youtu.be/dtLvoKmrLbo Private Messenger App Vaporize The status of our encrypted private messenger app, called Vaporize, continues to move forward. We have completed most of the structure on the app, and are working to install the encryption layer for ultimate level of security, and privacy.

AppShop in-app platform Approved We are please to report Apple has finally approved our new in-app platform AppShop in the first of a many apps to be updated with new system.

New Relaxation App Download Here: http://apple.co/2mLCl6m. Mobile Rebranding The Company, through its mobile division i-Mobilize, plans to relaunch their mobile business in the specific areas of mobile encryption and security, and mobile applications for the growing cannabis and marijuana market. Under this new goal, the Company will keep its focus on a couple of dynamic concepts within the mobile market, and will look to reduce or shelve other projects to the back burner, which may be a smart move as to keep them focused on one or two projects at a time. The Company has experience in developing over 2000+ mobile applications in the past years, which shows they can bring a project from concept, to development pretty quickly. Mobile Apps for Cannabis Market One of the more exciting aspects of this trade is the Company’s plan to develop mobile apps for the rapidly growing cannabis and marijuana industry. The Company is expected to release a detailed update on their cannabis mobile app direction, but in meantime investors can get a feel for the market by taking look at MassRoots, Inc. (OTCQB: MSRT), which is one of the main players in the area of mobile applications for cannabis market. Industry News Confide, an app that allows users to send disappearing encrypted messages, grew its user base sevenfold in one week after stories saying that Republicans in Washington, D.C., are using it to share information confidentially, said Confide President Jon Brod. „Last week our users increased 7 times over the prior week, so just, explosive growth,” he said. The spike followed stories from multiple publications, including Axios and the Washington Post noting how the app is taking off among political operatives. SnapChat currently commands a market cap of over $31 billion and the company generates about $400 million in annual revenue. Snap’s revenue growth rate is a lot higher than Facebook’s, demonstrating the market need to send messages that delete automatically, although not securely like our Vaporize app, and we expect industry growth will continue. As of Feb. 28, 2017, the Company has roughly 60 million shares issued and outstanding, and is traded Over the Counter under the symbol „MRNJ”.

We plan to update these apps in our upcoming relaunch, and will be adding a couple more to our list.

The offer, if legitimate, could put Silicon Valley in the unusual position of deciding whether to cooperate with Assange, a man believed by some U.S. officials and lawmakers to be an untrustworthy pawn of Russian President Vladimir Putin, or a secretive U.S. spy agency. It was not clear how WikiLeaks intended to cooperate with technology companies, or if they would accept his offer. The anti-secrecy group published documents on Tuesday describing secret Central Intelligence Agency hacking tools and snippets of computer code. It did not publish the full programs that would be needed to actually conduct cyber exploits against phones, computers and Internet-connected televisions. Representatives of Alphabet Inc's Google Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp <MSFT.O> and Cisco Systems Inc <CSCO.O>, all of whose wares are subject to attacks described in the documents, did not immediately respond to requests for comment before regular business hours on the U.S. West Coast. "Considering what we think is the best way to proceed and hearing these calls from some of the manufacturers, we have decided to work with them to give them some exclusive access to the additional technical details that we have so that the fixes can be developed and pushed out, so people can be secure," Assange said during a press conference broadcast via Facebook Live. Responding to Assange's comments, CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu, said in a statement, "As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity." "Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries." The disclosures alarmed the technology world and among consumers concerned about the potential privacy implications of the cyber espionage tactics that were described. One file described a programme known as Weeping Angel that purportedly could take over a Samsung smart television, making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room. Other documents described ways to hack into Apple Inc <AAPL.O> iPhones, devices running Google's <GOOGL.O> Android software and other gadgets in a way that could observe communications before they are protected by end-to-end encryption offered by messaging apps like Signal or WhatsApp. Several companies have already said they are confident that their recent security updates have already accounted for the purported flaws described in the CIA documents. Apple said in a statement on Tuesday that "many of the issues" leaked had already been patched in the latest version of its operating system. WikiLeaks' publication of the documents reignited a debate about whether U.S. intelligence agencies should hoard serious cyber security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public. An interagency process created under former President Barack Obama called for erring on the side of disclosure. President Donald Trump believed changes were needed to safeguard secrets at the CIA, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told a news briefing on Thursday. "He believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated." Two U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials told Reuters on Wednesday that intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of a breach at the CIA, which led to WikiLeaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said contractors likely breached security and handed over the documents to WikiLeaks. The CIA has declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents leaked, but the officials said they believed the pages about hacking techniques used between 2013 and 2016 were authentic. Contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years, most notably Edward Snowden and Harold Thomas Martin, both employed by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton <BAH.N> while working for the National Security Agency. Assange said he possessed "a lot more information" about the CIA's cyber arsenal that would be released soon. He criticized the CIA for "devastating incompetence" for not being able to control access to such sensitive material. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the populist UK Independence Party, visited Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London earlier on Thursday. A representative for Farage said he was unaware what was discussed. Assange has been holed up since 2012 at the embassy, where he fled to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape, which he denies.
