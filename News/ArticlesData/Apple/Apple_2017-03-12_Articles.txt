Nevertheless, there are a couple of tidbits about Apple inside the report… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Kuo believes that Samsung will see weaker demand for its Galaxy S8 this than it did for the Galaxy S7 last year. One reason for this is that last year, Samsung essentially released a single flagship device because of the Note 7 debacle. Another reason for slowed demand, however, is that Samsung will face increased competition this year from Apple. Kuo explains in his investor note that the Galaxy S8 lacks “sufficiently attractive selling points” and thus the OLED iPhone could be a “bigger draw for consumers” this year than the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were last year: We project Galaxy S8 shipments of 40-45mn units in 2017F, implying slower momentum compared to Galaxy S7 in 2016 (around 52mn units shipped), attributable to: (1) a one-month difference in comparable sales period; (2) Galaxy S7 was Samsung’s main promotional flagship model in 4Q16 after termination of Galaxy Note 7 due to the battery explosion issue, hence the higher sales base; (3) as Galaxy S8 lacks sufficiently attractive selling points (except full-screen design), the OLED iPhone could well be a bigger draw for consumers. Because of the increased competition from Apple and the flagship iPhone 8 this year, Kuo says he recommends focusing on the sales and supply chain momentum of Apple’s OLED iPhone model. Overall, Kuo believes that Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will have minimal impact on the supply chain. We are conservative on demand for Galaxy S8, and believe its contribution to the supply chain will be limited. Instead we recommend focusing on the sales outlook and supply chain momentum of Apple’s (US) OLED iPhone model. Kuo has offered up a variety of details related to the iPhone 8, including its OLED display, wireless charging, new glass design, and function area. Yesterday, We outlined everything we currently know about the iPhone 8 here. Much has been made about the similarities in design between earlier iPhone 8 mockups and Galaxy S8 leaks. Nevertheless, it doesn’t seem like Kuo thinks a similar design will have any impact on the success of the iPhone 8, but rather a negative impact on the Galaxy S8.

Engst Tim Cook called them a “cultural phenomenon.” They’re backordered for six weeks on the Apple online store right now, and some independent Apple resellers tell me they can’t get any to sell. Apple’s new AirPods wireless earbuds are unquestionably an engineering feat, and while reviewers such as our own Julio Ojeda-Zapata and Josh Centers have identified a few weak points, the AirPods are generally well-received (see “Apple’s Wireless AirPods Were Worth the Wait,” 20 December 2016). The main negative is the $159 price, which makes the likelihood of losing or damaging one of the AirPods all the more worrying. While that price may seem high, most of the full-fledged competitors to the AirPods are at least as expensive, if not more so (see “CES 2017: Gadget Finds on the CES Show Floor, Days 3 and 4,” 11 January 2017). So what if I told you that you could buy a competing product for less than a tenth the price? Seriously. Don’t expect it to be as good as the AirPods, not by a long shot, but for somewhere between $5 and $20, you can buy a single Bluetooth earbud that does basically what the AirPods do — put a speaker and microphone in your ear without awkward wires. I first heard about this product category from a Cornell running buddy, Rob Kurcoba, who bought his first earbud from a Chinese reseller on eBay. At only $6.99, it was incredibly cheap, but he had to wait six weeks for it to arrive via slow boat. He paired it with an Android Wear smartwatch that could play music, the Sony Smartwatch 3 SWR50, and started wearing it on his solo runs. Soon, he was evangelizing it to the rest of us when we ran with the High Noon Athletic Club. Amused by his excitement, I looked on Amazon and was amazed to discover that the single-ear Bluetooth earbud had become almost a generic item, with numerous companies selling products that look nearly identical. I chose a $15 Nocobot model that had slightly better reviews than the others and got it a few days later — no need to wait for the slow boat with Amazon. It paired with my iPhone and my Apple Watch, and worked fine for listening to podcasts while doing yard work and a few times while running. This was all before the AirPods came out, and I lost track of it once yard work stopped for the year. But after the AirPods were announced and finally started to trickle out to users, I was a guest on MacBreak Weekly and mentioned the earbud while we were talking about the AirPods. That comment hit a nerve with listeners, generating lots of requests for more details. So here we are! Nocobot Bluetooth Earbud -- The earbud I bought and recommended on MacBreak Weekly was manufactured by a company called Nocobot and sold by another firm called Duto. It cost $14.99 and came with a custom four-inch USB charging cable with a needle-like tip that plugs into a tiny hole in the earbud. In my testing, battery life is about 3.5 hours of audio; I’m not entirely sure how quickly it recharges because there’s no way to check how fully charged it is. The earbud itself is black, and shaped like an old-style hearing aid, in the sense that it’s designed to fit snugly into your right ear. That’s either a plus or a minus, depending on your ear. It fits tightly in my ear — so well, in fact, that I have to pop it out by pulling up on the top of my ear and pushing gently from the back. It feels a little odd initially, but after a few minutes, I stop noticing it. I could easily see it not fitting in someone else’s ear. It fits only in your right ear, and in case my use of the singular hasn’t made this clear, it’s only a single earbud — your left ear remains uncovered. I consider that a plus for running or biking, where covering both ears is dangerous, but it’s a liability for when you want to block the outside world. The earbud has a single button that you use for pairing, toggling power, and starting and stopping audio: Press and hold the button for 5–10 seconds to put it into pairing mode. Press and hold the button for 3–4 seconds to turn it on or off. Press and hold the button for 1–2 seconds to switch its audio feedback between Chinese and English. Press the button quickly to start or stop the audio, or to answer and hang up calls. Press the button twice quickly to redial the last number called. The annoying part of the button is that it’s somewhat stiff, and pressing it means pushing in on your ear, which can be a bit uncomfortable. On the plus side, it’s unlikely to be pushed accidentally in your pocket or bag. Its only other interface is a recorded voice that tells you that it’s powering on or off, that the device is connected, if it’s ready to pair, and when you end a call. It also tells you when the battery is getting low, and I once heard it say “Battery high.” The quality of the audio is good, but not great. I mostly use it for podcasts while working outside, where it’s totally fine. When I first used it to listen to music while running, I experienced some skips and dropouts. I was able to resolve those by moving the Apple Watch to my right wrist or, when I’ve had the iPhone in a waist belt, sliding it around to the right side or front. The volume is loud enough for most environments, but some additional power would have been nice at times. Put bluntly, this is not an audiophile solution. I hadn’t used the Nocobot earbud’s microphone for calls of any sort until writing this article since I very seldom talk on the iPhone. When I called Josh, he reported that I sounded OK, but not great. For me, his audio was nice and clear, though not quite as loud as I would have liked. Using the iPhone’s built-in speaker and mic worked noticeably better for both of us. Our Skype test was less successful, likely due to the slow hotel Wi-Fi network I was using. The earbud can’t invoke or be used with Siri, unfortunately. You’ve probably noticed that I haven’t linked to this earbud yet. That’s because the particular one I bought isn’t available on Amazon anymore. Nor can I find any indication that Nocobot and Duto are even in business. We’re talking about sketchy Chinese companies here — that’s why it’s so cheap. However, the $14.99 G-Cord Ultra Lightweight Wireless Bluetooth Hands-Free Earbud looks identical, down to the logo on the button, so if you’re looking for one of these, give the G-Cord a try. QCY Q26 Bluetooth Earbud -- After I mentioned the Nocobot earbud on MacBreak Weekly, a listener recommended a competing product from QCY, which is a higher profile brand, to judge from a Google search. At its heart, the QCY Q26 is extremely similar to the Nocobot, being a single-ear Bluetooth earbud controlled by presses on a single button and responding via audio feedback. It costs $13.59 from Amazon and comes in a variety of colors. The QCY Q26 uses a stalk-like industrial design that has pros and cons. On the plus side, it should fit in anyone’s ear, and it comes with three sizes of rubber ear tips so you can choose the one that best matches your ear. That design also enables it to block sound better than the Nocobot earbud. Although it’s designed to go in your right ear, with the button on the top, you can flip it over and put it in your left ear, with the button facing down. It might not work well for calls in that orientation. Either way, the button is easier to press than the Nocobot’s button because you can pinch the QCY Q26 between your fingers while pressing. It’s not all good, though. The stalk design means that it doesn’t fit into your ear nearly as snugly as the Nocobot, and I’d be more concerned about it falling out accidentally. Plus, I find that the rubber ear tip blocks so much external noise that it almost feels like my ear has water in it — it’s somewhere between disconcerting and uncomfortable. (The Nocobot doesn’t block the ear canal as much, avoiding that situation.) The QCY Q26’s button is easily pressed in your pocket or bag, which can turn it on and run the battery down inadvertently or even pocket dial if it’s pressed twice in quick succession. Battery life isn’t quite as good as the Nocobot, at about 3 hours in my testing. The QCY Q26 comes with a micro USB cable for charging, and it plugs into a port on the other side of the earbud from the button. The port has a cover that’s devilishly hard to open; I can get it open only with the sharp point of a safety pin. Controlling the QCY Q26 is almost identical to the Nocobot, with a long press to put it into pairing mode, shorter presses to turn it on and off, quick presses to control audio or answer/hang up calls, and double presses to redial the last number. The audio feedback is similar too, though it doesn’t seem to talk in Chinese. Audio quality in comparison with the Nocobot is both better and worse. The QCY Q26 has a bit more oomph, and when Josh and I tested the microphone quality, he reported that it was a little better, but still reminiscent of AM radio. The rubber ear tip does block more ambient noise too. However, music sounded a bit muddier, and at least in my test unit, there’s a quiet background hiss. You don’t hear it when audio is playing at any significant volume, but it’s noticeable when the volume is very low or off. Plus, when I tried to use it while running with my iPhone in a waist belt, audio cut in and out enough that I stopped and swapped it for the Nocobot. It was fine when I used it to listen to music while standing at my desk, however. Making a Choice -- I won’t pretend that either of these earbuds is anywhere near as good as Apple’s AirPods. Their Bluetooth pairing can be annoying, audio quality isn’t as good, battery life is shorter, it’s more difficult to plug in their charging cables, their microphone quality is weak, and neither supports Siri or voice commands. And heck, you only get one, something that AirPods allow but don’t require. But these earbuds are so cheap that you may not care. I wrote this while at the ASMC Summit, a conference for independent Apple resellers, and when I showed these two little earbuds to one attendee, he said that he didn’t even bring his AirPods to the conference for fear of losing them. Just as the best digital camera is the one in your pocket, the best earbud is the one you have with you. Also, I’m talking about a category that contains much more than these two entrants. When you search for “Bluetooth earbud” on Amazon, you’ll see a variety of comparable products with slightly different industrial designs that you might find more compelling. Some are as cheap as $5, and there’s no reason I can see to spend more than $20 given how similar they look. I wouldn’t expect any of them to last for all that long, and they’d be easy to lose, but a super low price makes up for a lot of sins. My friend Rob, who got me started with these earbuds a year ago, tells me that he has since bought eight more, four of which he’s given away to family and friends. Of those he kept, he lost two and one broke, but at $7 each, he doesn’t feel bad about it. So hey, if you’re looking for a cheap wireless audio solution for one ear, give one of these earbuds a try. It’s not a big investment if it doesn’t work, and you might be pleasantly surprised.   READERS LIKE YOU! Support TidBITS by becoming a member today!

(Run the wire behind your head.) I had no problem pairing. They work similarly to the ones reported on above. Maybe a bit too loud by default, but phone controls handle that easily. About $22. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LWZ6XZA/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Reply David Meyers  2017-03-10 17:11 If you don't mind a wire between the buds, there are several terrific options for around $30 or so on Amazon. I really like the SoundPEATS Q12 (in the ear) and Q9A (loop over the ear - very very secure) a lot. They've got a true wireless pair - which look identical to the Q9A but without the wire between the two - for about $50. Audio quality is quite good. Unfortunately, they both stink for phone calls. It's the phone call quality which is really making me consider AirPods. For calls, I use a Plantronics Voyager Edge (and when you think about pricing -- that Edge is about half the price of a pair of AirPods, which makes the AirPods not seem quite so outrageous.)

Given that your email address starts with "heimdall," I suppose extraordinary senses would be among your super powers. Reply Jim Schmidt  2017-03-15 14:11 I have one of the millions of knock-offs of that single ear bud. I got it off of Amazon for maybe $8. It's a perfectly acceptable speaker for my intended uses - out running or driving in the car. I've had it with me on numerous 5k runs, and never once worried about losing it. The quality is decent - I'm no audiophile, so I'm not one to ask about specifics. But I have it to keep my pace and check my stats (and listen to my phone when I'm in our Bluetoothless, AUX-less car), and it functions in that regard perfectly. I will note that it does play both channels of audio in that one speaker, so you don't lose half of your music to a missing earbud, which is nice.

The star of Dragons’ Den Online knows the economy and enterprise inside out — and can help with YOUR ideas and problems. THE launch of the latest smartphone model has become major news in recent times — such is our fascination with faster, shinier mobile devices that boast ever more sophisticated features. No longer do new phones simply just appear on shelves. They are “events”, in that very modern sense. 3 The competition over Smartphones is fierce Industry launches represent only the culmination of a long build-up of hype, characterised by an initial frenzy of anticipation, then followed by conjecture, rumour-mongering and insider leaks. Make no mistake, it’s serious business for many people, whether that be the manufacturers themselves, forensic-level analysis from the online geeks, or the media machine that’s grown up around the mobile tech industry. So it is with the expected launch of the Samsung S8 on March 29 in New York, ending months of excited speculation over what may well be its best device yet. The existence of the coming device was first confirmed in January when Samsung filed the name with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Indeed, while the hype begins long before the launch, for the manufacturers there’s a much longer process behind the scenes of ensuring that their smartphone design is as robust as possible, matched by watertight patenting of features.

Interestingly, it is also thought that the S8 could take a few design cues from Apple — undoubtedly Samsung’s biggest rival for global smartphone supremacy. New reports indicate that Samsung has been granted a European Union patent for earphones that are able to sync with companion smartphones through improved Bluetooth technology. In other words, they’re wireless — just like Apple’s AirPods which were launched last year to much fanfare, and then in some quarters, derision. Many long-term Apple users lambasted the move as they suspected that the expensive buds would be easily mislaid while the iPhone7 saw the popular headphone jack phased out, so some felt they were being forced to make the change. It’s therefore a risky move for Samsung to follow suit, but what of the potential legal implications? Samsung and Apple are certainly no strangers to battling it out over patent infringement — they’ve been doing it for quite some time — and holding a patent in one region doesn’t necessarily mean that it is held elsewhere. Potentially then, that can mean multiple court actions across multiple regions. Indeed, Samsung and Apple have been entangled in more than 50 lawsuits around the globe since 2011, with billions of dollars in damages being contested. The battle will no doubt rage on –— and that’s why it’s so important as a business to secure your intellectual property from the outset, whether you’re an established big player or a startup finding your way. If you invest properly in this area, then you should be robustly protected, while sending a strong message to competitors that you were there first. Scotland is full of innovative and forward-thinking businesses whose brands are truly iconic and they wouldn’t be where they are without having fiercely protected their intellectual property. I believe it’s essential that we have a strong strategy in place for protecting our ideas, and as such I work with Scottish intellectual property specialists Marks & Clerk. The firm has ensured that any new ideas or products of mine are followed by the swift filing of patents and trade marks, and therefore I am able to count on the most effective protection possible. It is an example of a successful Scottish firm facilitating the success of others. As world-beaters like Apple know, innovation and that elusive creative spark are only the beginning for businesses. True success is determined by those who carefully secure and protect their ideas. Youngster boost to business 3 Young workers have a whole host of opportunities I WAS pleased to see a raft of exciting opportunities for young workers being revealed in conjunction with the launch of Scottish Apprenticeship Week. Up to 27,000 will benefit from apprenticeship employment opportunities this year, according to the Scottish Government. That’s brilliant news for youngsters that are not interested in going down the traditional route of university, but still want the opportunity to further their career. The figure is 1,000 higher than last year’s target for apprenticeship starts which is particularly encouraging given new research that indicates almost a quarter of Scottish students would consider an apprenticeship as a route of employment after school. University doesn’t suit everyone, and although Scottish students are fortunate enough to enjoy free tuition fees, it still involves a major undertaking, often including part-time jobs to at least partly meet related costs. One of the main benefits of modern apprenticeships is the ability to earn money straight away whilst learning, and the advantage of gaining work skills as soon as possible. Better still, many apprenticeships guarantee a good wage for two to three years and the possibility of a job after graduation. Scottish businesses who intend to be sustainable and move with the times should offer apprenticeships which will ultimately help grow their business. Scotland currently enjoys the second lowest youth unemployment in Europe, so our youngsters are doing incredibly well amid an exciting and ever-growing talent pool. With such a strong performance and new apprenticeships, the future looks bright for our industries. Festival is best by smiles 3 Kevin Bridges will be appearing in Comedy Festival YOU will not be short of laughs this week as the Glasgow International Comedy Festival kicks off in no doubt hilarious style. The festival, in its 15th year, runs right up until March 26, with venues taking part right across the city. Expect big laughs from Scottish and UK comedians including Al Murray, Des Clarke, Ray Bradshaw and Kevin Bridges. The festival offers a significant groundswell of home-grown talent that will not only please comedy fans but local businesses too, who will be cheering with joy as they can expect to be much busier this week with an influx of crowds. Make sure you get involved — this year’s line-up is not to be missed and the brilliant atmosphere means it’ll be the place to be. It makes me cry WE are continually told how great it is to buy Scottish products but it seems consumers aren’t holding up their end of the bargain in some aspects. Despite Scotland being so well known for its seafood industry, exporting to more than 70 countries, a majority of us are simply not eating enough seafood and ignoring the related health benefits. Lots of us have ailments which could be helped by eating fish — yet we are still not taking advantage of the fish on our doorstep. It’s so important that we support the future of our seafood industry, and health experts say that eating at least two pieces of fish a week can go a long way to helping yourself and our hard-working fishermen. As Shaf… your questions answered Dear Shaf, I’VE recently had a few negative reviews on my Amazon store for products I sell. I’ve spoken to Amazon and they are unwilling to remove them. I am quite annoyed as I had 100 per cent positive feedback prior to these being left. Aside from paying customers to remove the reviews is there any other quick fixes to have them taken down? SHAF SAYS: I think you are getting over concerned about this. In business it is impossible to make everyone happy. Even companies such as Apple have critical reviews. The negative reviews give you a chance to improve your product and service. Use this valuable feedback to improve your business. Once you have done this respond publicly to the reviews with your actions. Under no circumstances should you offer any financial inducement to the reviewers to remove their feedback as if Amazon find out they will close your account. Dear Shaf, I have started working from home selling products online. I have registered as self-employed with HMRC and I have business insurance and my landlord has given me permission. The bulk of my orders are done by a fulfilment company, is there anything else I should do? SHAF SAYS: I am assuming when you say the bulk of your deliveries are being done by a fulfilment company you may get the occasional delivery to your house. Have a chat with your neighbours and let them know what you are doing. You should also inform your local authority that you are running a business from home. Assuming you are not filling your garage and house with stock, this should be a mere formality. We pay for your stories and videos! Do you have a story or video for The Scottish Sun Online?

Video Is Snapchat building the iPhone killer? Apple owns all the oxygen in several territories across its ecosystems, like music-library management and photo management, competing only with giants such as Amazon and Google that can offer similar features. But in the arena of podcast apps, the decentralized distribution of audio episodes has left what seems like just enough room for independent developers. Over the years, three companies have released version after version of the most popular non-Apple podcast apps: Pocket Casts from Shiftyjelly, Supertop’s Castro, and Overcast from Marco Arment’s Overcast Radio. While Apple maintains the most comprehensive central directory via iTunes and preinstalls the Podcast app in iOS, it also follows its usual path of restricting choices for the crispest and simplest possible user experience. Clearly, podcast listeners want more. While Podcast dominates listenership, these three indie apps have remained viable enough to mature, plus a variety of others, including some that offer paid-subscription-only content and deep archives of past episodes. The time seems ripe to compare these apps, because Overcast just ticked over with a major interface improvement in version 3; Castro made some slight tweaks in its latest release with version 2.3; and Pocket Casts had its first significant revamp since launching in 2011 with last July’s version 6. (It’s now up to 6.5.) After spending some time with the latest versions of each app, I look at their major features and differences to help guide you to a choice of what works best. Because the apps are free with ads (Overcast) or inexpensive ($4 for the other two), it’s hard to go wrong if you can’t figure out the right fit at first. [ Further reading: Individual reviews of Overcast 3, Castro 2.3 and Pocket Casts 6.5 ] The basics While the apps take a different approach to creating queues, managing downloads, and displaying interfaces to take actions and modify settings, they share a lot of basics. Subscriptions. What’s the point of a podcast app without recurring subscriptions? Each app has slightly different options for controlling what happens when a new episode appears. I’ll discuss episode and storage management below. Each app also lets you download individual episodes by viewing a list. Automatic feed updates. The apps have their own server-side polling of the podcast feeds that announce new episodes. With the same subscriptions across three apps and notifications of new episodes enabled in each app, in my observation over several days there’s no clear winner as to which app discovers new episodes first. It varies for every show and sometimes by episodes in a show. IDG Castro’s notifications offer a full description and several options with 3D Touch. Notifications. Related to new episodes, you can opt in each app to get a push notification when a new episode arrives. Overcast and Pocket Casts both let you drill down and disable notifications on a per-subscription basis, too. You can 3D Touch the notifications for each to download or queue episodes. Castro also pops up an notification if you stop playing an episode near its end. Discovery. Each has a directory that lets you find a specific podcasts or browse by genres or groups to find more. Overcast is probably the richest in this area, by letting you link your Twitter account, which then lets you see episodes and podcast recommended by people you follow. When you mark a podcast with a star, those recommendations are pushed out as well. Both Overcast and Castro allow you to add episodes from the discovery view; Pocket Casts can only subscribe to a podcast. Downloading and streaming. These three apps all support both downloading and streaming episodes of podcasts, and offer a lot of controls and settings for when podcasts are automatically retrieved, as I discuss below. Speed of playback. Each app lets you speed up and slow down podcast playback. While I listen to everything at the rate at which it was released, some people prefer to bump to 1.2x or 1.5x, allowing them to cram more listening in. Sleep. For people who fall asleep while listening to playback, all three apps let you set a timer after which they stop. CarPlay. If you enjoy the often painful experience of using CarPlay, all three apps can provide that experience with podcasts. Storage management. The apps vary in approach to avoid filling up your iOS storage. By default, Overcast and Pocket Casts delete episodes after they’re played, and let you control how many episodes from the back catalog to retain, either as a global setting or with per-podcast overrides. Castro always deletes episodes after they’re played (when they leave its Queue), but you can set a maximum number of hours of podcasts to keep downloaded. Exporting and importing subscriptions. You can export your podcast subscription list from one app to another. These three apps all support OPML (Outline Process Markup Language), which for peculiar and atavistic reasons became established as the interchange format. In each app’s settings, there’s an export option that allows you to share with any compatible software, which includes all the other podcast apps. However, none of the apps have tools to resolve duplicate subscriptions. Beyond these features, everything diverges. The apps demonstrate a striking lack of similarity and make strong design and feature choices that differentiate them from one another. Triage, queuing, and playlists Most people fare poorly when confronted with overchoice: too many options relative to the necessity at hand. People speak of “podcast bankruptcy” in the same way they describe a pile of unread The New Yorker or The Economist magazines looming in the corner of their living room. Hundreds of hours of podcasts you haven’t listened to yet are likely to remain mostly unlistened-to ever. If you subscribe to just a handful of podcasts and have regular allotted time during a commute, runs, or work when you can keep caught up, this doesn’t affect you. But I suspect most people reading this far in a podcast app feature comparison are drowning in episodes. Each of these apps employs a unique approach to let you try to carve out the space you’ll listen to through a combination of triage, playlists, and queuing: Triage: dealing with incoming episodes. Queuing: setting up automatically and manually reordering which podcast plays next. Playlists: breaking subscriptions or filters to sort episodes into lists. IDG Castro focuses on the Queue and Inbox, allowing more sophisticated triage and sorting. Each podcast’s new episodes are shown at the Inbox top next to its tiny thumbnail. Castro uses a queue. Castro uses a paired approach of the Queue and the Inbox, starting in version 2. Newly released episodes flow by default into the Inbox, much like an email inbox, and aren’t downloaded. The Queue, by contrast, is your active playlist, and Castro downloads all queued episodes when you’re connected Wi-Fi unless you change the preference. You can also opt to download via cellular. (Turning off downloads turns the Queue into a streaming playlist.) You triage the Inbox by tapping individual episodes and then either adding them to the top or bottom of the Queue, or tapping Archive, which removes the entry from the Inbox. I find this a very quick way to pick just the episodes from my subscriptions I definitely want to listen to. There’s also an Archive All button at the top right of the screen, which clears out the inbox when tapped. And, bravo to Supertop, you can tap an undo button if you accidentally tap Archive All! Individual episodes found through searches or older episodes from your subscriptions can be added to the queue by tapping the episode. And you can mark any episode in the Queue, Archive, or Search areas as a favorite, which adds them to a list in the Archive view to find later. Castro 2.3 added more descriptive notifications to help with on-the-fly queue management. When a new episode appears, you can use 3D Touch to start playing it immediately, add it to the queue, or shift it to archive, so it never appears in your inbox. If you pause during the last three minutes of a podcast, a notification shows up that lets you skip the rest of the episode or start playing the next one. Who will like Castro’s approach? Anyone who subscribes to a lot of podcasts and doesn’t listen to every episode of each podcast. IDG Overcast emphasizes playlists, though it added a queuing option in the latest release. Overcast focuses on playlists. Overcast started with a playlist-only mentality, though that’s shifted slightly in version 3. Unlike Castro, Overcast creates a master smart playlist, All Episodes, that includes every downloaded episode, whether via subscriptions or chosen individually. The master playlist and any additional smart playlists can have Priority Podcasts, new episodes of which automatically sort to the top. But you can also edit a smart playlists current list to re-prioritize individual episodes. Regular playlists let you pick from the episodes already downloaded. Starting in Overcast 3, however, a new option threads the needle between an All Episodes and defined playlist approach, letting you quickly add episodes—downloaded or not—to a Main Queue list. This is effectively a special static-episode list that’s baked in. It’s not a full triage, but it makes it easier to set up and modify a set of episodes on the fly that you want to listen to next. Overcast’s episode notification also allows a triage of Play, Add to Queue, and Delete. Who will like Overcast’s approach? People who listen to most of the episodes of podcasts to which they subscribe, or who like to set up custom arrangements of what to listen to and switch easily among those. IDG Pocket Casts’ Up Next queue provides quick access to an on-the-fly created list. Pocket Casts has a default list with a queue for triage and a form of playlist. Several people I’ve spoken to about podcast apps call out Pocket Casts because of its thumbnail queue, which is the app’s home screen. This queue, by default, displays the podcast graphic for each episode in the queue from newest to oldest. This main queue is mostly like Castro’s Inbox. Pocket Casts also offers a triage queue, called Up Next, into which you can select to push new episodes or add as an automatic per-subscription option. The Up Next queue occupies a bar at the bottom of the screen, and swiping left reveals the icons of the next upcoming episode. Tapping the bar opens a full-screen view for playback controls and management of the Up Next queue. However, the app also has a playlist-like feature in the form of filters, which resembles smart playlists in Overast. A filter can use a time cutoff (starting with the last 24 hours), only show episodes you’ve starred, and include or exclude any subscription. Filters are found in a sort of pre-home screen that includes prefab items for New Releases and In Progress (episodes you’ve started listening to). It’s a bit awkward. Who will like Pocket Casts’ approach? If you like to see a thumbnail showing you which shows have new episodes, and rely on that to assemble of a queue of to listen to next, while not needing the richer triage features in Castro. Other feature differentiators While figuring out what to listen to next is the biggest issue for most people, a few other features can be deciding factors. IDG Overcast brags about saved time with its Smart Speed silence eliminator. Omit pauses. Overcast and Pocket Casts both offer a variant on eliminating the spaces between sound: they can trim out silence on the fly, removing anything more than a brief pause. For some interview and talk podcasts, the pauses don’t signify…much. (With podcasts that include music or acting, you’ll want to turn it off, and you can control it in both apps per podcast.) In testing the same podcast in both apps, I prefer Overcast’s version. Pocket Casts more noticeably clamped down the ends of words to my ear, sounding like tiny edits. Overcast’s jiggery-pokery either waits slightly longer or uses fading to avoid what sounds like editing chops. Sync. Castro doesn’t include sync, while the other two apps offer (free) account-based synchronization across any copy of the app logged into the same account, including what you’re currently listening to, the current position in any episode that you’ve started, subscriptions, and playlists. Platforms and pricing. This is where it gets complicated if you plan to listen to podcasts on more than one device or via the wb. Overcast ships for iOS only in a version that works across all iOS devices. It’s free with ads, but has a $10-a-year Premium in-app purchase that removes ads and allows uploads of audio that isn’t available via a feed using the Web app. Pocket Casts has versions for iOS (all devices), Android, and the Web, and charges separately for each. While the iOS version is just $4, the web app is $9, which seems a bit steep in relative terms, though it’s well built. Castro is the most limited. It’s $4, doesn’t sync, and is designed just for the iPhone, not the iPad. If you like its features and you’re solely using an iPhone, this isn’t a problem. Bottom line Each of these three alternatives to Apple’s Podcast app has its strengths, and unlike some app categories, in which many apps produce similar results, you can examine the differences to figure out which appeals most to you. For some people, Castro lacking any silence-slicing option is a non-starter. While I love that feature in Overcast, the podcast app I used the longest, Castro 2’s triage feature won me over and I cope with a few extra seconds here and there. Because each of these apps is made by independent developers, teams that range from one person to a handful, your suggestions for features to add are more likely to be taken seriously, and each new release from these companies reference the most-asked-for changes and additions that their users want.

Then, several users confirmed that the were able to purchase the buds. “Was sitting at work…completely forgot I had Fruit basket opened. And I heard a ping. Opened it up, said ‘Found one!’ and bam, bought my pair and picked them up right away. Love them lol,” said Reddit user BillyWaz, who added that by the time of his ordering and driving to the store, they sold out of their stock. “Yeah checked yesterday and there was some in my local Apple Store in Montréal. Bought a pair….. and canceled my order. They fit well in my ears, went for a quick run this morning no problems and impressed with the quality of the sound and phone calls,” excitingly claimed Fblondin. Going to the Apple Store website can be misleading as they claim — in most locations — that the AirPods won’t be available for pickup until May 1. However, stock trickles in and out throughout the week, and it sometimes doesn’t show on the retail website. A good way to get notified once a retail location gets stock is to go to the Fruit Basket website, which alerts you once the AirPods, as well as other Apple products, are in stock. The AirPods have received very good reviews in general. [Image by Daryl Deino] Apple’s AirPods are considered the first true wireless earbuds that offer a combination of good sound quality, decent battery life, and wireless convenience. Rolling Stone described the AirPods as “pretty f***ing cool.” “And while $159 is still a pretty penny to spend on far less than audiophile-grade headphones, it’s a bargain for the experience of walking around, totally wire-free, with a personal soundtrack pumped directly into your brain. In a nutshell: pretty fu***cool.” The review adds that connecting these buds is far easier than connecting other Bluetooth products. Forbes also likes the AirPods and says they are made of pure magic. “That’s right folks, these Bluetooth wireless headphones require no button pushing or connection with the physical world. They are simply magical. Many wizards worked tirelessly on either the optical sensor and motion accelerometer technology or the marketing campaign. The lines are blurred. Magic does that.” The article adds that the five hours of battery life are actually quite impressive considering how small the buds, which come with a charging case, are. The case charges the AirPods in a matter of minutes. Many thought that Apple’s wireless buds would fall out easily, but many will attest that they rarely fall out, no matter how much you wiggle your head. The BeatsX have much better noise-isolation than the AirPods. [Image by Daryl Deino] Another complaint from users is that there is no noise isolation. Perhaps those people might want to check out Apple’s new BeatsX earbud headphones, which are connected together by a wire. However, they use Apple’s W1 connection to simply connect to your iPhone or other Apple device. Time noted that even though the BeatsX are easy to set up, are comfortable, and are good at muffling outside noise, they don’t always stay in your ears during heavy exercise. The reviewer also didn’t like the fact that the power button is hard to find. Both the AirPods and BeatsX can be used with non-Apple devices, but the connection won’t be as simple. Still, with both the AirPods and the BeatsX, most sources would agree that Apple has proven they are still ahead of the curve.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News BLOG: Right now, wherever you are: Empowering the next generation of dynamic teamwork Cisco Blog > The Platform The Platform Chris Dedicoat – March 7, 2017 – 0 Comments The defining principle of working in technology is its relentless pace of change and innovation, even in places where you may not expect it. Today, technologies are improving so quickly, in so many ways, that companies have an unprecedented opportunity to build more efficient processes, foster deeper collaboration and transform the way they work overall. At Cisco, we’re focused on helping companies future-proof their business, so they can take advantage of all that innovation through six key imperatives: Security from the ground up, network automation, cloud optimization, deep analytics, dynamic collaboration and teamwork, and programs to ensure that we humans can keep up with it all. This week at Cisco Live! in Melbourne, we come together with customers and partners to dive into these different aspects of technology and how they enable the future of business. For example, take our recent work with Apple. Mobility is dramatically changing the way work gets done today. But to truly transform the enterprise through mobility, it requires native apps running seamlessly on great devices over modern, sophisticated corporate networks. Apple and Cisco agreed to work together to create the best possible app and voice experience for iOS devices on corporate networks. We took advantage of new features in iOS 10 and tapped into the latest networking software and hardware from Cisco to increase reliability, connectivity, and deliver a great mobile user experience for apps, calling, and collaboration. [embedded content] The solution is elegant in its simplicity: With just a quick software upgrade, organizations can greatly improve the effectiveness of their mobile business processes and collaboration tools, like Cisco Spark, that connect everyone and everything together. Recently, a U.K.-based Cisco IT team took advantage of it. In Cisco offices around the world, wireless LAN is one of the most important pieces of infrastructure, because our employees truly rely on mobile technologies. Wi-Fi is indispensable to their work. We’re not unique here, of course. Reliable wireless LAN networking is foundational for enabling innovation, driving new business processes, as well as team collaboration and productivity in organizations all over the world. It’s only gaining in importance, as companies discover the power of dynamic teamwork — bringing together experts and talent from varied locations to solve challenges and execute projects. Our U.K. team upgraded its Cisco Wireless LAN controller software to AireOS 8.3 that includes the first networking innovation from the Apple and Cisco strategic partnership. AireOS 8.3 MR1, our latest version, released just last week, extends these unique networking capabilities across the entire Aironet access point portfolio and to all Aironet wireless controller platforms, including Mobility Express. This broad support enables customers of all sizes to benefit from the new capabilities. To quantify any change from the upgrade, the team conducted a series of tests in their office using the Cisco Spark app. The test was a basic video call between an employee roaming the office floor with an iPhone 7 running iOS 10 connected to the local Wi-Fi network and another employee running the Cisco Spark app on a MacBook. They repeated the test 20 times a day for several days before and after the software upgrade, and their findings showed a big improvement in the connection quality. The upgrade reduced major interruptions by 83 percent — and complete disconnections were eliminated entirely. And again, taking advantage of these improvements was just a software upgrade away. To get an idea of how powerful it can be in bringing the actual human experience to the forefront, take a look at the video above, which we’re showing this week in Melbourne. This has been the promise of technology all along: to assist humans in everyday tasks, simplify, automate, and collaborate, whether it’s across a conference room table or the Pacific Ocean. We’re looking forward to seeing many of our customers in Melbourne this week, but if you can’t make it, check out the video above for a teaser, and then dive into our Apple and Cisco enterprise page to discover more about what we’re up to. The page offers a wealth of resources.  Plus, talk to your Cisco or Partner sales rep to set up a demo or an assessment of how we can help you fast track your mobile business — and take advantage of tomorrow’s innovations today. Our time is now.

The company’s market share has steadily eroded since 2014. In fourth quarter 2016, Xiaomi’s smartphone shipment volume and market share was 7.4 percent, less than half of its 2015 market share and a distant fifth behind current leaders OPPO, Huawei, and Vivo, according to data from market research firm IDC. OPPO and Vivo—who share the same parent—came out of nowhere to displace Xiaomi and dominate the middle range of the Chinese smartphone market—a segment filled with commodity-like Android devices sold at lower price points than devices from Apple and Samsung. Beyond Xiaomi’s sluggish sales, its fortunes were further dented by the January departure of Hugo Barra, head of the company’s international business and arguably its most well-known figure. Barra joined the company in 2013 as a VP from Google, and has been instrumental in building Xiaomi’s business abroad most notably in India where Xiaomi maintains a 6.6 percent market share. Despite declining sales, Xiaomi still has higher ambitions. Its Chairman Lei Jun styled himself as China’s homegrown Steve Jobs, and the company recently joined Apple as one of the few global smartphone makers to design and manufacturer its own processor chips. (Source: IDC) Homegrown Chip Xiaomi announced its own chip, called Pinecone Surge S1, on Feb. 28 at an event at the China National Convention Center. The chip—which has eight cores running at up to 2.2 GHz—is used in the company’s new midrange Mi 5c smartphone. With this, the company joins Apple, Samsung, and domestic rival Huawei as the only smartphone makers in the world with their own processor manufacturing capabilities. Xiaomi’s introduction of a self-made chip is interesting on a few fronts. The private startup has not raised capital since 2014, when Xiaomi was valued at $45 billion by investors. Today, given slowing sales, its valuation is presumably lower. But during the launch event to unveil its new smartphone chip, Xiaomi deviated from its usual script of thanking investors for their ongoing support. Instead, Lei Jun flashed a slide that read, “Thanks for the government’s support,” according to the Wall Street Journal. While few details about Xiaomi’s funding from Beijing are known, the support seems to be broad-based. According to Lei, financial backing came from a semiconductor development fund set up by Beijing, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, and Beijing’s municipal government. Beijing has identified semiconductors as a nationally important sector and last year, numerous funds were set up at the national, provincial, and local levels to support sector R&D. China’s desire to be self-sufficient in the sector was driven by foreign government opposition to acquisitions of semiconductor companies by Chinese firms due to security concerns. Xiaomi’s new chip is also a shot across the bow of leading global chipmaker Qualcomm by the Chinese communist regime. China has long eyed Qualcomm’s dominance among high-end smartphone chips with disdain. Beijing fined Qualcomm in 2015 for almost $1 billion after a years-long investigation into supposed “anti-competitive practices.” As part of the fine, Qualcomm was forced to lower the royalty rates it charged Chinese smartphone makers using the company’s chips. Qualcomm’s royalty calculation basis was lowered from 100 percent of selling price as was the norm globally, to 65 percent of the selling price for Chinese phones. Broadening Product Range Politics aside, Xiaomi’s introduction of its own chip shouldn’t have a material impact on Qualcomm’s business. All of China’s leading phone brands use Qualcomm chips in some of their smartphones, especially the higher end ones. And Xiaomi’s meager global market share isn’t likely to have a meaningful impact to Qualcomm, even if it ceases using Qualcomm chips entirely. But given Xiaomi’s current struggles—the company last year decided to stop releasing quarterly smartphone shipment figures—the chip is all about its future. Having a first-party chip allows Xiaomi to cut production costs and obtain control over a vertically integrated process from design to hardware to software (Xiaomi has its own MIUI Android custom OS). This is the model Apple has built and perfected over two decades. And Xiaomi is among the earliest first movers to tackle the “internet of things” and smart home ecosystem products in China. The new chip allows Xiaomi to more effectively connect and integrate its wide range of product offerings. For example, Xiaomi has been an aggressive player in the wearables segment. Its Mi Band wrist monitor has a 15.2 percent global market share right behind Fitbit, according to IDC. It’s the fastest growing major brand in the wearables sector, with year-over-year growth of 96 percent compared to Fitbit’s decline of 22.7 percent. Xiaomi has a broad range of connected home and personal products spanning action cameras, routers, smart coffee machines, and smart scales. Its most recent product is a smart guitar with accompanying app to facilitate learning. Taking another page from Apple and Samsung’s playbook, Xiaomi has been quietly amassing a portfolio of patents. Xiaomi recently bought intellectual property (IP) assets from Intel, Broadcom, Microsoft, and most recently Casio, according to IAM, a leading IP industry journal. The lack of IP portfolio has long been an Achilles’ heel for Xiaomi; it’s a chief reason for the company’s limited scope outside of China. Amassing IP assets should further equip Xiaomi for future growth.

Tech Apple Science Cars Geneva Motor Show Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     IPhone 8: What You Need To Know About Apple's Anniversary IPhone Posted: Mar 13 2017, 1:20am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     The next generation iPhone, expected for a 2017 release, will mark 10 years of iPhone - it will be special. Apple is definitely not going to miss the tenth birthday of arguably the most demanded smartphone series in the world: the iPhone. The best way to celebrate an anniversary of a smartphone is to imprint the history in a ceremonial smartphone. iPhone 8 is expected to be the ceremonial model which will imprint the tenth anniversary of iPhone in the history. Don't Miss: Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway! The iPhone 8 is most-definitely going to be stuffed with latest technology features and high-end components. Read this article till the end to find out all the features and specifications iPhone 8 will be packing. Of course, most of the content is based on rumors and leaks, as the smartphone is set to release in the second half of this year, but still, information in this article is based on the most reliable resources, and will often be updated. The latest news suggests that iPhone 8 will feature plastic OLED display, meaning that the iPhone 8 will most probably be curved. Samsung Display will manufacture the display OLEDs for iPhone 8’s display, and is expected to produce almost 100 million units of those. Will The Tenth Anniversary Edition Be Called iPhone 8? A recent report from Macotakara states that the anniversary edition may be named “iPhone Edition” instead of iPhone 8. Leaks from different reliable sources claim that the anniversary edition model of iPhone will be made available after the releases of iPhone 7s and 7s Plus models. All three of this year’s iPhone releases are expected to be made in the same event. A pattern can be detected when studying the names of iPhone models since the famous iPhone 4s. Since iPhone 4, the ‘s’ model of the current iPhone is released the very next year of the original iPhone model release. For instance, iPhone 4s was released in 2011, one year after iPhone 4s (2010), and the iPhone 5s was released in 2013 while iPhone 5 hit the stores in 2012. Apple may not necessarily follow tradition this time, this year is too special for Apple, no one can be certain until an official news is released. As far as expectations are concerned, it might be possible that Apple releases iPhone 8 this year while iPhone 7s and 7s Plus are discarded, or maybe the tenth anniversary edition of iPhone could be named “iPhone X”, anything is possible. Is a Tenth Anniversary iPhone “Plus” Also Possible? Could be, Apple started the tradition of Plus editions since the release of iPhone 6. The pattern followed all the way through iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and if iPhone 7s is expected, it’s expected to arrive with a 7s Plus. But there is still the exception that makes us unsure. If Apple follows the pattern, we will enjoy a larger-screen version of iPhone 8, while if Apple wants to keep the legacy of iPhone 8 unshared, it could do that. Release Date: Either its coincidental, or Apple likes to drop patterns for iPhone enthusiasts to study and expect the future plans of Apple for iPhone. Every iPhone model from the iPhone 5 has been announced in an special event. The mentioned special events are held on Wednesdays of Tuesdays in the first or second week of September. The pattern doesn’t end there, each announced iPhone from iPhone 5 has rolled out into market two Fridays after their official announcement. The only model that broke this pattern was iPhone 6s, which was launched on the first Friday after its official announcement. Coming back to our first point, either Apple carefully left these patterns for us to expect the iPhone 8 in the first week of September with the official launch on the second Friday after the announcement, or its just coincidence and iPhone 8 could be announced on any unknown date this year. All New Design: A company as creative as Apple doesn’t wait for something to happen, it plots the future of its products quite earlier to get more time for prototyping and enhancing the end-product. iPhone in specific, is known to make an unpredictable entry in each of its iteration when we talk about design. iPhone 3G had a plastic frame, iPhone 4 had a glass back and antenna band out of nowhere, then arrived the iPhone 5 with an untraditional aspect ratio of 16:9 and sharp-square edges with rounded corners, suddenly the next iPhone had a larger display screen and rounded edges. Only iPhone 7 failed to surprise the world as it followed the same design traits as iPhone 6. Although it could be because Apple wanted the world to get completely bored with the current design so everyone would fall in love with the new design in iPhone 8. As seen in rumored renders of iPhone 8, the next model in-line is going to make a more heroic entry in terms of design. With a minimal-bezels front, virtual home button or a complete function bar, and fingerprint sensor integrated on the display screen, people will pay anything to get their hands on the upcoming iPhone 8.The back is expected to be glass, while the edges will either be stainless steel or aluminum. Color Themes: iPhone 5s, 6s, and 7, each of these models were accompanied by a completely reimagined color theme. iPhone 5s with Gold, iPhone 6s with Rose Gold, and iPhone 7 with Jet Black color theme. iPhone 8 is most-probably going to introduce another innovative color theme to signify its value in Apple’s history. A report by Macotakara suggests that a new color theme featuring red as the primary color will be available for current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the same theme could also be an option for the upcoming iPhone models this year. Specifications: Apple’s own line of mobile chipsets – the A-series – has been featured in iPhones since 2010. Each iteration of the smartphone received a new iteration of the CPU chipset too. iPhone 8 is also expected to receive an upgraded chipset (probably A11). Secondary processors have been used often in iPhone models to handle smaller independent features in the device, like motion voice activation and big.LITTLE fusion. The A11 could be packing the processing power to not only implement these features, but also augment their capabilities and induce AI-functionality. Not to forget, the virtual function area will also be adding load to the chipset. Apple has been tirelessly working to create iPhone an “Apple-only” entity. Custom chipsets were the first step, rumors suggest that future iPhones will feature custom Apple-made Graphical Processing Units and modems. For now, it is rumored that Intel will supply the modems for iPhones released this year. Any Possibility Of The Fancy Smart Connector? The magnetized connectors which were introduced in iPad Pro, later spotted in the Apple MacBook Pro, could surely be a great addition to the future iterations of iPhone. Capabilities of the smart connector surpass from charging and enter into the modular arena. If a smart connector is engineered for iPhone 8, it could be used for a miniature keyboard specifically designed for iPhone 8, like a keyboard was designed specifically for iPad Pro. Speaker packs are an option, augmented cameras, 360-view VR cameras, 3D cameras, mimicking capabilities in car infotainment systems, all could be possible. Keep checking back on the article to stay up-to-date on the matter. Display: iPhone’s LCD panels with standard screen resolution have been a huge help in battery saving, making them a good choice so far. But introduction of VR-environment and specifications of Samsung and LG’s flagship models are making the current display of iPhone an obsolete one.Not to worry though, a high quantity of rumors claim that Apple will introduce the OLED display panels with 1920x1090p and 2560x1440p screen resolutions in the upcoming models of iPhone this year. Although, Apple worked really hard to develop the 3D Touch feature in iPhones’ LCD display panels. The feature could be discarded, or Apple could re-engineer the new OLED panels, or possibly even stick with the old LCD panels altogether. Digitimes has also reported that one of the iPhone model this year will feature a 5.8” AMOLED display while the other models will pack the regular LCD panels. OLED versions of future iPhone will most-probably be curved, claims Korea Herald. Such iPhones will utilize plastic, instead of glass, ultimately creating the question: “If iPhone 8 is Glass Back, well it not be the OLED version?” iPhone 8 will not adopt the True Tone System, although it did receive the DCI-P3 color mechanism, which is also implemented in iPad Pro. Still the True Tone System is a considerable short-coming for the upcoming iPhone. True Tone System measures the surrounding light and adjusts the Gamma/Contrast ratio to provide a visually smooth experience. Will iPhone 8 Be IP68 Certified? iPhone 7 was a certified IP67 model, which made it impervious to accidental and minimal exposure to water, but it is too risky to push the limits. iPhone 8 on the other hand, is highly expected to be IP68 certified. Completely waterproof (dustproof too), says the job description. Imagine diving into seawaters without any fear and photographing your friends and fellow fishes with the dual-camera you so love in iPhone 7. iPhone 8 is highly anticipated to be IP68 certified according to a report surfaced through The Korea Herald. Are Wireless Charging Rumors True? An implementation of wireless charging had been impossible through metal surfaces, which was the main reason why iPhones since the iPhone 5 couldn’t offer the wireless charging feature. Apple however, is a stubborn child. Reports stated that iPhone has been working on developing a mechanism which would offer wireless charging (inductive charging) even through metal sheets. Rumors of success followed recently, making the aluminum-back of upcoming iPhones no longer a drawback. May it be a glass back, metal, or plastic, wireless charging is now advanced enough to function through any of these surfaces. So, do expect a wireless charging feature in future iPhones. Ming-Chi Kuo, an expert analyst from KGI dropped the word that Apple is going to use a graphite sheet as a protector for the 3D display panel against the heat generated due to wireless charging. What no one else could offer, will be brought by Apple. Apple recently patented a lot of concepts suggesting that wireless charging could be conducted even from a distance. The resonant inductive coupling will allow future iPhones to charge without being placed on a pad. This technology may not be operational till the entry of 2018. Ceramic Frame, Possible? Yes, after watching the Apple Watch 2 been built inside a ceramic frame, you might want to know if iPhone 8 could also feature such material which even stronger that stainless steel. Using a ceramic frame for a device as large as a 5.5-inch iPhone is quite costly. So, fingers crossed on this one.

The app is available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, meaning that live streaming every game is about as easy as could be. To get started, simply download the March Madness app from the App Store. Upon opening the app, you can either sign-in with your (or a friend’s) cable provider to access unlimited streaming of every game in the tournament. The NCAA is also offering a free 3 hours of streaming to all users, while games streamed on CBS specifically do not require a log-in at all. This sounds a bit complicated, but it’s actually not too hard to process: Because of the sheer number of games, March Madness is broadcast on CBS, TNT, TruTV, and TBS. Games that are broadcast on TNT, TruTV, and TBS are the ones that require cable login after 3 hours. Games broadcast on CBS do not require a cable log in.

Again, CBS games don’t require a log-in, while TruTV, TNT, and TBS games do. How to stream Selection Sunday on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Mac Streaming this evening’s Selection Sunday show is just as easy as streaming the tournament itself. The show, which will see the NCAA set the field of 68, officially kicks off at 5:30PM ET on CBS. Selection Sunday can be streamed on NCAA.com on your Mac, while the NCAA March Madness Live app on iOS will also have the livestream.  As we mentioned earlier, streaming CBS content doesn’t require a cable login unless you’re streaming on Apple TV or another set-top box.

April Launch Hinted Technology 0 0 0 March 12, 2017 MacBook Air 2017 Release Date: Refresh Coming This Year? April Launch Hinted Louise Elliot The MacBook Air 2017’s release date is still widely debated whether it is coming at all, but fans are still hopeful that a refresh to the sleek yet outdated Apple laptop will finally arrive this year. The most recent rumor is that the Cupertino-based company may be thinking of launching an update in April. MacBook Air 2017 announcement may come in April Hopes for a MacBook Air 2017 has diminished following a disappointing year for the laptop. Even so, the recent sale of the 2016 version on Best Buy might hint to the upcoming arrival of an upgraded variant, MacWorld reports. [Image by Dan Taylor-Watt/Flickr/CC BY 2.0] The retailer dropped the price of the latest MacBook Air during the last week of February. Until now, the 13.3-inch laptop is still listed on the website with a price tag of $899.99, which is $100 less than the original price. This sparked rumors that Best Buy is lowering its prices in anticipation of a new Air. The timing is also suspicious as an Apple event is said to be happening soon. In a report by Apple World Today, an event might be held at the 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in the new Apple Campus that will open in April. The publication suspects that the tech giant will make announcements regarding the new iPad lineup on Tuesday, April 4. Several reports have picked up this speculation. Aside from the new iPads, Apple might also be thinking of revealing other devices at that date. It’s worth noting that the 2016 12-inch MacBook and the disappointing refresh to the MacBook Air were announced in March last year, so fans are also likely to expect an update regarding the said gadgets around that time. As April is a big month for the smartphone maker, fans can likewise expect big things to come for them. Discontinuation rumors are still abundant on the internet However, there are persisting rumors that the MacBook Air will not be refreshed anymore. Speculations suggest that Apple will still keep the lightweight laptop in its lineup but will axe it once it becomes costlier to keep. And according to rumors, that time is coming soon. #eBay #laptop #macbook 2017 Rose Gold Apple Macbook: $941.00 (29 Bids) End Date: Tuesday… https://t.co/abDTY3dLWk #ebay #sale #Sale pic.twitter.com/i3uEEHRB5r — AmazonBay4u (@AmazonBay4u) February 28, 2017 As the Inquisitr previously reported, Apple is running out of reasons to keep producing the MacBook Air. Regarding weight and portability, the iPad Pro or the 12-inch MacBook easily defeats the Air. That’s not to mention that the smaller MacBook has different color options, such as the favorite Rose Gold, and has Retina display, a feature that has been rumored to arrive in the Air since it was first introduced in 2012. MacBook Air 2017 rumored specs Even though Apple might not spend too much attention on the MacBook Air 2017 anymore, industry observers still expect the Cupertino-based company to release updates. As USB Type-C is quickly becoming the norm, it is also predicted to arrive in the laptop this year. As for the speculated specs, fans are hoping to see an Intel Kaby Lake chip with upgraded RAM. Other features that might finally make the MacBook Air a competitor in the computing industry includes an E-ink keyboard, trackpad support for the Apple Pencil, and Retina display. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] The E-ink technology will allow the MacBook Air keyboard to be fully customizable regarding languages and shortcuts. The trackpad feature was seen in a patent that indicates the Apple Pencil, which only works on touch surfaces, being able to work on the trackpad. Lastly, the Retina display that is a standard for MacBooks will finally enable the Air to join the ranks of its cousins. But, these are all far-fetched ideas considering that Apple merely bumped up the minimum RAM last year. Nonetheless, the Cupertino company might still be planning big things for the MacBook Air 2017. Fans are advised to wait for news in April.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 12, 2017 at 1:16PM Image source: Getty Images. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) reign at the top of the smartphone market is under threat. Slowly but steadily, Chinese telecom giant Huawei has been spreading its wings across key global markets, in a bid to displace Apple and Samsung from the top of the smartphone heap. Huawei's ambition of becoming the second-largest smartphone company in the world received a shot in the arm in 2016, as its smartphone sales increased close to 27% from the year before. In stark contrast, both Apple's and Samsung's shipments fell 4.3% over the same period, according to Gartner. The strong growth in shipments gave Huawei 8.9% of the smartphone market in 2016 compared to 7.3% a year ago. By comparison, the market shares of both Apple and Samsung took a beating. The Cupertino-based smartphone giant's share of the market fell by 1.5 percentage points to 14.4%, while Samsung's market share fell by two percentage points to 20.5%. Huawei, however, has managed to consistently increase its smartphone shipments, leading to market-share gains: Data sources: Strategy Analytics and Counterpoint Technology Market Research. Chart by author. Having already occupied the third place in the smartphone race, the Chinese vendor will now go all out to achieve its lofty ambitions. In November 2016, the chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group told Reuters that it wants to become the second-largest smartphone company in two years. But will it be able to meet this aggressive target? China and India will be tailwinds for Huawei The Chinese company has been seeking growth in its home market. Last year, Huawei shipped 76.6 million phones in China and sat in the second place with a market share of 16.4%. Meanwhile, Apple's Chinese shipments dropped an alarming 23% to 44.9 million units, giving it a single-digit market share of just 9.6%. This means that Huawei has opened a huge gap over Apple in China, as its smartphone shipments there are up almost 22% in 2016. China will be the key to Huawei's global smartphone dominance, since it is the world's biggest smartphone market and accounted for 21% of global shipments last year. What's more, the growing adoption of LTE connections in China means that smartphone demand in the country will remain strong. GSMA Intelligence forecasts that China will have 1 billion 4G connections by 2020, compared to 762 million at the end of 2016. The increased adoption of 4G means that customers will need to upgrade to smartphones from feature phones as they move away from legacy technologies such as 2G and 3G. On the other hand, Huawei is also looking to make inroads into the Indian market. Last year, it said that it aims to have 10% of the Indian smartphone market by the end of 2017. In fact, Huawei's Indian consumer operations reports directly to the Chinese headquarters, showing the company recognizes the importance of this market. This is not surprising as annual smartphone sales in India are expected to top 200 million units in 2020 (rising from 102 million units last year), making it the world's second-largest market. If Huawei manages to carve out a 10% share for itself in India, it can add 20 million units in smartphone sales. This looks like an uphill task since it had just 0.5% of the Indian market in the first half of 2016. But in September 2016, Huawei began its smartphone manufacturing operations in India, and it plans to manufacture 3 million units by the end of 2017. If it is able to convert all these units into sales this year, the company's Indian market share will gain respectability. By comparison, Apple is yet to get its manufacturing operations in India into full swing. Though its manufacturing partner Wistron has set up a plant in the southern part of the country, it will only produce around 300,000 to 400,000 units of the iPhone SE initially. This is a far cry from Huawei's manufacturing capacity. The secret behind Huawei's growth Huawei has a smart formula to win over customers in big smartphone markets -- offline sales. In China, Huawei plans to set up 1,000 stores across all counties, apart from striking partnerships with distributors and retailers. It also plans to deploy 460 service stores in 45 nations. Meanwhile, Huawei has partnered with more than 50,000 retail outlets in India and is going to set up more than 200 service centers. The company's offline-store strategy for emerging markets is a smart one, allowing it to gain more eyeballs and eventually increase sales. In fact, offline sales in markets such as India have been the key to the success of Chinese smartphone companies, since customers have been able to touch and feel their phones before buying. And, just 35% of the Indian population had access to the internet last year, which could be another reason that Huawei has been busy opening retail outlets in smaller cities. A similar scenario is unfolding in China, where offline smartphone sales are gaining momentum. The growing shift toward offline smartphone sales has encouraged Huawei to drastically ramp up its company-owned stores. Huawei had bumped its global store count by 116% to 35,000 toward the end of May 2016. The company has further strengthened its retail presence as it planned to open another 15,000 stores in 2016 itself. Around half of its stores are on the Chinese mainland and across the rest of Asia, with the next-largest fraction in Europe. By comparison, Apple has 491 stores spread across the globe, and over half of them are in the U.S. What's more, its store presence in markets such as India and China is negligible compared to Huawei's. Apple reportedly had 40 stores in China by the end of June 2016, when Huawei had over 11,000 stores on the mainland. On the other hand, Apple's plans to open stores in India have been slowed by regulations, though it might open up three of them this year. Huawei's strong retail presence is complemented by the company's strategy of offering both budget and premium smartphones. The Honor 5C, which some reviewers count among the top budget phones, costs less than $170 in India at current exchange rates, placing it way below the global-average smartphone price of $256. In fact, Huawei also sells feature phones in emerging markets that cost less than $100. These budget phones help bring customers to its stores and improve brand awareness. The company is now gradually moving into the higher segment of the market by launching more mid-range and premium phones, which should eventually improve the average selling prices of its phones. Image source: Huawei. The takeaway A strong retail presence and an extensive product portfolio that covers all segments of the smartphone market have been the catalysts behind Huawei's growth. In fact, the company's two-pronged strategy has put it in the limelight, as the value of its brand grew 28% in 2016 on the back of high-end devices and marketing campaigns. Apple and Samsung, therefore, have a fierce competitor that looks capable of breaking into the top two in the smartphone market. Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Kawasaki’s first stint at Apple dates back to 1983 where he served as the company’s Mac evangelist, essentially touting the benefits of the Mac platform to developers and the public at large. Don't Miss: Leak: Can the iPhone 8 compete with a Galaxy S8 that looks like this? Earlier this year, Kawasaki penned an interesting post on Quora where he detailed what he learned from his time working with Steve Jobs. What makes Kawasaki’s perspective so fascinating is that his experience working with Jobs occurred during the mid-1980s, long before Jobs managed to tone down his legendary temper. Based on his time at Apple, Kawasaki relays that being 100% honest at all times was the most valuable thing he learned from working with Jobs. Indeed, we’ve seen a number anecdotes from former and current Apple employees over the past few years articulating the same, namely that Jobs didn’t necessarily demand that everyone agree with him at all times, but rather that he respected complete honesty, no matter how brutal. On the flipside, Jobs himself was never one to shy away from hurting anyone’s feelings in the interest of delivering cold hard truths. Laying out the benefits of steadfast honesty, Kawasaki writes: Telling the truth is a test of your character and intelligence. You need strength to tell the truth, and intelligence to recognize what is true. People yearn for the truth—that is, telling people that their product is good just to be positive doesn’t help them improve it. There’s only one truth,so it’s easier to be consistent if you’re honest. If you are dishonest, you have to keep track of what you have said. All in all, some wise guidelines for life, both in and out of the workplace.

By: Gizbot Bureau Updated: Friday, March 3, 2017, 10:37 [IST] Apple may soon set-up manufacturing plant in the US, in an attempt to create more domestic jobs, this move is in light with the pressure from the Trump administration. The company is believed to expand its $50 billion US manufacturing and supplier base as stated in a media report. "We love this country. We will continue to look for ways to expand and help in any way that we can," Cook was quoted as saying at the company's annual meeting in Cupertino. Apple CEO, Tim Cook went on to further state that though the final assembly of the iPhones is done in China, the semiconductors, glass screens and adhesives for the device are made in the US. He also pointed out that though only one-thirds of the company revenues comes from the US, it still maintains two-thirds of its employees in the US. SEE ALSO: Apple's next generation iPhones will likely feature USB Type-C port The company is still looking at options to expand its operations in the US and feels that Apple could only exist in the US. Though all of this may be due to the pressure from the Trump administration it will be interesting to see how things pan out. Apple had recently shown interest and even confirmed to start manufacturing its iPhones in Bangalore, India. Though it is rather early to know for sure what Apple has planned we could very well see Apple operating from both India and the US owing to the relationship between the two nations. None-the-less we will keep you posted on the latest updates as and when we get them.

If you have suggestions for topics or specific questions you’d like to see answered, feel free to let me know. Catch up on past installments here.  In this week’s installment of EduTech, we’re taking a break from our recent app coverage to highlight some hardware that will make life in the classroom a bit easer. Specifically, we’re going to focus on iPad accessories that are of great use in the classroom, including keyboards, docks, styluses, and more. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Even though we hear many doomsday stories about iPad in the classroom, and about the iPad in general, the device is still heavily relied upon by students and teachers around the world. Chromebooks may be popular, but that doesn’t change the fact that iPads are also one of the most common learning devices. One of the biggest benefits of using an iPad in the classroom is the vast market of accessories available for it. Companies have been making iPad accessories ever since the device’s beginning, which means at this point in its life-cycle, there are some pretty useful ones available. Read on as we break down the best accessories for using an iPad in education… Keyboards The iPad has long been compared to a computer, especially by Apple itself, and one of the accessories that most helps justify that comparison is an an external keyboard. The iOS keyboard is the best software keyboard I’ve ever used, but for writing long-form papers and taking notes, it’s really beneficial to have a physical keyboard. There are a variety of options on the market for iPad keyboards, and it somewhat depends on whether you’re using an iPad or an iPad Pro. Fear not, as we’ll tell you the best choice for either device. If you’re using a normal iPad, my personal pick for a keyboard is the Brydge Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard ($129.99). This keyboard is backlit and detachable, meaning that if you don’t need it right that second, you can snap it off and slide it back in your backpack. The Brydge, in my testing, provides the typing experience that’s closest to what you get with a laptop. If you’re using an iPad Pro, Apple of course makes its own Smart Keyboard, but that’s not my recommended choice. My choice is Logitech’s CREATE Keyboard ($129.99), which connects via the iPad Pro’s Smart Connector, includes an Apple Pencil holder, and has a much better key design than Apple’s own Smart Keyboard. One important thing to note here: If you choose an iPad Pro keyboard that connects via Smart Connector, it will only work with the iPad Pro. On the other hand, most other keyboards connect via Bluetooth and thus can be used interchangeably. The central thing to look for when shopping for an iPad keyboard is to ensure that it’s compatible with the iPad model you have. Below are some other options that connect via Bluetooth, just make sure they are compatible with your iPad. Brydge Aluminum Bluetooth Keyboard – $129.99 Anker Bluetooth Folio Keyboard Case – $35.99 Zagg Slim Book Pro – $149.99 ZAGG Slim Book – $54.99 Stylus Using a stylus is a mixed bag. In some instances, it can dramatically help  productivity, but it really depends on what you’re doing and the quality of stylus that you buy. Personally, I only really recommend using a stylus if you’re an iPad Pro user and thus can use the Apple Pencil. The Apple Pencil is far and away the best stylus I’ve ever used with the iPad. The level to which its integrated with iOS is what really makes it work so well. It’s somewhat pricey, but you can get it on Amazon right now for $85.87, a $15 discount compared to Apple’s list price. If you’re someone using an iPad Pro in education, the Apple Pencil is a no-brainer purchase in my opinion. If you’re not using an iPad Pro, or don’t want to shell out that much cash for an Apple Pencil, there are a few other options available. The best stylus in my testing is the Adonit Dash 2 ($49.99). The Dash 2 features 14 hours of battery life and offers the closest experience to the Apple Pencil that you’re going to get, and at half the price nonetheless. Adonit also has the Jot Pro ($22), and it’s a bit more basic and actually doesn’t require charging of any sort. For artists specifically, FiftyThree sells its own Pencil stylus ($30) that works with the popular Paper app on iOS. If you’re using a stylus with iPad or iPad Pro, check out our full guide of the best note taking apps here. Other Accessories A stylus and keyboard are the two most basic accessories that make using an iPad in education much easier, but there are some other accessories that also make education and learning easier. One of the most popular tools is Osmo ($79.99), a game system that makes learning with iPad a hands-on experience. It’s kind of hard to explain, so watch the video below for a full demonstration: If you’re working in any sort of media or photography school, you can’t go wrong with a Lightning to SD card adapter ($14.99). Wrap up These are just a few of the accessories that makes life with an iPad in education much better. This is very much just the tip of the iceberg, though.

In September, Apple released its iOS 10 operating system for select iPhone, iPad and iPod touch models around the world. In the months since its release, the company’s pushed several updates to iOS 10 users. These updates have delivered new features and bug fixes for lingering iOS 10 problems. Apple’s eradicated many iOS 10 problems but many still remain. iOS 10 and iOS 10.2.1 users are complaining about a number of frustrating issues including abnormal battery drain. Oh this iOS 10.2.1 battery drain is real. :( — Eat-Mund (@EdmundSoon) February 25, 2017 ios 10.2.1 hasn't fixed the battery issue,does @Apple even care about customers or should we switch to @SamsungMobile 😒 — 👽 (@losingsomeoneee) February 24, 2017 Wish I never updated to 10.2.1 iOS. My battery drains so fast when not in use. Wtf apple??? — Polo (@MrPolo_) February 27, 2017 @Apple I finally caved in and downloaded ios 10.2.1… the biggest L I've taken in 2017. Battery dead at 42%… — Jonathan Oliver (@Jonathanjoliver) February 17, 2017 Abnormal battery drain is a common iOS problem and it pops up every time Apple releases a new update for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. iOS updates aren’t supposed to have a negative effect on your device’s battery life so we’re not surprised to see some iPhone and iPad users expressing their frustration to Apple and its customer service representatives. How to Fix Bad iOS 10 Battery Life Fortunately, there are more than a few potential remedies for bad iOS 10 battery life issues. This guide will show you how to potentially fix bad iOS 10 battery life on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Battery drain issues can be tricky but these fixes have worked well for us, and others, in the past. These fixes will work with all versions of iOS 10 including the company’s current version, the iOS 10.2.1 update. They should work for those of you running the iOS 10.3 beta as well. Check Your Apps Before you blame iOS 10 for your battery troubles, note that there’s a very good chance it’s something else causing the battery drain on your iPhone or iPad. If your battery life starts acting up with iOS 10 on board, the first place to look is at your collection of applications. There’s a very good chance an app, or apps, is hogging your device’s resources and causing the problem. The first place you’ll want to look is your Settings. Go into Settings > Battery and get familiar with the Battery Usage tool that arrived with the iOS 9 update in 2015. This tool will show you what apps are eating the most battery and when. Look for something out of the ordinary. If you do see something odd, check the App Store for an update. Developers are rolling out bug fixes and iOS 10 support updates that could improve performance. If an update fails to cure the issue, try reinstalling or uninstalling the app completely to see if that helps settle your device’s battery. Use Low Power Mode If you haven’t been using iOS’ built-in Low Power Mode, now would be a good time to get familiar with this important feature. The iOS 9 update delivered a new feature called Low Power Mode. It’s important because it allows you to stretch out the last 10-20% of battery life on your device without having to make a bunch of manual changes. To enable Low Power Mode on your device go to Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode > On. This feature will help you conserve a few hours of battery life. Start using this feature on a regular basis. Use Airplane Mode If you suddenly start experiencing rapid battery drain, it might be because you’re in an area with poor cellular coverage. When you are in a bad service area, your iPhone or iPad will work hard to try and find a signal. This can cause your battery to drain rapidly. This is a perfect time to flip on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode is found at the very top of your Settings and it will kill all of your connections when turned on. If you’ve done any air travel during the past few years, you’re probably familiar with the feature. Once you’ve entered a new service area, turn Airplane Mode off and you should notice an improvement to your device’s battery life. Disable iCloud Keychain If you don’t use iCloud Keychain, try disabling it to see if that improves battery life. This has worked for a number of people in the past. To disable iCloud Keychain on your device, you’ll want to go into Settings > iCloud > Keychain > Toggle iCloud Keychain off. If it doesn’t have a positive impact on battery, you can always toggle it back on when you need it again. Limit Background App Refresh Do you need your apps to automatically refresh in the background? No? Well then you might want to try disabling the Background App Refresh feature on your device. It could help you conserve battery life. Background App Refresh is handy because it will allows your apps to show you the latest data once you open them. It can also be a resource hog. If you don’t use or care about this feature, go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh > and turn it off for each app that is using too much power. It’s going to be an extremely tedious process for some of you but it could help your battery life. You can also turn the feature off completely if you don’t want to go through your list of applications one by one. If this doesn’t help, you can turn the feature back on for all of your apps or some of them. Manage Your Display Apple’s mobile devices use sensors to adjust the screen automatically in certain lighting environments. Sometimes these sensors work, sometimes they’re a little off. A bright screen can eat up battery life so we recommend getting a handle on your device’s display. First, try turning Auto Brightness off. To do this, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Brightness > Off. Once you shut it off, you’ll have to adjust your screen brightness manually. this is easy with iOS 10. You can adjust it in your Settings in the Display & Brightness menu or you can simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up Control Center. Swipe up and you’ll see a bar that stretches across the length of the first Control Center card. Use it to adjust screen brightness. Restart Your iPhone or iPad If you’re looking for a quick fix, try a simple restart. Hold down the power button for a few seconds and swipe to shut the device down. Hold down the power button again to boot the device back up. Sometimes, this dislodges battery life issues. You can also try a hard reset. To do that, hold down the home button and the power button (volume down and power button on an iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus) for about 10 seconds. The device will restart itself. This won’t remove any data. Reset All Settings If none of these fixes help, it’s time to take more drastic measures to fix your bad iOS 10 battery life. The first solution we recommend is a reset of your settings. To do this, go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings and then enter your passcode. If you don’t have a passcode enabled, you obviously don’t need to replicate that step. This process should take five minutes or more and it will restore your settings to their factory defaults. So, make sure you have all of your Wi-Fi passwords handy because your phone or tablet will forget them. Downgrade to an Older Version of iOS 10 If you’d rather drop down to an older version of iOS you can do that. For a limited time. If you can’t tolerate iOS 10’s performance, you can drop back down to an older version to see if that improves your devices battery life. The downgrade loophole will only be open for a short time so you’ll need to act quickly if you want to make the move. For more on the process, take a look at our downgrade walkthrough. Upgrade to a Newer Version of iOS 10 If you’re running an older version of iOS 10 and you’re noticing abnormal battery drain, you might try upgrading to the current version of iOS 10. There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.2.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements. Restore the iOS 10 Update If you have a bunch of free time on your hands you can try a restore on your iPhone or iPad. This step should only be used as a last resort because it will temporarily erase everything on your device and could take awhile to complete. You can try restoring from your backup after you install iOS 10. If your iOS 10 battery life issues return after the restore, you will want to try this method again without restoring from your backup. Here’s how to do this on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch: Plug in and backup to the computer or to iCloud. Turn off Find My iPhone – Settings -> iCloud -> Find my iPhone -> Off. In iTunes Click Restore. Follow the prompts and the iPhone will reinstall iOS 10 from scratch. When it completes click Restore from Backup to put your information back on the iPhone or Choose to set up as a new iPhone. Talk to Apple Support Online You should also get in contact with Apple support via its website or via Twitter. @AppleSupport battery life on iOS 10.2.1 is atrocious. iPhone 6s. No change in my use habits. 10.3 needed ASAP. — Logan (@9mmhp) February 16, 2017 The company runs a Twitter account that takes questions about iOS problems and could help point you in the right direction. Take Your Device Into an Apple Store If nothing on here works for you, and Apple’s online support fails, you could try taking your iPhone or iPad into an Apple Store to have a Genius run some diagnostics. Your issues could be related to a bloated battery, it could be something else entirely. If your device is still under warranty, they might even offer you a replacement. To find your closest Apple Store, head here. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.2.1 & 8 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.2.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 12 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.2.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  The iOS 10.2 update brings 13 known patches for potential exploits. That's one more than its predecessor (iOS 10.2). These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2 update and/or the iOS 10.1.1 update, know that iOS 10.2.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2 update had 12 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.2.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.2.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 12 31 Responses 09/13/2016 tug Reply this is stupid.. if previously u dont have much issue having all the same settings.. all the same cellular coverage.. the problem is the iOS 10 itself.. asking someone to switch off this and that is not exactly the solution 09/14/2016 Z Reply For me the battery status shows that Messages app took 51% of battery in the background. Ridiculous. Turned imessage off and swiped up messages app from the background and i see a better battery. 09/22/2016 Leo Reply I play a lot of games when i was on the 9.3.5 firmware and battery wasn’t that bad but when I do it on IOS 10 it drains so fast. So obviously theres a problem with it. 10/04/2016 We're The Phucarwe Reply Silly. Nothing in here addresses the inherent battery-draining qualities of yet another Apple downdate. Most of the “enhanced” features are aimed at improving apple’s bottom line rather than your device performance. I’m beginning to think more and more about abandoning a ship I’ve been sailing since the 80’s. C’mon, Apple. 10/06/2016 SUZANNE HAMOOD Reply there need to be yet another update to the IOS10. we should NOT be paying 700.00 for a phone that wont hold a battery charge for 8 hours. I have noticed a HUGH difference and I am not a big phone user. I could usually start off the day with a 100% and if not used much that day end the day with more than 50% Its 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven’t Hardley touched my phone today its at 34% WTF!!! 10/07/2016 Steve miller Reply My 6s battery dies so fast with as much shut off and manual fetch email setting have helped a little but at 1% it seems to last for hours for some reason. I think the battery is still fine but something is ip with the battery indicator 10/08/2016 Jonas Reply Same apps, same settings and the difference is 9% battery drain over night compared to not even 1% on IOS 9. By % that is ridiculous and nearly and insane difference…. As other mentioned, this guide does not have much to do with battery tuning iOS 10, although in general terms it may work, but not for we who haven’t changed anything… 10/09/2016 Elle Reply for some reason my 6 drains at night after i upgraded the ios. Now every time I turn on my phone, instead of my lock screen I see my music screen and I’ve turned off that app. I went form 86% right before bed and woke up to 21%. 10/10/2016 Brian Reply My 5c says the battery life is fine, 50% plus, then without warning the phone will power down. When I try to power it back up, it shows the battery as being dead as a post. So I plug the phone in, and the phone immediately powers up, and shows the battery life as being where it was before it powered down…that was 57% this morning. 10/10/2016 Rene Girardin Reply Here is a link to interesting discussions about iOS 10.0.2 and Fast Battery Drain on all iPhones. All the bla bla about how to lower battery usage is OK but there is a bug introduced in Network Settings. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7685072?start=30&tstart=0 10/11/2016 Matthew Grimsley Reply same with my ipone 6S. happened twice over the weekend. 10/13/2016 Ann Reply I think it’s so funny how our phones have a good battery life until an update comes along, but then it goes to poop and we are informed “Oh it’s probably dat app you using and not iOS 10” seriously??? 10/13/2016 Colin Nias Reply Even the staff in the Apple shops are reluctant to admit there is a problem, even though its plastered all over the internet. My 6 plus has the same issues, 100% in the morning, by 6pm I’m down to 25%. Loads of apps are still working in the background, Facebook and Mail seem to be the main culprits on mine. Apple really need to up their game and stop messing around with things. Listen, if it aint broke, don’t fix it. Simples!!! 10/13/2016 RB Reply Worthless article … “If you previously did not have issues wiith battery power and now do after installing iOS 10, the problem is likely something else and not iOS 10.” Makes perfect sense. 10/16/2016 Luigi Reply Guys I too have the same problem! I am angry!! But is it possible that these Apple release an update that sucks the battery like a ferrari to 240km / h ??? !! But crazy stuff !! It lasts less than half the time of use which I did with iOS 9. But what the heck !!! Apple immediately solve this problem !! Otherwise I swear that I buy an iPhone no longer !! 10/18/2016 jamie pollock Reply full charge at 7am… 3:30pm my iphone 6 shows 90% avail. Nothing special about my setup, I check email and send Texts during the day. I just don’t talk on it much nor use GPS. IOs 10 too. I must be lucky 10/19/2016 Mike Reply ISO 10 is a joke we pay to much and for the phone and service to have to go through this on every major update now it’s the worse it’s ever been I also have a iPhones 5 that says 33% and it just turns off and I have to plug it in and it comes back on with the same amount of power 33% wtf is the deal it’s like the older the phone the worse like they are trying to force everyone to buy the newest phone apple is about to have another class action law suit how many can they take at on time I love my iPhone but there seriously pushing me away and it seem like there doing it to a lot of customers bad business they need to do there homework before they release another update load it to a few different phones and models before you release shit 10/24/2016 Curtis S Reply Privacy > Location Services > System Services Turn off everything except Emergency SOS and Find My iPhone. 10/24/2016 Greg M Reply Hi I have updated my Ipad and now not only at first most of my Apps disappeared, Now it wont even charge to let me check things Surely an outfit like yours has have some accountability for this, this is a disgrace , I had been using this for my business, NOT Happy at all. 10/28/2016 Kai Reply Do not update to IOS 10…I repeat do not update. 10.1 does not help either. Battery life 10 mins if not plug into a charger. Constantly crashes and get stuck in reboot loop. Apple genius swear there is nothing wrong with the software when I brought my iPhone 6 in. Battery life performance at 80% when ran diagnostics, genius solution was to have it replaced. My only solution is to have the phone plug in a portable charger all day and remain plugged everywhere I go. Just waiting on the 7 to be in stock…if same problem arrives, I will be officially done with apple. 10/31/2016 David Harfst Reply This is not a problem with the apps draining the battery. It’s a bug, in my opinion, with how iOS monitors the battery. I’ve had my phone at 80% and all of the sudden it shuts off, and won’t power back on saying the battery is dead. Once I hook it up to power, it comes back on, still says it’s at 80%, and I can then disconnect from power again and it’s fine. This is happenning all the time since upgrading. The latter versions of iOS 9 did this too, but it would have to be down at 20 or 30%. I believe iOS 10.0.1 was better, but since going to 10.0.2, it’s worse again. This is a real pain. 11/03/2016 TS Reply Nothing listed here is a fix. These are all kluge-y awkward workarounds, none of which should be necessary with a properly-functioning OS. 11/20/2016 Mark Clulow Reply TOTALLY Shouldn’t have to go through all this though, this in nonsense. BOOOOOO! 12/31/2016 Kenneth Wilson Reply The problem is definitely the OS. IT seems Apple is trying to push people into buying new phones. Went to Apple. Did the whole reset thing.. no change. The y then suggest it was probably the because it would not charge in their kiosk and to replace it would be $300.00. Take the phone home and the phone charges without any issues. Changed every setting possible with no change. The IPhone 6 would last about 2 hours without doing anything on it. Changed the battery out. still no change. Ended up downloading the Public beta 10.2.1 Beta 2. Phone went from 2 hours to 8 hours with not really using the phone. It still has problems, but at least this helped, But Apple is definitely hiding something. 01/08/2017 pete Reply This is ridiculous. How is this a fix for the iOS battery drain problems? Clickbait. 01/25/2017 robert walker Reply bob, after installing ios 10.0.2 on my iphone5 after recharging and with 100% recharged,without using the phone at all it lost 40% of the charge ,something wrong big time apple . 01/28/2017 Stacey Reply I started with 100% battery life when I went to bed. Played a game for about 15 min and turned that off. Set the alarm, went to bed. Woke up wondering why my alarm didn’t go off on my phone. My phone was dead with only 2% battery life. I deleted the game, thinking it may have caused trouble, but it was only using 30% of my battery. Today after 100% charge and not using my phone, it’s already lost over 20% charge. Something is draining my battery and came here looking to see if I was the only one with an abnormally draining battery after 10.2.1 update. I use an iphone 7. Think I’ll go with Samsung galaxy for my next phone. Had troubles with iphone 6 with updates and I lost cellular connection with iphone 6, now having troubles again. Been one thing after another. I’m losing 1% of battery life every few minutes. I don’t have app refresh on either. Hope this gets fixed! 02/11/2017 Tim Reply Since upgraded to IOS 10, my Iphone 6 shuts off left and right with plenty of battery life left. Sometimes shuts off at 90% battery. This is messsed up! 02/12/2017 Rosemary Reply Since I upgraded to iOS 10.2 my battery has been draining up to 30% overnight & lasts no time at all throughout the day. I bought apple iPad Air as the battery life was 10 hours. Now I’m lucky to get 2-3hours. I’m really annoyed by this. I’ve had to follow online advice about switching off apps & conserving battery life by basically not using my iPad! Even with all this, there’s no great improvement. Is Apple going to fix this situation? It’s like they’ve bugged their own customers’ devices! Not the smartest move. I’m frustrated & let down. 03/08/2017 Karen Parker Reply “There’s no guarantee the iOS 10.2.1 update will solve your problem but we, and others, have noticed improvements.” I disagree as I did not have the battery drain issue until I installed 10.2.1. I have made all your recommended changes, turned off all notifications, and still getting less than 8 hours on a charge. If you go to Apple support they just keep up with the same old recommendations and will not even take ownership of the issue. So fed up I am ready to switch to Android if Apple doesn’t fix this nonsense soon. 03/12/2017 Nicole Seiler Reply 2 weeks after my 2 year contract ran out, by end of December 2016, I started to have serious battery problems on iPhone 6. It came suddenly, just like that. I hadn’t done any update. I am still on IOS 9.3.2. I didn’t risk to update on IOS 10, afraid issues will get worse. Example: I leave the house iPhone charged 100%. 1,5 hours later: 75%. I was maybe 15 minutes on Facebook in those 1,5 hours. One hour later I got a phonecall. I noticed that battery now showed just 57%. The call didn’t last more than 2 minutes. The iPhone shut down after the call. I hang it on an extern battery, it showed again 47%.

Today is International Women's Day, and to celebrate, Apple is highlighting women in film and TV in the iTunes Store, along with women of the literary world in the iBooks Store. The entire front pages of the Movies and TV Shows sections of the store featuring movies and TV starring, directed by, or written by women. On the film side of things, Apple has several collections of movies under headings such as "Act 'Like a Girl'" and "Fight 'Like a Girl'". The company has also created special sections for several women in Hollywood, both actresses and directors, including the likes of Amy Adams, Viola Davis, Nora Ephron, and Kathryn Bigelow. Each section contains work from across each woman's career. Additionally, for today only, you can get Arrival and Loving for $9.99 each. Arrival - $9.99 - Download Now Loving - $9.99 - Download Now Apple has decked out the TV section in a similar fashion to Movies. Putting the spotlight on shows about and created by women, Apple has also built a dedicated page to some of the top women on television, including Shona Rhimes, creator of shows like Grey's Anatomy and Scandal, as well as Westworld co-creator Lisa Joy, late night host Samantha Bee, and Insecure co-creator and star Issa Rae. Meanwhile, the celebration of women in the iBooks Store isn't as extensive. Women such as Gloria Steinem, Janet Mock, and Roxane Gay all recommend books for Women's History Month, while the store also features a section for books about women who led the way in science and other disciplines, but may not have received the recognition that they deserve. You can check out Apple's International Women's Day-themed pages on the iTunes Store and iBooks Store right now on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

By Aaron Brown Aaron Brown PUBLISHED: 11:06, Tue, Mar 14, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:06, Tue, Mar 14, 2017 APPLE • GETTYA new report suggests iPhone 8 will not include a dual-curved OLED display panel Apple iPhone 8 will not include a curved OLED display panel, a new report has claimed. The next-generation iPhone was widely-rumoured to incorporate a dual-curved display, like those used in the award-winning Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S7 Edge. This would allow Apple to squeeze a large display into its next smartphone without dramatically increasing the physical footprint of the device. Unfortunately, that might no longer be the plan. According to MacRumours, a new report from IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam, the display used in the Apple iPhone 8 will boast the same flat design as its predecessor, iPhone 7. “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design,” Mr Lam commented. "Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. “This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung's reveal later this month.” Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button Mr Lam is referring to the  2:1 aspect ratio used for the LG G6. That means the length of the display is roughly double its width. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have a 16:9 aspect ratio. Previous reports about the iPhone 8 claim the flagship smartphone will have a separate Function Area beneath the display that replaces the physical Home Button. This touchscreen area at the bottom of the display will adapt to whatever is happening on screen, bringing menu items and shortcuts to your fingertips, similar to the Touch Bar included on the latest MacBook Pro models. Apple is believed to be testing a number of prototypes for the new iPhone, so it might be too early to completely write-off the long-rumoured, dual-curved design. The latest rumours follow an analysts report that claimed Apple is planning to abandon the iPhone 8 brand name. Instead, the new flagship phone will be marketed as iPhone Edition, according to a new report from reliable Japanese blog Mac Otakara. The iPhone Edition brand would reportedly be used to signal that the smartphone is a higher-end model, similar to the top-of-the-range Apple Watch, which also carries the Edition moniker. Previous rumours suggest iPhone Edition could start at an eye-watering $1,000, roughly £820. The latest report from Mac Otakara also claims Apple is still testing a number of different prototypes for the new flagship iPhone. Apple is purportedly experimenting with a number of different display technologies and materials. Prototypes being tested in Cupertino include some iPhone Edition models with an LCD display, while others use an AMOLED panel. Other prototypes are being passed around the Apple campus with and without physical Home Buttons, the report adds. IMRAN TAYLOR • BEHANCEApple is purportedly experimenting with a number of different materials, including an all-glass body Apple is also believed to be experimenting with glass, aluminium and white ceramic chassis for the device. In fact, the only features Apple is reportedly certain of are the new five-inch display size, wireless charging and dual camera set-up. That display size refers to the primary touchscreen area, which will be around 5.15 inches, according to the latest whispers from Cupertino. Meanwhile, the rest of the touchscreen – which will reportedly bleed to the very edges of the phone – will be reserved for a row of virtual on-screen buttons. According to Ming-Chi Kuo, the overall footprint of the smartphone will be similar to that of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6S and iPhone 7, which all have a 4.7-inch LED display. Apple purportedly plans to debut an edge-to-edge display in an effort to keep the physical size of the device down, while simultaneously increasing the size of the display. DRIBBLE • ALHASAN HUSNIConcept artists reveal the new Function Area at the bottom of the five-inch touchscreen Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive is reportedly designing the phone so that it resembles "a single sheet of glass". Apple is hotly-tipped to ditch the physical Home Button from the front of the smartphone, so that it can reduce the bezels around the display. But the dramatic changes planned for the next iPhone will not just be surface-deep. According to a new research note from UBS, Apple has put together a team of more than 1,000 engineers working on Augmented Reality (AR) technology ready for the iPhone. Augmented Reality sees artificial elements – like video footage, CGI animation or GPS data – placed on-top of real-world elements. Pokémon Go is probably the best known example, which lets players use the camera to search for CGI monsters within the world around them. Apple CEO Tim Cook is very interested in AR and has spoken at length about the potential for the technology. IMRAN TAYLOR • BEHANCEDespite previous rumours to the contrary, the iPhone 8 might not ship with a curved display “I regard it as a big idea like the smartphone," Mr Cook said in an interview earlier this year. "The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic or country or vertical market: It’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge." According to Business Insider, Apple now "may have over 1,000 engineers working on a project in Israel that could be related to AR". The same UBS research note claims Apple will include Augmented Reality technology inside its best-selling smartphone as early as the iPhone 8, or iPhone Edition. If Apple keeps to the same schedule as previous years, the new iPhone will be launched in September. Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities claims Apple will incorporate the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, usually located in physical Home Button, beneath the glass display in the next iPhone. Apple Park HQ in pictures - take a look at Apple's stunning new office Wed, February 22, 2017 APPLE will open its new office in April and it feature a forest and 1,000 seat theatre Play slideshow APPLE 1 of 8 Apple Park HQ in pictures According to Kuo, the current system Apple uses for its fingerprint recognition functionality will not allow for its revolutionary all-glass design. Instead, Mr Kuo claims, the new fingerprint sensor will require optical sensors to read the print resting on the display. The complicated new display set-up, which presumably will still need to incorporate the pressure-sensitivity debuted with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, will require a number of new, custom solutions from the panel manufacturers. However the KGI Securities research report states that Apple has enough clout within the industry to get the system built ready for the new iPhone. Alongside the new fingerprint recognition technology, the iPhone Edition could also see Apple introduce facial tracking sensors into its flagship smartphone, Mr Kuo has claimed. These could be used to scan users' faces to help verify identification. Mr Kuo believes the fingerprint recognition system will "ultimately be replaced by a facial recognition system" in an effort to make the iPhone even more secure. "However, if the technical challenges cannot be overcome, we believe a combination of fingerprint and facial recognition is another possible solution," he writes. Elsewhere, Apple is reportedly looking to distance itself from the curved aluminium design language it has used for the past three generations of iPhone, first introduced with iPhone 6. With the Home Button gone, Apple can extended the display to the bottom of the phone – reducing the chunky bezels around the screen, and shrinking the overall footprint of the device. Apple is expected to debut its new industrial design language early next year with a refresh of its iPad range.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Brian Barrett. Brian Barrett Security Date of Publication: 03.12.17. 03.12.17 Time of Publication: 8:00 am. 8:00 am How to Update All Your Gear (For Safety!) Wired This week’s WikiLeaks revelations, which showed that the CIA can compromise a huge range of devices, shouldn’t send you into paroxysms of fear over your smartphone. It should, though, be a solid reminder that one of the best ways to keep yourself safe from hackers is also one of the simplest: Update your gear. What allows hackers access to your devices, after all, are breakdowns and vulnerabilities in the firmware (read: operating system) that runs them. Many companies push out updated versions of that firmware regularly, and those releases often include important security updates. A recent example? In January, Apple pushed out iOS 10.2.1, which which patched over a dozen vulnerabilities—some of them major. That’s an extreme but not isolated example. And while there are plenty of other tin-foil hat strategies to securing your digital lives, the absolute simplest, surest way to achieve a baseline of protection is usually just to hit “update.” With that in mind, here’s how to keep all of your gear as up to date as possible. Find a few hours some weekend to back up your stuff, and then bang out the update. It won’t make you anything close to bulletproof, but it should grant you some much-needed peace of mind. iOS Okay, the easy one’s first. Apple updates iOS pretty regularly, and will badger you with notifications until you catch up. Nearly 80 percent of iOS devices, for instance, are already on iOS 10. Good work! If you’re one of the laggards, or if you’ve been skipping the iterative updates, getting caught up is easy. If your battery level’s healthy, head to Settings > General > Software Update. Then tap Download and Install, at which point you can decide to install at that moment or schedule it for overnight. If you go with the latter, plug your phone in before bedtime. And that’s it! You’re up to speed. Back to Clash Royale. Android Here’s where things get trickier (yes, already). The good news? Google releases monthly security updates for Android devices. That’s great if you own a Nexus or Pixel smartphone, but less helpful across the rest of the big wide Android world. Hack Attacks Andy Greenberg How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) Michael Calore Worried the CIA Hacked Your Samsung TV? Here’s How to Tell Brian Barrett How To Stop Your Smart TV From Spying on You While Google shares that updated code with its hardware partners, it can take a long, long time for it to reach devices that aren’t sold by Google itself. That’s because manufacturers often run modified versions of the operating system, meaning regular changes aren’t quite as simple as plug-and-play. Carriers also sometimes weigh in on when and how a smartphone or tablet update happens. While some manufacturers, like LG and Samsung, have committed to the monthly patch process, It’s a situation that leaves millions of devices potentially exposed. As of publication, fewer than three percent of Android devices had received last fall’s Nougat update, with only half a percent on the latest push, Android 7.1. So the best way to keep Android device updated, then, is to stick with a Nexus or Pixel. Regardless of your specific device, though, go to Settings > About Phone > System Updates to see what you’re running, and if there’s a more recent version available to you. MacOS Easy as pie! Your Mac is probably already up to speed, because Apple hounds you with daily reminders until you concede. Just in case you want to be extra-sure you’re up to date, though, click on the Apple icon at the top of your screen and hit Software Update. That’ll get you to the Mac App Store, which will show you what needs downloading under the Updates tab. Select the latest and greatest, and do a little air guitar solo while you wait for the install to finish. Windows Windows 10 features automatic updates, so you should be doing just fine. It’s worth checking just in case you’re behind, though. To do so, head to Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update > Check for Updates. Getting yourself from an older version of Windows may be slightly more of a pain, but not by much. Just head to this link https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10, select which version of Windows 10 you want, click Download Tool Now, launch the tool, and follow the instructions from there. It’ll take a while, but it’s worth it. Your TV One WikiLeaks revelation that took casual observers aback? The CIA used malware to turn a specific set of Samsung televisions into eavesdropping machines. Creepy! But maybe not as surprising as it seemed. Smart TVs have gotten in trouble for tracking their viewers for years; the perpetrators have just been advertisers instead of spies. In most cases, the best thing you can do with a connected television is to disconnect it. Get a Roku instead! You’ll love it. Otherwise, many smart TVs offer automatic updates by default. If not, or if you just want to double check, a manual update usually sits just a few remote-clicks away. On an LG webOS TV, go to Menu > System Settings > About > System Updates. For Samsung, go to Menu > Support > Software Update. For Sony, hit the Home button on your remote, then go to Help > System software update > Check for a system software update. Vizio? Press the Menu button on your remote, click on System > System Information > Service Check. Routers Oh boy. OK. This one’s not fun. And we’re not going to be able to cover all of them here. But know that routers act as the first line of defense against hackers and botnet recruiters, so keeping yours up to date really can be worth the hassle. For Netgear, head to this website. on a device that’s connected to your network. Enter the user name and password; the defaults are “admin” and “password,” respectively. (Also: Change the defaults.) Go to Advanced > Administration > Firmware/Router Update > Check. If there’s an update available, click Yes, and hope you don’t have to fiddle with it again any time soon. Linksys has an auto firmware update feature, but if you’d rather go manual, head to this site http://support.linksys.com/, then enter your router’s model number. Click on Downloads, select which version of the hardware you have, and then click Download. Agree to the terms of service, save the file to your computer, access your Linksys Smart Wi-Fi Account (more details on that here), click Connectivity, then Router Firmware Update, then Choose File, and run that sucker and follow the instructions from there. And so on. Fortunately, it’s not always so annoying. You can update Apple’s AirPort routers through the AirPort Utility on your Mac. The Google Wi-Fi mesh network routers update automagically, as do Eero and lots of other next-generation routers, which saves all kinds of headaches. That should just about cover your most critical devices. Or at least, going any further would mean unpacking every single IoT system you’ve signed on with. For those, just make sure autoupdates are turned on, and that should help plenty. Or, you know, don’t put your dishwasher on the internet in the first place. Go Back to Top.

He's off to a good start. He was part of a team of kids that won the 2015 TechGLOBAL Civic Hackathon for an app called VoicePedia, which reads Wikipedia entries aloud for the visually impaired. It's available on Apple's App Store. The second app of his to be accepted into the App Store was a derivative called RecipeReadr, which reads your recipes aloud. It cost $1.99 and has had a couple thousand downloads, so far, Royzen tells us. That was enough of a commercial success to land him a scholarship to Apple's 2016 Worldwide Developer's Conference teen program, where he briefly met Apple CEO Tim Cook and Apple's famed senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi in what he describes as a "life changing" event. A few years ago, Apple didn't allow teen programmers into its conferences at all. As we previously reported, one of the most famous Apple teen coders was John Meyer who invented the flashlight app Just Light for the iPhone 4 (before Apple integrated a flashlight feature into iOS). He followed that up with a hugely successful app called Perfect Shot. When Mayer was 16, he had to sneak into WWDC, getting his father to get a pass for him. (Meyer is now in his early 20's and running his own citizen journalism startup, Fresco News.) Today, however, Apple welcomes young programmers with open arms via its WWDC scholarship program. Apple gives about 400 kids a free pass to the conference (and will even help pay for travel for a handful of them). They attend special programming where they can meet other kid programmers and get feedback on their work from Apple employees. Apple just opened up applications for its 2017 scholarship program. View photos Michael RoyzenMore (Michael RoyzenMichael Royzen) Hands-on inspiration Tim Cook always makes an appearance with the teen scholarship winners at WWDC. When Royzen met him, he was both star struck and inspired, he says. "I felt so much appreciation. This is the man who makes my work possible. I asked him to sign my iPhone. I look at the signature to push myself harder as a developer and even as a human." But it was an interaction with Federighi that really influenced him. The head of software spent a few minutes talking to Royzen about his work and some of Apple's new dev tools. The result is Royzen's latest app called Ryde, which will helps you manage your daily commute so you always arrive on time. Royzen built it because he noticed that some days it took him longer to get to school than other days, he said. While iOS and Google Now will both tell you when to leave for an appointment in your calendar, that doesn't work for stuff you don't put into your calendar like your daily commute or your trips to the gym, your kid's daycare center, etc.  This app checks traffic, tells you when to leave and also the fastest route to get there each time.  "It uses some of the new Maps APIs that were released and the new design language that was announced," Royzen says. "I built it using the inspiration I got from Craig Federighi and Tim Cook." View photos Michael RoyzenMore Read More (Michael RoyzenMichael Royzen) Ryde hasn't gone crazy with downloads yet, but it's gotten some nice reviews. More importantly, Royzen's experience represents how far Apple has come in its encouragement of kid coders. The interaction with Federighi was a particular highlight, because the exec talked one-on-one with them. "Having that short conversation, I could tell how passionate he was about his work and how dedicated he was to building high quality products," Royzen said. He was also left with the sense that these two powerful men were not just smart, they were also "humble," he said and left this young programmer with "a burning desire to do more." Given all the recent news of bad behavior among some techies, which makes all of Silicon Valley sound like a frat house, Royzen's simple ambition to work hard and be humble is a breath of fresh air.  NOW WATCH: A body-language expert analyzes Trump's unique handshakes More From Business Insider 'No country would find 173 billion barrels of oil in the ground and just leave them': Justin Trudeau gets a standing ovation at an energy conference in Texas These sheets are one of the biggest viral-marketing successes of the last few years — here's why Programmers in the Valley are pressuring their friends to quit working at Uber Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The popular talk show host is back at it with another parody Apple commercial and the latest one addresses some of the most pressing concerns surrounding the recently proposed Republican healthcare plan. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE The one-minute spoof opens like a standard Apple commercial with overly-dramatic shots and music, but quickly puts a comedic spin, taking jabs at recent comments made by Rep. Jason Chaffetz: “At Apple, we don’t think you should have to choose between an iPhone and quality healthcare. Because you can have both.” This is when things swiftly take a turn for the hilarious – and the weird. The ad lampoons how ridiculous Chaffetz’s comparison between consumer products and healthcare is by running through a series of increasingly ludicrous scenarios on how you can use your flashy Apple devices for your medical needs. This isn’t the first time Conan has leaned on Cupertino-style lingo and imagery to bust jokes. Back in 2016, the talk show host poked fun at how easily lost the AirPods are in another fake ad. He also ridiculed a leaked patent hinting the company might be working on what appeared to be a mysterious high-tech shopping bag. Watch the full parody commercial in the video section above.

Here are six things you should to know about it and how it compares to Pandora. Apple says that Apple Music is essentially numerous different music streaming services rolled into one to create a convenient service with all of the features that it thinks users will love. Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine took the stage at Apple’s WWDC keynote to introduce Apple Music and talk about some of the new features. It appears as if this was the main reason why Apple bought Beats a while back. Many people were confused as to why Apple would buy a company like Beats, but it’s more clear now. In any case, though, Apple Music is here and it looks to take on the music streaming industry once and for all. Iovine called the current music streaming industry a “fragmented mess,” with Pandora being one service in the middle of it all, but Apple looks to change that with its new music service. If you’re interested in what Apple Music has to offer compared to Pandora, here are six things you ought to know about the differences between Apple’s new music streaming service and Pandora. 24/7 Radio Something that Apple Music and Pandora sort of have in common is that there’s 24/7 radio, but Apple Music plans to do it a bit differently. Instead of just music playing all the time, Apple Music will actually be able to stream true radio, with DJs and everything. It’s called Beats 1 and it will broadcast live from three cities: New York, Los Angeles, and London. The radio stations will play music that’s been curated by real people. It sounds pretty cool and if there’s one thing that music lovers enjoy about music, it’s that they hate algorithms and much prefer actual humans to picking music. Following Artists A big feature in Apple Music is called Connect, and it will allow artists and fans to interact with each other. Essentially, artists can use connect to post photos, lyrics, updates, etc. to their fans. So if an artist writing a new song, they can post lyrics, and if they’re having a personal jam session, they can record it and upload it to Connect for fans to watch. Pandora currently Artist Marketing Platform and Artist Audio Messages, giving artists a platform to connect with listeners, but we’ll have to wait and see what Apple Music offers specifically when it launches. Siri Support It’s not too surprising, but Apple Music will support Siri, which means users can ask Siri to play a song or search for a song using you voice, without even opening the app. One example Apple showed off big time during the keynote was the ability to tell Siri something like “play the most popular song from 1985,” and Siri would come back with Apple Music and play the song. It’s something that might not be incredibly useful for some users, but it’s certainly a cool party trick you can pull when you’re with some friends. Unfortunately, Pandora and Siri don’t support each other, and it remains to be seen if Siri will ever support third-party apps. Music Video Streaming One big feature that Apple spent very little time talking about was the ability to watch music videos within Apple Music. Of course you can do this on YouTube, and Google has been making that a higher priority, but in Apple Music, there are no ads, but simply just straight music videos that users can stream. Pandora doesn’t offer any kind of music video streaming at the moment, and it’s yet to be seen if the internet radio app will get that ability. However, the service recently worked with the Rolling Stones and Jack White to offier exclusive video interviews about their tours and they even had exclusive live streams of some of their concerts. Of course, music videos aren’t quite as popular as just listening to the music, but if you’re looking for something different with music, you can easily just fire up some music videos within Apple Music and watch away. Music Recommendations As mentioned earlier, Apple touts a revolutionary new way that it will bring music recommendations to you. With Pandora, it uses an algorithm to see which music you may like based on music that it knows you already like, but Apple Music does things a bit differently. When you fire up Apple Music, there will be a For You tab that includes music that’s recommended for you. To get recommended music, the app lets you choose some genres that you like, as well as a handful artists that you enjoy listening to. From there, the app will provide you with music that you may like and you can then listen to it right away, as well as create custom playlists from any music that you like. Pandora has always been known for creating music stations based on your likes, but we’ll have to see how much better Apple Music is in this department when the service officially launches. Price As for how much you’ll have to pony up for Apple Music, it’ll cost $9.99 per month per user, or you can go for a family plan for $14.99 per month. The nice thing about the family plan is that it can support up to six users, which means that it would cost just $2.50 per user if six people got on board. Pandora One is a bit cheaper for a single plan, priced at $4.99 per month or $55 per year. This is half the price of Apple Music, but there’s no family subscription available. In any case, though, the extra cost of Apple Music for a single-user plan may still be worth it, as it looks to come with way more features than Pandora.   3 Responses 11/03/2015 Pj Reply “fragmented mess,” ??? That’s a good description of the bloatware Apple calls Apple Music? 11/29/2015 Ray Reply Who says having a human make suggestions is better than a computer heuristic? What I get excited about is the possibility that Pandora will find a BRAND NEW artist for me. One that has done it totally without the “industry!” 03/11/2017 David Reply Late reply to this article, but ran across it as I’m trying to find out how to make Apple Music behave similarly to Pandora… I’ll echo Ray on this one: who ever said people prefer human-generated lists? Pandora helped to expand my music awareness so much. Customizing lists, then generating lists based off of newly-discovered songs that were a bit different… I would hear a song from a new genre, and then discover tons more music from that genre. It worked really nicely, and I wasn’t limited by someone else’s awareness, nor by industry preferences. Apple initially dipped their toes into a very similar setup (which was really exciting, and made purchasing those new songs and albums a lot easier), and that caused me to sign up with their service and drop Pandora for a few months, but then they dropped it purely for Apple Music. My Pandora subscription is up for renewal, so I figure I’ll give Apple Music a try and see if I might prefer it. If my first hour with it is any indication, I think Pandora can count on keeping my business… but Apple will still get my money when I occasionally buy songs and albums that I found on Pandora.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News Apple announces environmental progress in China Lens Technology has committed to power all of its glass production for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by the end of 2018, as part of Apple’s industry-leading supply chain clean energy program announced last year. Lens is the first supplier to make a clean energy commitment for all of its Apple production, and will meet its goal through an unprecedented power purchase agreement with local wind projects. Apple is working with suppliers to help transform the environmental landscape in China, and is proud to announce all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with UL’s Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The UL standard certifies all of their manufacturing waste is reused, recycled, composted, or, when necessary, converted into energy. Since the program began in January 2015, the sites have diverted more than 140,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. “We want to show the world that you can manufacture responsibly and we’re working alongside our suppliers to help them lower their environmental impact in China,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives. “We congratulate Lens for their bold step, and hope by sharing the lessons we’ve learned in our transition to renewable energy, our suppliers will continue to access clean power projects, moving China closer to its green manufacturing goals.” “Our power purchase agreement is the first of its kind in southern China and we hope it will serve as an example for other companies looking to transition to cleaner, more economical sources of power,” said Lens CEO Zhou Qunfei. “We’re pleased to be the first supplier to commit to covering all of our Apple production with renewable energy, and proud to source from local Hunan wind farms to power our facilities in Changsha.” Lens’ manufacturing with Apple currently includes two facilities in Changsha, Hunan province. Wind energy will cover 100 percent of the energy consumed producing Apple products at Lens facilities by 2018, avoiding nearly 450,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, equivalent to the energy use in 380,000 Chinese homes.

A new jailbreak tweak called StoreSwitcher by iOS developer Ori Kadosh is a new release that was designed with these kinds of people in mind. After you install StoreSwitcher, you can go into the App Store and easily switch between your accounts for downloading apps. To do it, you simply tap on your account at the bottom of the App Store app, and you’ll see a new button in the Apple ID popup labeled “Switch Account” as shown below: When you tap on it, you get a list of all your available App Store accounts. These are the Apple ID accounts you’ve signed into since installing StoreSwitcher. With that in mind, if you want to add another account to easily switch to on demand, you’ll need to go to Settings → iTunes & App Store and sign out of your existing account so you can sign into a new one. StoreSwitcher will automatically save your account for future access. Having multiple App Store accounts is useful for a number of reasons, including when you want access to apps that are only available in other countries or you have a particular setup with your Apple Music subscription, among other things. Fortunately, because Apple doesn’t offer this functionality out of the box, StoreSwitcher has your back and can be had from Cydia’s BigBoss repository for just $0.99. The tweak works on all jailbroken iOS 9 and iOS 10 devices, whether it’s an iPhone or an iPad.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google Pixel XL review: A great start for a debut phone With top-notch camera and game changing Google Assistant feature, the Pixel XL is inarguably the best Android phone to take on the traditional rival Apple iPhone series. Rohit KVN   March 12, 2017 16:40 IST Google Pixel XL review: A great start for a debut phoneRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google's Nexus device program was a huge hit among smartphone aficionados, who liked the pure Android experience over other phones with customised-UI. Having said that, the search engine didn't have full control over hardware development, marketing and sale of the Nexus series and that's probably why, Nexus series fell short of taking on Samsung and among other smartphone manufacturers. Google, took a leaf out Apple's book to build its own Pixel phone series as it exercised full control from product development to software, promotion and sale. Also read: Top 5 Android phone brands that raised their game in 2016 Pixel and Pixel XL boast of a powerful Qualcomm processor, latest Android software and top-of-the-line camera hardware. But, they are not the Pixel phone series' biggest asset. It's the 'Google Assistant', touted as the most intuitive voice-command feature seen in any phone, as it is powered by Google's advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithm (said to be more superior than Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana) that make the phone stand out. We recently got the opportunity to test Google's 5.5-inch Pixel XL and here's our take on it. Google Pixel XL build-quality and display review: Meets flagship expectations (4.5) Google Pixel XL comes with standard display specifications like we see in top-end rival phones. It features 5.5-inch QHD (2560x1440p) display. The colours come alive in Google Pixel XL. With brightness control features, we were able to improve the viewing in direct sunlight. So, even if you take the phone outdoors, you can read messages with minimal strain on the eyes. In terms of build quality, Google Pixel XL has got a good mix of glass and metal on the back. On the front, it is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 series glass shield. Only niggle is the use of glossy glass on the shell, as it causes dust accumulation. As the fingerprint sensor is placed right below camera, owners while trying to find the scanner, might leave sweaty finger smudges. And also, the glass without proper protection will be more vulnerable to scratches than the metal. We urge Google Pixel phone users to buy back-case and also use tempered glass cover for safety (despite Gorilla Glass protection) to save getting cracked if dropped from just 3 feet height face down. Google Pixel XLRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL Design Review: Unique, but not inspirational (3.5) There is no doubt Google has succeeded in bringing a unique design language for the Pixel phones. The use of glass for the camera-module in the top-half of the phone and leaving the rest bare with metal, creates a dual-tone effect. But, we felt it was not visually appealing. Other aspects such as curved corners and the chamfered frame around the edges resemble any other phone in the top-end category. Having said that, the phone is pretty sleek and fits pretty easily in the hands and we appreciate Google for going for smooth camera module on the back with no awkward bumps, unlike rival iPhone 7 Plus. 1/6 Dual-tone design on back coverRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL review: front display panelRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL revoew: bottom edge with dual speaker on the sides with Type-C USB portRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL top-edge with 3.5mm audio jackRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL right side edge with power and volume rockerRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL left edge with SIM trayRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL Performance Review: Does everything a marquee phone should do (4) Google Pixel XL comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 821, which can clock a speed close to 2.15GHz and is supported by sumptuous 4GB RAM and 32GB/128GB internal storage. With pure Android in the phone, we hardly faced lag in the Google Pixel XL. All the apps loaded quickly and also faced no trouble while switching between the apps. Playing graphics-rich games on Google Pixel XL was really a treat. Its high-resolution display offers rich viewing experience and powerful hardware offer a lag-free playing experience. During the performance testing on benchmarking apps, Google Pixel XL fared pretty well. It scored 1,605 and 4,023 points in terms of single-core and multi-core tests on Geekbench v4.0.3. And, on AnTuTu, it scored an impressive 131,061 points. Google Pixel XL mobile interface review: Pure Android experience with value-added Google Assistant feature (5) Like the Nexus series, Google Pixel series run pure Android and is entitled to get all the software updates, be it incremental firmware updates, or security patches and even the upcoming 'O' series OS, as well. Google Pixel XL's pure Android OS with clean interfaceRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Yes, the company is rolling out Google Assistant to all Android phones running Marshmallow (v6.0) and Nougat (v7.0) series OS, but it has to be noted that, there are some limitations, as all the devices does not possess required hardware to perform certain actions using the Google Assistant. It also got a RenderScript score of 7,040 points on Geekbench apps, which means the performance of the device, can be improved over time.

However, during the test run, Google Pixel XL was able to stay awake for 14 hours. We tried Wi-Fi-based internet surfing, WhatsApp calling (video & voice). We later switched-off the Wi-Fi and turned on the internet data to perform aforementioned tests. Later, we also played a video game for 15 minutes and also did a photo session lasting half an hour, as well. It also comes with a fast charging cable that can power-up the phone from zero to 100 percent under two hours. Google Pixel XL camera review: Best in the business (5) Google Pixel XL camera review: Best in the business (5/5)Rohit KVN/ IBTimes India Besides the Google Assistant, the Pixel XL's trump card is its camera. It boasts of a 12.3MP dual-pixel camera with f/2.0 aperture having1.55 μm large pixels. It also features fast auto-focus with Phase Detection Auto-Focus (PDAF) and Laser Detection Auto-Focus (LDAF). It is capable of taking 4K (30 fps) resolution video and slow-motion videos in HD 240 fps (8x) and Full HD 120 fps (4x) speed. It is aptly supported by CRI-90 dual-LED flash. During tests, it took gorgeous photos, be it in bright light conditions or twilight or even in the dark. The pictures were of top-notch quality. On front too, Google Pixel XL camera excels well and can a cover wide area for group selfie. It houses a feature-rich 8MP camera with 1.4 µm pixels for clearer photos in low light, f/2.4 aperture and is capable of recording full HD video, and thus guarantees high resolution video chatting. For those unaware, Google Pixel ( & Pixel XL) series is still ranked as the top-rated camera phone in the industry. Even the recently launched Huawei P10, which houses Leica's new-age camera hardware, is rated below the Pixel phone series. As per DxOMark camera standards, the P10 was able to get 87 points, while the Google smartphone scored 89 points. [Note: Apple iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus scored 84 and 86 points, respectively] 1/9 Google Pixel XL's primary camera sample taken during early morningRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL's primary camera sampleRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL primary camera sample taken during bright sung lightRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL camera sampleRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL primary camera sampleRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL camera sample shot in the eveningRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL primary camera sample taken during nightRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL's primary camera sample taken during nightRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL's camera sample shot during nightRohit KVN/ IBTimes India Google Pixel XL final verdict: A great start for a debut phone (4.5) By taking complete control over phone development, Google has done a remarkable job in its first attempt with the Pixel phone series. Pixel XL impressed us in almost all department and we were particularly thrilled while testing the camera and the Google Assistant's capabilities. With more features expected to come to the phone in future, Google Pixel owners, can hold on to their phones for long and don't have to worry about the device getting out-dated with the launch of the new phone, for at least next couple of years. With top-notch camera and game changing Google Assistant feature, the Pixel XL is unarguably the best Android phone to take on the Apple iPhone series. Pros- Impressive build quality Excellent camera, if not the best Google Assistant Dependable internal hardware configuration (Snapdragon 821CPU+4GB) Cons- We were not that impressed with the Google Pixel's design language, but this particular view of ours on this aspect can be discarded, as the matter is subjective.

Nicolai Solling, director of technology services at Help AG, said businesses are not specifically worried by the CIA snooping as they expected it after the Snowden leaks. “What businesses are worried is about is the cybercriminals, and the companies have invested a lot in security to safeguard their information,” he said. According to analyst reports following the wikileaks announcement, the CIA software that was leaked is far behind the NSA in sophistication and technical expertise. According to some reports, the CIA buys more advanced software from contractors or shares technology with the NSA. Advertisement However, Solling said that relations between the government and the technology industry has been tense since National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed secret NSA surveillance of phone and digital communications in 2013. Last year, the FBI also asked Apple to assist in unlocking an iPhone used by attackers in San Bernardino mass shooting. Apple refused and took the FBI to court over the issue. The FBI finally cracked the iPhone without the help of Apple by using a professional hacker. While some analysts say business shouldn’t be too concerned about the CIA leak on Tuesday, a number of companies listed in the leaks have been taking measure to secure their devices. Financial Times tweeted on Wednesday that Samsung is looking into security of their smart TV line after WikiLeaks leaked documents show that smart TVs are vulnerable to cyber snooping. Apple said in a statement to the international media that many of the issues identified in the leaks have already been addressed in the latest version of iOS. “Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 per cent of users running the latest version. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates,” Apple said. That biggest threats to a person’s security often comes from their own actions, one analyst warned. Sian John, chief security strategist at Symantec EMEA, said hacking or snooping is usually only possible when a malware is downloaded on to the device. According to Norton Cyber Security Insights Report, one in five (21 per cent) of people have at least one unprotected device, leaving their other devices vulnerable to ransomware, malicious websites, zero days and phishing attacks. Of these, one-third say they don’t believe their devices need protection, leaving them vulnerable to attack. “Even if your Smart TV or smart devices are switched off, the malware will make the camera and the microphone on the devices to be on always. Same is the case for Amazon Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant despite uttering the key word to start listening to users’ commands. The microphone is always listening to the users to hear the key word,” Solling said. Hackers are looking at the vulnerabilities and have found ways to ransom users data. Ransomware is software that infects a smartphone or computer and prevents users from accessing their data unless the user pays a ransom. Ransomware attacks have soared five-fold to hit 718,536 users in one year (between April 2015 and March 2016) and have become a huge problem for cybersecurity over the last few years. Solling said users should also be careful with social media networks. Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft all have the ability to track information but don’t because they don’t want to be associated with the surveillance issues. The same caution should be used when giving access to certain apps to can grant access apps, camera, photos and music. Best options for protecting your data • Keep devices running on the latest operating systems and antivirus software. • Don’t download any unwanted or unknown apps. • Don’t open messages or e-mails from strangers. • Don’t use public WiFi or open WiFi. • Never share your passwords.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch Nokia 3310 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 LG G6 iPhone 8 Home / News / Mobile Phone News / iPhone 8 might miss out on curved screen after all iPhone 8 might miss out on curved screen after all by Sean Keach 12 March 2017 0 shares Read Comments There’s been no shortage of rumours suggesting that the iPhone 8 will feature a curved screen. But it’s not going to happen, according to an industry analyst. It’s been widely reported that Apple would be introducing a special third model of the iPhone 8 with enhanced features. One of these was a curved OLED screen, similar to what we’ve seen from Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge. But speaking to MacRumours, IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam described how even though Apple will introduce an OLED display on the new iPhone (finally!), it won’t be curved. Here’s what he said: “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design.” He continued: “Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety. This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung’s reveal later this month.” Still, rumour-spinners seem fairly confident that at least one iPhone 8 model will feature an OLED screen. This would be a first for the iPhone, despite rival Samsung having utilised the technology for years. Unlike conventional LCD displays, OLED screens feature pixels that produce their own light. This means the screen doesn’t need a backlight, saving power. Also, because individual pixels can be turned on or off, the screen can show truer blacks, and thus offer a better dynamic range and wider colour gamut. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 8 in September this year, marking the 10th anniversary of Apple smartphones. Related: iPhone 7S What would you like to see from the iPhone 8?

Out of all of them, Siri is definitely the oldest and according to Apple’s speech team head Alex Acera, he explains to Reuters how Siri has managed to stay a step ahead of the competition. Related ‘Will Shift iPhone Production To US If Apple Bears All Costs’ – Pegatron CEO On Shifting iPhone Production To US For one thing, Siri is able to speak in 21 languages localized for 36 countries, and though you can say that the United States is the largest smartphone market in terms of revenue, Apple’s hefty sale numbers around the globe is a very good reason why the company has continued to enjoy a huge level of success in the smartphone business so improving those region’s native languages in the form of Siri is going to be important. In comparison, Microsoft Cortana has eight languages tailored for 13 countries while Google’s Assistant, which began in its Pixel phone but has moved to other Android devices, speaks four languages. To add to the growing list of languages, Siri will soon start to learn Shanghainese, and for those that are not familiar, it is a special dialect of Wu Chinese. Advertisement From personal experience, I have found that Siri is more accurate than Google’s speech-to-text assistant in deciphering the spoken text. Even though English is the most popular spoken language, the accent differences bring a huge hurdle when you attempt to communicate with the virtual assistant and I definitely agree that while there is significant room for improvement on Siri’s part, it makes dictation a lot simpler when you use it. Related Upcoming 9.7-inch iPad Pro Model Might Not Be Different From Its Predecessor But Only From a Design Perspective To bring in a new language to its compatibility list, Apple first starts by having people read passages in a variety of accents and dialects and after collecting a record of sounds captured, the company builds a language model that tries to predict word sequences. Apple also collects a small percentage of recordings from customers and through timely software updates, customers can expect better functionality from the virtual assistant. Apple is investing large sums of money in machine learning and AI and our assumption is that the tech giant may be looking to further improve Siri. If there is one request I would make to Apple, it is to make dictation a smoother ride than it is right now, on both iPhones and the Mac.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Brought together through baseball: Apple Valley Little League celebrates 60 years Saturday Mar 11, 2017 at 12:01 AM Mar 11, 2017 at 10:17 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_Charity APPLE VALLEY — A crowd full of parents beaming with pride filled James Woody Community Center on Saturday morning, as hundreds of uniformed little leaguers scampered onto the baseball field amid applause. It was the biggest opening day the Apple Valley Little League has ever had, organizers said, made special particularly because it was also its 60th anniversary celebration. “Looking around at all these people, we’re all from different walks of life, and all this craziness in the world, but baseball always brings us together,” Pastor Brian Riddle of Redeemer Church in Apple Valley said in an invocation. “Let us be good examples of teamsmenship and of loving our neighbors here on the field.” About 70 teams, both boys and girls alike, were called onto the field by the AVLL Information Officer Will Johnson during the opening ceremony, flashing smiles at the parents as their pictures were taken. Johnson said the AVLL is the largest Little League in the High Desert, with the baseball and softball teams totaling approximately 870 children. Following a presentation of colors by the High Desert Regulators equestrian unit and the National Anthem sung by Apple Valley resident Sophie Sooter, Johnson introduced several special guests, including Tom Perkins, a long-time member of the Detroit Tigers organization, who later threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Apple Valley Mayor Scott Nassif addressed the crowd, encouraging the children to “work hard, play hard and play fair.” Following him was a volunteer award presentation for Patrick Doran, the AVLL treasurer who Johnson introduced as “full of knowledge and always willing to lend a hand.” “I want to recognize the (AVLL Board of Directors) — it takes a lot of work to set this up,” Doran said. “I appreciate everyone who signed up and the parents coming out to practices and games, even in tough weather … And I’d like to reiterate that we need volunteers.” In between raffling prizes, the voice of Disney's Goofy came over the microphone, voice acted by guest YouTube star Brian Hull. “I’ve never seen a Little League as big as what I’m looking at right now,” Hull said. He went on to share a message for the children to “do your best,” but not stress winning. “What I remember most from my Little League experience is how much fun I had at all the games and all the friends I met along the way.” Then, as Donald Duck, Hull said “Let’s play ball!” After Perkins’s first pitch, it was AVLL President Frankye Prothero’s turn for a ceremonial pitch, followed by Ryan Moore, a 6-year-old leaguer who was diagnosed with cancer in December. “Since (his diagnosis) he has been the definition of a warrior,” Johnson said as the crowd erupted in applause to show support for Moore. The opening ceremony concluded with a surprise appearance from the 501st Legion, which is the only organization authorized by the Star Wars franchise to make public appearances, and three Stormtroopers and Darth Vader stuck around for photos with families as the celebration continued.

Apple is number one smartphone vendor in NZ for the first time since 2012 Posted on 12-Mar-2017 18:31 | Filed under: News : Apple Apple shipped the highest number of smartphones over the holiday season, according to IDC’s recently published fourth quarter smartphone shipment results, tracked from October to December 2016.    Apple have not held the number one position since the first quarter of 2012.    Vendors shipped a record high volume of 672,000 smartphones during October to December 2016, up from 614,000 smartphones shipped over the same period in in 2015. The top three vendors made up close to 80% of these shipments. Apple shipped 221,000 smartphones, Samsung fell to the number two position with 176,000 smartphone shipments, and Huawei closed the number three gap significantly reaching 143,000 smartphone shipments.    Chayse Gorton, Client Device Analyst for IDC New Zealand, believes there are three key reasons contributing to Apples fourth quarter performance in the market.    Apple overcame stock constraints observed after the release of the iPhone 7 models late in the fourth quarter. Gorton says, "even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated”.    Despite looking somewhat similar to the iPhone 6s, updated specifications were enough to entice many consumers to upgrade their Apple smartphone. Gorton suggests, "it's hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability", rather he suggests "it is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior".     Publicity issues relating to competing vendors enticed a portion of consumers to make the switch to Apple. Samsung's battery cell issues in its recently released Note 7 smartphones, and the subsequent recall, not only led the devices to be excluded from IDC's tracker, but also to some consumers to question their loyalty to the vendor.           2016 was an exciting year, with the overall smartphone market growing 10% year on year, and despite fourth quarter vendor rankings, Samsung holding off Apple to retain the number one position for the year. Overall for 2016, Samsung held 32% share, Apple held 27% share, and Huawei held 14% share.    With Apple successfully winning a quarter for the first time in close to five years, and Huawei closing the gap in third place, it is safe to say the smartphone vendor battleground is shaping up for an interesting year.   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Software » Trending now » Hot discussions in our forums right now: TiVo Service ending on 31 October 2017 Created by Riggleby, last reply by Maxcat on 17-Mar-2017 13:44 (500 replies) ... 32 33 34 Surveillance - if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear Created by Dynamic, last reply by MikeAqua on 17-Mar-2017 12:28 (92 replies) ... 5 6 7 The President Of The USA: Donald Trump Created by TimA, last reply by Fred99 on 16-Mar-2017 22:52 (3498 replies) ... 232 233 234 How to Bank API for Deposits?

News Photos Ticket Sports Obits E-Edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Site Archive With claims of CIA hacking, how to protect yourself Sunday Mar 12, 2017 at 1:01 AM By Brian X. ChenThe New York Times WikiLeaks last week published a trove of documents that appears to detail how the Central Intelligence Agency successfully hacked a wide variety of tech products, including iPhones, Android devices, Wi-Fi routers and Samsung televisions. That’s just about every major category of consumer electronics. So what does that mean for you if you own one — or several — of these gadgets? For many people, it may mean nothing at all. The thousands of pages of documents refer to programs that attacked outdated versions of the software systems running on devices, and many security vulnerabilities have been patched. On the other hand, many people may still use outdated software on their devices. And although the CIA designed these tools to spy on terrorists in the interest of national security, the hacking tools may have ended up in the hands of a whole range of entities. The fallout may also end up being broader. WikiLeaks, which released documents covering 2013 to 2016, has said its initial publication was just the first installment in a bigger cache of secret CIA material. So even if you aren’t worried about what WikiLeaks revealed about the CIA right now for yourself, here are some tips for protecting your cellphones, televisions and internet routers. If you use Android Hundreds of millions of Android users still use devices based on older versions of this Google-made mobile operating system. The WikiLeaks document collection, which includes 7,818 web pages and 943 attachments, showed that the Android devices targeted by the hacking programs were mostly running a version of Android 4.0. Today, about 30 percent of Android users, or at least 420 million people, are on a variant of Android 4.0, according to Google. The company said it was investigating reports of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents. With the limited information we have now, the best thing people can do is to stop procrastinating on updating their software. “The one thing that people can and should be doing is keeping their apps and phones as up-to-date as possible,” said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. For owners of older devices, getting the latest software updates may not be easy. Many older Android handsets, like the Samsung Galaxy S3, can't download the latest version of the Android software. If you are in that boat, it’s a good time to purchase a new smartphone — such as the Google Pixel — which is running the latest Android software. Other than ensuring that you have the latest operating system, Google recommends that Android users protect their devices with lock screens and PIN codes, and to enable a setting called Verify Apps, which scans apps downloaded from outside of Google’s app store for malware. If you use iOS Many iPhone owners are far more up-to-date with their mobile software than Android device owners. So only a minority of iPhone users have devices with the versions of the Apple iOS operating system that the WikiLeaks documents mention. Specifically, the WikiLeaks documents referred to exploits working on versions of iOS up to 8.2. About 79 percent of Apple users are running iOS 10, the latest version of the system, and only 5 percent are running a version older than iOS 9, according to Apple. But in raw numbers, with more than one billion iOS devices sold worldwide, that amounts to at least 50 million people running the outdated software. For those worried about their iPhone security, the advice is generally the same here as for Android owners: iPhone and iPad users should make sure to be running the latest operating system, iOS 10. Apple said that many of the security issues described in the WikiLeaks documents had already been patched in the latest version of its software and that it was working to address remaining vulnerabilities. Not all Apple devices can get the latest operating system. Apple’s iOS 10 is compatible with iPhones as far back as the iPhone 5 released in 2012, and with iPads as old as the iPad Air and iPad Mini 2 released in 2013. If you are using anything older than those, it’s a good time to buy a new device for the stronger security. If you have a Samsung TV With Samsung televisions, the situation is less clear. The documents mentioned programs attacking smart TVs in Samsung’s F8000 series, which include microphones for voice controls. Samsung said it was looking into the WikiLeaks reports, and noted that software updates with the latest security enhancements are automatically downloaded on its televisions. The company did not immediately comment on whether any vulnerabilities had been patched. The documents published by WikiLeaks disclosed that a tool called Weeping Angel puts the target TV in a “fake off” mode. Then, with the owner believing the TV is turned off, the set secretly records conversations in the room and sends them over the internet to a CIA server computer. Smart TVs are part of a proliferating category of “internet of things” devices that have raised security concerns because many of the companies that make them do not have strong backgrounds in information security. In a recent column I wrote about defending a smart home from cyberattacks, experts recommended strengthening Wi-Fi settings and regularly auditing smart home devices for software updates, among other tips. That advice might not be sufficient for addressing privacy concerns around Samsung’s smart TVs because the Weeping Angel hack continues to control the television even when it appears to be turned off. Craig Spiezle, executive director of the Online Trust Alliance, a nonprofit privacy group, said the WikiLeaks revelations could spur action that he sees as lacking from makers of connected devices. “I see this as a wake-up call for the industry to build better security and for consumers of these devices to rethink what they have and, in some cases, disconnect their connectivity,” Spiezle said. Protecting routers The WikiLeaks documents also described methods of injecting malware into routers offered by Asian manufacturers like Huawei, ZTE and Mercury. In general, it is wise for everyone to regularly check routers for so-called firmware updates to make sure they get the latest security enhancements. Depending on which router you own, downloading the latest firmware update isn’t very intuitive because it usually requires logging into the router. More modern routers like Eero and Google Wifi include mobile apps that help you download the latest updates automatically, so consider one of those if you are worried. Protecting personal computers The WikiLeaks documents mentioned attacks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers. Personal computers have always been the most vulnerable devices we own, so this tip is fairly obvious: Make sure to install the latest operating system updates and use antivirus software. And as always, stay on guard against suspicious websites that may be serving malware.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 12 March 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Silicon Valley firms imperilled by proposed import tariffs, ‘border adjustment tax’ Huge headache: Apple's complicated supply chain may put the world's most valuable company in the bull's eye as Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials. — Reuters SAN JOSE, California: That shiny new iPhone may say "assembled in China" on the back but its origins are scattered around the world: wafers from Taiwan, modem chips and batteries from South Korea, displays from Japan, components from Europe and raw materials from Africa, Asia, Europe and the US.  Now that complicated supply chain may put Apple – the world's most valuable company – in the bull's eye as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans consider sweeping import tariffs or a comprehensive border tax on incoming products, components and raw materials.  But while Apple has been singled out by Trump before, the administration's actions would affect a who's who of Silicon Valley's big name tech companies – which could see sales, revenue and access to global talent take a hit from new fees and the trade wars that could follow.  "It's a real mess," said Marcus Noland, senior vice president at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C., think tank that supports free trade.  Only two months into the Trump administration, it's difficult to discern how an import tariff or border tax might take shape, but the president has said he wants to punish US companies that make goods overseas to sell back home. Imposing new costs on imports would encourage domestic manufacturing and create jobs, Trump has argued.  While campaigning, Trump mentioned a 45% import tariff on goods from China and 35% on imports from Mexico. More recent reports suggested the Trump transition team was looking at a 10% fee. House Republicans, meanwhile, have proposed a 20% "border adjustment tax" covering all imports from all countries.  The list of firms with the most to lose from an aggressive new tariff or tax regime includes the valley's biggest names: Google, Tesla, Oracle, HP, Cisco, Intel, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia, Marvell Semiconductor and more.  Also standing to lose? Consumers who will inevitably have the increased costs from import tariffs or a tax passed on to them, according to experts.  "You and I are going to pay for it," said Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate, who studies supply chains.  However, others believe imposing higher import costs would deliver significant benefits.  Northwestern University law professor Steven Calabresi said the proposed 20% border adjustment tax would "encourage Americans to buy American products" and "promote good jobs here in the United States" while raising US$1tril (RM4.44tril) over 10 years.  "It will allow us to cut income taxes, which discourage people from working. It is smart to discourage a little bit of the buying of foreign goods if you can then cut income taxes and get people back into the workplace or get them to work harder," he said last week in an op-ed in The Hill.  Still, tariffs or a tax would also hit countries like China that export to the US, potentially leading to trade wars with nations whose markets and raw materials are critical to tech companies.  "If we decide to impose tariffs or high barriers to trade on our trading partners we should expect reciprocal trade barriers, which of course is not good for our industries, it's not good for prices, and the whole thing spirals downward," said Renee Bowen, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor who studies international trade.  Generally, when tariffs drive prices up, sales go down, said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a tech-focused think tank.  The tech industry has long depended on a complex global network of suppliers, workers and materials. Apple, for example, noted in its most recent quarterly report that its manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers in Asia.  "Everything that is in our products comes from overseas," Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC in February. "That supply chain has taken 30 years to set up. So when all those components come in and are taxed, it's not going to be good. This does not create jobs. It actually lowers the number of jobs for many, many companies."  HP makes printers and PCs in China, while Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital manufacture products there and in Thailand, according to analyst Handel Jones of International Business Strategies in Los Gatos, Calif.  Google's new Pixel phones are made by HTC in Taiwan, where Nvidia and Marvell Semiconductor buy chips that power products sold in the US. The Home virtual-assistance device by Google is made in China, and the company relies on Taiwanese firm Quanta to supply the servers that make it a cloud-services titan. Facebook also buys servers from Quanta, according to analysis firm Moor Insights & Strategy. Intel has fabrication and assembly plants in China, and assembly facilities in Malaysia and Vietnam.  It's not just companies making tangible products that are at risk. Even a software-and-services company like Oracle is vulnerable to tariff-related retaliation, because it has invested heavily in providing IT services in China, where its clients include state-owned enterprises. The Chinese government, on top of potentially responding tit for tat to tariffs or taxes, could bar state-owned companies from doing business with US firms, said the Peterson Institute's Noland.  Companies that make some products in the US won't escape, either. They too would be vulnerable to an all encompassing import levy, such as the proposed border adjustment tax, because they use materials or parts from other countries.  While only Congress can levy across-the-board tariffs, a US president has "limited authority" to impose tariffs in response to "special circumstances involving discrimination against US exports or other unfair trade practices," said John Veroneau, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who served as deputy US trade representative under President George W. Bush. Trump has complained that other countries make the US pay high tariffs and taxes on American products shipped overseas.  The president's focus on China and Mexico targets two nations that play critical roles in the supply chains for major US electronics firms, so high import tariffs aimed at those countries would "immediately disturb the supply networks," Noland said.  Retaliatory tariffs would mean American companies could be faced with added costs for shipping high-end, US-made components to China or Mexico for final assembly, before getting hit again when they import the assembled products back into the US, Noland said.  A full-blown trade battle with China could lead to a "supply chain war" in which the Asian nation bans exports to the US of the metallic elements used in electronics manufacturing, which would "hurt US electronics firms," a September report from the Peterson Institute said.  China could potentially ban the sale of specific American tech products, claiming security issues and saying, for example, "You can't sell Apple phones in China, because we're worried about – and then they'd make something up," Georgia Tech's Vande Vate said.  Conflict between the US and China over trade could spread to other areas, potentially affecting American firms' access to Chinese talent, Noland said.  "A trade war that started with products," Noland said, "could spill into things like visas and immigration issues, which would disadvantage the entire high tech sector."  ___ Other threatened companies and their products: Tesla has a long-term contract to buy lithium mined in Mexico for the batteries it makes domestically. Cisco announced last year it was expanding manufacturing in Mexico, where it has operated since 1993. HP has production facilities in Mexico, according to market-intelligence firm BNamericas. Bay Area companies SanDisk and Intel are among semiconductor companies make chips domestically that are sent to Asia to be wired up for installation onto circuit boards that are imported back to the US, according to Georgia Tech professor John Vande Vate. — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Panic button device and app launched Capcom and Disney team for retro game collection Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News Voice: The Next Computing Empire This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from the investor’s perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it’s now increasingly clear that the human voice will become society’s next major computing interface, and why it will continue proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II, I’ll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In Part II, I’ll discuss the various players involved in the race to commercialize the technology — those best-positioned to profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow, and those dropping the ball entirely. I’ll also dive deeper into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology continues to improve. Image source: Getty Images. For nearly 40 years, we’ve seen the computer evolve into an indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a monumental role for investors along the way. The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us into that world, offering us endless floods of information, entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and constant immersion. Now, a fourth technology — voice computing — is removing that last barrier. Reimagining the roles computers play Imagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons, asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing, having your phone translate the entire conversation between Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time. Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and reactions. These aren’t hypothetical scenarios — they’re happening right now. The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we’ll explore in this two-part series, voice computing is the burgeoning field of technology making it possible. Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual assistants on smartphones), the industry’s ultimate aim is enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style interactions with computers. It’s an ambitious prospect capable of significantly expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but it’s also one that appears inevitable when considering the trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary technology to solve unmet needs. Image Source: Getty Images And yet voice computing’s evolution is different. Unlike any form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet, manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services without ever having to touch a physical device — all in the time it takes to form a sentence. If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View Research to project the global market for voice recognition technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare, defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I’ll discuss these in more detail in Part II). There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact with technology in society, but before that can happen, a large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must occur, a shift that cannot occur until several key hurdles are overcome. Understanding the challenges ahead To analyze those obstacles, let’s turn to the most promising application of voice-driven technology today: virtual digital assistants. Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista. Chart by Author Thanks to the success of the iPhone and Apple ‚s(NASDAQ: AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most wildly used virtual assistant in the United States, but until recently, it’s also perfectly exemplified what’s holding voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing technology. It’s a problem we can break down into three fundamental hurdles. The first is that users must often resort to awkward combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field, perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, „Speech recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That’s really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably don’t want to use it very often. That’s probably where speech recognition is today.” The second hurdle is that even when our speech is correctly recognized, there still remains a strong chance it will be misinterpreted while undergoing natural language understanding, a process in which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sense of how frustrating the encounter can be. Image Source: Author’s iPhone Encounters like these make us feel as though we’re wasting our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventually discouraging us from even tryingto use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms or creating reminders. Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data, third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major players in this space have been actively accruing for years. Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized by Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and other components of voice computing at astounding rates. ( Click here for an outstanding story by The New York Times on Google’s significant role in making this happen). Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors to open their platforms up to third-party services have made today’s voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your stored Domino’s information — not unlike an actual secretary would do. As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-party commands available on Amazon’s voice-based assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot. Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by Author With time, these technical achievements and partnerships will continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the technology will convince users to begin using voice as an interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, „I think that as speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it today, to using it all the time.” He added, „Most people underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent … 99 per cent is a game changer.” Although we’re not yet able to predict when the technology will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any indication — since Ng’s speech, Baidu has built a program capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20% less errors, than human beings — it won’t be much longer. In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands in the way. It’s a problem shared by every other major computing medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it. An instantaneous computing experience No matter the medium, we’ve always interacted with computers by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines. Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result. Yet despite these advancements, today’s mediums still subject users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that inherently slows down the process between thinking a command and actually being able to communicate that command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our thumb, and tapping away. It’s a process so effortless, the average American now checks their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It’s even become fashionable to argue there’s no longer enough friction separating society from our devices; that we’re too plugged in to the digital world. So when you consider that voice computing’s primary advantage is eliminating friction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and their computing medium in two ways. Let’s take the smartphone for example. Image Source: Pixabay The seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to remember it’s on the counter even before we can do that. Then, once we’ve reached our phone, we’re required to physically handle it, a process that generally requires we have one hand free and able. That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our computing experience to revolve around the location of our device, as opposed to it revolving around us . They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing need. There’s a reason speech is our most instinctual form of communication. If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don’t pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it’s instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors are not instinctual , but we put up with them because the people around us usually don’t have the answers, and because smartphones are our best alternative. But they don’t have to be. The rise of voice It’s not obvious quite yet, but today’s physically bound mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is starting to fill it. Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to virtually bypass the friction inherent in today’s major computing mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by Amazon’s line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from across multiple rooms and through various background noises at any time simply by calling for it out loud. Image Source: Amazon.com. Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon’s Echo is giving consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing experience. Following its initial setup, there’s no pressing buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a medium. And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any indication — Amazon hasn’t officially released sales figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison to Morgan Stanley’s estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the device has achieved well over 5% household penetration — early demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce their own offerings (see Google’s Home, Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: NVDA) Spot, or Baidu’s Little Fish), and as voice recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party support continue improving at rapid pace. Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by Author To be clear, these devices will never replace today’s existing computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking on an increasing share of our more „conversational” demands, common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect from dialogue („Cancel my doctor’s appointment.” „Pause that music!” „What’s a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? … Great, order that one.”) As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society. And that’s where the real opportunities begin. The opportunity at hand Some of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life, allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new ways. In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the infrastructure that in turn enabled Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) , Alphabet, Uber, Snap , Amazon, Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) , and countless others to create businesses that reach deeper into our lives than any before. Image Source: Author’s iPhone And yet voice technology is going deeper. It’s becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of our lives than any before it. It’s called on using our most instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it’s accessible in the time it takes to form words. It’s a technology that provides tomorrow’s innovators a far more intimate and pervasive way to help us satisfy our digital wants. It’s a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both investors and society. In Part II: The Playing Field, I’ll discuss various players involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish 5.8-inch iPhone Display Might Not Be Curved After All By Tyler Lee on 03/11/2017 20:01 PDT An interesting and recent rumor has suggested that this year we might get an iPhone with a 5.8-inch curved OLED display. It is an interesting rumor because Apple has never really been one for curved displays, and it is possible that maybe with the rise in popularity of Samsung’s curved display phones that there are some who expect Apple could follow suit. However as it turns out, not everyone thinks that way. According to a report from MacRumors, they have been told by several analysts that they believe that a flat display will continue to make an appearance, even with the 5.8-inch iPhone. Instead the only curve that we can true expect would be around the edges where Apple is expected to adopt a 2.5D display, similar to that of the current design and the Apple Watch. The report quotes IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam who said, “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design.” Lam isn’t the only one who believes this to be the case as prior to this, other analysts such as KGI Securities Ming-Chi Kuo and Chinese research firm TrendForce have offered similar opinions. In any case we guess this is just something we’ll have to wait and see for ourselves. Right now the rumors surrounding the 2017 are all over the place, but hopefully we’ll have our answers soon enough. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone.

Since then, however, things have changed. Some new details have emerged, some old rumors have been squashed, and more. As we inch closer to the announcement of the tenth anniversary iPhone, we’re starting to narrow down what exactly the device might feature. It can get overwhelming with all of the contradicting reports, so read on for our full, updated breakdown of 2017 iPhone rumors… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Display + Function Area Originally, it was believed that the iPhone 8 would feature a 5.8-inch OLED display. We’ve now learned, however, that some of that display will be taken up by a new function area, making the usable screen real estate somewhere between 5-inches and 5.15-inches, though the display as a whole will come in at 5.8-inches. While there were rumors that Apple would introduce a 5-inch iPhone, it now seems as if those rumors were referring to the same flagship 5.8-inch model, but not counting the function area towards the total screen size. Following a report from KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo, we dove a little bit deeper into the math of the iPhone 8’s screen resolution and came to the determination that the device, if rumors hold true, will feature a 521 pixel-per-inch display. This number is significantly higher than the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhones, which have 325 PPI and 401 PPI, respectively. The area of the screen dedicated to the apps and interface is expected to be 2436×1125, which makes for a 21:9 aspect ratio, roughly. This could spell trouble for watching content that is 16:9, but would bring the iPhone up to par with competing Android phones in terms of screen resolution and pixels-per-inch. In terms of display technology, it is still believed that the iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone to make the jump to OLED. This, however, seems to be one of the most uncertain aspects of the device right now and really depends on Apple’s ability to source enough of the component. As for the function area, it is said to take up the bottom portion of the display and offer navigation buttons and more. Specific details are still somewhat unclear, but it sounds awfully similar to the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros, allowing for contextually aware buttons and controls. Read below for all of the details we know thus far on the iPhone 8 display and function area: Latest report suggests iPhone 8 screen features higher 521 PPI density, 3x Retina scaling like Plus models KGI: iPhone 8 to feature new ‘function area’ in place of Touch ID, 5.15-inch usable screen space Apple again said to be releasing iPhone 8 w/ 5.8-inch OLED display Report: Apple iPhone 8 to feature plastic, curved, OLED display New profile sheds light on Apple’s push to switch to OLED displays with iPhone 8 Apple reportedly sourcing 5.8-inch AMOLED panels for next iPhone exclusively from Samsung Design Not much has changed in what we expect the iPhone 8 to feature in terms of design. It’s expected to feature an all-glass design with metal casing around the sides, similar to what we saw with the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s. The ideal setup here is the beautiful design of the ‘Jet Black’ iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, but instead of the scratch-prone gloss that it uses, we’ll get a more sturdy glass design. In terms of overall size, it has been said that the iPhone 8 will be around the same physical footprint as the current 4.7-inch iPhone, but that the larger screen is possible because of the nearly bezel-less design that the iPhone 8 will incorporate. We’re still expecting the device to feature 2 cameras on the back, much like the current iPhone 7 Plus. The cameras could, however, be vertically aligned as opposed to horizontally, which would allow for more advanced 3D and sensing technology, but more on that later. Read all of the design rumors for the iPhone 8 below: KGI: OLED iPhone 8 to be similar physical size to 4.7 inch iPhone 7, with significantly larger battery Nikkei: iPhone 8 will introduce 5-inch version, all-glass backs across lineup Apple to revamp iPhone lineup in 2017 w/ iPhone 4-like design, AMOLED screen, 5.8-inch model Apple to drop aluminum iPhone casing in 2017 in favor of new ‘all glass’ enclosure with AMOLED screen KGI: ‘Increasing likelihood’ iPhone 8 will feature glass front and back, stainless steel metal for premium models New report supports glass design for iPhone 8, with iPhone 4-style stainless steel frame Home Button + Touch ID The addition of the function area and nearly bezel-less design means we will likely see the demise of the Home button as we know it this year. Apple paved the way for this change last year with the solid-state Home button, but this year we expect an entirely new embedded Home button. The Home button is expected to be embedded in the display itself, meaning that it will no longer be a separate button at the bottom of the front of the device. As for Touch ID, it seems likely that Touch ID will also be embedded in the display. Apple has a patent that theoretically allows for such a technology. Instead of the capacitive solution that Touch ID uses today, an embedded solution would use ultrasonic imaging technology that is believed to be much more accurate: The most accurate but least common finger-scanning technology is ultrasound imaging. In this type of sensor, two transducers are placed on the x- and y-axes of a plate of glass–one each for receiving and transmitting–for propagating ultrasound waves through a glass plate; when the finger is placed on top of the glass, the finger impedes the waves and the receiving transducer can measure the alteration in wave patterns. This type of scanner is very new and largely untested in a variety of conditions, but initial results show promise for the technology. It combines the large plate size and ease of use of the optical scanners with the ability to pervade dirt and residue on the scanner, an advantage of capacitive scanners.

Originally, it was widely rumored that the iPhone 8 would feature a long-range wireless charging technology. This would have been a major technological achievement on Apple’s part, but according to more recent reports, the iPhone 8 will feature inductive wireless charging. Most reports have suggested that Apple will sell the wireless charging technology separate from the iPhone 8 itself. This likely refers to something like a charging pad or mat. Even though it is expected to be using an inductive solution, it is believed that Apple has been working on its own inductive solution with Broadcom. It’s unclear how much Apple could potentially sell its wireless charging technology for, but you can read all of the latest wireless charging rumors below: Apple said to be working on wireless charging solution with Broadcom Report claims Apple will sell iPhone 8 wireless charging tech separately Apple joins Wireless Power Consortium/Qi, lending weight to rumor of wireless charging for iPhone 8 Report suggests hopes of Energous-based long-range charging in iPhone 8 may be dashed USB-C or Lightning? Well, both. While one Wall Street Journal report suggested that Apple would make the jump to USB-C with the iPhone 8, that doesn’t necessarily appear to be the case. Instead, it seems like the iPhone will stick to the smaller and proprietary Lightning connector, but rather start including a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box with a USB-C wall adapter. Doing this will allow for owners of recent MacBooks and MacBook Pros to plug their iPhone directly into their laptop, while USB-C charging would also be faster than Lightning to USB-A. There are several reasons as to why Apple likely isn’t switching to USB-C all around this year. For one, regulating USB-C accessories is much harder as it is an open standard. Lightning, however, is Apple’s own standard and thus it can more strictly regulate what type of accessories are produced using the connection. Apple also, of course, collects royalties on all certified Lightning accessories. WSJ: iPhone 8 to replace Lightning connector with a USB-C port KGI reports Apple iPhone 8 will not switch to USB-C, internal upgrades will support fast charging over Lightning 3D Sensing + AR Technology Apple’s plans for 3D sensing and augmented reality are a bit more unclear, but it’s widely believed that Apple has a relatively large team working on the technologies. Apple has also made a number of acquisitions in this area. Most recently, it has been reported that the iPhone 8 will feature a revolutionary 3D-sensing front camera that detects depth for games and facial recognition. This type of technology also lends itself to face recognition for unlocking the iPhone, providing another secure biometric way of doing so. We also recently outlined the two ways 3D depth-sensing could work on the iPhone 8, both of which can be seen in the image above. The first way: The simplest way to sense 3D space is to use what the note calls Time of Flight (ToF). An emitter transmits a signal (for example, in infrared) and times how long it takes to bounce off an object in front of the iPhone and return to a sensor. From a series of timed returns, the iPhone can build up a 3D image of what is in front of it. The other, more advanced, technology: Known as Structured Light, a known pattern such as a grid is projected onto whatever is in front of the iPhone. This grid will be distorted by the 3D shape of the object it hits, and the iPhone can then analyze this deformation to calculate the shape of the object. Tim Cook has continually spoken fondly of augmented reality, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Apple is working diligently on implementing it into the iPhone.

Throughout this post, I’ve referred it as the iPhone 8, but a recent report suggested that it may be called the iPhone Edition instead. We really don’t know and probably won’t know until we get much closer to the fall unveil… As for that fall unveil, it’s believed that Apple will announce the iPhone 8 in September, but that because of the advanced production technology the device will require, it won’t actually hit store shelves until a couple of months after that. According to reports, the 3D sensing technology and OLED display are what’s causing Apple to push the release back. The iPhone 8 is expected to be the most expensive iPhone to date, according to a Fast Company report. The device could come in at above $1000, but that’s not necessarily insane when you take into consideration the monthly payment plans that most smartphones are purchased on nowadays. Report: 3D sensor production ramp suggests iPhone 8 to launch later than September Report: iPhone 8 to feature Lumentum-sourced 3D sensor, launch above $1,000 this fall despite early production rumors Report: iPhone 8 to start mass production in September Report: This year’s flagship iPhone may be called the ‘iPhone Edition,’ launch well after announcement Comment: A flagship iPhone 8 going for $1000+ isn’t as outlandish as it may sound, are you in? [Poll] Wrap Up It seems clear that this year’s iPhone will be the biggest release in the device’s history. With an all-new design, wireless charging, an OLED display, and much more, it looks as if Apple is pull out all of the stops to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the device. Some aspects still remain uncertain, though, and it’s likely that things will continue to evolve and change. As of right now, though, these are the features we’re expecting the iPhone 8, or whatever it is called, to adopt. If the device turned out exactly like we outlined in this post, would it be enough for you to shell out over $1000? Let us know down in the comments.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Fire destroys several sheds, doused before reaching home Saturday Mar 11, 2017 at 5:50 PM Mar 11, 2017 at 5:51 PM By Staff Reports APPLE VALLEY — A large plume of black smoke could be seen in the Fairview Valley area Saturday afternoon after several sheds were engulfed in a fire that was quickly doused, according to Apple Valley Fire Protection District officials. The fire erupted in the backyard of a residence in the 26300 block of Cahuilla Road — in unincorporated northeast Apple Valley — and was reported to authorities at 2:45 p.m., AVFPD Chief Sid Hultquist said. When firefighters arrived, they found multiple wooden sheds, several vehicles, yard debris and several propane tanks fully engulfed in flames, Hultquist said. “Several propane tanks were venting, and there were multiple rounds of ammunition exploding from inside the sheds,” Hultquist said, explaining that although the rounds weren’t exploding at the same velocity as they would when firing out of a gun, there’s still a level of danger posed to firefighters. “There was some life hazard with those things, but our goal was to prevent it from spreading to a motor home and several other trailers on the property, and we were able to do that.” Despite contending with the propane tanks and ammunition, the fire was knocked down in about 30 minutes. The cause of the fire is unknown, and AVFPD officials are interviewing the residents of the property about the incident. “It doesn’t look suspicious in nature,” Hultquist said. A total of three fire engines and nine firefighters plus Chief Hultquist responded.

Specifically, the blog shared a portion of the App Store URL, otherwise known as a CatalogURL, for macOS 10.13. We were subsequently able to pinpoint the full URL by tweaking an older CatalogURL link, and it appears to be a secure HTTPS link originating from Apple's servers, so the screenshot is legitimate. The full URL: https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.13seed.merged-1.sucatalog.gz We don't know much about what's coming in macOS 10.13 at this point, but visits we're receiving from Macs running pre-release versions of macOS 10.13 have been picking up steadily since the beginning of the year, presumably as Apple's engineers work on the operating system update ahead of its unveiling. Visits to MacRumors from Macs running macOS 10.13 We don't know what the successor to macOS Sierra will be called, but in 2014, Apple trademarked a long list of names that could be used for future updates. Names range from popular beaches and well-known cities in California, where Apple is headquartered, to mountains, deserts, and animals. A list of known trademarked names that have yet to be used: Redwood, Mammoth, California, Big Sur, Pacific, Diablo, Miramar, Rincon, Redtail, Condor, Grizzly, Farallon, Tiburon, Monterey, Skyline, Shasta, Mojave, Sequoia, Ventura, and Sonoma. An entirely different name is certainly possible too. macOS 10.13 will likely be seeded to developers for testing purposes in early June ahead of a public release by the end of October. The beta will likely be available to public testers over the summer as well.

I know a fair chunk of us think we want this but think it through: do we want to dummy down MacOS to be compatible with what iDevices can do or complicate iOS to better fit what whole computers can do? Full unification would involve such compromises. I know some of us look at Surface and think a Mac version of that is what we want but chat with people who really use Surface and see if they think duality built in is as great as spun in marketing focused on very select benefits. Rating: 13 Votes Stella 1 week ago Apple should really use this as an opportunity to unify. iOS 11 and macOS 11 No thanks. OSX has been dumbed down enough already. No unification necessary especially if that involves making OSX a closed ecosystem - downloading software only from the (Mac)AppStore. Sierra was a very disappointing release. Hopefully 10.13 will be better. Rating: 12 Votes ppcebay 1 week ago Apple should go back to the old OS X release scheme... 1.5 / 2 years between major releases! Rating: 9 Votes Vorkeyjones 1 week ago I only just upgraded from El Capitan to OS X Sierra, and apart from Siri (which I don't use), I can barely tell the difference. Hope 10.13 is a more useful update. Rating: 9 Votes RedWeasel 1 week ago Features from iOS bought into OSX that do not belong. For example Launchpad. Another: Cannot close applications using Siri in OSX. How does Launchpad dumb the system down? You don't have to use it, you can still open apps with the Finder as before. Rating: 8 Votes Mr. Dee 1 week ago Sonoma sounds like a good name, rolls of the tongue nicely. Grizzly, please don't. Well, we know it will support: APFS, improvements to Siri (maybe Hey, Siri support), tighter integration with iCloud - might sync the entire system to iCloud. I hope they add a mobile metered connection setting, when I connect my MacBook Pro to my iPhones mobile hotspot, it depletes the data in no time. Windows 10 has this built in, while its not perfect, it helps a great deal with handing mobile data. Apart from that Sierra has been pretty solid and I can say its been the case since I bought my first Mac in 2015. Came with Yosemite and each upgrade has been a good one.

Apple Watch | 02 Mar 2017 | Print  | Comment (13) New Apple Watch Stand Looks Like the 128K Mac by Julio Ojeda-Zapata I hadn’t planned to write about Elago’s W3 Stand, an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh. I mean, what is there to say? “It’s an Apple Watch charging stand in the shape of a classic 128K Macintosh.” The end. But I realized Elago had concocted something brilliant when a buddy last week bestowed the product upon me — a thoughtful gesture after a recent death in my family — and other friends around a taproom table erupted with delight and a bit of envy. I was even more surprised later that day when my wife spotted the accessory on my desk and went gaga over it. You must understand a couple of things about my wife: She does not own an Apple Watch, has no interest in ever getting one, and has never been steeped in Apple lore. She adores her MacBook Air, but only in a utilitarian sense. Yet, hovering and cooing over the W3, she told me she wanted one – just because. So did I when I first heard about it. After all, I own a nonfunctional 128K Mac, a decorative prop that has a place of honor in my home office right near my Power Mac G4 Cube. The Elago W3 fits right in at Julio Geek Central. I have the $14.99 tan-colored model that approximates the color of the original Mac. Elago also sells a $15.99 dark-gray version, which is a strange color choice in the Mac sense, but matches darker-colored watches and straps. The stand is a simple yet substantial little thing made of soft, sturdy rubber. It’s a mini-Mac, but with a vertical slot for the Apple Watch to slide in. Within the stand, there’s a circular cutout for Apple’s watch charging pad. The W3’s cable threads downward through the accessory and out the back, mimicking the look of the classic Mac’s power cable. The stand’s screen is just a cutout, so when the Apple Watch drops into place, its face becomes the actual, functional “Mac” display. The Apple Watch sits on its side, which activates Nightstand mode and transforms the W3 into a nifty bedside clock with a classic-Mac look and feel. It even has details such as a faux floppy-disk slot, complete with a tiny paperclip-eject hole, but no Apple logo that might attract legal attention. I’m using the Elago in the bedroom with a first-generation Apple Watch (my Series 2 watch charges up in my home office on the far-more-utilitarian Griffin WatchStand Powered Charging Station that also charges my iPhone). I put the original Apple Watch on my night table in Airplane mode to keep activity to a minimum and left it there as a permanent fixture. In fact, I am experimenting with using the Apple Watch strapless to heighten the classic-Mac effect: But I suspect the mini-Mac clock will quietly migrate to my wife’s side of the bed before long. That’s fine, anything to foster marital bliss. I hope whoever came up with this cute product at Elago got a bonus. And I wonder if sequels might be in the works — a Bondi Blue iMac charging stand, perhaps?   Smile makes tools so you can have a productive day.

With the W3 Stand for the Apple Watch, Elago has tapped into Apple nostalgia while solving a practical problem: a charging stand that looks like the classic 128K Mac. With a watch positioned sideways within the accessory in Nightstand Mode, users get a geeky bedside clock. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Aaron Priven  2017-03-02 19:36 Somebody needs to write a MacOS 6 emulator for Apple Watch. Or at least make a nightstand mode that displays the time in Chicago font. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:53 Good ideas! Reply Michelle Steiner  2017-03-02 22:14 I've had one for a few months. I have a 0.3 meter charging cable that plugs into a USB port on the clock on my nightstand, so I now have two nightstand clocks. But one looks like a 128K Mac. I think I'll put an Apple logo on it. Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:52 When you put the Apple logo on it, send us a picture. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-06 20:10 One problem: it is only available in white, or for $1 more, black. Where's beige? Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-06 20:52 The white model is actually beige. So, you have two color options, beige or black (which is actually a very dark gray). Reply Pete  2017-03-06 22:03 "I hope whomever [sic] came up with this cute product..." Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-07 09:24 Fixed! Reply Todd V. Jonker  2017-03-07 01:45 I love my little-mac stand, but my watch always turns itself off after a little while. Is there a way to prevent it from doing so while it's charging in the stand? Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-07 07:32 Not to my knowledge. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-07 10:05 Here are details about Nightstand mode. You just need to nudge it. http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205045 Reply Julio Ojeda-Zapata  2017-03-07 10:27 Adam is correct! You don't even need to touch the watch itself. I just give the edge of my night table a light nudge or tap, and that awakens the nearby watch. Reply Quoc Vo  2017-03-07 18:52 If you have a 3D printer, you can print one yourself. I printed one and have been using it for a year. It's a great stand...so retro. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1216409 Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

According to a khaleejtimes.com report, citing Arabic daily Emarat Al Youm, the UAE’s Ministry of Economy stated that only specific iPhone 6s which contain defective batteries made in China during September and October 2015 will be recalled. Apple has recently expressed that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. If you have experienced this issue, the firm has urged residents to use the serial number checker (www.apple.com/ae/support/iPhone6s-unexpectedshutdown/) if your iPhone 6s is eligible for a battery replacement, free of charge.

Tweet Email this Print this Feedback When Android Wear first arrived, I was excited. Of course I was. The little green guy in a watch: how could I not be? Then after a few weeks, or a few hours in some cases, I realised Android Wear was a bit awkward. A bit thin. A bit annoying. Android Wear 2.0 is out to solve all those issues. And it only took, consulting the Filofax, three years. That’s right, real progress has been a long time coming. But at least it’s here. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 INTERFACE: A SMOOTHER JOURNEY The second version of Android Wear brings lots of new features and add-ons. After living with it for a little while now, they’re not what I’ve appreciated the most, though. I’ve dropped in and out of using Android Wear over the last three years, because I skip between using Apple Watches, fitness trackers and all sorts of wrist-worn gadget fluff. Every time I came back to Wear, there were a couple of days of fitting back into its ways. It was like putting on a jumper made by an alien with only the loosest understanding of human anatomy. I’m talking about awkward gestures and an overcomplicated architecture to basic parts of the system. Much of that is gone now. I’ve been using Android Wear 2.0 with the Huawei Watch 2, and it feels more like what some people always wanted, a watch version of Android. You press a button to access your apps menu, and all the most top-level gestures are vertical. No more finger gymnastics: side swipes are only needed when you dig a bit deeper. It sounds like a small thing, but means the entire system is much more intuitive. Wear 2.0 also makes way for other kinds of controls. Apple Watch-like rotary dials, Samsung Gear S3 rotating bezels: Wear can now get on just fine with the lot. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 CUSTOMISATION: A BIG FACELIFT The update is a kinda delicious mix of making Wear simpler and more complicated at the same time – or at least more open. For example, watch faces are way more customisable. All but the simplest have little extra data fields, whether that’s your step count, the date or the weather. These can be switched around when you customise the watch face, and they can even act as shortcuts or pull in data from third-party apps. At this early stage, there aren’t scads of these third-party data blobs about, but there soon will be. They are called complications, a name we can only imagine came out of a brainstorming meeting worthy of The Apprentice’s later seasons. Android Wear also — finally — lets you download apps right from the watch, rather than having to browse on your phone and then sync your apps. This makes it play much nicer with iPhones. The Google Play Wear interface is predictably not as pretty as the phone version, but does the job of letting you noodle away a few minutes looking for something fun and new to play with. It’s annoyingly slow to load, though, taking a few seconds unless it has been used recently, and is therefore kept open in the system RAM. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 APPS: INDEPENDENCE DAY Google Play is a good example of Android Wear 2.0 apps becoming more independent. To date, most Wear apps of any substance have been little more than second screens for the version on your phone. Wear games have tended to be standalone, but crucial apps like Runkeeper and Strava weren’t much use on their own. Now they are. Ready for the software’s launch, these top run/walk/cycle trackers now work solo, without even having their phone-based relatives installed. Paired with a watch that has GPS like the Huawei Watch 2, a Wear watch can finally be a good run tracker. It’s a long overdue upgrade. Right now these apps are still only really meant for tracking your exercise rather than checking out maps of your runs and graphs of your progress, but with any luck we’ll be able to do some shallow data mining before too long. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 MESSAGING: REVERT TO TYPE Messaging apps get a big boost with Wear 2.0 too. Wear watches have been able to send ‘quick reply’ texts and Google Hangouts using basic pre-written snippets or dictated sentences for years, but now full-blown functionality for third-party apps is possible. Before you get too excited, there’s no WhatsApp Wear app yet. But there is a Wear 2.0 version of Telegram, which is a bit like WhatsApp. This is where the new virtual keyboard comes in. That’s right, there’s a full keyboard in Wear 2.0, letting you write on your wrist. At first we started using it as a classic ‘tap each key’ keyboard — total nightmare — but it also supports gesture typing, where you drag a line between the characters in the word you want. It works oddly well, and it’s all because Google’s predictive typing is so good these days. This keyboard is also used in Google Play when you search for apps. It’s a system-wide thing. If you hate it even with swipey typing, you can talk to the watch’s mic instead. There’s still a question of whether you’d really want to do this daily with your everyday messenger. Would you? ANDROID WEAR 2.0 NOTIFICATIONS: LESS NAGGING, MORE HELP It’s the fundamentals that really change things up day-to-day, such as the way notifications work. Previous versions of Wear used notifications ‘cards’ that look like digital post-its. They were a bit insistent, popping up on the watch face to try to get your attention: a bit try-hard. Like other bits of Wear 2.0, notifications are now less annoying. Post-its have been replaced by plainer notification text on top of a dark grey background, and you can choose whether they pop-up until you read them, appear for five seconds or not at all. You can always read them by just flicking up on the watch face, so they’re never too far away. What you see in these notifications hasn’t changed radically as far as I can tell, but they slot into Wear, and your day, much more comfortably.  If you’ve already read up a bit on Wear 2.0, you may have heard about the new Google Assistant packed into this software. It’s meant to be a wrist version of the Siri-a-like introduced with Google Pixel phones. You ask it for “local cinema times” and hope you don’t end up with a blurb about “global Cinnabon crimes”. I haven’t experienced a huge world-changing upgrade though. You were able to say ‘Ok Google’ to your watch with previous versions of Wear and ask it questions. The difference now is that you might get a bit more info, and get further without having to head over to your phone. You still need to be connected to your phone to get Google Maps directions (even with Wi-Fi). It’s nowhere near as cool as Amazon Alexa yet. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 EXTRAS: PAY BY SWIPE If you must have your gadget glands stimulated, there’s always Android Pay, which is now supported by Wear. Your Wear watch will need NFC, but it’ll let you make contactless payments just by pressing your watch to the wireless pay pad. It’s a pretty neat way to travel around London in place of an Oyster card, but it may only hold as much cred with the Tesco checkout assistant as wearing a pair of Apple AirPods (that’s zero in the current climate, by the way). On the subject of Apple fans, Wear 2.0 is more friendly than before thanks to its more ‘standalone’ style. Should iPhone owners jump in bed with a new Wear watch? If you find a good deal for one of the older watches that will get the jump up to 2.0 and aren’t bothered about GPS tracking then perhaps. But the second-gen Apple Watch is still the best smartwatch out there. A lot of you are probably wondering if Wear 2.0 radically improves the battery life of these watches. I’ve not been able to take two of the same watch, one with 2.0 and another with a pre-2.0 version into a dark room and given them a good pummelling yet, but it doesn’t seem there’s a huge improvement. The Huawei Watch 2 lasts for a day and half, maybe a bit more if you don’t hammer it, and the LG Watch Style’s stamina is reportedly absolutely terrible. Oh well. ANDROID WEAR 2.0 VERDICT Android Wear 2.0 is much easier to live with than any previous version of the system, particularly if you’ve found the system unintuitive or fiddly in the past. It’s simpler in the right places, and more customisable in others. It also lets you do a lot more with the right hardware, namely a watch with GPS and NFC. If you already own a Wear watch that is down on the upgrade invite list, you should be happy. But it’s not likely to solve one of the system’s main problems: a cycle of low uptake and so-so developer interest that has made sure new killer apps are rare things.

A Storm is Coming: “App-pocalypse” To See Nearly 200,000 Apps Culled #AppleMusicWest4th Underway w/ Exclusive Live Performances + Interviews Apple New Report Slams ‘Curved Display’ iPhone Rumors, Expects Flat Form-Factor By Arron Hirst 12th Mar 17 11:04 pm Share Tweet Despite a barrage of rumours over the last several months claiming that Apple’s first-ever curved display iPhone could see its public introduction, as early as this year, a new report out this weekend slams that notion – citing that the next iPhone will instead feature a flat screen made from edge-to-edge OLED. The comments arrive via IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam who anticipates the company will instead adopt a “flat implementation of OLED design” on their coined ‘special’ edition, 10th-anniversary celebrating iPhone -which could end up costing over $1,000– and that will be “analogous” to the current 2.5D glass design, the analyst notes. “Much like the recently announced LG G6, we anticipate a touchscreen with a new longer aspect ratio design to take advantage of higher coverage area of the iPhone in its entirety.” “This new design language is expected to become the trend for 2017, as we all anticipate Samsung’s reveal later this month,” the analyst added. The comments from the industry analyst arrive weeks after it was speculated Apple could have not one, not two … but three new models of the iPhone to show off at its fall media event likely to be held at Apple Park – this year, with the addition of any type of edge-to-edge display to the smartphone expected to require some re-jigging of the placement of the firm existing force-enabling 3D Touch module, (which may even be moved to its new hame underneath the iPhone’s display) … and follow KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo too hinting that the Cupertino firm is all-but ready to move to OLED for the iPhone, in an announcement that is simultaneously expected to see it unveil its long sought-after, and highly rumoured, wireless-charging technology. / MacRumors Continue Reading You may also like...

Press Secretary Sean Spicer was spotted during a trip to the Apple Store, and a random shopper decided to come up and barrage him with a bunch of loaded questions about working for President Trump. Spicer was reportedly shopping at the Apple branch in Georgetown when a woman filmed and bombarded him with question after question. The video speaks for itself, but here’s a sampler of the kinds of inquiries that the questioner decided to pursue: “How does it feel to work for a fascist?” “Have you helped with the Russia stuff?” “Do you feel good about lying to the American people?” “Are you a criminal as well?” The encounter was streamed on Periscope and posted on the Twitter account @Shreec. Twitchy also noticed that the same user participated in a protest last month where Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was blocked from entering a school in D.C. Watch above, via Twitter.

Photo: Supplied. Higher prices for fruit, vegetables and dairy products resulted in a 2.2 per cent increase in food prices to the end of February 2017. Food prices rose 0.2 per cent in the month, compared with a 2.8 per cent increase in January. With seasonal adjustment, the cost of food rose 0.8 percent in February 2017. “This was the largest annual increase since December 2011,” says Statistics NZ consumer prices manager Matthew Haigh. “500g of the cheapest available butter cost on average $4.58 this month, compared with $4.06 last month and $3.45 a year ago.” Higher prices were seen in all sub-groups except meat, poultry, and fish which was down 2.0 per cent. Fruit and vegetables were up 7.7 percent and grocery food was up 2.3 percent. Vegetable prices were up 12 percent, led by higher prices for carrots, kumara, and tomatoes. Carrot prices are at an all-time high, up 51 per cent since February 2016. One kilogram of carrots cost $3.53 in February 2017, compared with $2.34 a year ago. Apple prices also contributed to the large movement, up 32 per cent from February last year. However, apple prices in February were down 13 percent from January. Prices for dairy products also increased. Butter prices were up 33 percent compared with February 2016, and 13 percent from January 2017. Higher prices for fruit and vegetables which are up 1.8 percent, were offset by lower prices for meat, poultry, and fish (down 1.5 percent). Seasonal influences on fruit and vegetable prices were apparent as we move out of summer. Increases were seen for summer produce, led by strawberries and lettuce, and decreases were seen for end-of-summer produce, led by apples and potatoes.

Corazon Victorino International Business TimesMarch 10, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Microsoft finally launched its promised overhaul of the Cortana app for iOS this Friday. The Redmond giant kept its word that it will put out a revamped version of its app, which will simplify the way people use its AI assistant. Other implementations included in the update are minor, but they are still conspicuous. Given these changes, does Cortana now match or even surpass Apple’s native voice assistant Siri? Microsoft’s new Cortana is version 2.0. It is already up on Apple’s App Store and requires iOS 9.0 or later to work with an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Based on the release notes the company provided, the new Cortana has a fresh now look and an overall better user experience. It has redesigned calling, texting and reminders features and boasts of more immersive full-page answers. It also has faster page transitions and improved app responsiveness.  Cortana for iPhoneMore Cortana for iPhone app Photo: iTunes/App Store The revamped iOS app definitely loads faster, and the best thing here is it listens to voice commands and questions by default. The redesign is also very obvious to longtime users. Before the color of the app’s user interface was dark gray. With the updated version, users are greeted with a purple look and more prompts to do stuff right away, according to Thurrott.  Microsoft may have taken cues from Google in refreshing the Cortana app, for the homescreen now comes with Google Now-like information cards for certain data like weather, news, traffic, nearby restaurants and package deliveries. The reminders screen has also been redesigned to embrace a cleaner UI than the one before.  Cortana for iPhone 2More Cortana for iPhone (Quick Actions) Photo: iTunes/App Store An app drawer-like button is now present on the lower-left of the homescreen and clicking it will bring up “quick action” buttons for certain info and commands without having to speak with the voice assistant. The responsiveness is also noticeably faster when switching from doing one command to another.   Despite the many changes, Cortana still can’t hold a candle to Siri. For one thing, Cortana is still limited in use because it cannot be triggered or used when one is outside of the app. Another thing to take note off is the app’s inability to connect with native iOS services. The only upside here is it’s the perfect AI assistant if one has a Windows 10 computer, which has Cortana integrated, as pointed out by Apple Insider.  Read More CortanaMore Microsoft is rolling out its newest version of Cortana.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise 500 Events Subscribe Serial Entrepreneurs A Well-Known Tech Watchdog Dishes on the Writing Beat Rob Pegoraro started his career in the mailroom without training in tech, writing or sorting mail. Image credit: Shutterstock.com Jordan French Contributor Serial Entrepreneur ---Shares March 12, 2017 Whenever a major phone carrier comes out with a new unlimited data plan you want to know more about, what’s the first thing you do? Look it up online to see if it’s legit. Thanks to the rise of the internet, we’re able to look for this information. While we can always read the print, it’s much easier to have someone interpret it for us. But what about the information that doesn’t appear in the fine print? All those articles you see online -- on the Washington Post, USA Today, New York Times and more -- seem to have more information than the phone carrier offers on the data plan. That’s because, thanks to the rise of online use, there’s a plethora of information, written and curated by writers of the highest caliber. This is where you’ll find pieces written by Rob Pegoraro, prolific freelance tech journalist whose name is synonymous with USA Today’s technology section. He writes plenty of articles that investigate the information asymmetry that companies try to take advantage of. Basically, he finds everything that you might not see in the fine print. Pegoraro explains that one example is of the calendar app on iOS. There was an issue with looking up past events on the calendar -- typing in a subject would only yield results from the past two years -- that hadn’t been noted in any of the reports by Apple. A “one-man Consumer Reports,” Pegoraro says his cohort of investigative tech journalists fills a need. The vagaries of Apple’s calendar app affect many but very few have the time to investigate the how and why. That’s precisely where Pegoraro’s cohort of tech writers enter. Related: The 15 Best Freelance Websites to Find Jobs Becoming a tech writer. Rob Pegoraro is a self-made writer who covers just about anything that you’d find at a tech conference. Pegoraro spends his time covering the internet, computers, various electronics, software and “other things that beep or blink.” He never studied any of the subjects he now covers -- including writing -- while he was attending Georgetown University. In 1995, after gaining valuable experience while writing copy for a Georgetown newspaper, Pegoraro landed a position as a copy boy in the newsroom of the Washington Post. While this was largely sorting mail, it gave him the chance to submit stories to editors. In what was largely a right place, right time event, Pegoraro was told to sell stories to the editors regarding the online world. From here, he carved out his niche of all things tech related and began to earn attention for his meticulous style. Pegoraro was named a columnist at the Washington Post, a position he held until 2011 when he left the Post to became a freelance journalist and writer. He wanted the flexibility to cover more of the pieces he wanted to for a variety of news sources, both published and online. After years of building up his expertise as a tech writer, Pegoraro has found himself in a pretty comfortable position. He travels to various trade shows and expos to cover cool new gadgets that are coming out. Related: 4 Ways to Find the Right Freelance Writer for Your Blog The life of a freelance journalist. You can always find Pegoraro at the “Mardi Gras meets CES” that is SXSWi in Austin, Texas. In 2017 he’ll be attending for his sixth year in a row, making him somewhat of a veteran to the entire event. Some of his advice for SXSW? Accept that you won’t make it to everything you want to. The entire event is so chaotic in nature that it just won’t work. Also, be sure to bring portable charging devices for mobile – and be prepared to stand. Not only does SXSW serve as a destination for him to cover his subject, but Pegoraro has also found that the event is excellent for networking – something many entrepreneurs understand the importance of. Pegoraro has achieved something that many people strive for: he is following his passion on his own terms. While he never received the traditional education required for his role, he persisted and has become a recognized name in tech. During his time as a freelance journalist, Pegoraro has also learned a number of valuable lessons, particularly concerning marketing and promotion. He’ll be sharing his personal insights at PR Summit 2017 where he will be a featured speaker. Related: The 5 Skills You Need to Become a Successful Content Writer For Pegoraro, the most important thing to plan for in the writing process is the research. While he has years of experience writing about tech, he recognizes that he doesn’t know everything off the top of his head. Before agreeing to any terms with clients, Pegoraro makes sure that he’s budgeting himself ample time for research. By spending enough time gathering the information and facts, Pegoraro crafts articles unlike others that can be found – all without the classic instruction to be able to do so.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) actually dipped by about 0.5% last week, closing at $139.14. That small change did not threaten the company’s ranking as the top-performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index for 2017. It is up 20% for the year. The stock had posted a new 52-week high the week before. The speculation over the features of the next iPhone has been dialed back a little but has not disappeared. AppleInsider, for example, refers to a note from KGI Securities and star Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who thinks the iPhone 8 (or whatever it ends up being called) will easily outsell Samsung’s Galaxy S8, expected to be introduced late this month at an event in New York. A more general note, also from AppleInsider, refers to a memo from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich claiming that Apple has “superior pricing power” and that the company has become “antifragile.” Apparently, that means that Apple can withstand threats from any direction and still remain standing because it has had to face down so many threats already. One final bit of Apple news from last week: Japanese website Mac Otakara, cited by MacRumors, thinks the iPhone 8’s official name will be “iPhone Edition,” a designation the company has already used for its high-end Watch. The iPhone 8/Edition, which could cost $1,000 or more, certainly would qualify as high-end. Apple’s market cap is now over $730 billion, a drop of $3 billion in the past week. Between last May, when the stock dropped to a 52-week low, and last week, the shares have added more than 55%. The DJIA is up about 18% in the same period and the Nasdaq Composite is up about 24%. Apple shares closed at $139.14 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $140.28. The consensus 12-month price target is $142.69 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share.

But before its legendary rise, Apple was just three guys in a garage in Los Altos, California. Back then, it was a company struggling with IBM and Microsoft's meteoric success, and it would eventually face rough times where everything seemed like a lost cause. Here's a look into the history of Apple in photos, from its inception through to the triumphant return of Jobs. View As: One Page Slides Apple was cofounded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Los Altos, California. Kimberly White / REUTERS There was a third cofounder, too, named Ronald Wayne. Jobs brought Wayne on board to provide business guidance for the two young cofounders, but he ended up leaving the company before it was even officially incorporated. Wayne took an $800 check for his shares in the company. Ronald Wayne Wayne sketched the first Apple logo by hand. Wikimedia Commons Apple's first "offices" was the garage of Jobs' parents, shown here. Dino Vournas/AP The company's first product was the Apple I, which was just a motherboard with a processor and some memory, intended for hobbyists. Customers had to build their own case and add their own keyboard and monitor, as seen in the picture. It sold for $666.66 — seriously. Wikimedia Commons The Apple I was invented by Wozniak, who also hand-built every kit. Here, you can see his hand-drawn design diagrams for the Apple I computer. Wikimedia Commons Meanwhile, Jobs handled the business end, mainly trying to convince would-be investors that the personal computer market was primed to explode. Eventually, Jobs would bring in Mike Markkula, who made a crucial $250,000 angel investment and came to work for Apple as employee No. 3, with a one-third share in the company. Jobs and Markkula.Digibarn Apple would officially incorporate in 1977, thanks to guidance from Markkula. A man named Michael Scott (no, not the one from "The Office") was brought in at Markkula's suggestion to serve as the company's first president and CEO. The thought was that Jobs was too young and undisciplined to serve as CEO. Michael Scott 1977 also saw the introduction of the Apple II, the personal computer designed by Wozniak that would go on to take the world by storm. Flickr/gmahender The Apple II's killer app was VisiCalc, a groundbreaking spreadsheet software that propelled the computer ahead of market leaders Tandy and Commodore. With VisiCalc, Apple could sell the Apple II to the business customer. Wikimedia Commons By 1978, Apple would actually have a real office, with employees and an Apple II production line. This was also around the time some early Apple employees grew tired of prolonged exposure to the famously difficult Jobs.

In 1979, Apple engineers were allowed to visit the PARC campus for three days, in exchange for the option to buy 100,000 shares of Apple for $10 a share. Wikimedia Commons In 1980, Apple released the Apple III, a business-focused computer that was supposed to compete with the growing threat of IBM and Microsoft. But the Apple III was only a stopgap, and Xerox PARC had gotten the young Jobs thinking in a different direction ... Flickr/stiefkind Xerox PARC convinced Jobs that the future of computing was with a graphical user interface (GUI), like the kind we're used to today. Apple Jobs spearheaded the effort to equip Apple's next-generation Lisa computer with a GUI, but was bumped from the project thanks to infighting. Lisa was released in 1983 to much fanfare, but disastrous sales — it was too expensive and didn't have enough software support. Jobs ended up leading the second project ... the Apple Macintosh, billed as the most user-friendly computer to date. It would go on to become popular with graphic-design professionals, who liked its visual chops (even though it was in black and white). It was still very expensive, however. Jobs, chairman of the board of Apple Computer, and the new Macintosh personal computer following a shareholder's meeting in Cupertino, circa 1984.AP Photo/Paul Sakuma Around the time of the launch of the first Macintosh in 1983, Apple got a new CEO in the form of John Sculley. Jobs and Sculley at the launch of the Macintosh.Fanboy.com Sculley was serving as Pepsi's youngest-ever CEO, but Jobs managed to bring him to Apple with the now-legendary pitch: "Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?" In 1984, Apple would release the TV commercial that would make it a household name. This ad, appropriately called "1984," was directed by Ridley Scott and cost the company $1.5 million. It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII, and never again.   This was also when tensions between Jobs and Bill Gates started to run high. Originally, Microsoft was working hard at making software for the Macintosh. But those plans were scuttled in 1983 when Microsoft revealed that it, too, was working on a graphical user interface called Windows. Business Insider The Macintosh had strong sales, but not enough to break IBM's dominance. This led to a lot of friction between Jobs — the head of the Macintosh group who liked doing things his own way — and Sculley, who wanted stricter oversight on future products in the light of the Lisa disaster and disappointment of the Macintosh. Jobs, Sculley, and Wozniak.Sal Veder / AP Images It got to the point that Apple's board specifically instructed Sculley to "contain" Jobs. Things came to a head in 1985 when Jobs tried to stage a coup and oust Sculley — but Apple's board of directors took Sculley's side and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. A furious Jobs quit and went on to found NeXT, a computer company making advanced workstations where he had total control. In this April 4, 1991, photo, Steve Jobs of NeXT Computer Inc. poses for the press with his NeXTstation color computer at the NeXT facility in Redwood City.AP Images Wozniak left around the same time in 1985, saying that the company was going in the wrong direction. He sold most of his shares. Wozniak (center) with concert promoter Bill Graham (left) and the Grateful Dead's Mickey Hart (right).LENNOX MCLENDON / AP Images With Jobs gone, Sculley had a free hand at Apple. At first, things seemed great, and Apple introduced its PowerBook laptop and System 7 operating system in 1991. System 7 introduced color to the Macintosh operating system, and would stick around (with updates) until OS X was released in 2001. Associated Press The 1990s would see Apple get into lots of new markets, none of which really worked out. Possibly the most famous Apple flop of the '90s was '93's Newton MessagePad, which was Sculley's own brainchild. It literally created the market for "personal digital assistants," but it was $700 and did little more than take notes and keep track of your contacts. Flickr/moparx But Sculley's longest-lasting mistake was in spending lots of time and lots of Apple's cash on bringing System 7 to the brand-new IBM/Motorola PowerPC microprocessor instead of the dominant Intel processor architecture. Most software was written for Intel processors, plus they got cheaper and cheaper over the years. Mac System 7.GUI Guidebook At the same time, Microsoft's influence was on the rise. Macs offered an excellent, but limited, library of software, on expensive computers. Meanwhile, Microsoft was selling Windows 3.0, available on far cheaper PCs made by the likes of Dell and HP. Microsoft Archive Between the high-profile flops and the costly decision to move to PowerPC, Apple's board had had enough. After Apple missed on its first quarter earnings in 1993, Sculley was fired and replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler, a German expatriate who had been with Apple since 1980. YouTube Spindler had the unfortunate job of following through with Sculley's big PowerPC mistake. In 1994, the first Macintosh running on a PowerPC was released. But Apple's fortunes continued to sag as Windows took off. After acquisition talks with IBM, Sun MicroSystems, and Philips all fell through, Apple's board replaced Sculley with Gil Amelio in 1996. Gil Amelio and his wife, Charlene.Kevin Winter/Getty Images Amelio's reign saw its own kind of excess, including the "Twentieth Anniversary Mac," a $7,500 all-in-one PC that came with the very unique perk...Apple would hand-deliver it via limo and set it up for you, in a full-on concierge experience. WIkimedia Commons Read more about the Twentieth Anniversary Mac and its demise here. Amelio's tenure was equally troubled. Under his reign, Apple stock hit a 12-year low (largely because Steve Jobs himself sold 1.5 million Apple shares in a single transaction). Amelio decided to just purchase Jobs' NeXT Computer for $429 million in February of 1997 and bring him back to Apple. Lou Dematteis/Reuters On July 4 weekend that same year, Jobs would stage a boardroom coup and convince Apple's board to install him as interim CEO. Amelio resigned a week later. Lou Dematteis / Reuters 1997 would also see the introduction of Apple's famous "Think Different" ad campaign, celebrating famous artists, scientists, and musicians. Under the new era of Jobs' leadership, the company would make nice with Microsoft, which invested $150 million in Apple circa 1997. The investment was announced at Jobs' first big speaking gig as CEO, with a guest appearance from a gigantic Bill Gates projection. The audience booed. Jim Bourg/Reuters Jobs also had Jony Ive spearhead the design of the iMac, an all-in-one computer released in 1998. In 2001, he introduced Mac OS X, based on the operating system from NeXT Computers, finally replacing System 7. And in 2006, Apple finally moved to an Intel-based system architecture. With that foundation set, Jobs was able to lead Apple all the way through to the 2007 introduction of the iPhone. After a tumultuous few decades, Apple was on track to its current position of the most valuable company in the world. And the rest, as they say, is history.

Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Mar 12, 2017 at 9:23AM It's rare to find high-dividend stocks with safe payouts, whose businesses also have room to grow over the long term. However, the good news is that stocks like this do exist, especially in the real estate sector. Here are three real estate investment trusts, or REITs, all of which pay dividend yields above 5%, that could generate both income and growth in your portfolio for years to come. Senior housing could grow rapidly Senior Housing Properties Trust (NASDAQ:SNH) pays a 7.9% dividend yield and invests in healthcare properties. Image source: Getty Images. As the name implies, senior housing makes up a large portion of the portfolio of 433 properties, but that's not the only type of healthcare real estate the company owns. About 40% of the portfolio is medical offices, and there are also smaller holdings in skilled nursing and wellness properties. The reasons for investing in healthcare real estate, and especially a company that caters to the needs of seniors, are simple to understand. The U.S. population is aging rapidly, and the 65-and-over population in the United States is expected to grow by more than 20 million by 2030. Older age groups, such as 85-and-older are growing even faster. Image source: Senior Housing Properties Trust investor presentation. Senior Housing Properties Trust has a unique advantage because its 97% private-pay asset mix is among the best in the industry. Private-pay healthcare is typically far more stable and predictable than healthcare that depends on government reimbursements, so this is a good thing for long-term stability and dividend safety. Speaking of the dividend, the yield may sound too good to be true at first, but consider that it represents just 83% of the company's normalizes FFO, and that the portfolio is designed to produce stable and predictable growth. Hotels have a unique pricing advantage Hotel real estate investment trust Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE) pays a 6.4% dividend yield, and operates 236 Hilton and Marriott-branded hotels in 33 states, with a particular emphasis on extended stay and select-service brands like Homewood Suites, Residence Inn, and SpringHill Suites. The company's business model is to maintain a diverse portfolio of hotels that operate under well-known brand names, partner with excellent operators, and continually reinvest in its properties to maintain a competitive advantage. Now, unlike healthcare properties, which are an inherently defensive type of real estate, hotel properties can be a bit more volatile, maximizing profitability in prosperous economic times, but suffering more when things go badly. However, hotels have the unique advantage of being able to adjust rental rates on a daily basis, which allows it to take full advantage of the good times, while quickly adapting to falling market rental rates during recessions. Another advantage for investors is that unlike many hotel REITs, Apple Hospitality's operators are paid a variable management fee, based on each property's performance. This gives the operators a unique incentive to run efficient hotels and to go above and beyond with guest satisfaction. Apple Hospitality REIT operates at a higher EBITDA margin than most peers, and has plenty of room to grow, especially after Marriott's recent merger with Starwood Hotels, which adds upscale brand names like Sheraton, Westin, and W Hotels to Marriott's portfolio. Image source: Apple Hospitality REIT investor presentation. Diverse properties with room to grow EPR Properties (NYSE:EPR) pays a 5.7% dividend yield and invests in three different types of properties -- entertainment, recreation, and education. The company owns a total of 320 properties in 41 states, D.C., and Canada, and has grown at an impressive rate in recent years, including about $1.3 billion in new investments since 2014. EPR's entertainment and recreation properties include megaplex movie theaters, ski parks, waterparks, and golf complexes, and combine to make up about three-fourths of the portfolio. The idea behind focusing on these property types as an investment is that millennials like to spend money on experiences -- which is supported by the fact that the total spending on these types of activities has steadily risen as millennials have come of age. Image source: EPR Properties investor presentation. Impressively, EPR owns about 200 entertainment and recreation-oriented properties, and this portion of the portfolio is nearly 100% leased (more than 99%). Tenants are on long-term (11+ year) leases, with gradual rent increases built in. On average, only about 3% of the company's leases expire in any given year. In addition, the education properties make up the other 25% of the portfolio, and represent perhaps the best growth opportunity going forward. Public charter school enrollment is currently at 3.1 million students, and has grown at a 12% annualized rate over the past 15 years. However, supply has not grown quite as fast as demand, resulting in a waiting list of more than a million students. In fact, EPR says that charter schools alone represent a $2.5 billion market opportunity for the company, with an additional $2 billion opportunity in private schools and another $1 billion from early childhood education. These aren't risk-free, especially over short time periods It's important to mention that all three of these companies have significant risk factors to be aware of, especially over short periods of time. Interest rate risk is a big one, at least in regards to the stock prices. Rising rates are generally bad for REITs, and if rates increase faster than the market is expecting, it could easily cause these stocks to drop. In addition, there are company-specific risks with each of these. For example, senior housing demand could slow, leading to oversupply problems. A recession could occur, leading to less demand for hotel stays and less spending on entertainment. The point is that if you invest in these, expect some volatility over shorter time periods. However, over the long run, all three of these companies have solid business models that should produce strong returns. Invest accordingly. Matthew Frankel has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(AAPL) Stock Near All-Time Highs I love Apple, but I want to short AAPL stock (safely) at these levels By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 10, 2017, 8:46 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Tesla: Trade TSLA With Less Risk How to Trade Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Near All-Time Highs Log Into Facebook Inc (FB) Stock For Free Money Recent Posts: iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treasury Bond (ETF) (TLT): Sell Risk for Income How to Make Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Pay You High Yield 3 Profitable Long-Term Trades on Gold Stocks View All Posts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), like many other mega-cap stocks, is within about 1% of its all-time high-water mark. The PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ) is within 1% of its all-time high, too, so it’s normal to feel a little edgy about chasing prices higher from here. But based on their fundamentals, valuations still make sense for mega tech like AAPL stock and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). Source: Shutterstock Fundamentally, Apple stock still has a lot of momentum left by the iPhone that Steve Jobs created. I remain an outspoken critic of Tim Cook, who I think will eventually break the company. But that danger is a few years away. AAPL stock has long been undervalued given its fan base and financial health. FB stock is powered by excellent management and more than a billion users in the hottest trends. For the long-term, I simply can’t short concepts like these. But not shorting is totally different than chasing upside potential. While I still like Apple’s story for the long-term, I want to take a bearish position in AAPL stock for the near-term. This isn’t “dissing” the company’s prospects. It’s just respecting price levels. Today’s trade, in fact, is a pure bet against price action rather than fundamentals. So before you send out for my arrest, read my recent writeup about going long AAPL for free. The trade yielded free, substantial profits. Today, I’m going to use options to set up a pair trade. How to Trade AAPL Stock Here The bet: Buy the AAPL Apr $135 put for $1.4 per contract. This is a bearish trade where the maximum risk is the cost of entry. The faster Apple stock falls toward my put the faster my profits accrue. For a more conservative approach I can turn this into a debit put spread instead. To reduce my out-of-pocket expense I will leverage AAPL’s fundamentals. I will sell longer-dated downside risk against levels that I know Apple stock won’t visit. The purpose is to generate potential income out of thin air to finance my bearish bet. The bank: Sell the AAPL Nov $110 put for $2 per contract. Given the 20% buffer from current price, this trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. For a more conservative approach, I can turn this into a credit put spread instead. Taking both trades means I am getting paid to short AAPL stock. I will profit even if Apple goes nowhere. I will net 60 cents per contract if both options expire worthless. So, as long as price stays above my sold put, any premium I recapture from selling my bearish trade is pure profit. I am not obliged to hold my options trades open through their expiration. Selling naked puts is dangerous, so only do it if you’re willing to own AAPL stock at that price. And never risk more than you can afford to lose. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

This device is particularly anticipated owing to the fact that Samsung must attempts to recover from the disastrous Galaxy Note 7. It is a necessity for this handset to be impressive and, naturally, significantly more stable than Samsung’s last release. Image Source: DBS Design – YouTube.com Leaked images Ahead of the anticipated emergence of the Galaxy S8, rumors are now accelerating regarding the next generation smartphone. A few concepts images have been released recently, while Slashleaks has also showcased a few possible leaked photos. A user by the name of ‘Leakspinner’ is responsible for one such picture, and although the consensus of opinion is that it is not legitimate, it still gives us some clues regarding the makeup of the Galaxy S8. However, a second user has also leaked images to Slashleaks, namely ‘Seanmirza23’, and it seems that this particular source of information is far more solid. This leaker is known to have delivered pretty substantial information in the past, and it seems that his latest attempt to reveal the Galaxy S8 could be equally valid. Images emanating from Seanmirza23 suggest that the Galaxy S8 features a screen protector produced by an unknown manufacturer. It also implies that the Samsung flagship will feature a particularly large display, in which the design of the screen takes over pretty much the entirety of the smartphone. The sides of the mobile in this leaked image curve downwards, in common with other recent Samsung releases, with the bezels above and below the screen extremely slim indeed. This leak is particularly credible as it tallies with many of the rumors related to the Galaxy S8, along with general trends in the industry. With only weeks to go until the Galaxy S8 is launched, the list of rumored specs for the device is solidifying rapidly. Top of the list is the display in the unit, and in accordance with the previous images, it seems that we can expect a rather large screen. 4K screen The latest suggestion is that Samsung will produce both 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch versions of the Galaxy S8, and that there could even be a surprise in the resolution department. It has been reported in the last couple of days that Samsung may arm the Galaxy S8 with 4K resolution, resulting in the first ever Super AMOLED curved display from the corporation. This would arguably be a risk for Samsung, but there is an onus on the company to deliver something outstanding with this handset. Android 7.0 Nougat and IP68 certification It is also expected that the Galaxy S8 will feature Android 7.0 Nougat as its operating system, while the Korean manufacturer will also deliver IP68 certification. This would keep the Samsung device ahead of the Apple iPhone range in this department, although Apple is expected to improve the durability of the iPhone range when the iPhone 8 is released. Processor The Galaxy S8 will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip in the United States and an Exynos 8895 in international markets. The clock speed of these devices has yet to be released, but fans of the range will be hoping for a genuine octa-core unit. Memory It is believed that the Galaxy S8 may feature 6GB of memory, although other reports suggest that Samsung will only include 4GB. There is still some debate over this figure, with the final amount perhaps dependent on the screen resolution of the device. If the Galaxy S8 turns out to be a 4K resolution handset, as has been suggested this week, it could be that the corporation will opt for the 6GB figure. Battery The two versions of the Galaxy S8 will feature 3,000mAh and 3,500mAh batteries. The Galaxy S8+ will naturally benefit from the larger unit, the Samsung will be looking to extend its lead over the iPhone range in this department. The Apple handset has been continually criticized for delivering a rather paltry battery life. Cameras A 12-megapixel main camera and 8-megapixel front-facing snapper are anticipated for the Galaxy S8, although a range of new features may also be included within its photographic capabilities. Both versions of the Galaxy S8 will also benefit from dual-lens cameras. Built-in AI assistant Bixby will be unveiled when the Galaxy S8 emerges, with the Viv Labs Team that worked on initial versions of Siri having been beavering away on the first ever Samsung AI assistant. It will be interesting to find out what functionality Samsung has been able to include in this first Bixby release, but it will certainly be challenging for the company to produce a piece of software that is the equal of the established Apple assistant. USB-C USB-C charging will be included in the Galaxy S8, with users benefiting from this sophisticated, reversible form of connection. Storage There is still some debate on the amount of storage to be included with the Galaxy S8, but sources close to Samsung have suggested this week that 64GB and 128GB models will be made available. This will be backed up by micro SD, enabling fans of the Android-driven device to boost storage up to 256GB. Optional Samsung DeX HDMI dock Another interesting suggestion for the Galaxy S8 is that it will feature an optional Samsung DeX HDMI dock. This smart dock has been linked with the next generation smartphone for a couple of months, since a patent for the technology emerged. Whether this is really a realistic prospect for the Galaxy S8 remains to be seen, but it would certainly find favor with consumers should Samsung find this to be technically plausible. Bluetooth 5.0 Finally, it is widely believed that Bluetooth 5.0 functionality will be included with the Galaxy S8 when it arrives on the market. Release date Samsung confirmed during its Mobile World Congress press conference that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will launch at a standalone event in New York City on March 29. UPDATE 02-11-2017: The release of the Galaxy S8 should be merely weeks away, and thus the level of speculation about this flagship smartphone has reached fever pitch. So here are all the latest rumors and links regarding this next Generation handset. Galaxy S8 Design Not too much is known about the design of the Galaxy S8 as of yet, but Samsung Display, responsible for manufacturing the screens included in Samsung devices, has published YouTube adverts of interest. The videos feature an unknown smartphone with a design similar to that which has typically been anticipated for the Galaxy S8. Another interesting morsel of information is the suggestion that Samsung will ditch the headphone jack for the Galaxy S8, following on from Apple’s example with the iPhone 7. However, rumors have also emerged recently that Samsung will dispense with micro-USB / USB-C in the Galaxy S8 generation. This latter suggestion seems unlikely, but Samsung will consider all possibilities for the Galaxy S8, as it requires something outstanding following the disaster of the Galaxy note 7. If USB is ditched then the Galaxy S8 will undoubtedly charge wirelessly. Dimensions GSMArena has leaked what are reported to be the dimensions of both the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus.

The small but growing number of shareholder votes on diversity proposals is on pace to match or exceed the record set last year, according to data compiled by ISS Analytics, which tracks proxies. Apple and Tyson Foods investors already rejected such proposals, and another eight are in the queue. The $309.7 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System, has made diversity proposals a priority in its proxy voting, aiming to break companies "out of the group think of male, pale and stale," said investment director Anne Simpson. "As evidence grows on this and fund managers focus on building diversity even in their own organizations, I think we're going to see support on this moving up." In each of the last five years, more than 20 board diversity proposals have been brought to U.S. companies, encouraging some to change their policies and avoid a public referendum. IBM and CVS have already done so this year -- explicitly stating they will consider gender and racial diversity in their board appointments. CVS confirmed the changes. IBM declined to comment. A vote doesn't predict success -- in fact, the opposite. Of the nine proposals that came to a vote last year at companies including Apple, LinkedIn and Skechers U.S.A., the only one to pass was at FleetCor Technologies. On average, the proposals earned about 25 percent support, according to ISS. BlackRock Advisors and Vanguard Group, the two biggest funds by assets under management, rarely vote for shareholder proposals on diversity topics. Both firms say they prefer to engage privately with companies. "The vote is but one mechanism we have to message the companies," said Glenn Booraem, Vanguard's head of corporate governance. "Our direct engagement with companies has the benefit of being far more nuanced than voting for or against a proposal." Blackrock spokesman Ed Sweeney noted the company's commitment to various initiatives to raise the number of women in governance and executive leadership. "When we speak with company management and independent directors, we emphasize diversity and inclusion as key components of corporate culture and strategy," he said. Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates, on the other hand, vote for diversity proposals far more often. Morgan Stanley had no comment other than to refer to it's proxy voting policy that says it considers such proposal on a case-by-base basis. "We tend to support most of these proposals on the rare occasions when we are voting on them," Donna Anderson, vice president and global corporate governance analyst for T. Rowe Price, said in an interview. "We think the business case is pretty strong that bodies with diverse views, including boards, tend to make better decisions than non-diverse groups." At the current pace of gains, women aren't forecast to hold 50 percent of board seats until 2055. The number of people of color appointed as directors fell in 2016 and the overall rate of minorities serving on boards has been mostly unchanged over the last decade, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart. As of now, 13 percent of companies currently give specific details about the race and gender of directors named in their annual filings, said Belen Gomez, senior director of research at Equilar Inc., which tracks diversity disclosure. "The needle is moving, but it's moving slowly. I do think things are going to ramp up." NorthStar, based in Boston, filed six proposals this year asking companies to adopt language that they would seek greater board diversity. All six agreed to add specific wording, and the fund withdrew the proposals, said Mari Schwartzer, assistant director of shareholder activism, engagement and social research at the fund. "Companies think that they already have initiatives in place to ensure diversity," said Ivy Jack, director of equity research at NorthStar Asset Management, which brought the proposals to IBM Corp. and CVS Health Corp. "We look at it and say, 'even if you have already been doing it, maybe you need to do it differently, or you're not doing it enough, because your board still does not represent your customers, or just the general population of the country.'"

As it turns out, some of our seemingly harmless habits are doing slow, silent, deadly damage to those precious lithium-ion batteries. You’re charging to 100% If your palms start sweating when your battery drops below 90%, you need to chill. Maintaining a full charge is not the most efficient way to keep your phone battery strong. In fact, experts suggest letting your phone coast through the day between 30 and 80 percent full. That’s where it’s most comfortable, and will run most efficiently. So stop juicing it overnight, and instead go for shorter and more frequent bursts throughout the day. You’re letting your phone die Lithium ion batteries become volatile when they drop down to low power, so you should avoid getting that pesky “low battery” warning too often. Every full discharge wears down your battery ever so slightly. That being said, Apple and other experts suggest you let it fully run out of juice every one to two months to “calibrate” the battery gauge. You’re overheating your battery Okay, this isn’t specifically a charging issue. But it’s still very important. You’ve probably noticed that your phone is annoyingly sluggish after its been sitting out in the sun. That’s because iPhone batteries really, really hate extreme temperatures, and have to work extra hard in high heat or cold. According to Apple, the “comfort zone” for iPhones (as well as iPads, iPods, and Apple Watches) is between 32 and 95 degrees. Bottom line: your phone is basically a needy little computer baby that needs to be bundled up and cooled off on the regular. You’re leaving your case on while you charge While we’re on the subject, if your phone feels too hot when it’s plugged in, it’s possible your fancy case might be trapping in the heat that’s produced while charging. So do your phone a favor and take it off. You’re using the wrong charger Your Apple-issued charger is designed to cut power when the battery hits 100%, but those cheapo unauthorized third-party USB cords are not, and may do some damage by excessively juicing the battery. Plus, ya know, they could kill you. Source: Thrillist Ad ==> A Former One Minute Man Who Now Last 30mins In Bed Reveals The Secret Of His New Strength Place your ad here Loading...

Adam Mills06/08/2015 Apple’s iOS 9 update is confirmed and it will be heading to a number of devices later this year including several older iPhones and iPads. Today at WWDC 2015 in San Francisco, Apple finally confirmed the elephant in the room. The company’s new iOS 9 update is official and the company took time to detail many of the features and enhancements coming with the successor for last year’s iOS 8 software. Apple did not confirm a specific iOS 9 release date but it did confirm a release later this year in the usual fall window that iPhone and iPad users have grown accustomed to. Apple also detailed the devices that will be getting the iOS 9 update and its features later on this year. The iPhone 4s iOS 9 update is confirmed.   Ahead of today’s keynote, iOS 9 rumors hinted at some major changes for this year’s iOS release. In years past, Apple would release its newest update for select devices. Specifically, devices that had received iOS updates for three years would lose iOS support. Not the case with iOS 9. Apple today announced that it will be bringing iOS 9 to a number of iPhones and iPads including the iPhone 4s and the iPad 2. This will be the fourth update for the iPhone 4s and the fifth update for the iPad 2 and it extends their life for at least another year. The company will also be pushing out iOS 9 updates to a number of other big name devices including the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 5. Here is the full list of devices that will be getting the iOS 9 beta and the public iOS 9 release that arrives later on this year: iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone 5s iPhone 5 iPhone 5c iPhone 4s iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad 4 iPad 3 iPad 2 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 2 iPad mini iPod touch fifth-gen The company will not be bumping up non-iOS 8 devices to iOS 9 which means that owners of devices like the iPhone 4 and iPad 1 are out of luck. Not included on the list are the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple’s two iPhones that are rumored for arrival later on this year alongside the iOS 9 release. With the iOS 9 release confirmed for the fall, there’s now some credibility to the rumors that point to an iPhone 6s release in and around August and September. iOS 9 will be introducing some major changes to the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch though Apple will be limiting some of the update’s features to newer devices. For instance, some of the iPad’s new multitasking features will only be offered to owners of the iPad Air 2. Apple also revealed some other notable changes ahead of the iOS 9 release this fall. The company revealed that it’s tweaked its OTA download process to alleviate the storage issues that plagued iOS 8. iOS 8 required iOS users to have a whopping 4.6GB of free space to install. This presented problems to those that owned 16GB versions of the iPhone and iPad. With iOS 9, Apple will only require 1.3GB of free space to download and install Over-the-Air through a device’s settings. A far cry from last year’s release. The iOS 9 release date is still a mystery though owners of the iPhone and iPad already know what to expect. Standard Apple protocol calls for an announcement alongside an iPhone, a release date confirmed at the event, a release that comes right before the new iPhone release, and a release on the same day at the same time for all eligible devices. For now, iPhone and iPad users will have to contend with the iOS 9 beta which Apple will release for developers today and to the public in July. 4 Responses 06/09/2015 Cydia Pie Reply iPhone 4S and older devices will not be supported in this latest iOS 9. 06/15/2015 Dylan Snelling Reply iOS 9 will be supported by every device that supports iOS 8 apple isn’t dropping any support this year because they want everyone to get iOS 9 as stated during WWDC 2015 11/10/2015 Mr. Harris Reply iPhone 6 S Google Maps not working.

Catch up to it all now with our weekly news reca, that covers the big highlights for you. First up, there was some news about the Motorola Moto G5 Plus, which is set to launch in India next week. The phone will be launched at an event on March 15, and Flipkart has told Gadgets 360 that the new Moto G5 Plus will be available exclusively via the e-commerce site, something that the startup has already started teasing on social media. The Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus were launched by Lenovo at MWC 2017 in Barcelona, and both phones received a much needed design refresh, with a metal chassis and a circular camera frame at the back. Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus specifications also see a bump in many departments, while the price stays in the affordable range. The Moto G5 has a 5-inch full-HD display, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, and a 1.4GHz octa-core processor. The Moto G5 Plus meanwhile has a 5.2-inch full-HD display, with 3GB of RAM, and 32GB storage, alongside a 2GHz octa-core processor. Moto G5, Moto G5 Plus First Look We also learned a little more about the Samsung Galaxy S8 this week. Samsung's upcoming flagship saw a lot of leaks this week, and reports said that it will go on pre-order from April 10 - though later reports state that there could be delays. We also saw some fresh image leaks that again showcased the 18:9 screen aspect ratio. Now, the launch date has officially been set for March 29.   The Samsung Galaxy S8 will reportedly offer facial recognition, and a leak suggests that its price will be EUR 799 (or approximately Rs. 56,500), while the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is likely to be priced at EUR 899 (or approximately Rs. 63,500). In what has to be the surprise of the week, we also saw the release of a new iPhone 6 variant. Although the iPhone 6 was launched in 2014, it came in 16GB, 64GB, and 128GB storage options at the time. Now, Apple has launched a 32GB variant, which is presently available online only in India and a few other countries. The 32GB ipHone 6 is being offered by third-party retailers and only in Space Grey at Rs. 29,999. In case you're looking for something a little more up to date, you can also pick up a discount on the iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus. The phones are available with discounts of up to Rs. 10,001 on Amazon India; rival Flipkart is also offering flat discounts as well as exchange discounts on the two Apple smartphones. iPhone 6 32GB vs OnePlus 3T vs iPhone SE: Best Buy Under Rs. 30,000?   There were also some interesting developments from WhatsApp this week. For one, the Android app is getting a redesign, separating voice and video calls and moving the attachment button. In other welcome news, WhatsApp might be bringing text status updates back, after replacing them by the Snapchat-like WhatsApp Status a while back. There was also reports of WhatsApp testing business chat tools, though the company has declined to comment. In other news, the OnePlus 3T (Review) went on sale from the OnePlus Store, the Chinese company's own site, starting Friday. Those who purchase the smartphone from the OnePlus Store will get a free OnePlus 3T Protective Case. And data published by whistleblower WikiLeaks showed that that CIA has developed tools to spy on you through all your electronics - from your phone to your smart TV. WikiLeaks says it will work with tech firms to defeat CIA hacking. Apple says it has already fixed most flaws, while most of the other companies are looking into the matter, and Telegram assured users its encryption has not been compromised.   Google has also split Hangouts into two new apps - videoconferencing through Hangout Meet, and text-based chats becoming Hangouts Chat. The Hangouts Meet app is already available on both App Store and Google Play but Hangouts Chat can only be accessed early by G Suite customers through search giant's Early Adopter Program. Aside from all of these developments, we also got the launch of the Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro. Packing 4GB of RAM and 16-megapixel front and back cameras, the device is priced at CNY 2,499 (roughly Rs. 24,100) and is already available for pre-order on Samsung's China website. The Samsung Galay C5 Pro will begin shipping from March 16. Samsung also launched two phones in India this week, the Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) priced at Rs. 28,990, while the Samsung Galaxy A7 (2017) has been priced at Rs. 33,490. Aside from that, there was also the BlackBerry Aurora, sold by BB Merah Putih, the company that currently holds the right to manufacture and sell BlackBerry smartphones in Indonesia. The smartphone has already been made available since March 3 through pre-orders and will remain available till March 12 with local retailers at IDR 3,499,000 (roughly Rs. 17,400).   In China, there was also the launch of the LeEco Le Pro 3 Elite, though despite the name, it's actually a cheaper variant of the LeEco Le Pro 3 launched in September, lacking NFC and getting a slightly downgraded processor. Other launches included the Swipe Elite Sense priced at Rs. 7,499, which comes with a 5-inch HD display, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB storage, with a 1.4GHz octa-core processor; the Vivo Y25 launched in Malaysia at MYR 499 (roughly Rs. 7,500), packing a 4.5-inch display with 1GB of RAM and 16GB storage, along with a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor; and the iVoomi iV505, priced at Rs. 3,999, which has a 5-inch QHD display, 1GB RAM, and of 8GB storage, paired with a 1.3Ghz quad-core processor. In other developments, the Samsung Pay mobile platform has gone live in India. Samsung Pay supports both NFC and MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) that allows a user to send a magnetic signal from smartphone to the payment terminal's card reader. The list of compatible devices for Samsung Pay mobile payment solution includes Samsung Galaxy Note5, Samsung Galaxy S7, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+, Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016), and Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016). It can be used in place of a debit card, or to pay via the Paytm wallet if you prefer.   And late last week, ISRO's lost lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, was found, still orbiting the moon. NASA scientists found it with new technological application of interplanetary radar. Chandrayaan-1 is still circling some 200 kilometers above the lunar surface, the scientists determined. In addition to finding Chandrayaan-1, the scientists also located NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter around the Moon. Disclosure: Paytm's parent company One97 is an investor in Gadgets 360.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iPhone 8 may not feature the curved OLED display we’ve been hoping for Yoni Heisler BGR NewsMarch 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple’s iPhone 8 will likely feature an edgeless OLED display, but reports suggesting that the display might incorporate a curved design might be off the mark. According to fresh remarks from IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam (via MacRumors), the iPhone 8’s display will essentially sport the same flat design as the iPhone 7. Don't Miss: T-Mobile adds more data to its unlimited plan before it starts throttling you “We anticipate Apple will adopt a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model,” Lam said, “which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design.” Even though we’ve seen a number of reports pointing to a curved iPhone 8 display, it’s hard to discount Lam’s remarks in the wake of a recent Macotakra report claiming that Apple still hasn’t selected a final design and feature-set from a selection of iPhone 8 prototypes. Taken together, it’s perhaps a tad early to blindly assume that a curved iPhone 8 design is on the horizon. Curved display or not, there’s still a strong chance that the iPhone 8 will usher in the largest upgrade cycle in iPhone history and, in the process, shatter any number of sales records. Besides, iPhone users have been longing for a new form factor — which the edgeless OLED display will deliver — as opposed to specifically demanding a curved display. Display details aside, it’s widely believed that the iPhone 8 will feature improved battery life, wireless charging capabilities, an improved IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, enhanced Siri features, facial recognition, and much more. There are also rumblings that the iPhone 8 will introduce some new and intriguing augmented reality features. Tim Cook of course has been uncharacteristically effusive when discussing the technology, even going so far as to compare its potential impact to that of the smartphone itself. The only downside to the iPhone 8 is that it may hit store shelves a little later than the September launch window we’ve grown accustomed. Per a recent report, mass production of Apple’s flagship 2017 iPhone may not commence until September, a timetable that would likely push back the launch date until late October or early November of this year.

Meftech will take place at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre on March 13 and 14, where the most influential financial executives will be joined by dozens of the world’s most advanced and exciting technology solutions. Jim Marous, a recognised global leader in the field of financial technology, will be a keynote speaker at the event where he will urge banks and financial institutions to learn from truly digital companies such as Facebook and Apple to build relationships with their customers. Marous, the owner of the Digital Banking Report, said: “Today’s consumer expects a more personalised experience than ever before. Using non-banking organisations such as Uber, Amazon, Apple and Facebook as examples, they want their bank to know them, look out for them and reward them based on real time insights. “They are willing to share very personal details about their life as long as their bank can provide value by saving them time and money and avoiding stress in their daily life. We are talking about using big data and machine learning, combined with AI (artificial Intelligence), IoT (Internet of Things) and voice technology to build a financial concierge relationship. “Using personalisation to provide real-time advice the way the customer wants to receive it results in a better customer experience, increased trust, higher engagement and loyalty. This, in turn, increases share of wallet and loyalty.” Two more industry leaders will join Marous on stage --  Chris Skinner, CEO of TheFinanser.com, and bank innovation consulting expert JP Nicols. All three will also offer face-to-face advice over the course of the two-day exhibition. The stellar speaker line-up is bolstered by the latest cutting-edge technology solutions that will be on display, including blockchain technologies, machine learning and Facebook finance, all of which are disrupting the financial services industry across the globe. IBM has been announced as a platinum sponsor of the event, while two other global giants, SAP and Comarch, have also recognised its significance in the region by taking up gold sponsorship opportunities. Marous continued: “Meftech should be a hugely important event for financial institutions in the Middle East. By bringing together regional and international leaders in the industry, individuals and organizations can learn about the latest technology, insights and case studies that are not available elsewhere. Through networking and learning sessions, participants can challenge legacy thinking and fight complacency in banking. “If I could give the attendees three bits of advice, number one would be to make data and analytics a top priority across their organisations, as it is the foundation for every future trend and prediction. “The second would be to leverage this insight to provide a personalised, contextual one to one relationship with customers and prospects, and finally to go beyond digitalization of paper to digitalization of processes, looking at each transformation from the perspective of the customer as opposed to being a cost reduction initiative." Building upon Meftech’s rich pedigree of success, it will be expanded this year with a host of features including, a bespoke appointments-scheduling service enabling exhibitors to pre-arrange one-to-one meetings, closed room roundtables to maximise interaction between participants and speakers, and a world class conference programme featuring a mix of keynote presentations, case studies and live demos. Board level guests from some of the leading banks in the region have already confirmed their attendance including from FGB, ADIB, Qatar Islamic Bank and Bahrain Islamic Bank. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: abu dhabi | banking | Financial | Meftech | More Finance & Capital Market Stories Dubai Chamber to open India office in Mumbai Dubai non-oil foreign trade hits $347bn in 2016 Emirates NBD unit launches India equity fund Gulf sovereign Eurobonds to hit $33bn in 2017 UAE launches VAT, excise awareness sessions Sico UAE becomes Nasdaq Dubai member UAE non-oil exports hits $35bn in nine months FGB, NBAD directors discuss key merger issues Arab co-operative insurance market hits $33bn Business conditions set to improve, feel UAE residents GCC 'may need $275bn financing' Asar plays key role in Equate's debut sukuk programme 'Get ready for disruptive change financial sector' Shuaa Capital to buy two UAE financial groups Top US business leaders set for Bahrain forum Nasdaq Dubai joins hands with Tunisian bourse Al Salam Bank inks exclusive deal with Gulf Air World Bank rankings boost for Bahrain KPMG to focus on financial management at seminar CustomerXPs to showcase key fraud management solution at Meftech Warba Bank achieves maiden sukuk success Dubai private sector growth stays robust EDB helps bring $261m FDI to Bahrain UNB arranges aircraft purchase loan Maintaining stability priority, says Qatar cbank chief QFB sells partial stake in healthcare service provider Euromoney Jordan conference this month BNY Mellon names new Mena sales head UAE banks need to improve customer service: survey IDB to host major PPP forum in Riyadh Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The modeling icon, 46, was her usual stunning self as she was snapped at New York City's JFK airport on Saturday. The 5ft9 beauty kept warm in a lavish black fur coat, matching with black leggings and boots, while carrying a large black handbag. Fab in fur: Naomi Campbell, 46, was her usual gorgeous self as she prepared to depart from New York City's JFK airport on Saturday Runway ready: Never a wallflower, the gorgeous model stood out in her expensive ensemble Busy: Naomi, who's currently appearing on the show Empire, made a number of media appearances during her latest trip to the Big Apple  Naomi, who's been a regular on Empire as fashion maven Camilla Marks, made the media rounds during her recent trip to the Big Apple, with appearances on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live and Fox News, opening up on a number of burning questions. Among those inquiries was the state of Naomi's friendship with Rihanna, a topic which was broached on Andy Cohen's pop culture gab-fest. The British stunner said that 'everything’s fine' between her and the Umbrella hit-maker - in spite of a digital diss in the form of an unfollow on RiRi's Instagram page. Supermodel: Naomi was alongside RuPaul on Watch What Happens Live Tuesday, where she spoke on a number of topics, ranging from the modeling business to the late Whitney Houston Faded friendship: While she didn't go into detail, Naomi insisted she was not in a feud with Rihanna, who she unfollowed on Instagram Campbell clarified her stance in saying that there were no hard feelings, as she can relate to the Barbadian beauty on many levels. 'I don’t have beef, especially with black women that I think are powerful out there - we’re all in the same thing, doing the same struggle,' she said. The famed model, who was on top of the business during its 90s boom alongside beauties such as Cindy Crawford and Kate Moss, also noted how today's digitally-driven society has changed the ladder to modeling super-stardom, when asked about the success of Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid. Legend of the catwalk: Naomi has been a professional model for more than three decades  Back in the day: Naomi, seen in this shot from London Fashion Week in 1989, said social media is a more powerful tool than the forms of print and TV media she and her contemporaries ascended with, decades back She said that with the advent of social media, the game has changed when it comes to making a name for oneself in the ultra-competitive fashion industry. 'How we became known was ... television, newspapers, magazines ... so, it is a bit easier now. You have more of a reach,' she said. Empire is next slated to hit the air March 22 at 9/8c on FOX.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 164 shares Most watched News videos Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Dancing Prince seen talking to mystery woman at Verbier party Little girl is overcome with emotion as her dad meets her from school Train ploughs snow as it pulls into New York station Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Will's got the love!

Just this week, WikiLeaks released nearly 9,000 pages that, if true, reveal that the CIA has been hacking tablets, smartphones, and smart TV's and turning them into recording devices. "They could turn it on remotely but it wouldn't turn the power light on. So anybody in that room would then be discussing or talking and being monitored without their knowledge or consent," said Will Donaldson, Cybersecurity Expert. In other words, spying; Wikileaks founder Julia Assange has not released all the details about the CIA's hacking software, but said he would release them to major tech companies, which tech expert Broc Wurzbacher says is a good thing. "They've looked at Apple or Google and have looked at loopholes or flaws in their software that they know how to patch and can point them in the right direction," said Wurzbacher. If that information gets in the hands of the wrong people, the results could be very bad. "Put these in the hands of criminals, and what are they going to do with them? 'Hey if i download this, insert it into a phone, then I can listen in on anyone in my business or in my house for criminal intent, that could be a bad thing," said Wurzbacher. Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all said that the leaked tools targeted older systems and that most were likely dealt with in a past softward update. Those three tech giants, Apple, Google, and Microsoft all say they have yet to hear from WikiLeaks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News An Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Factory in America? Maybe Not. Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips There’s a big push toward bringing manufacturing home, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is feeling the pressure. The company has been exploring options for a possible „Made in the USA” iPhone for months, along with its key manufacturing partners. Source: Apple However, the biggest partner of them all, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd (OTCMKTS: HNHPF ) – otherwise known as Foxconn – just threw a big glass of cold water on any hopes there might have been about building an Apple factory on U.S. soil. Made in the USA President Donald Trump made bringing jobs back to America one of his key campaign points, and it’s since become a focus of his presidency. As a result, a long list of companies has committed to moving jobs from offshore locations to U.S. soil. Some of the country’s biggest technology firms are supporting the „Made in the USA” push, including Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which has committed to adding 100,000 full-time jobs by mid-2018. Even South Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) is looking at opening a U.S. factory to build appliances. Apple isn’t exempt from this movement. On the contrary, as the world’s most valuable company, Apple is under considerable pressure to do something. Especially when the iPhone – its most lucrative and visible product by far – is made in China. Deflecting criticism, Apple CEO Tim Cook has gone on record as saying it’s the availability of skilled, trained workers that makes outsourcing manufacturing to China the strategy AAPL pursues, not the cheap labor. The possibility of a U.S. iPhone factory is something the company is reported to have asked Foxconn to investigate starting last June. The results weren’t very positive . The latest remarks from Foxconn make the idea of the company building a U.S. Apple factory seem even less likely. Foxconn Chairman Throws Doubt on U.S. iPhone Nikkei Asian Review was at an event marking the groundbreaking for a new industrial park … in China. There, Foxconn chairman Terry Gou commented on the possibility of building a U.S. iPhone factory . He had just returned from a trip to Washington after hinting his company might consider a large display panel factory in the U.S. (for TVs), as well as a molding factory. However, Gou did not sound enthused. In addition to echoing Apple CEO Tim Cook’s concerns about the lack of a trained, skilled workforce, and noting the entire iPhone supply chain is located in China, Gou has concerns about red tape. He told Nikkei : „I am concerned as to whether the U.S. can resolve all the investment issues in only a few months’ time. Does the U.S. offer incentive programs for foreign investors? They’ll need to pass bills first, and we’ll need to wait for American authorities to make a decision first.” In other words, the possibility of Foxconn building an Apple factory here to make iPhones is very low. Made in the USA iPhone Out of Reach … For Now What’s sometimes forgotten is that a U.S. Apple factory  alreadyexists . An Austin, Texas, plant churns out the company’s Mac Pro, complete with a „Made in the USA” sticker. Although it’s not exactly churning out these computers, and that’s a problem AAPL is facing as part of the whole U.S. iPhone concept. It turns out that the Texas Apple Factory has faced challenges with having to make its own customized tools and training workers. The situation has been bad enough that some of Apple’s engineers are reportedly pushing the company to move production back to China , if and when a new Mac Pro model is released. Who wouldn’t want to buy an iPhone with „Made in the USA” proudly etched on the back? Unfortunately, economic reality is a big obstacle to this goal. With Apple’s Mac Pro experience, Tim Cook’s obvious concerns and the latest comments from Foxconn, the possibility of an iPhone manufactured in a U.S. Apple factory seems more distant than ever. As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace The post An Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone Factory in America?

(NASDAQ: AAPL ) rumor mill today is news of the tech company opposing „right to repair” legislation. Today, we’ll look at that and other Apple Rumors for Friday. Right to Repair : Apple has sent representatives to argue against a right to repair bill up for consideration in Nebraska , reports AppleInsider . The tech company sent Steve Kester as its representative. He spoke with Nebraska Sen. Lydia Brasch about the negative effects the bill may have. The representative claims that it could cause the state to become a refuge for „bad actors”. The bill would require the company to supply manuals and parts for its devices to customers. Tech Support : Apple has been named the best company for tech support by  Laptop Mag , MacRumors notes. This marks the third year in a row that the company has taken the top spot on the list. The list included nine other tech companies and the number two on the list was Acer with a tech support score of 88. AAPL took the top of the tech support list with a score of 93. The quick repose of the company’s tech support accounts and specialists helped it reach the number one spot on the list. LG UltraFine 5K Display : Another test of the new LG UltraFine 5K Display shows that it works without issue , reports 9to5Mac . The new LG UltraFine 5K Display can now be safely used near routers and other wireless access points. The first version of the device had trouble and could crash when near these types of devices. Additional shielding has been added to the new version to protect it from these problems.

The port is one of four sites being considered for a multibillion-dollar project proposed by Exxon Mobil.   Casey Jackson for The Victoria Advocate BY THE NUMBERS The plant would generate $22 billion in state economic gains during the construction phase and $50 billion in state economic gains during the first six years of operations. The plant is expected to create more than 600 new permanent jobs and about 3,500 indirect and induced jobs during operations. The plant also would create about 11,000 construction jobs during a five-year buildout. Officials at Exxon Mobil and Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp. said they will announce by the end of March where they plan to build a multi-billion-dollar petrochemical plant. And although company leaders have been continually lobbying for tax incentives in San Patricio County, Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk said neither Victoria County nor two other Louisiana sites have been taken off the list of potential sites. Company officials submitted a tax abatement application to the San Patricio County commissioners court and a tax limitation application to the Gregory-Portland Independent School District in fall 2016. They have not submitted any applications in Victoria County. "A sitting decision will not be made until more is known about the outcomes of the Chapter 312 and 313 tax abatement applications to San Patricio County and Gregory-Portland Independent School District," Stryk said. "Once the study phase is complete, the project will be in a position to select a site." The Gregory-Portland school board has scheduled a hearing March 21 with the option for members to vote. That meeting is one day after San Patricio commissioners plan to vote at a hearing that would designate the proposed plant location a reinvestment zone, said Superintendent Paul Clore. The reinvestment zone was approved in August, but an attorney for the group Portland Citizens United, which opposes the plant's location in San Patricio County, has challenged the legality of the commissioners' original hearing about the reinvestment zone, said Adair Apple, the group's leader. "We're asking the commissioners court to redo the reinvestment zone hearing," she said. "It has to be public notice across the county. Before, they only put it in one newspaper, in the Portland News, which is not the county paper. Nobody showed up at that hearing because no one knew about it." The county commissioners court is set to redo the reinvestment zone hearing on March 20, said San Patricio County Judge Terry Simpson. The original hearing did not properly designate the land for the plant, he said. To have tax abatements and limitations for the company, the plant must be in a reinvestment zone. "We want to change it, so it would fit the project," he said. The county commissioners court will vote on the tax abatement within a week or two of the reinvestment zone hearing, Simpson said. The opposition group doesn't mind having the plant built in the county but does not like the proposed location because it is north of town near residential homes and within two miles of three schools, Apple said. "A big concern we have is what are those students going to be exposed to?" she said. "They won't know until they start the permitting process, and that's when they have to talk about emissions and what will be released. During the permitting process, they can still make stuff confidential, and we wouldn't know about it." Group members have attended several school board and commissioners court meetings with 50 to 100 members opposing the project location, Apple said. The group's Facebook page has more than 2,200 likes. The organization Texans for Natural Gas supports the project and its location, spokesman Steve Everly said. If Portland community members' concern is health and safety, the public needs to know that the companies proposing the plant are certified responsible care companies. To be a certified company, the work place safety rate has to be five times better than the average U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole, he said. Exxon officials have been actively engaging and listening to the San Patricio County community through almost 80 meetings since December, Stryk said. Company officials also have established a community information office at 1512 Wildcat Drive in Portland. "We hope this space can help facilitate additional face-to-face interactions with members of the community and enable all parties to both listen and to share their views," Stryk said. Exxon plans to spend more than $20 billion over 10 years to build and expand 11 manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Gulf area, creating thousands of jobs and adding billions of dollars worth of economic activity in Texas and Louisiana, Stryk said. Dale Fowler, president of Victoria Economic Development Corporation, said that to his knowledge no final decision about the plant has been made. If company officials choose Victoria, the plant would be near the Port of Victoria. "So, we continue to stay in contact with the company, and we have used their announcement to further market Victoria," he said. "I think we have a good site and a good location for future petrochemical expansions." Exxon's consideration of Victoria has put the county on the map for other companies to consider when they expand, Fowler said. "We're a proven location for industry with the presence of great chemical companies such as Invista, Dow, Formosa and DuPont," he said. "That means that we have the infrastructure here to support industry."

Written by Anuj Bhatia | Updated: March 14, 2017 11:59 am Apple iPhone 7 Plus features two cameras on the rear, each with 12MP sensors: one standard wide angle 12MP lens alongside a telephoto lens with an optical 2X zoom. Free-lance photographer Prashanth Viswanathan has for over a decade been working on assignments ranging from newswires like Reuters and Getty to newspapers like the New York Times and The National. His focus is documentary photography, including events, weddings, political activism, visual sociology and news photojournalism. He tells us about his switch from large format DSLRs to smartphones for his camera needs. Watch all our videos from Express Technology How did you get into photography? Tell us about your journey. After my higher studies, I was interning in the Sales department at Reuters back in 2005. A bay across, I came across a bunch of professional photographers working for the Newswire department. It was early 2006 when from the tsunami coverage (of 2004), one of the team members won the most prestigious award in the profession. Even as we celebrated their success, I kept getting drawn to the amazing photographs being produced by the team on a daily basis. I was mesmerised by the range of coverage from spot news events, features, stories and sports. In June of 2016, I quit sales and started as an intern at the Reuters Photo desk. After an eventful 18-month internship, I started freelancing. What type of cameras have you typically used over the years? I have been predominantly a DSLR user professionally, until recently started using my iPhone also for work.  Also read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Buy it just for the camera, but that’s not the only great feature How often do you use a smartphone to take photographs? I maybe using my smartphone at least once an hour unless I am sleeping. Free-lance photographer Prashanth Viswanathan has for over a decade been working on assignments ranging from newswires to newspapers. Which phone do you use to take photographs and why? I have been using iPhones from the beginning, as they have always had the best result in low light right. The camera on the iPhone 4s was my companion for over four years before I switched to a 6s and now the 7 Plus. What is the best camera feature in the iPhone 7 Plus? Earlier, the two biggest limitations of a smartphone in comparison to a DSLR was its magnification and the depth of field. With the introduction of two lenses the iPhone 7 Plus addresses the issue of zooming optically. The portrait mode gives you control of depth of field. With these options the iPhone camera has replaced my DSLR for my day-to-day Photography. iPhone 7 Plus sample size. Image resized for web (Photo credit: Prashanth Vishwanathan) What features do you think smartphone cameras are good at compared to DSLRs? DSLRs are far bulkier, they are more intrusive than a smartphone and heavier too. Majorly the smartphone zones you out of the technicalities of using a DSLR and makes you concentrate on emotions and composition. It simplifies the process of photography even to a child.  Also read: Apple gives photography tips for iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus users What camera features would you like to see introduced into smartphones? Smartphones in the future should offer a lens series, with high-quality glass, which allows to shoot in tough light conditions and increases the dynamic range of the smartphone. As a photographer and an iPhone 7 Plus user, give us five tips to take better photographs this Holi 1.iPhone 7 Plus is splash and weather proof, I won’t recommend to dip it in water, but will not be worried if water droplets hit the phone in the process of shooting. Cover it with plastic when you are not shooting. Out of all the choices, I would not worry carrying an iPhone to capture the festival of colour. 2.Using the optical zoom feature helps you capture action keeping your distance and not getting yourself too wet. 3.Portrait mode will be handy capturing faces smeared with colour. 4.Using slow motion video would give you lovely splash footage. 5.Using apps like boomerang and filters on Instagram enhances the colour experience.

But I cannot live with a bank that prioritises cheques over modern conveniences such as mobile payments (Stock picture) Spare a thought for the customer support staff of Bank of Ireland and AIB. Last week, both sets of teams were inundated with enquiries from hundreds of frustrated customers, wanting to know when they may get to use Apple Pay. Bank of Ireland took the worst of the flak as it doesn't even have Android Pay as an alternative. Instead, its policy is to issue cheque books. But paper IOUs finally look endangered. For those who missed it, Apple finally launched its Apple Pay mobile payments system into Ireland last week. In a nutshell, this system allows you to save your contactless credit card's details into your iPhone's digital 'Wallet' so that the iPhone becomes the physical object you use when paying for things at a contactless payment machine in a shop. It's incredibly handy. It's also pretty secure considering each payment requires your fingerprint, meaning a stolen iPhone is useless to the thief. But the country's two biggest banks decided to sit the launch out. In doing so, they handed a free pass to KBC and Ulster Bank, the two banks with which Apple Pay can be used. As a result, hundreds (perhaps thousands) of customers are now considering a move away from the big two banks. I am one of those customers. My bank, Bank of Ireland, is an especially egregious case when it comes to a lack of modern options. For its own reasons, it sat out the introduction of Android Pay last December, making it the only major bank not to have either Apple Pay or Android Pay. It has no problem issuing me with a chequebook, though. So now I'm looking to open an account with KBC or Ulster Bank. Quite apart from the issue of Apple Pay, this may be no bad thing. I'm fairly sure that moving bank almost always results in some saving anyway, regardless of extra benefits such as the use of Apple Pay. I'm also fairly sure that it's not an overreaction to consider moving away from a bank because they don't have a shiny new system. We all have some issue or other with our existing bank. An item such as Apple Pay is really just the nudge many of us need to look at our finances with a bit more diligence. This is especially so as most of us have probably been with the same bank for years out of sheer inertia. So I don't feel especially nerdy that it's the lack of Apple Pay that is finally pushing me into taking a proactive stance on my own banking habits. I can live with paying more in fees. But I cannot live with a bank that prioritises cheques over modern conveniences such as mobile payments. From the tsunami of negative feedback that Bank of Ireland got this week, I'm not alone. (To be fair, AIB also took it in the neck for not having Apple Pay. But it, at least, has mobile payments in the form of Android Pay. It also says it's in discussions with Apple about Apple Pay). Why do we want these mobile payment systems? I'd say it's because we're sick of flaky pieces of plastic. And we're sick of waiting in shop queues while others take ages unzipping wallets, tapping pin codes into terminals (which then sometimes take more time to process the transaction), replacing their cards, rezipping the wallet and replacing the wallet in their bags. We also may be looking for slightly better security. Just over a week ago, I got a call from my bank telling me my credit card had been compromised and I'd need to wait over a week until a new one was issued to me. This is currently causing me administrative chaos with everything from disrupted bin payments and M50 tolls to Spotify and Netflix subscription interruptions. Whether or not the card was physically compromised or hacked from some website isn't that important because I'm pretty sure that using Apple Pay (or Android Pay) in future would be more secure. This is because paying in a shop (or online) using Apple Pay or Android Pay doesn't always require the kind of physical disclosure of sensitive data (such as the three-digit CVV security number) that physical cards require. The whole system is based on a more secure, encrypted form of transaction that uses one-time dynamic codes. For me, this means that I'm less likely to be called up by the bank and told that someone has withdrawn €200 from an ATM in Seville using what appears to be my card. It also means a slightly thinner physical wallet and less of a necessity to keep changing cards when they disintegrate or bug out from being placed next to other cards in the same wallet. While I can't completely divest my affairs from Bank of Ireland (I have a mortgage, for example), a few enquiries last week showed me that it's quite easy to switch a lot of current account stuff without too much hassle. In the case of one of the Apple Pay banks, KBC, there also appears to be a fee-less option once a balance of €2,000 is maintained. An alternative option to switching banks is Boon, a prepay system that works by downloading an app and topping up via a prepaid digital Mastercard. It works in any shop whose terminals accept the Mastercard contactless logo. But that may be too restrictive. I'm not crazy about the thought of a constant top-up system where shortfalls may take days to rebalance. So I'm going to try one of the other banks. I'm willing to do this just so I can use an iPhone as a payment tool. But in the process, I bet I'll save money on my day-to-day banking costs.

Last year he was outraged when he attended a campaign rally in San Jose and saw violent anti-Trump protesters attacking Trump supporters. Sharyl Attkisson: "Did you post these feelings online?" Torba: "Yes." Attkisson: "On what?" Torba: "On Facebook, on Twitter, I wrote a blog about it. And immediately - without getting into any of the issues or anything - I was automatically labeled a racist, a bigot, etcetera. Venture capitalists, people that I respected and had worked with on a very close level, that just wrote me off completely and blacklisted me completely." Torba is now living in self-imposed exile in Texas, fighting what he sees as growing control of information online. He’s started his own version of Twitter called Gab. Attkisson: "What was the idea behind it?" Torba: "The idea behind it is that news, information, and communication is really monopolized on the internet by a select group of people. About four or five leaders in one of the most progressive cities in the world with some of the most progressive workers in the world. And what I saw happening as a conservative in Silicon Valley was an agenda being pushed and the conservative side and conservative ideas being suppressed." It’s not only conservatives like Torba who believe there’s an epic struggle underway to control information. Liberals and nonpartisans also complain of censorship, bias and fake news. We’re steeped in the most intense propaganda wars since World War II. That’s when the Nazis and the Allies fought for their citizens’ hearts and minds, devising propaganda campaigns to demoralize the enemy. Today’s battleground in the information wars: TV and the web. Islamic extremist terrorists openly recruit online. U.S. officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin exploited state-controlled TV news to discredit Hillary Clinton. Covert warfare is also widely being waged by U.S. political and corporate actors. Attkisson: "When people get online every day and take part in social media or do searches for news, what is it you think they don't know?" Matthew Brown: "I don't think they know they're being manipulated." Brown is a data analyst who pierces the secrecy behind paid efforts to influence online. Attkisson: "What areas of the internet are used to shape and manipulate opinion?" Brown: "Everywhere social. Everywhere social means specific Facebook pages, but it also means the comment sections in every major newspaper." Brown began investigating after his health insurance costs tripled and he commented about it on the Obamacare Facebook page. He got bombarded, he says, by digital activists disguised as ordinary people. Brown: "Digital activists are paid employees; their purpose is to attack anyone who's posting something contrary to the view the page owner wants expressed." Brown decided to use analysis software to crunch the numbers. He evaluated 226,000 pro-Obamacare posts made by 40,000 Facebook profiles. What he found was remarkable. Brown: "60 percent of all the posts were made from 100 profiles, posting between the hours of 9 and 5 Pacific time." Attkisson: "Which means what?" Brown: "They were paid to post." Brown says it’s rampant on social media. One popular tool: “zombie profiles” that make automated “robo” posts. Brown: "A zombie post is a fake, purchased, or rented Facebook profile that's expressing the views of an organization as if it was his or her own. But, when in reality, the comment being expressed is done on software and written by generally one or two people. So, the zombie posts will go out on a schedule and then they are supported by zombie likes." Attkisson: "Is there any reason to believe Republicans don't do the same thing and corporations as well?" Brown: "There’s no reason to believe that everybody’s not doing it." Even the government is in the game. Leaked emails show the feds seeking “persona management” software to “allow 10 personas per user.” They talk of creating an “army” of fake social media profiles maintained by actors “gaming” to hide their true location, and using “tricks” to “add a level of realness … to all fictitious personas.” Campaign 2016 brought higher stakes and a new name to internet efforts to manipulate public opinion: fake news. Unsubstantiated rumors about both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went viral. There was "Pizzagate," which claimed Clinton associates were running a child sex ring from a pizza parlor. Trump was accused in a case of child rape. In October, President Barack Obama unveiled a push to “curate” the news. Obama: "We are going to have to rebuild within this wild, wild West of information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to." The news media quickly joined the president’s call. After a man motivated by Pizzagate rumors fired a gun in the pizza parlor, Clinton added her voice to the cause. Clinton: "It is now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences. This is not about politics or partisanship. Lives are at risk, lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs, contribute to their communities. It's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly." Facebook announced an initiative to stop fake news. The head of the left-wing group Media Matters told donors the group played a “critical role” in forcing Facebook’s hand. But the fix involved using fact-checkers who many conservatives see as biased. Conservatives point to fake news in the mainstream media, like the false report claiming Trump had removed a bust of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. from the White House. Trump: "Zeke, from Time magazine, writes a story about, I took down - I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But this is how dishonest the media is." PART 2 Attkisson: What do you define as fake news? Susan Glasser: "Well, as a term, right? It's like any term and in fact now you see partisans of both parties appropriating and using this label merely to apply it to news that they don't like." Glasser was editor of the left-leaning Politico during the 2016 campaign. Glasser: "So, what started out as a panic over fake news and what role it had in undermining Hillary Clinton's candidacy and promoting Donald Trump's candidacy, by the way, is now a label that Donald Trump, master marketer, has seen is a powerful label, so he's appropriated that and slapped that label on stories that he merely doesn't like." Trump: "You are fake news … go ahead." Glasser: "It's not that it didn't exist before, but Americans used to know the difference between The National Enquirer at the checkout counter and The New York Times. Public suspicion and allegations of bias hound the most pervasive internet players: Twitter, Google and Facebook." During the presidential campaign, critics discovered when doing a Google search for "Hillary Clinton indictment" that typing in "ind" didn't suggest "indictment." When you type "Hillary Clinton ind" into Bing or Yahoo, there are plenty of indictment-based recommendations. When you type it into Google the top two recommended autocompletions are "Hillary Clinton Indiana" and "Hillary Clinton India." As it happens, Google's parent company, Alphabet, was a top Clinton donor. Its chief executive worked on the Clinton campaign. Last year, former Facebook insiders alleged they "routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers." Attkisson: "We hear from a lot of people that they don't trust Politico or Facebook or Google or whoever it might be that's trying to sort through the truth or the facts." Glasser: "We're looking at a crisis of faith in institutions, the media being one set of institutions that is under assault. More broadly, political parties, you know, no longer have the trust and the faith." Torba claims Twitter censors conservatives, but not liberals for similar behavior. On Gab anything goes, he says, as long as it's legal, not inciting violence, and not exposing information like credit cards. Torba: "What we're doing is instead of us playing Big Brother and, you know, curating content and deciding what is news and what isn't and what people should see and what they shouldn't, we are giving the power to you as a user so you can mute different words, trends, hashtags, phrases, topics and users." Because of Gab's anti-censorship policy, it's attracted plenty of detestable users. Some blogs call it "Twitter for racists" and "the alt-right's very own Twitter." Torba: "The media likes to label us as alt-right or they've said, you know, Nazi Twitter or the Twitter for racists. I find it, you know, really funny because we have one of the most diverse starting teams of all time. So, we have my co-founder who is a Turkish Kurd and he's also Muslim. We have our chief communications officer who is based in Canada, who is an Indian and a practicing Hindu." If there's ultimate truth in the debate over manipulation of information, it may be found in asking not "What can you believe?" but "Who wants you to believe it and why?" Attkisson: "Do you favor censoring information that someone has decided is untrue or may blatantly be untrue so that the public can't access it online?" Glasser: "I don't. I think that would be a terrible mistake. We have to find a way for truth to regain its value in our public discourse, I think, and that's not about stopping people from what is untrue. It's about finding ways to reinvigorate the conversation around which is true and to find out that which those who are powerful don't want us to know." Attkisson: "What would your advice be to somebody who's taking part either in social media or looking for information on the web?" Brown: "My advice would be not to believe any of it. Take it all with a grain of salt." close News In Pictures Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch Charges filed in vicious beating posted to Facebook Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host Trending 1   UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch 2   Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him 3   BI-LO ends fuelperks, begins loyalty program 4   Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host 5   Car crashes into animal hospital in Franklin DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 UPDATE: Authorities investigate after toddler found dead on front porch 2 Family of missing Spruce Pine man want to know why it took so long to find him 3 BI-LO ends fuelperks, begins loyalty program 4 Transformus seeks new location after talks break down with Mills River host 5 Car crashes into animal hospital in Franklin 6 Late season winter blast comes with pros and cons 7 Henderson County water controversy may be decided by state lawmakers 8 Reality Check: How to get a checkup from the neck up in minutes 9 Bone-chilling cold takes toll on some apple varieties in WNC 10 Driver cited after colliding with salt truck on I-40

The code contains what WikiLeaks referred to as a "hacking arsenal" of malware, viruses, trojans, and weaponized "zero day" exploits for iOS devices, that could give anyone in possession of the code "the entire hacking capacity of the CIA." This "Year Zero" release is the first in the full Vault 7 series by WikiLeaks, and is said to act as an introduction to the capacity and means of the CIA's covert hacking program. The agency's abilities can take aim at a number of popular consumer products from companies like Apple, Google, Samsung, and Microsoft, turning everything from an iPhone to a smart TV into a "covert microphone." In its analysis of the released documents, WikiLeaks looked at how iPhones and iPads have been targeted by the CIA in the past, and how they can continue to be exploited in the future. Although Android remains a dominant force in the global smartphone market, WikiLeaks argued that a "disproportionate focus" has been placed on iOS devices by the CIA, most likely due to the Apple-branded phone's popularity. Because of this, the agency has a specialized unit in place within the Mobile Development Branch that creates and executes malware to infiltrate, take control of, and exfiltrate sensitive information from iOS products. The MDB's methods are said to include a collection of zero day exploits, which are vulnerabilities in a piece of software unknown by the software's creator and subsequently exploitable by hackers. Including the iOS malware, WikiLeaks claimed that the CIA has recently "lost control" of the majority of its hacking arsenal. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote "zero days" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. WikiLeaks noted that in the wake of Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, a group of technology companies convinced the Obama administration to disclose any zero day exploits and bugs to each company, rather than hoard the information. The Vulnerabilities Equities Process underlined this agreement in 2010, and the U.S. government said it would reveal any vulnerabilities discovered to the company in question. Documents in Year Zero paint a further negative image for the CIA, which is said to not have abided by the agreement between the technology companies and the U.S. government. An example was given by WikiLeaks centering on one malware that can control both the Android phone and iPhone software "that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts." The government is said to not have brought the information forward to Apple or Google in the time it has had the hacking data. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. The scope of the new WikiLeaks documents includes detailed information on the iOS exploits, hacks that could potentially infest vehicle control systems, and even attacks against Samsung smart TV sets. This last point, dubbed "Weeping Angel," was said to have been developed by the CIA in conjunction with the United Kingdom's MI5 as a way to convert turned-off television sets into secret microphones. The full list of the Year Zero documents can be found on WikiLeaks, and complete analysis of the documents by independent security experts will take some time in order for the impact of the release to be determined.

The number two lie people tell themselves is "Well, I'm not doing anything wrong, so why does it matter?" The truth is that an innocent person cannot be manipulated, as they have nothing to hold over them. Sooner, or later, something valuable will be found by those that want to manipulate you, and will, at their leisure, use that to bend your will.

[doublepost=1488905563][/doublepost] Seriously. I read it and yawned. Not from apathy regarding covert surveillance, but from faux-surprise that this info would be new to anyone. Are there actually people who didn't think this was occurring? In the court of law, thinking that an event happened and proving that an event happened makes quite a difference.

GSMArena.com Tip us 868k 125k 87k 202k RSS Log in Login with Facebook Google Sign up Home News Reviews Blog Phone Finder Tools Glossary Coverage FAQ Contact Alphabet soup Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017) review - - - Sunday Q&A Post your comment Comments (20) Chip 12 March 2017 Misc Featured After a two-week break when Yours truly was busy roaming the streets of Barcelona and bringing you the latest updates from the MWC, the Sunday Q&A finally returns. Our inbox got overfilled and it might take a couple of weeks to catch up to all the interesting questions you posted. This week we talk our top 10 by Fans chart, GPU comparisons and when is the right moment to upgrade your phone. Stephan: Would it be possible for you guys to give us a competitive review on GPUs just as you did on the CPUs a while back? I know device resolution comes into play but maybe just include offscreen battery of tests. I tend to find that if gaming is important to you that even older chips such as those in Snapdragon 800 and 808s tend to be better than some of these latest CPU accompanying Snapdragon 625 and 650s. Comparing GPUs without the context of actual implementations in specific SoCs and devices wont do anyone much good. What really matters is how a given phone performs for GPU-intensive tasks such as gaming and we make sure to cover that in depth in our reviews. If you feel like comparing offscreen performance across various devices you should our Basemark X database, which contains most of the phones weve reviewed in recent years. Suraj: I don't understand why we need dual cameras for just bokeh effect, like in recent phones (for ex Honor 6x,Honor 8,iPhone 7 Plus). Because if a simple app would do that, why you need two cameras? Does Dual camera in above mentioned phones provide anything more than the effect? There are a bunch of different takes on the dual camera setup in smartphones. You have different focal lengths (LG, Apple), improved low light performance (monochrome sensors on Huawei and Xiaomi phones) and only depth information for bokeh effect(HTC, ZTE). Creating a realistic bokeh effect in post processing is a rather hard task that involves a lot of challenges, hardest of which is detecting the actual outline of the subject that needs to be in focus and its distance from the other objects in the frame. Thats something a second camera helps a lot with and normally helps deliver better results. Plus as we mentioned, in most of the implementations the second sensor also serves another purpose so the bokeh assistance is merely an added bonus. A bunch of people: Why is phone X missing from your top 10 by fans ranking when it has more fans than phone Y that is on the list? To keep that list fresh we only allow phones that have been in our database for less than 18 months on it. Otherwise you'll only see very old phones there and you won't know, which of the new phones is the most widely loved. Since some phones get uploaded as rumored that reduces their stay there by a few more months. We're considering changing that policy to only affect phones that have been official for 18 months so expect some changes there. Joonie: Is it worth upgrading to a flagship phone this year, knowing that for the next year or 2, something would be far greater than the phones we have today? Would the satisfaction be a worth the money? Ah, the age-old question - should I shop now or wait for until something better comes up? Theres always going to be something better on the horizon and if you are afraid that an improved model will come out then you can never get anything. The product upgrade cycle for every device family and manufacturer is pretty well established at this point so you know when the next flagship will come around. And unless you are a few weeks away from that theres probably little reason to delay the purchase of a phone that ticks the right boxes for you. The smartphone race is extremely fast paced so you cant constantly stay at its front unless you upgrade phones every three months - the trick is to find a phone that works for you and be happy with that. Sam: Why Sony cameras don't perform better than the competitors given every other mobile company uses Sony sensors? Why Sony skimps on battery? While certainly one of the most important things, the camera sensor isnt the only factor that contributes to great image quality. There are also plenty of decision to be taken when it comes to image processing - balancing saturation and noise or noise and fine detail or detail and oversharpening artefacts. Sony flagship cameras have certainly have had an edge over the past years when it comes to total resolved detail as the company went for very high resolutions. However it also often tended to have issues with corner softness in its lens, which meant sharpness rapidly dropped towards the edges of the frame. The high-res sensors also had issues with their low-light performance too - another issue that the not particularly bright lens didnt help with. Either way, the new Motion Eye camera that we saw at MWC 2017 seems to be a marked improvement for Sony and it might catapult the company back to the front of the camera race. Not sure what you mean by Sony skimping on battery, but we have had a bunch of Sony handsets produce excellent scores in our battery test. You can see all results over here to see that battery life has actually very rarely been an issue with Sony handsets. Josh Cole: Please add option to select GPS, GLONASS, BDS, it will help ease the search of a perfect phone! You can use the Free text field at the bottom of our Phone Finder page to filter phones that have GLONASS, BDS or another specific navigation system. You can also separate individual terms by comma to search for more than one supported system at the same time. If you have any questions for us - you can send them by using the form over here.

Nick Ross PC World @NickRossTech 13/03/17 Review Specs Images User Reviews Buy Now Tweet 104 Users want this Expert Rating 4.25 / 5 Pros Looks stunning Fast at everything Good audio features Cons No headphone jack Expensive Bottom Line HTC's flagship phone brings some interesting features to the top of the market including great looks and 24-bit audio. But there's better value elsewhere. Would you buy this? Yes 104 No 93 Price $ 1,199.00 (AUD) Phone aficionados have a soft spot for HTC. The company’s hardware almost always seems to be very well made and only occasionally tainted by dodgy software or pricing. Here’s the new HTC U Ultra. It’s a bit of a tongue twister to say out loud, but you only need to glimpse at it to see how it’s one of the prettiest phones around… probably ever. But the premium phone market has some amazing choices including the Google Pixel XL, the Huawei Mate 9, the iPhone 7 and the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy S8. So where does this sit on an impressive list? Key specs 5.7in, 1440 x 2560 LCD screen, secondary screen 2in, 160 x 1040 LCD, 64,128GB/4GB RAM, Quad-core Snapdragon 821 CPU, Adreno 530 GPU, 12MP rear and 16MP front cameras, microSD (dual SIM slot on some models), USB-C, no headphone jack, 24-bit audio, Android 7, 3000mAh battery, 162 x 80 x 8mm, 170g. Full specs here. Handling and Design We keep raving about the colourful, metallic finish of the U Ultra, but just look at it. It’s actually a curved glass finish constructed from Corning’s ‘super tough’ Gorilla Glass 5 - on the 64GB model. The 128GB model goes one step further and is finished in a premium-watch like Sapphire Crystal. We didn’t have the heart to drop test it but doubtless some videos will appear on YouTube over the coming weeks. The finish rivals, if not surpasses, Apple’s Jet Black special-edition glossy variant and, unlike the glassy (and explodey) Samsung Galaxy Note 7, sticks to your hand and isn’t as slippery as a fish. HTC also bundles a clear plastic case to add some protection while letting you still see the chassis. We preferred to use the phone without it but if you’re dropping a load of money on this, it’s a good idea to protect it somehow. One concern we do have is for the protruding camera lens. Without a case you’ve got to choose between scraping the front screen or the camera when putting it on a table. Hmm. The protruding camera means either the screen or the lens will be subjected to abrasion when you're placing it on a surface without a case. It’s a deceptively-large phone. Despite being only 8mm thick at 162mm in length it’s one of the largest on the market. There’s not much wasted space above and below the screens though. At the bottom is a function button which doubles as a fast fingerprint reader and directly above the main, 5.7-inch screen is a 2in secondary screen. If you’ve small hands or don’t like phablet-like big phones, this probably isn’t for you – but if you like the look of it, check out the smaller-yet-similar, single-screened HTC U Play, which we’ll be reviewing soon. We’re normally suspicious of second screen-like features as they can be gimmicky, not very useful and battery vampires. However, the U Ultra’s can be genuinely useful. It shows you notifications without waking the whole phone up, there are many different apps and shortcuts that it can display and it offers a high resolution and looks good. The fact we used it and didn’t want to turn it off speaks volumes. The exception here is with the Highlights news feed content, which we found as annoying as every other smartphone news/information service. We’d turn that off moving forward. The second screen seamlessly sits atop the main screen and offers notifications, news and shortcuts. The main screen is as crisp and vibrant as we’d expect from an Ultra High Definition LCD screen and we’ve no complaints there. Ultimately, beyond the ability to customise themes, there’s little here that doesn’t feel like a native Android 7 phone in general usage. That’s no bad thing. The processor is the Snapdragon 821 (with Adreno 530 graphics chip) which is the same as the Android Flagship, Google Pixel XL. As such everything flies along as fast as you’d hope and responsiveness is almost instant. Audio Audio quality is something HTC raves about and usually for good reason. The BoomSound system is back here which includes 24-bit audio compatibility but there are caveats. Firstly, there’s no headphone jack... FFS. In a phone this big there’s surely not much excuse for it to be missing and hopefully this fashion trend will be short lived. There's no 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter either. HTC does, however, include a USB-C-connected pair of 24-bit earbuds. Naturally, you can’t charge the phone while using them, unless you find a compatible adaptor from somewhere. When you first plug in your earbuds the phone's 'USonic' feature will offer to ‘tune’ them to your ear canal in order to enhance audio quality. Whatever it does at this point, whether it's smoke and mirrors or bona fide science, the quick tests it runs deliver up some noticeable audio improvements which you can test by turning the enhancements off and on while a test track plays. There’s even a graph. HTC USonic. The graph illustrates how audio is tuned to your ear's unique shape. Apparently. Whenever you subsequently play music, USonic tells you that it's performing a (very) quick background noise check to ensure that 'sound levels are balanced.' However, for those wanting the loud-and-clear external speaker performance of previous HTC devices, it’s not here this time. While the external speaker does get quite loud the treble tops-out and distorts quickly and there’s next-to-no, bass-rich punch. If you miss this feature, those around you might be grateful. The U Ultra also has four different microphones for recording. It helps make the U Ultra particularly good for conference calls and recording audio with video.

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface.

Long before it was his livelihood, it was his fascination, and one he'd never asked for permission to do. Now, as the independent console industry is entangled in legal battles across the country, the very principles behind his livelihood are being challenged by titans like Microsoft and Sony. "I've been fixing stuff since I was a little kid, scavenging garbage," GorillaStomp said, not looking up from the Xbox he was dismantling with a screwdriver. He was watching a For Honour Twitch stream while removing pet dander and cigarette detritus from the Xbox's jammed disc tray. "Basically, I went from Legos to real-life troubleshooting." We were in 8-Bit And Up, an independent games store that also deals in console repair. For eight years, he's been fixing out-of-warranty consoles that gamers don't want to send to manufacturers, and estimates he's about 75 per cent effective at fixing whatever he agrees to open up. "I'm not afraid of anything that's man-made," he said. Recently, eight states' senators have introduced bills that protect GorillaStomp's right to repair consoles. If passed, they'd require console manufacturers like Microsoft and Sony to put spare parts and manuals on the market for independent console repairmen. It's a small thing with big, abstract implications, namely preventing an industry repair monopoly. Currently, independent repair companies don't depend on console manufacturers for spare parts or information. Chinese eBay vendors and YouTube videos get the job done. These "right to repair" bills will expand and legitimise the independent repair industry, in the process testing manufacturers' grip on their consoles post-warranty life. If consumers had no access to independent shops and if they had no option but to ship their Xboxes to Microsoft for a disc drive replacement, they'd have to wait a month, pay up to a third of the console's price tag and, potentially, receive in return a new console without any of their saved data. The bills would ensure that wouldn't happen. A rep for the games industry's lobbying group said "right to repair" bills would help "sidestep consoles' digital protection assets" and "invite unethical individuals to break the law and encourage widespread theft of video games and proprietary information. The games industry doesn't think these bills are necessary. In fact, a representative for the Entertainment Software Association, the lobbying group that hosts E3 and counts among its members most major video game publishers, told me that the information and tools that would be disseminated thanks to these "right to repair" bills would cause problems. Specifically, they said the information would help "sidestep consoles' digital protection assets" and "invite unethical individuals to break the law and encourage widespread theft of video games and proprietary information." Lobbying against the "right to repair" bill, the games industry is working to make their own repair services indispensable and uncontested, the sort of capitalist future that Apple is already affecting. In the early 2000s, legislators originally pushed "right to repair" bills to fight car dealers' monopoly on automotive repair. After a 10-year fight, the Massachusetts legislature passed the Automotive Right to Repair Act in 2013, so any technician could get the tools and information they needed to fix cars. When the "right to repair" movement became a hot issue in tech, repair industry lobbyists looked at the Automotive Right to Repair Act. "We did some copy-and-paste on the bill and substituted digital electronic products for automobile," Gay Byrne, the executive director of the Repair Association, told me. The two initiatives were similar, in theory, except for one crucial thing: 1998's Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which protects game manufacturers' copyright claims, but also contains a stipulation protecting independent hardware repair — at least, in theory. A supporter of the "right to repair" bills on the games industry's opposition: "They get to protect their content and they get to protect their marketplace for repair. And they get to basically force you to get a new console if they don't feel like repairing an old console." That stipulation, the Computer Maintenance Competition Assurance Act, is what lawmakers are heatedly debating across the country and which presents an exception about when it would be illegal for an independent shop to repair something. "The requirement in the copyright law says you can't fix the hardware if it might infringe on the copyright of the software," Byrne said. It's a claim technology manufacturers parrot when asked what's so controversial about releasing diagnostic manuals or repair parts — a claim that I've been hard-pressed to substantiate with real incidents, and one Byrne dismisses as "bullshit." She doesn't think independent repairmen are there to pirate console software. And the already-illegal threat of piracy shouldn't haunt consumers' right to repair what they already paid for. The ESA's reasoning is, to her, a sleight-of-hand. "They get to protect their content and they get to protect their marketplace for repair. And they get to basically force you to get a new console if they don't feel like repairing an old console," she said. Sending consoles across the country can be a major drag for gamers who want to keep playing. "What if I lived in a remote part of Minnesota?" GorillaStomp asked angrily. "Screw yourself. You know, my cousin's been taking apart stuff for his whole life. Let him fix it." A console gets worked on at 8-Bit And Up Back in 2008, GorillaStomp interviewed for a job at 8-Bit And Up with its owner, Joe. "It was the weirdest interview I'd ever had," he told me. Joe asked if he'd ever worked as a repair guy. GorillaStomp said, "No, but last summer, I fixed seven PS2s for my buddies." Joe hired him. When the "Red Ring of Death" plague hit Xbox 360 consoles, signalling a critical hardware malfunction, GorillaStomp says he fixed 20 consoles a week in 8-Bit and Up's dim, used game-lined den. Microsoft mercifully extended their Xbox warranty, placing a $US1 ($1) billion stack of chips on retaining their consumer base, but the repair took weeks. He's seen everything from gum-clotted disc drives to PSPs wrecked by misguided hacks, estimating he's about 75% effective at fixing whatever lands in his hands. "It's all about keeping the gamers playing as cheaply and stress-free as possible," GorillaStomp told me. "I can get stuff back to them in a week." At the Lower East Side's XCubicle, a console repair hackerspace that sees a little more sunlight, co-founder Patrick Che recalled fixing between 30-50 consoles a week in 2008. That's when he decided to expand his web development business into a full console repair suite. "We had a storefront. Our friend was doing a lot of those repairs. We asked our friend to put up a sign. Customers would drop them off and we'd fix them," he told me. XCubicle now is a small, cluttered room stacked high with console boxes. One cabinet contained the "roach bag," where unlucky PS4 owners whose warm power strips attracted roaches had their consoles literally de-bugged. (XCubicle charges a $US30 ($40) roach fee.) Customers interface with repairmen through a window spotted with Mario and Pokemon stickers. The table he sat at was cluttered with modded Nintendo 3DSes, with screens and buttons carefully sorted in plastic containers. Nothing was from Nintendo. XCubicle Che gets his parts from China via eBay, as does 8-Bit And Up. Hackers post their own "how-to" console repair videos on YouTube, which can be hit or miss, unless you know your stuff. If New York's "fair repair" bill passed, he said, he'd use the extra diagnostic information, and might nab some official components here or there. It would solve a reliability issue. Sometimes, knock-off parts, especially screens, are scratched or defective. He just eats the losses because sending parts back to China can be a pain. Yesterday, Nebraska's "right to repair" bill was heard. In Nebraska, it is the farming industry that has pushed the bill further than any other state's. Tractor manufacturer John Deere programs digital locks into their tractors' software, preventing farmers from diagnosing their own hardware malfunctions. John Deere cited the DMCA, and charges thousands for repairs, adding urgency to Nebraska's "right to repair" fight. For years, John Deere representatives have argued that independent tractor repair would inevitably lead to software piracy of the software that makes them tick, going so far as to say that, when farmers purchase tractors, they have "an implied licence for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle." Michael Warnecke, an Entertainment Software Association representative, testified at the Nebraska hearing. "If this bill were to go forward, it would create, at the very least confusion, and possibly severely undercut U.S. copyright law," Warnecke said. When he cited the possibility of bypassing consoles' security features as a reason to kill the bill, someone sitting near the livestream microphone whispered "bullshit." Following him, a wireless communications representative argued that authorised providers can guarantee better-trained technicians. Honed by the manufacturers themselves, these repairmen have at their fingertips privileged, proprietary information for repairing consoles. There isn't the added risk of sketchy repair practices. XCubicle's Che doesn't disagree. "It's kind of true," he told me, a week prior. "There are a lot of shady repair shops that take consoles in and don't fix them, or they take parts out and sell them." But Joe, who owns 8-Bit and Up, laughed when I posed the question of training. He'd hired GorillaStomp, after all. "They [Microsoft and Sony] don't repair consoles. You're not getting your machine back, and you're not getting your data back. They throw your machine in a bin and send you a new one," he told me. "I'll put my guys up against their guys any day." The question remains: If corporate tech successfully stomps out "right to repair" bills moving through seven states, what changes? Will XCubicle and 8-Bit And Up get shut down? According to repair industry professionals, things will stay as they are. They will just operate on the fringes, in less-than-ideal conditions and without official components or diagnostic tools. They will continue to get their parts from China and their info from YouTube. It's inefficient, and for consumers, a little risky. Also, a shut-down could add momentum to manufacturers' push for the more restricted world Apple users live in, perhaps manifested as a crackdown on YouTube repair videos that, somehow, violate the DMCA or, at worst, cease-and-desist letters sent to Joe from 8-Bit and Up. Chinese parts are essentially untouchable, though. "America was founded on pioneer spirit," GorillaStomp concluded, oiling the Xbox's disc drive. Piece by piece, he reassembled its shell and plugged it into an old, dusty TV. Prince of Persia flicked on. "The government needs to leave people alone," he said. In this case, it could be the government that makes his job easier, and corporate interests spinning a web around his hands. Comments leigh @leigh Mar 13, 2017, 12:34pm Would love a similar look at the Australian side of things, there's still a few around that freely advertise they'll modify your consoles as well as fix them.

Whats to stop console makers going the path of Apple and designing their hardware so its impossible to fix? E.g. Apple soldering on Ram to the MB. Reply 0 Virus @virus__ Mar 13, 2017, 3:27pm Eh, most apple stuff is possible to fix with the right know-how & tools. Not so easy for you or I, but there's a bloke based in NYC called Lois Rossman, he does live streams almost daily on YouTube of him fixing MacBooks. He has an electronics repair shop. He's gotten around a lot of these issues of schematics not being easy to obtain & parts being extremely hard to source. he even once had immigration raid him (I think that's who) because of Apple, heh. Reply 0 blasty Guest Mar 14, 2017, 7:07pm Let's hope this legislation continues. E-waste is one of the worlds largest contributors to polution, from dumping old products and from extra production due to people having to buy new. My currwnt phone works great and would rather repair than buy new when there is no need. Manufacurers are fighting this out of greed and not with the worlds interests at heart, particularly as devices are increasingly built to fail over time. Look at how many people bought multiple xbox 360's. A right to repair and modify is an implicit right of ownership. Otherwise it is a rental, in which case those renting out the product are accountable for mantainence. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Sign up now close The week in security: the CISO’s role evolves as WikiLeaks shares CIA hacking techniques David Braue (CSO Online) on 13 March, 2017 11:46 0 - - - - print email Taking on the role of the CISO can be a steep learning curve, particularly when it happens in the wake of a large cybersecurity incident. This, as cybersecurity breach posterchild Target appointed a new CISO. The role of the CISO was one of numerous cybersecurity themes at the Cisco Live conference in Melbourne, where cybersecurity was a high-visibility element as the company extended its capabilities in the area. There were notes that many attackers are now part of large organisations whose professionalism may exceed that of their targets, and the observation from Australia’s peak cybersecurity administrator that security investment and work is exploding this year thanks to the government’s renewed interest in the area. And some at the event were wondering why Australian companies aren’t buying more Australian information-security products. Researchers ran an extensive study of how social-engineering scams exploit social media, even as a US mass-marketing company publicly exposed its list of 1.36 billion emails, many cross-referenced with other information. The US government is so keen to keep its hacking techniques secret that it dropped a child pornography case to avoid having to disclose the way it caught the defendant. Wikileaks filled in some of the vacuum with a massive dump of the CIA’s hacking techniques – which include hacks of Android and TVs, raising eyebrows and sending companies scrambling to re-evaluate their security postures. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange said the CIA had lost control of its cyberweapon documents well before they were published online, saying that it would share the tools with Apple and other technology companies – although some wondered whether they can use it. Intel Security released its own tool to check whether users’ EFI subsystems have been compromised by rootkits. Antivirus vendors also moved to take advantage of the CIA malware leak, which will allow them to determine whether a particular organisation has been hacked by the CIA. Apple said it has already fixed most of the iOS exploits detailed in the CIA leak. Analysis of the documents suggested that the NSA and CIA were behind the Equation espionage group, even as Wikileaks said might help technology vendors disarm the tools detailed in the leaks. Speaking of bad security postures, consumer-advocacy group Consumer Reports announced it would start reviewing consumer Internet of Things (IoT) products on their data security and privacy performance, enlisting the help of an ex-Google cybersecurity expert to warn people about potential security risks. A US Senate resolution moved to roll back privacy rules – introduced just last October – for broadband service providers, even as a US senator probed the maker of the hacked CloudPets smart toy. Android got patches for 35 critical vulnerabilities, while Firefox 52 dropped support for Java plug-ins and expanded its HTTP ‘not secure’ warnings. Read more Cisco Live: Why aren’t Australian companies buying Australian infosec? Also not secure is Internet voting, according to the French government, which has banned Internet voting in its upcoming presidential elections because of the “extremely elevated threat of cyberattack”. Hackers exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts to compromise corporate Web servers, while one security expert warned that risk management requires one to start with the basics. A security hole in the Confide messaging app, reportedly popular amongst White House staff, exposed user details. Some security experts were evaluating the security of rival messaging tool WhatsApp, even as a cryptographer advised that those concerned about secure communications are best advised to use an iPhone to communicate. The Church of England had great success in baselining its system to quickly pick up on ransomware attacks before they caused serious damage, while Blackhawk Network got better visibility into threats with the Darktrace Enterprise Immune System. Researchers linked the Shamoon cyberattack in Saudi Arabia to a new attack in Europe, even as the CIA data leak suggested that a CIA ‘false flag’ team had repurposed the Shamoon data wiper. This, as FBI head James Comey railed against strong encryption and said that citizens have never had guarantees of “absolute privacy”.

My bag contains [my] make up kit, hand lotion and hand sanitizer aside from my other personal belongings like wallet and phone. Nothing beats clean hands! I guess a bag must basically contain things that are useful for our daily activities.  What electronic gadgets are you currently using? For my laptop I am using a Macbook and an iPhone for my phone. It’s a fact that Apple products have always have the good quality and more advanced.  What’s inside your closet? Mostly my dresses from different collections are the major stuff inside my closet. I like glamour office attires, which I can also wear for evening events. I am also into shoes and handbags which occupy the most space in my closet. What is your style of clothing? Talking about my style cannot be defined in one corner. We have to be flexible. For me, it depends on the weather and occasion. Living in Dubai you can see me with fit clothes during summer and you can see me with fur during winter and sportswear every morning as I hit the gym or if I am just at home spending my time painting and  when I am with my music,  I  just merely wear my rugged clothes. What clothing brands do you think closely fit your sense of fashion?  I don’t really have a clothing brand in particular, when I shop, I visit every store and find something that fits my body type. My principle is this: If it looks good on you, buy it! No matter what brand it is, as I shop depending on what makes me look good not just the hype.  That would help you boost confidence.  What is your favorite perfume?  Chloé Eu du Parfum, it has a fresh powdery floral scent which makes me feel happy and boost my self-esteem and femininity. What is your favorite brand of shoes?  I both like Louboutin and Valentino.  I invest in a pair of good quality shoes as those brands produce comfortable shoes, more durable and they last longer especially [since] I always love to wear heels so I need to have a good quality pair of shoes. Are you a shopaholic?  Yes, I was before to be honest, but when I started earning from my own sweat, I intended not to, but I treat myself once in a while. We all have to admit that buying something new (new car, new dress, new shoes, new bags) makes us feel great but it’s only passive. For as long as you are not spending beyond your budget, then that’s totally fine!  What inspires or influences you to buy an item? I normally buy stuff for my basic needs or replacing old items but if I see great deals on the stores, I don’t want to miss the opportunity!              What brands do you trust for your skin care? I use SK-II and Shiseido for my face. I am very careful when buying products for my skin especially since I have acne prone skin. That’s why these two brands stand out for me. I also use Nivea shower gel and Nivea Lotion ever since. What is a Branded Pinoy for you? Branded Pinoy for me is someone who has a positive outlook in life. Our brains are wired to find things we are looking for. If you are always cynical or waiting for things to go wrong, then your life will reflect that. On the other hand, having a positive outlook in life will bring you joy and provide you with inspiration when you least expect it.  Facebook Comments Website Comments free pron March 6th, 2017 Reply HL5bYg Pretty!

(New York Times) the brief Would you text or tell the kettle to boil. Photo: Wikimedia Commons TechnologyAI Smart condo conundrum – Talk to appliances, or text them? Today dimming the lights in a smart home is done by talking to a small Wifi speaker, but now a Singapore firm offers a messaging service By Reuters March 13, 2017 8:48 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 In today’s so-called smart home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected speaker, such as Amazon’s Echo or Google’s Home. This voice-first market – combining voice with artificial intelligence (AI) – barely existed in 2014. This year, Voice Labs, a consultancy, expects 24.5 million appliances to be shipped. Other big tech firms have their own plans: Apple is taking its Siri voice assistant beyond its mobile devices to PCs, cars, and the home; Baidu last month bought Raven, billed as China’s answer to Amazon’s Alexa intelligent personal assistant; and Samsung Electronics plans to incorporate Viv, its newly acquired virtual assistant, into its phones and home appliances. But not everyone thinks the future of communicating with the so-called internet of things – the interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects – needs to be vocal. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was working on Jarvis, his own voice-powered AI home automation, and found he preferred communicating by text because, he wrote, “mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me.” And several major appliance makers have turned to a small Singapore firm, Unified Inbox, which offers a service that can handle ordinary text messages and pass them on to appliances. With your home added to the contacts list on, say, WhatsApp, a quick text message can “start the coffee machine; turn on the vacuum cleaner at 5pm; or preheat the oven to 200 degrees at 6.30pm.” “Think of it as a universal translator between the languages that machines speak … and us humans,” said Toby Ruckert, a German former concert pianist and now Unified Inbox’s chief executive. The company is just a small player, funded by private investors, but Ruckert says its technology is patent-backed, has been several years in the making, and has customers that include half of the world’s smart appliance makers, such as Bosch. Unified Inbox connects the devices on behalf of the manufacturer, while the consumer can add their appliance by messaging its serial number to a special user account or phone number. It so far supports more than 20 of the most popular messaging apps, as well SMS and Twitter, and controls appliances from ovens to kettles. Other home appliances being tested include locks, garage openers, window blinds, toasters and garden sprinklers, says Ruckert. “People aren’t going to want a different interface for all the different appliances in their home,” says Jason Jameson, of IBM, which is pairing its Watson AI supercomputer with Unified Inbox to better understand user messages. They will this week demonstrate the service working with a Samsung robot cleaner. “The common denominator is the smartphone, and even more common is the messaging app,” Jameson notes. “Trojan horse” There’s another reason, Ruckert says, why more than half of the world’s smart appliance manufacturers have signed up. They’re worried the big tech companies’ one-appliance-controls-all approach will relegate them to commodity players, connecting to Alexa or another dominant platform, or being cast aside if Amazon moves into making its own household appliances. “Our customers are quite afraid of the likes of Amazon,” Ruckert said. “Having a Trojan horse in a customer’s home, like Echo, that they must integrate with to stay competitive is a nightmare for them.” An Amazon spokesperson said the company was “excited by the early response by smart home device manufacturers and even more excited by the customer response,” but declined to speculate about future plans. A spokesperson for Bosch said no single company can knit the Internet of Things together, so “there is a need to collaborate and establish ecosystems,” such as working with Unified Inbox. Already the race is on to incorporate other services into these home hubs. Amazon allows third parties to develop apps, or “skills,” for Alexa. It has more than 10,000 of these, with many added in just the past three months. Most are developed by firms using Amazon’s software toolkit, and range from telling jokes to ordering food. And Amazon makes it easy for other hardware makers to incorporate Alexa into their appliances, increasing its reach. Chinese device maker Lenovo has embedded Alexa in its speakers, while General Electric has it in a lamp – meaning users can control these devices by voice, and use them to order products from Amazon. LG Electronics and Huawei are also working on Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon said. Text messaging, though, may yet break down those walls. As Zuckerberg noted, the volume of text messages is growing much faster than the number of voice calls. “This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice, and will need a private messaging interface as well,” he says. Even smarter Some companies are already looking further ahead, and doing away with the need for any human instruction – whether by voice or text – by making machines smarter at learning our habits and anticipating them. LG, for example, is using deep learning to make its appliances understand and avoid objects in a room, or fill an ice-tray based on a user’s cold drink habits. At Unified Inbox, Ruckert looks ahead to being able to communicate not only with one’s own appliances, but with machines elsewhere. Bosch executives in Singapore, for example, have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how many people were in a particular room. Ruckert is also working with Singapore’s Nanyang Polytechnic to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital equipment attached to patients. And smart appliance entrepreneur James Dyson said in a recent interview that the future lies in what he calls “highly intelligent automation.” “For me, the future is making everything happen for you without you being particularly involved in it.” For a graphic on How Unification Engine works, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/TECH-IOT-MESSAGE/0100403J07F/unibox.jpg The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Share Tweet Linkedin Email Technology AI Business Singapore Amazon Google Apple Samsung Electronics Southeast Asia Comments More on this topic Apple’s Siri is learning a new Chinese dialect: Shanghainese Reuters China’s Artifical Intelligence boom SupChina, The Atlantic Baidu furthers AI push with acquisition of Raven Tech startup TechCrunch EVEN MORE asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin asia times Facebook Twitter Google plus Linkedin Explore Main China Northeast Asia Insights Southeast Asia World Politics Business Culture Trending Topics #South Asia #Japan #Middle East #India #Koreas #South China Sea #Sport About About Asia Times Contact Us Advertise with Us Write for Us Terms of Use Privacy The DailyBrief Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox © 2017 Asia Times Holdings Limited, All Rights Reserved.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Big software companies like Adobe, Google, and Microsoft have all begun modifying their most widely used applications to include support for the Touch Bar display on Apple’s latest MacBook Pro laptops. Some indie developers have done the same thing. But many, many Mac apps don’t let you do anything with the Touch Bar, five months after Apple unveiled its 2016 MacBook Pro and introduced tools and guidelines to help developers build for its Touch Bar. That’s about to change. See, many developers rely on open-source software called Electron to operate desktop versions of their existing web applications. Earlier this week, the team behind Electron released a beta version of the software with new features that will let developers add Touch Bar functionality into existing Electron-powered apps. “The new Touch Bar API allows you to add buttons, labels, popovers, color pickers, sliders, and spacers. These elements can be dynamically updated and also emit events when they are interacted with,” Kevin Sawicki, a developer at GitHub who contributed to the additions, wrote in a blog post. Electron is among the most popular projects on GitHub, and, sure enough, GitHub is the company behind it. Electron serves as the underlying framework for another piece of GitHub open-source software, the Atom text editor. Now Atom could very well get Touch Bar support soon. The same thing could happen to Microsoft’s competing Visual Studio Code text editor. Altogether, more than 300 apps are built with Electron. These include Basecamp 3, Brave, Discord, Ghost, Hyper, Docker’s Kitematic, Mattermost, Nylas N1, Automattic’s Simplenote, Slack, Tidal, Tweeten, WordPress.com, and Yhat Rodeo. Someone has already shared a plugin that brings Touch Bar support to Hyper. In other words, get ready to see the Touch Bar become useful in more and more of the apps you use on the Touch Bar everyday.

For those unfamiliar, this is an OLED strip that replaces the row of function keys and also doubles up as an extension of your keyboard. Now for owners of the laptop who are hoping to get more functionality out of their Touch Bar, you will be pleased to learn that Microsoft has recently updated its Skype app for macOS where support for the Touch Bar is now available. What this means is that users will now be able to see a profile photo of who they’re chatting with, the ability to mute our hang up calls, and start/end video. There isn’t that much options offered at the moment apart from the ones we mentioned, but presumably it could change in the future as Microsoft thinks up of more ways to take advantage of the feature. Recently we’ve started to see more developers offer support for the hardware feature, such as Google’s Chrome and also the Microsoft Office suite of productivity apps. We expect that over time more apps will eventually add their support for Touch Bar, and given that the laptop is barely half a year old, we suppose it is understandable that there isn’t a lot of compatibility at the moment.

Print Story X Print Story Editorial March 11, 2017 Share Advertisement Brave new world The dark world painted by George Orwell in his classic novel ‘1984’ has been with us for many years, notably after 9/11 when surveillance of private data by US intelligence agencies was stepped up. Since the US National Security Agency (NSA) leaks in 2013, we have known that our privacy is under threat from a network of state agencies. Moreover, after last year’s tussle between Apple and the FBI over the ability to hack iPhones, there is little doubt that spy agencies have been looking for loopholes in our electronic devices. While we may have thought that spy agencies still had some catching up to do, a new WikiLeaks release of CIA documents has revealed that these agencies have penetrated our lives more than we could have imagined. The thousands of leaked documents have catalogued the CIA’s cyber-spying techniques till early 2016. Most worryingly, they reveal that the CIA has been able to find a way to hack people’s smart TV sets to listen in to the conversations they are having in their private lives. While the current technique requires fitting an actual bug to the device, there is no doubt that this revelation will set alarm bells ringing in the industry. Similarly, while the CIA still cannot decrypt encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal, it has been able to find ways through Android and IOS operating systems. Keywords such as ‘terrorism’, and now we are told ‘Islam’, have been searched for by US agencies in the apparent hope of detecting militants. This goes far beyond the issue of personal privacy. It leads us into a world which holds multiple dangers for all kinds of people and leaves them open to action from government, visa issuing authorities, employers and other groups. The fact that social protest and political actions all over the world are increasingly organised over social media makes it still more tempting for agencies to pry into this world. What is heartening is that the leaks confirm that there are still conscientious objectors, such as Edward Snowden, who are willing to step up and tell us when these agencies overstep their limits. The trouble, however is that – like the NSA leaks before – it seems no one is really paying attention. The digitisation of our lives has continued to go on unchecked. The CIA has attempted to claim that the leaks do it harm, but the only harm possible is to us – ordinary citizens. The NSA leaks confirmed that Big Brother was listening in to our every conversation. The CIA leaks confirm something far more sinister: Big Brother can actually control our conversations. There is the possibility that evidence could simply be planted if the CIA is able to control a digital device. Alarmingly, some tech giants are reported to have entered into agreements with intelligence agencies to assist them in their actions. Others such as Apple and WhatsApp maintain that they are making every effort to ensure privacy. The internet has offered human beings much freedom in the current age. But it has also opened up new ways for others to invade our privacy and our rights. The current leak may not go beyond a certain level of classification but it has opened us up to the scary new digital world we have to contend with. Unfortunately, it is hard to see any real change coming at a time when technology allows barriers set up to guard privacy to be broken through.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Consensus on military courts as demands accepted Govt will do all to end blasphemy: Nisar Trump’s second bid for Muslim ban blocked Balochistan to become tiger of Pakistan: PM ECP dismisses references against Imran, Tareen View more... see all opinions Opinion Aijaz Zaka Syed UP is not the end of the world Nadir Hassan The Haqqani affair Shahzad Tahir To potential legislators Shahzad Chaudhry South Asian politics: coming of age?

Private browsing is a way of masking your online search habits and history, allowing you to surf the internet without your browser saving data to onto your computer. Although it hides superficial search data, it lacks the secure encryption of a VPN and should be considered only as a means of preventing other users from seeing what pages you have visited. These capabilities are built into everyday web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple's Safari, and Mozilla Firefox, which normally involves opening a new window in a mode that prevents data capture. Depending on the browser you use, the private browsing tool will have a different moniker - Google Chrome has its 'Incognito' mode while Internet Explorer uses 'InPrivate'. Here's our guide to private browsing and how to enable the tools on every major browser. Google Chrome As we mentioned above, Google Chrome calls its private browsing mode Incognito Mode. This can be accessed by simply selecting “New Incognito Window” from the menu when in Chrome. You’ll be able to tell you're using it by the "secret agent" icon in the top left corner of the window. In Incognito Mode, Chrome won't keep track of the pages you visit, the data you enter into forms, or any searches you submit. However, it’s worth noting that Incognito mode only prevents Chrome from saving your site visit activity. It won't stop other sources from seeing what sites you’ve visited, including: your ISP; your employer (if you're using a work computer); and the websites you visit themselves. If you use Chrome’s Incognito Mode to download files, the browser won't remember what files you download, but those files will stay on your computer after you close the Incognito tab. You'll have to manually delete them from your hard drive if you don’t want anyone to see them. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge Internet Explorer and Edge’s private browsing mode comes in the form of InPrivate browsing. To access this, select the More icon, which is displayed as three small dots in the top right of the window, and then select New InPrivate window. As with Chrome, the same search history isn’t saved, such as temporary internet files like cookies, browsing history, form data, and downloaded files and bookmarks stick around even after you close the InPrivate window. Microsoft's browsers also disable any third-party toolbars you might have installed when you start an InPrivate session. Mozilla Firefox Mozilla’s private browsing feature in FireFox is simply called ‘Private Browsing mode’ and offers the same privacy tools as Chrome and Edge. However, FireFox offers an additional tool that others browsers don’t to make browsing even more safe, and that’s called Tracking Protection. This is said to prevent companies from tracking your browsing history across multiple sites so they can’t record your browsing habits. There are two ways to open a new Private Window in FireFox. You can either click the menu button, which is presented as three horizontal bars in the top right corner of the window, and then click New Private Window. Or you can open a link in a new Private Window by right-clicking on any link and choose Open Link in New Private Window from the context menu. Once in Private Browsing mode, the browser window will have a purple mask at the top. Safari To enable Private Browsing in Apple’s Safari browser, simply go to File > New Private Window. A window that’s using Private Browsing has a dark Smart Search field with white text. Safari's private browsing mode also removes temporary files when you close the window. Browsing history, form data, and cookies are all wiped by default. Opera Opera is a noteworthy browser when it comes to surfing privately on the web because, unlike its rivals, its Private Mode offers a VPN connection to add another layer of secrecy to your browsing activities. It's not a silver bullet in keeping your activities totally private, but it does provide additional protection. To enable this feature, you can either go through the menu: File > New Private Window. Or, you can use keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+N for Windows and ⌘+Shift+N for Mac.

In today's so-called smart home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected speaker, such as Amazon's Echo or Google's Home. Posted 13 Mar 2017 07:56 CEO of Unified Inbox Toby Ruckert demonstrates how he uses his smartphone to control electrical appliances in a simulation software in Singapore March 3, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SINGAPORE: In today's so-called smart home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected speaker, such as Amazon's Echo or Google's Home. This voice-first market - combining voice with artificial intelligence (AI) - barely existed in 2014. This year, Voice Labs, a consultancy, expects 24.5 million appliances to be shipped. Other big tech firms have their own plans: Apple is taking its Siri voice assistant beyond its mobile devices to PCs, cars, and the home; Baidu last month bought Raven, billed as China's answer to Amazon's Alexa intelligent personal assistant; and Samsung Electronics plans to incorporate Viv, its newly acquired virtual assistant, into its phones and home appliances. But not everyone thinks the future of communicating with the Internet of Things needs to be vocal. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was working on Jarvis, his own voice-powered AI home automation, and found he preferred communicating by text because, he wrote, "mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me." And several major appliance makers have turned to a small Singapore firm, Unified Inbox, which offers a service that can handle ordinary text messages and pass them on to appliances. With your home added to the contacts list on, say, WhatsApp, a quick text message can "start the coffee machine"; "turn on the vacuum cleaner at 5 p.m."; or "preheat the oven to 200 degrees at 6.30 p.m." "Think of it as a universal translator between the languages that machines speak ... and us humans," said Toby Ruckert, a German former concert pianist and now Unified Inbox's CEO. The company is just a small player, funded by private investors, but Ruckert says its technology is patent-backed, has been several years in the making, and has customers that include half of the world's smart appliance makers, such as Bosch. Unified Inbox connects the devices on behalf of the manufacturer, while the consumer can add their appliance by messaging its serial number to a special user account or phone number. It so far supports more than 20 of the most popular messaging apps, as well SMS and Twitter, and controls appliances from ovens to kettles. Other home appliances being tested include locks, garage openers, window blinds, toasters and garden sprinklers, says Ruckert. "People aren't going to want a different interface for all the different appliances in their home," says Jason Jameson, of IBM, which is pairing its Watson AI supercomputer with Unified Inbox to better understand user messages. They will this week demonstrate the service working with a Samsung Robot Cleaner. "The common denominator is the smartphone, and even more common is the messaging app," Jameson notes. "TROJAN HORSE" There's another reason, Ruckert says, why more than half of the world's smart appliance manufacturers have signed up. They're worried the big tech companies' one-appliance-controls-all approach will relegate them to commodity players, connecting to Alexa or another dominant platform, or being cast aside if Amazon moves into making its own household appliances. "Our customers are quite afraid of the likes of Amazon," Ruckert said. "Having a Trojan horse in a customer's home, like Echo, that they must integrate with to stay competitive is a nightmare for them." An Amazon spokesperson said the company was "excited by the early response by smart home device manufacturers and even more excited by the customer response," but declined to speculate about future plans. A spokesperson for Bosch said no single company can knit the Internet of Things together, so "there is a need to collaborate and establish ecosystems," such as working with Unified Inbox. Already the race is on to incorporate other services into these home hubs. Amazon allows third parties to develop apps, or "skills", for Alexa. It has more than 10,000 of these, with many added in just the past three months. Most are developed by firms using Amazon's software toolkit and range from telling jokes to ordering food. And Amazon makes it easy for other hardware makers to incorporate Alexa into their appliances, increasing its reach. Chinese device maker Lenovo has embedded Alexa in its speakers, while General Electric has it in a lamp - meaning users can control these devices by voice, and use them to order products from Amazon. LG Electronics and Huawei are also working on Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon said. Text messaging, though, may yet break down those walls. As Zuckerberg noted, the volume of text messages is growing much faster than the number of voice calls. "This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice, and will need a private messaging interface as well," he says. EVEN SMARTER Some companies are already looking further ahead, and doing away with the need for any human instruction - whether by voice or text - by making machines smarter at learning our habits and anticipating them. LG, for example, is using deep learning to make its appliances understand and avoid objects in a room, or fill an ice tray based on a user's cold drink habits. At Unified Inbox, Ruckert looks ahead to being able to communicate not only with one's own appliances but with machines elsewhere. Bosch executives in Singapore, for example, have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how many people were in a particular room. Ruckert is also working with Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital equipment attached to patients. And smart appliance entrepreneur James Dyson said in a recent interview that the future lies in what he calls "highly intelligent automation". "For me, the future is making everything happen for you without you being particularly involved in it." - Reuters/mz Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top
_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Flirting with the Dark Side Anthony Caruana 13 March, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Over the last few weeks, as regular readers will recall, I’ve been using a Windows computer for some of my work. As part of that, I’ve also been using Google’s Chrome and Gmail software so that I can enjoy a consistent user experience across all my devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows PC). This has not been smooth sailing. Part of the problem lies with Apple’s stubbornness in not letting me choose what applications I’d prefer to use on my iOS devices. Setting Chrome as the default browser for all links can’t be done in iOS unless I acquiesce to Google’s will and use all their applications all the time. But this is not possible in my experience. Why I can make those decisions on my Mac and not on iOS, where the applications are supposedly curated and checked to ensure they are safe is a mystery to me. In short, Apple will be getting their own way soon as I move back to using Mail and Safari on my iPhone and iPad Pro. On my Windows PC, my journey has been quite rocky. I suspect the issues lie in more than one area. After finding a free (and I assume legal as I didn’t use a VPN or do anything tricky) stream of the Australia vs India test cricket, my computer mysteriously shut down. On restarting, there was an error message telling me the computer could not restart and that I was basically down to using a recovery disk or USB to get started. Naturally, that was something I didn’t have handy. The PC I’m using is not new. I purchased it when Windows 7 was the thing to have in the Windows world and it has been upgraded through to Windows 10. To cut to the chase, I created a recovery USB stick, restarted with it and repaired my installation. But the next morning the same problem recurred so I cut my losses and decided to fully reinstall Windows 10. What have I learned? I’ve had the occasional Mac curl up its toes on me. I’ve always had a recovery option, on a USB stick handy, just in case. I now have the same thing for Windows. And every now and then, a fresh installation is not a bad thing. With the Mac, we’ve become accustomed to annual updates and we simply layer them one on top of the other. It is inevitable, particularly if you’re a bit of a tinkerer, that you’ll accumulate some cruft that makes your computer run less than at its best. What’s your maintenance plan? Do you keep a recovery disk or USB stick handy just in case? Do you regularly reinstall macOS (or OS X as it was known) every year or two?

    By Jeremy WagstaffSINGAPORE, March 13 (Reuters) - In today's so-called smart
home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the
kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected
speaker, such as Amazon's <AMZN.O> Echo or Google's <GOOGL.O>
Home.
    This voice-first market - combining voice with artificial
intelligence (AI) - barely existed in 2014. This year, Voice
Labs, a consultancy, expects 24.5 million appliances to be
shipped.
    Other big tech firms have their own plans: Apple <AAPL.O> is
taking its Siri voice assistant beyond its mobile devices to
PCs, cars, and the home; Baidu <BIDU.O> last month bought Raven,
billed as China's answer to Amazon's Alexa intelligent personal
assistant; and Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> plans to
incorporate Viv, its newly acquired virtual assistant, into its
phones and home appliances.
    But not everyone thinks the future of communicating with the
Internet of Things needs to be vocal.
    Facebook <FB.O> founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was
working on Jarvis, his own voice-powered AI home automation, and
found he preferred communicating by text because, he wrote,
"mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me."
    And several major appliance makers have turned to a small
Singapore firm, Unified Inbox, which offers a service that can
handle ordinary text messages and pass them on to appliances.
    With your home added to the contacts list on, say, WhatsApp,
a quick text message can "start the coffee machine"; "turn on
the vacuum cleaner at 5 p.m."; or "preheat the oven to 200
degrees at 6.30 p.m."
    "Think of it as a universal translator between the languages
that machines speak ... and us humans," said Toby Ruckert, a
German former concert pianist and now Unified Inbox's CEO.
    The company is just a small player, funded by private
investors, but Ruckert says its technology is patent-backed, has
been several years in the making, and has customers that include
half of the world's smart appliance makers, such as Bosch
[ROBG.UL].
    Unified Inbox connects the devices on behalf of the
manufacturer, while the consumer can add their appliance by
messaging its serial number to a special user account or phone
number. It so far supports more than 20 of the most popular
messaging apps, as well SMS and Twitter <TWTR.N>, and controls
appliances from ovens to kettles. Other home appliances being
tested include locks, garage openers, window blinds, toasters
and garden sprinklers, says Ruckert.
    "People aren't going to want a different interface for all
the different appliances in their home," says Jason Jameson, of
IBM <IBM.N>, which is pairing its Watson AI supercomputer with
Unified Inbox to better understand user messages. They will this
week demonstrate the service working with a Samsung Robot
Cleaner.
    "The common denominator is the smartphone, and even more
common is the messaging app," Jameson notes.

    "TROJAN HORSE"
    There's another reason, Ruckert says, why more than half of
the world's smart appliance manufacturers have signed up.
    They're worried the big tech companies'
one-appliance-controls-all approach will relegate them to
commodity players, connecting to Alexa or another dominant
platform, or being cast aside if Amazon moves into making its
own household appliances.
    "Our customers are quite afraid of the likes of Amazon,"
Ruckert said. "Having a Trojan horse in a customer's home, like
Echo, that they must integrate with to stay competitive is a
nightmare for them."
    An Amazon spokesperson said the company was "excited by the
early response by smart home device manufacturers and even more
excited by the customer response," but declined to speculate
about future plans.
    A spokesperson for Bosch said no single company can knit the
Internet of Things together, so "there is a need to collaborate
and establish ecosystems," such as working with Unified Inbox.
    Already the race is on to incorporate other services into
these home hubs.
    Amazon allows third parties to develop apps, or "skills",
for Alexa. It has more than 10,000 of these, with many added in
just the past three months. Most are developed by firms using
Amazon's software toolkit, and range from telling jokes to
ordering food.
    And Amazon makes it easy for other hardware makers to
incorporate Alexa into their appliances, increasing its reach.
    Chinese device maker Lenovo <0992.HK> has embedded Alexa in
its speakers, while General Electric <GE.N> has it in a lamp -
meaning users can control these devices by voice, and use them
to order products from Amazon. LG Electronics <066570.KS> and
Huawei are also working on Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon said.
    Text messaging, though, may yet break down those walls.
    As Zuckerberg noted, the volume of text messages is growing
much faster than the number of voice calls. "This suggests that
future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice, and will
need a private messaging interface as well," he says.

    EVEN SMARTER
    Some companies are already looking further ahead, and doing
away with the need for any human instruction - whether by voice
or text - by making machines smarter at learning our habits and
anticipating them.
    LG, for example, is using deep learning to make its
appliances understand and avoid objects in a room, or fill an
ice-tray based on a user's cold drink habits.
    At Unified Inbox, Ruckert looks ahead to being able to
communicate not only with one's own appliances, but with
machines elsewhere. Bosch executives in Singapore, for example,
have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how
many people were in a particular room.
    Ruckert is also working with Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic
to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital
equipment attached to patients.
    And smart appliance entrepreneur James Dyson said in a
recent interview that the future lies in what he calls "highly
intelligent automation".
    "For me, the future is making everything happen for you
without you being particularly involved in it."

The thousands of documents published on March 6, dubbed “Vault 7”, describe CIA programs and tools that are capable of hacking into Apple and Android mobile phones. By hacking into entire phones, the CIA is then reportedly able to bypass encrypted messenger programs such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp. However, contrary to many news reports, the documents do not show the CIA has developed tools to hack these encrypted services themselves. The documents also outline a CIA and British intelligence program called “Weeping Angel”, through which the spy agency can hack into a Samsung smart television and turn it into a surveillance device that records audio conversations, even when it appears to be off. Other documents describe ways to hack into Skype, Wi-Fi networks, PDFs and commercial antivirus programs. The leak also shows the CIA has reportedly looked for ways to hack into cars and trucks, which WikiLeaks said “would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations”. Other documents outline how the CIA has used the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany, as a covert base to spy on Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The release totals 7818 web pages and 943 attachments, which WikiLeaks says comes from the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Some of the material was redacted by WikiLeaks to avoid releasing the actual computer code used in the programs. WikiLeaks says the release is only the first batch of many more secret CIA documents. The CIA has refused to comment on the authenticity of the documents. But at least one anonymous government official told The New York Times the documents were real. Another a former intelligence officer told the NYT the code names used in the documents appeared to be accurate. WikiLeaks did not reveal the source of the leak, but did say the source “wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons”. On Twitter, NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden said: “The CIA reports show the [US government] developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open. Reckless beyond words.” [Reprinted from Democracy Now!] 1129 International News Featured Content Mike Baird’s hopeless quest to build 'respect' for National Australia Bank "Former NSW Premier Mike Baird has enthusiastically accepted a job at the National Australia Bank as chief customer officer, in order to spend less Read more Donate now Get connected YouTube Green Left Radio Twitter Facebook RSS Activist calendar March « » S M T W T F S       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31     Sections australia world analysis culture General activist calendar back issues contact subscribe donate Sites Links Journal Resistance books Socialist Alliance About Green Left — the need for alternative media In these days of growing media concentration, Green Left Weekly is a proudly independent voice committed to human and civil rights, global peace and environmental sustainability, democracy and equality.

Bosch executives in Singapore, for example, have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how many people were in a particular room. Ruckert is also working with Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital equipment attached to patients. And smart appliance entrepreneur James Dyson said in a recent interview that the future lies in what he calls "highly intelligent automation". "For me, the future is making everything happen for you without you being particularly involved in it."

Higher prices were seen in all sub-groups except meat, poultry, and fish (down 2.0 percent). Fruit and vegetables were up 7.7 percent and grocery food was up 2.3 percent. Vegetable prices were up 12 percent, led by higher prices for carrots, kūmara, and tomatoes. Carrot prices are at an all-time high, up 51 percent since February 2016. One kilo of carrots cost $3.53 in February 2017, compared with $2.34 a year ago. Apple prices also contributed to the large movement, up 32 percent from February last year. However, apple prices in February were down 13 percent from January. Prices for dairy products also increased. Butter prices were up 33 percent compared with February 2016, and 13 percent from January 2017. “500g of the cheapest available butter cost on average $4.58 this month, compared with $4.06 last month and $3.45 a year ago,” Mr Haigh said. Food prices rose 0.2 percent in the month, compared with a 2.8 percent increase in January. With seasonal adjustment, the cost of food rose 0.8 percent in February 2017. Higher prices for fruit and vegetables (up 1.8 percent) were offset by lower prices for meat, poultry, and fish (down 1.5 percent). Seasonal influences on fruit and vegetable prices were apparent as we move out of summer. Increases were seen for summer produce, led by strawberries and lettuce, and decreases were seen for end-of-summer produce, led by apples and potatoes.

REUTERS/Edgar Su 2/3 left right CEO of Unified Inbox Toby Ruckert demonstrates how he uses his smartphone to control electrical appliances in a simulation software in Singapore March 3, 2017. REUTERS/Edgar Su 3/3 By Jeremy Wagstaff | SINGAPORE SINGAPORE In today's so-called smart home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected speaker, such as Amazon's (AMZN.O) Echo or Google's (GOOGL.O) Home. This voice-first market - combining voice with artificial intelligence (AI) - barely existed in 2014. This year, Voice Labs, a consultancy, expects 24.5 million appliances to be shipped. Other big tech firms have their own plans: Apple (AAPL.O) is taking its Siri voice assistant beyond its mobile devices to PCs, cars, and the home; Baidu (BIDU.O) last month bought Raven, billed as China's answer to Amazon's Alexa intelligent personal assistant; and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plans to incorporate Viv, its newly acquired virtual assistant, into its phones and home appliances. But not everyone thinks the future of communicating with the Internet of Things needs to be vocal. Facebook (FB.O) founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was working on Jarvis, his own voice-powered AI home automation, and found he preferred communicating by text because, he wrote, "mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me." And several major appliance makers have turned to a small Singapore firm, Unified Inbox, which offers a service that can handle ordinary text messages and pass them on to appliances. With your home added to the contacts list on, say, WhatsApp, a quick text message can "start the coffee machine"; "turn on the vacuum cleaner at 5 p.m."; or "preheat the oven to 200 degrees at 6.30 p.m." "Think of it as a universal translator between the languages that machines speak ... and us humans," said Toby Ruckert, a German former concert pianist and now Unified Inbox's CEO. The company is just a small player, funded by private investors, but Ruckert says its technology is patent-backed, has been several years in the making, and has customers that include half of the world's smart appliance makers, such as Bosch [ROBG.UL]. Unified Inbox connects the devices on behalf of the manufacturer, while the consumer can add their appliance by messaging its serial number to a special user account or phone number. It so far supports more than 20 of the most popular messaging apps, as well SMS and Twitter (TWTR.N), and controls appliances from ovens to kettles. Other home appliances being tested include locks, garage openers, window blinds, toasters and garden sprinklers, says Ruckert. "People aren't going to want a different interface for all the different appliances in their home," says Jason Jameson, of IBM (IBM.N), which is pairing its Watson AI supercomputer with Unified Inbox to better understand user messages. They will this week demonstrate the service working with a Samsung Robot Cleaner. "The common denominator is the smartphone, and even more common is the messaging app," Jameson notes. "TROJAN HORSE" There's another reason, Ruckert says, why more than half of the world's smart appliance manufacturers have signed up. They're worried the big tech companies' one-appliance-controls-all approach will relegate them to commodity players, connecting to Alexa or another dominant platform, or being cast aside if Amazon moves into making its own household appliances. "Our customers are quite afraid of the likes of Amazon," Ruckert said. "Having a Trojan horse in a customer's home, like Echo, that they must integrate with to stay competitive is a nightmare for them." An Amazon spokesperson said the company was "excited by the early response by smart home device manufacturers and even more excited by the customer response," but declined to speculate about future plans. A spokesperson for Bosch said no single company can knit the Internet of Things together, so "there is a need to collaborate and establish ecosystems," such as working with Unified Inbox. Already the race is on to incorporate other services into these home hubs. Amazon allows third parties to develop apps, or "skills", for Alexa. It has more than 10,000 of these, with many added in just the past three months. Most are developed by firms using Amazon's software toolkit, and range from telling jokes to ordering food. And Amazon makes it easy for other hardware makers to incorporate Alexa into their appliances, increasing its reach. Chinese device maker Lenovo (0992.HK) has embedded Alexa in its speakers, while General Electric (GE.N) has it in a lamp - meaning users can control these devices by voice, and use them to order products from Amazon. LG Electronics (066570.KS) and Huawei are also working on Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon said. Text messaging, though, may yet break down those walls. As Zuckerberg noted, the volume of text messages is growing much faster than the number of voice calls. "This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice, and will need a private messaging interface as well," he says. EVEN SMARTER Some companies are already looking further ahead, and doing away with the need for any human instruction - whether by voice or text - by making machines smarter at learning our habits and anticipating them. LG, for example, is using deep learning to make its appliances understand and avoid objects in a room, or fill an ice-tray based on a user's cold drink habits. At Unified Inbox, Ruckert looks ahead to being able to communicate not only with one's own appliances, but with machines elsewhere. Bosch executives in Singapore, for example, have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how many people were in a particular room. Ruckert is also working with Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital equipment attached to patients.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 March 2017 MMSV eyes double-digit growth by daniel khoo Sia: ‘We are targeting to record double-digit growth for FY17 in both top and bottomline.’ Company makes target after rising demand from smartphone makers PETALING JAYA: MMS Ventures Bhd (MMSV) is targeting a double-digit growth for its earnings and revenue for the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2017 (FY17) after a flattish FY16, thanks to increasing demand from smartphone makers. Its chief executive officer Sia Teik Keat told StarBiz that there were “more than enough” orders for the first and second quarters so far for FY17. “We are targeting to record double-digit growth for FY17 in both top and bottomline. “We see increasing demand from smartphone manufacturers who need to refresh their products,” Sia said. “We are operating in a highly cyclical industry and it can be quite unpredictable sometimes. “For now, the smartphone manufacturers in the supply chain are needing to refresh the product space to cater for the newer smartphones that will come out later this year. “From what I understand it will be a big change from previous models,” he added. MMSV is a test equipment manufacturer which makes specialised machineries to optically and electrically test LED components that are used in various industries including smartphone manufacturing, automotive and general lighting industry. The smart devices industry constitutes about 50% of MMSV’s total orders. “In order of volume, the smart devices industry is the biggest contributor to our company followed by the automotive and general lighting segments,” he noted. “We get this semblance that the first half of the year would be good, from the orders we are receiving now. In the first and second quarter we could record topline growth of up to 20%. The third and fourth quarters are still unknown now,” Sia said. It has been widely reported that the next iteration of the Apple iPhone would have major significant changes to its exterior and interior hardware modules that could shore up additional demand for the product. Apple usually has their new product launch in the third quarter of the year. MMSV recently reported its fourth quarter FY16’s results that saw net profit growing by some 267% to RM2.53mil on the back of revenues growing to RM4.87mil from RM4.52mil a year ago. For the entire FY16, the company recorded a rather flattish performance, but bottomline still grew slightly to RM9.52mil from RM8.08mil in the previous year. In the entire FY16, toplines grew slightly to RM35.58mil from RM31.29mil. Its financial statements attributed the improved profit performance in its fourth quarter to higher gains from other operating income due to the much higher foreign exchange gains as the US dollar strengthened further against the ringgit in the fourth quarter of FY16 compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Revenue for the fourth quarter also improved as the company was able to secure higher orders from its customers as a result of increase in demand from its client’s end customers. Commenting on its results, Sia says that if these foreign exchange gains are stripped out, the net foreign exchange gain for last year would constitute to about 10% of total revenue and profit. “When the ringgit weakened we get a foreign exchange gain from that as 65-70% of our sales are quoted in the US Dollar. We are paid within 60 days of invoicing,” he says. Moving forward, the company which is now housed in the Ace Market also aims to eventually migrate to the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia. “This will give us increased exposure to more funds and investor base and it will be a good move for us. We are hoping that the move will happen by the third quarter or by the end of the year with our anticipated growth in revenue and profit,” Sia said.

She wrote: 'HAPPY 40th BIRTHDAY to the best daddy in the world!!! We [love] you so much!'

Breaking911 Home Contact News Tips Politics Crime Terrorism Video Entertainment Weather Home Business Coming Soon: A World Without Wi-Fi Business Entertainment Tech Coming Soon: A World Without Wi-Fi March 12, 2017 0 3171 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Photo Source: The Star Online The Wi-Fi icon — a dot with radio waves radiating outward — glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Intel Corp., Qualcomm and Comcast. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers — mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum — or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers — risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. LTE-U — and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA — will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 Wi-Fi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said. Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts. “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of Wi-Fi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” (c) 2017, Bloomberg · Olga Kharif Facebook Comment SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleProof daylight saving time is dumb, dangerous, and costly Next articleFlorida man pleads guilty to cross burning in couple’s yard ---- Follow Us 176,776FansLike 180,565FollowersFollow 736SubscribersSubscribe Breaking Agents Intercept Weapons, Currency at Mexico Border March 16, 2017 BREAKING: FDNY EMT Killed, Partner Critical After Maniac Steals Ambulance And...

Higher prices were seen in all sub-groups except meat, poultry, and fish (down 2.0 percent). Fruit and vegetables were up 7.7 percent and grocery food was up 2.3 percent. Vegetable prices were up 12 percent, led by higher prices for carrots, kūmara, and tomatoes. Carrot prices are at an all-time high, up 51 percent since February 2016. One kilo of carrots cost $3.53 in February 2017, compared with $2.34 a year ago. Apple prices also contributed to the large movement, up 32 percent from February last year. However, apple prices in February were down 13 percent from January. Prices for dairy products also increased. Butter prices were up 33 percent compared with February 2016, and 13 percent from January 2017. “500g of the cheapest available butter cost on average $4.58 this month, compared with $4.06 last month and $3.45 a year ago,” Mr Haigh said. Food prices rose 0.2 percent in the month, compared with a 2.8 percent increase in January. With seasonal adjustment, the cost of food rose 0.8 percent in February 2017. Higher prices for fruit and vegetables (up 1.8 percent) were offset by lower prices for meat, poultry, and fish (down 1.5 percent). Seasonal influences on fruit and vegetable prices were apparent as we move out of summer. Increases were seen for summer produce, led by strawberries and lettuce, and decreases were seen for end-of-summer produce, led by apples and potatoes.

That’s just about every major category of consumer electronics. So what does that mean for you if you own one — or several — of these gadgets? For many people, it may mean nothing at all. On the other hand, many people may still use outdated software on their devices. And although the CIA designed these tools to spy on terrorists in the interest of national security, the hacking tools may have ended up in the hands of a whole range of entities. The fallout may also end up being broader. So even if you aren’t worried about what WikiLeaks revealed about the CIA right now for yourself, here are some tips for protecting your devices. What you can do if you’re on Android Hundreds of millions of Android users still use devices based on older versions of the Google-made mobile operating system. “The one thing that people can and should be doing is keeping their apps and phones as up-to-date as possible,” said Kurt Opsahl, deputy executive director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit. What you can do on an iPhone Many iPhone owners are far more up-to-date with their mobile software than Android device owners. So only a minority of iPhone users have devices with the versions of the Apple iOS operating system that the WikiLeaks documents mention. Specifically, the WikiLeaks documents referred to exploits working on versions of iOS up to 8.2. About 79% of Apple users are running iOS 10, the latest version of the system, and only 5% are running a version older than iOS 9, according to Apple. In raw numbers, with more than one billion iOS devices sold worldwide, that amounts to at least 50 million people running the outdated software. What to do with your router The WikiLeaks documents also described methods of injecting malware into routers offered by Asian manufacturers like Huawei, ZTE and Mercury. In general, it is wise for everyone to regularly check routers for so-called firmware updates to make sure they get the latest security enhancements. What to do with your computer The WikiLeaks documents mentioned attacks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers. Personal computers have always been the most vulnerable devices we own, so make sure to install the latest operating system updates and use anti-virus software.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Analyst Believes Galaxy S8 Still on Track to Be Released on April 21 By Omar Sohail Mar 12, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Manufacturing chipsets on the 10nm FinFET fabrication is definitely no easy task, and this is one of the reasons why Snapdragon 835 is not being produced in abundant numbers, forcing other manufacturers to resort to using Snapdragon 821 on their flagship phones (this includes the LG G6). Samsung might have pushed the official release date of its Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus for this very reason which is why you keep reading that both phones are going to be announced on April 28. However, one analyst is still under the impression that Samsung is going to hold onto its initial release date and not push that date to a week in advance. KGI Securities’ Analyst Has Strong Impressions That the Galaxy S8 Will Maintain Its April 21 Release Date, Despite Rumors Suggesting Otherwise Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most reliable analysts when it comes to Apple products has started concerning himself with the official release date of the Galaxy S8. According to him (via 9to5Google), Samsung is going to maintain its April 21 release date of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus but there are some really exciting things that you guys should know. The resolutions of both phones are not going to measure at 2560 x 1440, but 2960 x 2400 instead, crossing the QHD fence and pouncing on the QHD+ resolution category. Related Galaxy S8 Could Shoot Video at an Astounding 1000 Frames Per Second Advertisement The Galaxy S8 is expected to feature a 3,000mAh, maintaining the same capacity found in the Galaxy S7, and I am disappointed to hear this because the upcoming flagship will have a screen size of 5.8 inches compared to the S7’s 5.1-inch display. With all that improved screen real-estate, a larger battery is warranted. Galaxy S8 Plus, on the other hand, is expected to feature a 3,500mAh cell underneath the hood and both models are expected to be shipped out in the 4 and 6GB RAM configurations. Related Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus Expected to Go up for Pre-Order Early Next Month 4GB of RAM in a smartphone will serve your purpose quite nicely, but if you want to go all out when it comes to multitasking and opening up several applications at once, then we recommend that you go for the 6GB RAM version. Are you excited for the official announcement of the Galaxy S8? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

The internet has fallen in love with the sassy toddler and her baby sibling followed by the unbridled panic of their mother who swoops in behind them. It's safe to say his interview about South Korea wouldn't quite have had the same amount of global interest without their appearance in the background. But it's not the first epic live TV News fail - and it won't be the last. https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat/status/840175417545895936 More related stories Why assume an Asian woman is the nanny? How this expert/dad went viral My Trump tweet went viral - this is how it feels With 24-hour rolling news channels run by mere humans, it's no surprise that there have been quite a few slip-ups along the way. And we can't be the only ones glad of human error - if only for the lols. https://twitter.com/valerieloftus/status/840208087118151681 The Guy done good Video caption Guy Goma: BBC's best/worst interview? First up is Guy Goma, who turned up to the BBC for a job interview in the IT department. Instead, he found himself live on BBC News being asked questions about a court case between Apple computers and Apple Corps record company. The presenter thought he was talking to Guy Kewney, a technology expert. Mr Goma, bless him, tried his best - he was there for a job interview after all and clearly wanted to impress. And it was his endearing panic under pressure, before caving in and admitting he didn't have a clue, that won over the hearts of viewers. 'You have the wrong guest sir' Video caption Dr Todd Landman tells BBC Breakfast's Jon Kay: "I think you have the wrong guest sir" In another case of mistaken identity, BBC presenters Rachel Burden and Jon Kay thought they were interviewing an explorer; instead they got an academic. Just three months ago, Political Scientist Todd Landman sat on the red sofa and was introduced as the mountaineer Leslie Binns Rather than try to pretend he'd been up Everest, Professor Landman quickly said: "I think you have the wrong guest sir." It was all pretty good natured in the end, with Rachel Burden admitting: "It is ever so funny, I looked at this man and thought he doesn't necessarily look like a mountaineer." Fugitive gorilla goes rogue Image caption Kumbuka, a western lowland gorilla, looking the picture of innocence after arriving at London Zoo in 2013 We're not sure how a BBC Breakfast producer managed to mistake the First Minister of Scotland with a 29-stone gorilla. But that's what happened in October last year. BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty was explaining that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would be a guest on the programme, when producers cut to footage of London Zoo's fugitive gorilla Kumbuka. Naga couldn't contain her laughter and her co-presenter Charlie Stayt stepped in: "I'm sorry we've… err… very clearly run the wrong pictures over that particular sequence. My apologies there." The BBC later offered an apology of sorts to the 46-year-old SNP leader, in the form of a toy gorilla. https://twitter.com/JamieRoss7/status/787017363870851072 Computer says no We've all been there. You think the latest bit of technology can solve your problems, when in fact it just makes everything more complicated. Step forward BBC presenter Simon McCoy, who picked up a stack of printing paper instead of his iPad during a live TV broadcast. But like Guy Goma, the reason Simon's slip-up made headlines was because he continued talking as if there was nothing weird going on. A BBC statement confirmed that he just "went with it" after realising his mistake. Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related TopicsYou What?

BlackBerry, the OS, is gone now, but at least it outlived Palm (which was #4 back then). This really was a long time ago, before even the Google Play store was born. Back then you would download apps from the Android Market while books, music and videos had separate stores. Five years ago Google pulled a Charlemagne and unified its web territories and Play was born. It recently celebrated its 5th birthday. Three years ago Android had established itself as the dominant mobile OS with one prominent detractor - Nokia (puppeteered by Microsoft). The company did make a half-hearted attempt, the Nokia X phones. Unlike todays pure Android-powered Nokias, the X lineup was molded into a pseudo Windows Phone. History will do well to forget those. BlackBerry - now also firmly in the Android camp - is trying to resurrect hardware QWERTYs. But it was six years ago again that those were in their heyday. The Nokia E6 was appearing in tantalizing leaks while the Nokia E7 was just going on pre-order. The E6 merged touchscreen with hardware QWERTY in a bar form factor, similar to the BB Keyone, while the E7 had a flip out screen that revealed a large landscape keyboard. The battle between on-screen and hardware keyboards seems long over now, but the Keyone drew a surprising amount of attention. Other Android makers seem to have left hardware keyboards behind for good. To be fair, touchscreens are now much more capable than they were back in the day - it was a long road of ever higher numbers. As far as four years ago we were on the lookout for the cheapest phone with a 1080p screen, just north of 100. 1080p is still the norm for the more upscale devices while QHD maintains a premium price. Not for long, perhaps, as Sony is having another crack at mobile 4K (this time with HDR!). Related articles Google Play turns 5 Nokia 3, 5, and 3310 land in the UK in May Retailer in India lists BlackBerry KEYone, price revealed Weekly poll results: 1080p screens are good enough, there's not much need for 4K Reader comments eltee 3DRm 15 Mar 2017 as far as blackberry and their physical qwerty keyboards, people still want those, get asked at least once a day by customers for phones with a physical keyboard, theres still a market, even if its a small amount of people...

No other utility provides all of the information users need in order to write scripts using GUI Scripting.

It also incorporates the changes made in UI Browser 2.6.0, which added support for new accessibility features introduced by Apple in OS X Mavericks 10.11 and macOS Sierra 10.12 and the following improvements: * It incorporates new versions of PFiddlesoft's PFAssistive and PFEventTaps Frameworks. * It embeds both frameworks in the application, permitting UI Browser to be installed by dragging it to the Applications folder instead of running an installer. * Script statements generated by its AppleScript menu can be sent to Script Debugger 6, as well as to earlier versions of Script Debugger and other script editors. * The example scripts provided with it have been updated as needed to run in macOS Sierra 10.12. * It presents an alert when it refreshes its view because a UI element was destroyed in the target application or a Mission Control space was changed. * Minor bug fixes. Download a free, full-featured 30-day trial version of UI Browser now at the PFiddlesoft website. Pricing and Availability: New customers may purchase UI Browser for $55, with quantity discounts available. It is a free upgrade for registered owners of UI Browser 2.0.0 and newer.

Forecasters at the National Weather Service say a storm must show “considerable falling or blowing snow,” wind over 35 mph and visibility of less than a 1/4 mile for at least three hours. When all of the conditions are expected, scientists will issue a blizzard warning. When two of the conditions are met, they will issue a “winter storm warning.” Here are the five worst storms to achieve blizzard status in the city for the month of March, according to the National Weather Service. March 12, 1888: This two-day blizzard, which dumped 21 inches on the city, was the worst to strike the city in March. March 8, 1941: Central Park saw roughly 18 inches of snow. March 4, 1960: A two-day nor’easter produced 14.5 inches of snow. March 13, 1993: The “Storm of the Century” generated 71 mph winds and nearly 11 inches of snow at LaGuardia Airport. March 5, 1981: A mix of rain and snow brought 8.6 inches of accumulation to the city, which turned out to be the biggest of several storms that took place during that month.

However, intelligence agencies have continued not to disclose to Congress how many Americans have had communications caught up in the spying efforts. Upstream and Prism operate under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows intelligence agencies to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning people who aren’t citizens of the United States and are located outside the country. Prism is used to collect messaging data from major tech companies including Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft that is sent and received by foreign targets under surveillance. Upstream gives the NSA the ability to intercept internet traffic flowing along the "internet backbone"—major Internet cables and switches—located in the U.S. and overseas. Read: WikiLeaks: CIA Hacked Phones And TVs To Turn Them Into Spy Devices That section of the law is set to expire at the end of the year on Dec. 31. The White House reportedly supports the renewal of the law as-is and is not pushing for reforms to the programs despite widespread criticism of the wide net they cast. Congress has started to process of renewal, reviewing the law and its effects, but has continually had a request denied to learn how many Americans have their electronic communications intercepted by the programs. Democratic Congressman John Conyers of Michigan, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, is the latest to ask for figures from the intelligence community. Last week, he informed a panel hearing that Congress would need to know the numbers to help decide on reauthorization. "The members of this committee and the public at large require that estimate to engage in a meaningful debate," he said. Read: How Much Does The Government Spy On Us? US Officials To Announce Extent Of Surveillance Conyers is joined in his request by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Wyden has pressed the director of national intelligence for the information in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and has renewed his request in a letter sent to Daniel Coats, the Trump administration’s choice for director of national intelligence. "I and other members of Congress have been seeking an answer to this question since 2011. We posed the question again in the context of the reauthorization of Section 702. It is now central to the debate this year over the reauthorization of the program, which you have described as your 'top legislative priority,” Wyden wrote. Coats reportedly told Wyden he would "do everything I can" to "get you that number," but provided no guarantee that he would follow through. According to April Doss, a former NSA lawyer who testified before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month, U.S. spies don’t keep track of the number of American citizens caught by the surveillance programs because doing so would create its own privacy concern. She reasoned that identifying whether a person caught in the spy net would require spies to de-anonymize data collected, including phone numbers and IP addresses, to determine whether the person attached to that data is an American. Doss said that practice would “constitute an unnecessary and unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of U.S. persons” and would also likely be illegal as it would be “both intrusive and unrelated to any need for foreign intelligence gathering.” Privacy organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have called on Congress to put an end to the programs by letting them expire at year’s end. “We've long argued that the surveillance programs under Section 702 are not targeted, do not have sufficient oversight, and violate Fourth Amendment protections. That's why we’re calling on Congress to let the authority sunset," the EFF’s Kate Tummarello wrote in a blog post earlier this month.

Cassava is the company through which all EcoCash mobile money services are managed across Africa. For the first time ever, Zimbabweans in the diaspora are now able to take direct control of how the money they remit to Zimbabwe is used. They can sign up for the EcoCash mobile money service via the Ecocash Home Wallet app, and link it to their UK mobile number. The app is available for download on the Google Play Store and Apple store. Once registered, a user in the UK will be able to top up their Home Wallet through a debit or credit card or bank transfer, which will allow them to send money home and perform all other transactions available on EcoCash in Zimbabwe such as pay bills, pay merchants, or buy airtime. Haxton Rose, Managing Director of Cassava Remit UK, described the new service as "a response to long standing calls by the diaspora community for a transaction offering that provides speed, comfort, control, and security of funds remitted back home." He said the launch comes with a three month zero fees offer for top-ups to the wallet, while all in-wallet transactions remain free after topping the wallet. Natalie Jabangwe-Morris, General Manager for EcoCash Zimbabwe, said: "Gone are the days of having to queue at a high street shop to send money home, wait for several days for the money transfer to go through, and then having to rely on someone to handle other transactions in Zimbabwe on your behalf such as paying for school fees or any other projects back home. Regrettably, in such scenarios, we have heard of many instances where the money ends up being misappropriated. This is where the EcoCash Home Wallet comes in handy as the customer not only gets access to a remittance capability, but also gets direct control over how the funds will be used downstream." Cassava has so far excelled in developing and introducing such innovations across the markets in which it operates, which has in turn enhanced the equity of the EcoCash brand as seen at the just ended Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, where EcoCash was recognised as the Best Mobile Money Solution in the World for 2017.

The incident happened just before midnight while the President was at the White House. The suspect, identified in court records as Jonathan T. Tran, 26, of California, told the agency’s officers that he was there to see the President. “No, I am a friend of the President. I have an appointment,” Tran said when approached by an officer, according to a report released Saturday by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. Asked how he got there, Tran told officers: “I jumped the fence.” The arresting officers found two cans of mace and a passport on Tran, who appeared in D.C. Superior Court shortly before 5 p.m. dressed in a dark blue hoodie and khakis. He spoke only briefly, offering a faint “yes” when told his rights. He faces a charge of unlawful entry and will be arraigned in federal court on Monday. The judge said there was probable cause to hold Tran because he could pose a flight risk and danger to the community. The police report, obtained by CNN, offers a description of the incident. White House security footage showed Tran jumping the fence at the northwest courtyard of the Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House, the report said. He was not detected, however, until approached by a uniformed Secret Service officer. At one point, Tran hid behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the south portico entrance, according to a complaint filed in US District Court. Secret Service officer Wayne Azevedo said in the complaint that during a search after the arrest, “two cans of mace were found on Tran, including one his jacket pocket. Tran was also carrying among other things, a United States passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by President Trump, and a letter he had written to President Trump.” Azevedo also said “in the letter, Tran mentioned Russian hackers and said he had information of relevance. Tran alleged that he had been followed, and his ‘phone and email communications (had been) read by third parties,’ and that he had ‘been called schizophrenic.'” After the incident, the White House was placed under security condition “orange,” one of the highest levels of security for the Secret Service, an agency source said. The President was alerted about the intrusion late Friday night, an administration official said. The suspect was arrested by the Secret Service “without further incident,” the Secret Service said in its statement. Trump said Saturday that the suspect was disturbed, calling the situation “sad” and saying he appreciates the work of the Secret Service. “The service did a fantastic job,” the President said to reporters during a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia. “It was a troubled person. It was very sad.” A Secret Service source said the backpack Tran carried was x-rayed before bomb technicians removed it from the White House grounds for further evaluation. The backpack was found to be free of any hazardous materials, the Secret Service said in its statement. But that brief statement released by a spokesman Saturday morning seemed to downplay the incident and contained very few of the details in the police reports and court records, including how close the suspect came to the residence, his intention to see the President and the mace he was carrying. A special Secret Service intelligence team interviewed Tran, who was taken into custody by Washington police. The suspect has no criminal history and no previous history involving the Secret Service, that agency said. A Secret Service emergency response team searched the entire White House grounds with K-9 dogs, including the first lady’s garden, which is near the south entrance of the residence. Extensive searches were also conducted on East Executive Avenue and East Wing roadway. “Nothing of concern to security operations was found,” the Secret Service said in its statement. The suspect’s 19-year-old younger brother, Brian, from Milpitas, California, said Tran was “troubled” after being laid off from his job at an electrical engineering company. Tran had been “living in his car and eating junk food,” his brother said. Tran graduated from San Jose State University with an electrical engineering degree and had been “stressed out from the job,” his brother said. A Secret Service agent called Tran’s family’s home Friday night to inform them of the fence-jumping incident, his brother said, adding that his mother is “very troubled” about the matter. Tran has been “a very good brother to me,” said the brother, a mechanical engineering major at San Jose State University. The investigation into the security breach continued Saturday as the Secret Service tried to determine how Tran gained entrance to the highly fortified White House complex without being detected, officials said. It is the first known major security incident at the White House since Trump became president two months ago. Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent, said Saturday on “CNN Newsroom” that the breach has the potential to be “catastrophic.” “This is really troubling,” said Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “If someone came over the northwest fence of the Treasury complex, what that indicates is they didn’t go over just one fence, they went over multiple fences. This has the potential to be a catastrophic breach of the White House complex. This is really disturbing, just the amount of real estate that this intruder was able to gain or bypass on the complex.” “So the Secret Service has to really take a very hard look very quickly as to why weren’t other defense measures alerted,” Wackrow said. Asked Saturday if the Secret Service handled the situation correctly, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, the “Secret Service did a phenomenal job and they continue to provide phenomenal protection to the President and the first family, and the President was very appreciative of their efforts.” Spicer added that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly “was kept aware of the situation the entire time.” There have been numerous instances of people trespassing on the White House grounds over the last several years. In one notable instance in 2014, 42-year-old Omar Gonzales, of Copperas Cove, Texas, made it through the north portico doors with a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife in his pants pocket, according to the Secret Service. Gonzalez was apprehended just after making it inside the doors, the Secret Service said. The first family was not at the White House at the time. In another, the Secret Service apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn after he scaled the fence wearing an American flag-like cape while the first family was inside the residence celebrating Thanksgiving in 2015. Other incidents of trespassing include: A man tossed a backpack over the north fence in April 2016 before jumping over himself, where he was arrested. In April 2015, Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex while carrying a suspicious package, later deemed harmless, and was cornered by security dogs. Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, barely made it onto the lawn in October 2014 before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs, the Secret Service said. Adesanya, who suffers from mental health problems, had been arrested in a previous White House breach, his father said. In April 2014, a man wearing a hat of the Pokemon character Pikachu made it over the White House fence and onto the north lawn, where he was apprehended, the New York Daily News reported.

X How to . . . keep your messages private Keep the CIA – and other snoopers – from hacking into your messages Sun, Mar 12, 2017, 15:05 Updated: Sun, Mar 12, 2017, 15:27 Ciara O'Brien WhatsApp: it’s end-to-end encrypted, so no one can gain access to your messages unless they are the intended recipient. Photograph: Andrew Gombert/EPA         You might have picked up on some of the news during the week about the CIA and its ability to hack into messaging apps. While most of us probably aren’t CIA targets, keeping prying eyes out of our messages is always a good move – particularly when you think about what we divulge over messaging services. The first step to keeping your messages private, no matter what app you are using, is to disable previews on the lock screen. On iOS, go to Settings>Notifications>Messages and scroll down to Show Previews. You can choose Always, When Unlocked or Off. Turning them off will disable previews on the native messaging app. On Android, go to Settings>Lock Screen and Security >Notifications on Lock Screen and turn messages to off. iMessage The good thing about iMessage is that you can get your messages on all your devices. The bad thing about iMessage is that you can get all your messages on all your devices. So while it’s sometimes convenient to pick up your iMessages on your iPad, if the device is shared, anyone could see them. The good thing is that you have to enable iMessage on each device, it’s not done by default, and you’ll get a notification your other devices to say that a new device is using iMessage. But if you don’t want to have your messages popping up everywhere, you can easily disable it too. If you have the device in your possession, you can go to Settings>iMessage> and turn off iMessage. That will stop iMessage from being delivered to that device. If someone switches it back on you’ll get a notification on your other devices again, so it is easily fixed. You can also choose what addresses iMessage delivers to on each device. Go to Settings>iMessage and scroll down to Send & Receive. You can add and remove email addresses and phone numbers through that menu, but you’ll have to do it on each device on which you are using iMessage. ADVERTISEMENT You can also remotely deregister iMessage if you no longer have a SIM card for that number through Apple’s support website. https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/ WhatsApp WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, which means no one can gain access to your messages unless they are the intended recipient. That excludes the possibility that someone will have access to your phone remotely through malware, which is what the Vault 7 documents indicated. You can disable message previews to stop your message contents flashing up on screen. In the App, go to Settings>Notifications and disable Show Preview. But you might want to go a step further than that. WhatsApp also has two-factor authentication, which allows you to set a code that WhatsApp will periodically ask for to prevent unauthorised access to your account. It will also ask for the code when you are registering your number with WhatsApp again. Go to Account>Two Step Verification to enable the security feature and choose your code. You can also choose an email address to help you reset the code should you forget it – preferably an address not linked to your smartphone, if you’re being really security conscious. Signal Signal is an encrypted messaging and one-on-one calling app. On iOS it’s a standalone app, but Android users can set it as their default messaging application for unencrypted messages as well as private messages. To kill off message previews, open Signal and go to Settings>Notifications. From there you can set how background notifications behave. You can show the sender name and message, name only or no information at all. There are a few other things to look at. Go to Settings>Privacy> and slide Require Approval on Change to on. That will force you to approve any communication with someone who has recently reinstalled Signal, or otherwise changed their safety number. The same menu also allows to you to prevent any message previews from appearing on the app switcher, and to clear your message history in two clicks. Telegram Telegram is tied to your phone number, and has some useful features such as secret chats to keep important things private. Telegram also allows you to set a passcode to prevent unauthorised access to your account. Forget the passcode, though, and you’ll lose all access to your secret chats, so choose something you’ll remember. To keep your account from being set up on another phone without your knowledge, you can can enable two-step verification. Both of these security features can be accessed through Settings>Privacy and Security within Telegram. Confide Not only is Confide end-to-end encrypted, but messages are read line by line as you drag your finger down the screen to show a line at a time. Messages cannot be saved or forwarded, and once they’re read, they self-destruct. That’s just the free option. The subscription version, which costs €7.49 a month (or cheaper if you pay for a year upfront) will add features such as the ability to recall a message before it has been read – useful – and use themes and stickers. Confide Basic will do for most people. For iOS users, you can also use functions such as Siri to create messages, or send and receive Confide messages through the iMessage app. The messages will behave the same way as any Confide message, with self-destruct intact, but won’t appear in the Confide app. Within the settings on Confide, you can turn off Sent Message History, which removes the context of your conversation. That can be both a good and a bad thing. On one hand, if someone manages to get through your security code or Touch ID lock, they won’t be able to see the full context of your conversation; on the other, you could very easily lose the thread of the conversation without it. ADVERTISEMENT Viber Viber rolled out end-to-end encryption for messages a while back, but it also has the ability to hide chats. It only works on smartphones, not on the Viber desktop app, and once it’s enabled, it will hide the chat from your public list. You set a pin code that must be entered to access the hidden chats. To hide a chat, open Viber and go to the chats screen. Find the chat you want to hide, then swipe left on it to bring up the Hide option. If you haven’t set a passcode, you’ll be prompted to set one. This is also how you’ll find your hidden chats, by entering the pin into the search bar. You can also disable message previews by going to Settings>Notification and turning off Show Preview.       Topics: Cia Apple Read More World wide web creator Tim Berners-Lee targets ‘fake news’ Tech swipes right for transgender community PlanNet21 sets €100m revenue target after Agile acquisition BT’s gamekeeper-turned-poacher stance hard for Eir to take This week we’re talking about . . .

The sole holdout of this new agreement was HarperCollins who filed paperwork and said they are not engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The publisher also stated that the tribunal does not have any jurisdiction to lower the prices of e-books. The Bureau’s investigation started Apple was accused by the US Justice Department for colluding with publishers to create agency pricing, which created a uniform playing field. At the time, it was thought that if all retailers charged the same price for eBooks, there would be more competition in the field. Sadly, the opposite happened. Within a few short months the average bestseller increased in price from $9.99 to $16.999 and the two year decline in digital sales begun, forcing companies like Sony to exit the field entirely. There is no definitive date in which e-book resellers will lower the prices of e-books in Canada and how much they will be discounted. It also remains to be seen the extent of the Competition Bureau’s powers to penalize HarperCollins for refusing to sign the agreement.

Image: shutterstock By Tyler Schmall2017-03-12 15:00:00 UTC Greetings, fellow graphians! If you're like me, nothing grabs your attention quite like a diagrammatical illustration of a set of data. Frankly put: Graphs. Kick. Ass.  When you think of emojis, you may think of the popular ones first. For instance, there's the smiley faces, the hearts, the flame, and the ultra popular closed umbrella (🌂).  SEE ALSO: 10 error messages that prove my computer knows too much about my personal life But what if you wanted to use emojis to just talk graphs with a fellow graph fan? Well you're in luck, because Apple had the foresight to include an array of graphs in their emoji selection; they're just a little hard to find!  Here are the top nine emojis for us graph lovers. 1. Vertical bar graph emoji Oh hell yeah. The bar graph. The cornerstone of graphs. A bar graph has everything you love about graphs: bars, colors, and data. If you ask me, there's not a more aesthetically pleasing graph than the bar graph. Needless to say, I get a lot of mileage out of this one and it's always sitting top left in my "frequently used" section, as I'm sure is true about a lot of you. 2. Upward-trending line graph emoji This is another certified classic. The upward-trending line graph usually indicates good news, and graph enthusiasts will often use this emoji to say something in their life is going well. (Wish I could say I used this one more often LOL.) 3. Downward-trending line graph emoji Basically the inverse of the upward-trending line graph. Graph fanatics will often use it to say something isn't going well. E.g. "I'm all out of yarn! 📉" 4. Upward-trending line graph with Yen.  This is only used for one specific purpose in the graph community and that's "I have recently gained Yen." And it comes up a lot more often than you would think. 5. Straight edge ruler emoji Okay so there are only four graph emojis I guess. I really thought there were more. But maybe like if you were to make a graph by hand you would probably have to use a straight edge ruler to draw the lines? Or you would just use a computer I guess.  6. Open folder emoji Okay so bear with me here. If you were to have a lot of physical graphs you would need to put them somewhere, right? Perhaps in a folder? Sorry about this. I promised my editor I'd come up with nine of these and I thought there were way more than four graph emojis.  7. Slightly more open folder emoji This has really taken a turn for the worse. So this one would be the same as above except it's slightly more open. Once again I'd like to apologize for this. I could've sworn there were way more graph emojis. Unfortunately, I have a deadline to meet on this. Please continue reading.  8. Rollercoaster emoji Okay. You'll have to use your imagination a little bit on this one. But if you squint just right, the rollercoaster emoji almost looks like a graph. This is the best I could do. I'm sincerely sorry. I just have one more left to wring out of this and then you can move on.   9. Vol. 4 by John Appleseed emoji  Alright, I know what you're thinking and yes, it's just a book. But who's to say that Vol. 4 by John Appleseed isn't all about graphs? You have no idea. It very well could be. Maybe Mr. Appleseed was such a huge graph lover that he needed four volumes just to do his graph passion justice. There is no telling what's in this book, but as far as you or anyone else knows, it's specifically about graphs. So yeah.  I really thought this would go over better and I'm sorry.

KGI Analyst “Confirms” Samsung Galaxy S8 Full Specs and Release Date GO The flagship is said to go on sale on April 21 now Mar 12, 2017 10:52 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  We've definitely had our fair share of leaks about Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+, but apart from those specs that could be verified just by looking at the phone's picture, there haven't been any confirmations about them. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, well-known for his predictions about Apple, has just issued a report for KGI Securities that contains a lot of information about Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+ flagship smartphones. Both smartphones that will be officially unveiled on March 29 are expected to go on sale on April 28, but Kuo contradicts this rumors and claims the handsets will be available for purchase on April 21 in South Korea. He also “confirms” Samsung will launch two versions of the flagship based on the size of the display, with 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch panels. There won't be any flat panels for either version and both versions will lack the physical Home button. According to Kuo, the Galaxy S8's OLED display will support WQHD+ (2960 x 2400 pixels) resolution. The analyst predicts a 6:4 shipments ratio between the models with the smaller Galaxy S8 in the lead, 9to5Google reports. When it comes to hardware, Kuo expects Samsung to launch the Qualcomm-based versions of Galaxy S8 and S8+ in the United States, Japan, and China, while the Exynos-based models will be available in Europe and the rest of Asia. Some Galaxy S8 models will pack 6GB RAM inside Even though all info leaked until now suggests both Galaxy S8 and S8+ will pack 4GB of RAM inside, Kuo says that models launched in South Korea and China will include 6GB RAM since “users in those two markets are particularly sensitive to DRAM specs.” The larger model will be powered by a 3,500 mAh battery, whereas the regular Galaxy S8 variant will drain energy from a 3,000 mAh battery. Neither of the Galaxy S8 variations will pack dual-camera setup due to “immature dual-camera ISP design.” Instead, they will all feature 8-megapixel front-facing cameras and 12-megapixel main photo snappers on the back. Last but not least, the Galaxy S8 will come with a PC mode when placed in a dock, which will use the phone's USB Type-C port. Samsung Galaxy S8 and its bigger brother will be available on the market in seven color options including gold, silver, bright black, matte black, blue, orchid, and pink. #Samsung Galaxy S8#Galaxy S8+#Samsung flagship#Samsung smartphone#Galaxy S8 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ Show Up in White and Gold Colors Samsung Galaxy S8 Renders Revealed by Case Maker Online Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus Size Compared to Other Flagships Samsung Official Says Galaxy S8 Will Feature Facial Recognition Samsung Galaxy S8 Features Camera and Iris Scanner Improvements LibreOffice 5.3 Office Suite Gets First Point Release with 100 Improvements Study: 96% of Websites Get Attacked by Bad Bots Windows 10 Creators Update Hides a Secret Ad Switch, Privacy Group Warns YouTube Discontinues Annoying Annotations LXLE 16.04.2 GNU/Linux Distro to Bring All the Goodies from Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS Netflix Turns to Thumbs Up/Down Ratings, Ditches 5-Stars System Intel Launches Bug Bounty Program, Offers Rewards of Up to $30,000    Samsung Galaxy S8 New Android APKs SystemPanel 2 APK: Updated March 16th, 16:03 GMT Color Switch APK: Updated March 16th, 16:01 GMT Fing APK: Updated March 16th, 15:57 GMT PowerDirector APK: Updated March 16th, 15:55 GMT WhatsCall APK: Updated March 16th, 15:52 GMT imo APK: Updated March 16th, 15:51 GMT Jio4GVoice APK: Updated March 16th, 15:48 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S8 to Feature Variant with 6GB RAM in China more on: Samsung i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile This New iPhone 8 Concept is the Best One We Have Seen to Date By Uzair Ghani Mar 10, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit A new iPhone 8 concept has knocked on our door, and it’s perhaps the best one we have seen to date. New iPhone 8 Concept Takes Design Cues from G6 & Galaxy S8, But it Looks Astounding Up till now we have seen all sorts of weird and wonderful iPhone 8 illustrations from the world of concept designs. But there is nothing at all out there that looks as good as the one we are going to feature today. Although it does take a few design cues from the LG G6 as well as the (yet unreleased) Samsung Galaxy S8, but it manages to hold a personality of its own. Will Apple ever release something like this? Honestly, I have no clue at all. it’s just that this concept screams at everyone to be glanced at just once. Related The iPhone 8 Will feature Curved OLEDs Manufactured By Samsung, Claims Nikkei Quite frankly, despite being a massive iPhone fanboy, I am a huge fan of the G6 design, and also the Galaxy S8. There’s something about not having bezels at all that really puts the focus on the software running on the device, while still managing to focus on the amazing hardware in a minimal fashion. Advertisement Secretly, I do want Apple to come up with something similar to the LG G6 and Galaxy S8, but the company does end up surprising everyone with its decisions. There is a possibility we might end up getting an edge to edge display without the side curves, while at the same time, we might end up seeing a rehashed design from yesteryear. There are lot of things we need to take into account before even predicting whether or not Apple will ultimately release the smartphone we all want. But so far, the murmurings from the world of leaks and rumors sound promising. Who knows we really will end up getting that OLED iPhone 8 we so badly crave. Let’s just hope that really turns out to be the case.

What’s the closest equivalent to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 since that phone went up in smoke late last year? For months the answer to that question was the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but the Meizu Pro 6 Plus provides a surprisingly compelling alternative. It’s very tricky to find in the UK, but if you manage to track it down then you should be looking to pay around the £400 mark. Considering you’re getting an all-metal phone with many of the same specs as the aforementioned Galaxy Note 7 (minus the stylus), that’s quite a proposition. Meizu Pro 6 Plus – Design Meizu has plenty of experience creating metal-bodied phones now, so it’s no surprise to find that its high-end Pro 6 Plus is very elegantly built. Elegant, but hardly original. The phone’s rounded edges, drilled ports and horizontal antenna lines reveal another Android phone that apes Apple’s iPhone 6 (and beyond) design language. I was sent the gold model, which is never a colour choice that’s particularly to my taste. However, there are grey and silver options available too. Note, though, that the gold colour here has a softer, more metallic sheen than many similar smartphone variants. It’s almost pleasant. Related: 12 Best Android Phones There’s really little to note about the phone’s appearance. What’s more remarkable is how pleasant and manageable the phone is given that it employs a huge 5.7-inch display. It still isn't a handset you’ll use comfortably single-handed, but thanks to its 7.3mm-thin, 158g body, I never felt like the seams of my trouser or jacket pockets were in any danger. By way of a comparison, the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is about the same width and thickness as the iPhone 7 Plus, but it’s a few millimetres shorter and a huge 30g lighter. Given that its screen is even bigger, that’s pretty impressive. Also helping with the Meizu Pro 6 Plus’ unassuming design is its camera bump. Put simply, one barely exists, with just a slight metal lip lifting it away from the body. It’s centrally placed, but you can lay it down flat and it won’t rock from side to side unless you really press on the extreme edges of the phone. Below the camera lens is something I initially mistook for a funky new fingerprint sensor. Not only is this mystery component placed in a similar location to other rear-mounted biometric sensors, but it has a flat, round appearance. It's actually part of the camera, however. It serves as the flash, which is comprised of ten LEDs arranged in a ring. The actual fingerprint sensor is located on the front of the phone in the traditional – for iPhone and Samsung users at least – home button position. This worked quickly and reliably, and I preferred its iPhone-like recessed nature to Samsung’s sticky-uppy alternative. It just feels more locatable when you’re feeling for it unseen. Just like those high-profile rivals, the Meizu Pro 6 Pluss fingerprint sensor forms part of a physical home button, which you’ll have to click to wake the phone as well as (obviously) returning you to the phone’s homescreen. This home button also doubles as a capacitive back key. I expected to dislike this doubling up of functionality, but with practice I grew to like it – particularly when web browsing or quickly backing out from tinkering with camera settings to capture a shot. You get the usual arrangement of power and volume keys on the right-hand side of the phone, but in a rare misstep both have the same flat texture. This meant that I was never quite sure which key I was pressing when not looking – although in fairness, I usually managed to choose the right one. Meizu Pro 6 Plus – Display Meizu hasn’t cut any corners with the Pro 6 Plus display. Indeed, on paper, its specs match up to the dearly departed Samsung Galaxy Note 7 – a 5.7-inch behemoth with a QHD (1,440 x 2,560 pixels) resolution for a fine 515ppi pixel density. Even the panel type matches Samsung’s ex-flagship: a super-vivid Super AMOLED. It would be a tad optimistic to hope that the picture would be as good. It’s not. But while Samsung remains the king of AMOLED, I had few complaints with Meizu’s effort. Yes, colours are a lot punchier and more "false" than you might be used to in an IPS LCD, which is particularly noticeable when dealing with pale skin tones or red objects. But Meizu has at least included a slider function to let you make the picture warmer or cooler according to taste. It isn't the brightest display I’ve ever used, and it even seemed a little dim when I took it out on an atypically sunny day in early March. But it’s still perfectly usable. Perhaps the most notable feature of this display is the fact that it has a pressure-sensitive 3D Touch facility, much like the iPhone 7 Plus. This is rare on an Android phone, and while it works perfectly fine here, it feels rather gimmicky. It’s only really usable in Meizu’s small selection of custom apps – when previewing an email, for example, or… previewing a text message. It’s all rather half-baked and nowhere near as well implemented as it is in iOS – which many would say is of questionable value itself. There’s really nothing lost by its inclusion, but it’s far from a system selling feature. Meizu Pro 6 Plus – Software The Meizu Pro 6 Plus runs on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box. This isn't the freshest build of Android in town these days, with Android 7.0 Nougat officially landing back in August 2016. Not that this matters in practical terms. With Meizu’s Flyme 6.0 UI layered on top, this is a heavily tweaked version of Android regardless. Although this is the international version of the phone, you may be rather confused by the appearance of Chinese Mandarin text during the setup procedure. Scrolling down and selecting English as your language will restore things to legibility. One other potential point of confusion is the default app provision. Out of the box there are absolutely no Google apps preinstalled on the phone. Indeed, you won’t even find the Google Play Store in order to help you download those Google apps – or any others you may have bought, for that matter. This further gives away the Meizu Pro 6 Plus’ domestic focus – China and Google don’t really get along – but there's a simple and quick way around it. Simply head into Meizu’s Hot Apps app and download the Google Apps Installer. This will provide access to the Google Play Store and some crucial Googley system gubbins. One added annoyance is that you’ll need to manage your security permissions whenever there are updates, as any apps downloaded through the Google Play Store will be treated as being from an unknown source. It’s just an extra layer of approval, but it’s one that you probably won’t be used to from an Android phone. Besides this early point of friction, Flyme 6.0 is a relatively smooth and intuitive UI to use – if a little generic. Meizu’s software team is clearly a big fan of iOS, with a number of recognisable fonts, transparency effects, and touches littered throughout the UI. It even omits the app drawer, although that’s far from unique among Android phones these days. A more notable omission here is that of the typical Android multi-tasking key. Rather, you have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access a familiar app card carousel. It takes a little getting used to, since you need to start your swipe from off the screen. What’s more, I found that when trying to access the function in a rush, my thumb would often tap the home button first – which of course initiates the back command. This is the natural place for your thumb to fall, so you have to learn to instinctively contort your digit to either side. I’m not sure how quick this process will be, but I was still getting it wrong after a solid week of usage. One other persistent annoyance I found was the way in which Flyme handled third-party notifications, with a generic speech bubble employed for a whole range of uses. Have you just received a text message, or is it a traffic update from Google Maps? They’re treated as one and the same here. This, as you can imagine, doesn’t prove too useful – other than to tell you that something is happening. Or has happened. Flyme joins its fellow Chinese Android UIs in offering up a Theme store, which essentially provides a bunch of skins covering the homescreens and menus. You could choose one that makes it all look even more like iOS, one that reflects the current season, or one that announces you as a die-hard Guns N' Roses fan. Yep, they can get pretty specific. It’s a nice idea, but in truth most of them simply make your homescreen look a little cheap and gimmicky – like you handed over its design to a moderately talented art student rather than a dedicated UI team. Meizu’s stock apps are perfectly pleasant to use, with an emphasis on clear, unobtrusive design and fluidity (again, with a hefty tip of the hat to iOS). But the only real reason you’d stick with them over Google’s alternatives, or your own third-party picks, would be that aforementioned 3D Touch compatibility. As I’ve already mentioned, the implementation of this iOS-like trick is rather half-baked and superfluous here. I forgot it existed on more than one occasion.

Ohlhausen announced today that Jessica Rich, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, is leaving the agency on February 17 after 26 years of service. “We are grateful to Jessica for her many years of service to the FTC and the public,” said Ohlhausen. “She is a pioneer in consumer protection who spearheaded major initiatives regarding consumers’ privacy, data security, and financial transactions. Many of the FTC’s programs bear her indelible mark.” As Bureau Director, Rich managed eight consumer protection divisions and eight regional offices charged with stopping consumer fraud and deception and protecting consumers’ privacy. Under her tenure, the Bureau brought a series of major law enforcement actions that returned billions of dollars to consumers, including cases against Western Union, Volkswagen, Herbalife, Apple, Google, and Amazon. She was appointed Bureau Director by former Chairwoman Edith Ramirez in 2013. Prior to that, she served in a number of senior roles at the FTC, including Deputy Director of the Bureau, Associate Director of the Division of Financial Practices, and Acting Associate Director and Assistant Director of the Division of Privacy and Identity Protection. During her tenure, Rich also led the FTC’s efforts to expand its technological expertise. She created the FTC’s Office of Technology Research and Investigations (OTech) to train staff and assist with tech-related investigations, reports, and public workshops.  She hired technologists and attorneys with tech backgrounds to bolster the FTC’s understanding of the evolving marketplace and perform original research. She developed influential FTC policy reports, including reports on the Internet of Things, Big Data, data brokers, mobile apps, and cross-device tracking. And she oversaw public fora on a range of tech-related matters, including ransomware, Smart TVs, drones, and crowdfunding. As a division manager earlier in her career, Rich spearheaded the FTC’s privacy and data security program, building it from a small team to one of the agency’s signature programs. Among other things, Rich led development of the FTC rules protecting children’s online privacy (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule) and sensitive financial information (Safeguards Rule), and brought precedent-setting enforcement actions to address the privacy and data security practices of Microsoft, BJ’s Warehouse, DSW, TJX, and ChoicePoint. Rich, who joined the agency in 1991, is a recipient of the FTC Chairman’s Award, the agency’s highest award for meritorious service, and a graduate of Harvard University and New York University Law School. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition, and protect and educate consumers.

For many of us, iPhone has become the most essential device in our lives and we love it,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. „iPhone is how we make voice and FaceTime calls, how we shoot and share Live Photos and 4K videos, how we listen to streaming music, how we use social media, how we play games, how we get directions and find new places, how we pay for things, how we surf the web, do email, manage our contacts and calendars, how we listen to podcasts, watch TV, movies and sports, and how we manage our fitness and health. iPhone has become all of these things and more.

The Ken wants to fix business journalism in India with a subscription model Posted Mar 12, 2017 by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna shines hope on the future of genetic modification at SXSW Four former reporters and entrepreneurs are attempting to fix India’s “broken” business media landscape and simultaneously prove that there’s an audience — and business — for paying for quality journalism in the country. Subscription-based media is thriving in the West. The New York Times has seen its digital subscription base swell following the election of President Trump. In tech, The Information, founded by a former Wall Street Journal editor, has thrived with a mix of trend-based reporting and news scoops, while Stratechery, an analysis-focused newsletter/blog from Taiwan-based writer Ben Thompson, has also shown the model to be lucrative. But this is India, a country where monetizing a product is difficult even if it is supremely popular. Apple sells more iPhones on launch weekend than it manages in India over a whole year, while addictive services like Netflix — far cheaper than an iPhone — have struggled to gain mainstream prominence thus far. Starting with business reporting Yet subscription is the vision behind The Ken, a Bangalore-based new media company that publishes a story per day behind a paywall. Access is priced at $108 for overseas users, or 2,750 INR ($42) for those in India. The site, which also offers $10 per-month and $25/900 INR ($13.50) per-quarter packages, is the most prominent subscription-based media play India has seen thus far. Its coverage is principally focused on technology and business, that’s the domain its founding team has experience in, but there are plans to move into new areas further down the line. “We don’t want to be seen as just covering startups, that’s a very easy trap to fall into,” co-founder and CEO Rohin Dharmakumar told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “We want to expand our coverage and be interesting enough on a daily basis but also slightly unpredictable.” The Ken — which is named after an old-fashioned English word for knowledge — is build around its community. Email is the primary communication medium, and the team of 11 takes it in turns to send daily missives to its user base — including those who are registered but not paying — that introduce the daily read with humor and thought. Once a week, the site produces a story that sits outside of its paywall for anyone to read, acting as bait to lure in new subscriptions. A sample of the daily email sent to readers Beyond straight-up pay-to-read, The Ken uses other models to help get its writing into the hands of more readers without the need for advertising. It has worked with corporate sponsors who pay to make some of its content available for free without any promotional material or advertising — mobile wallet giant Paytm, for example, sponsored a week-long free pass — while it is in the process of introducing corporate subscriptions, too. There’s no plan for article-only or daily plans, Dharmakumar explained, because that would dilute the experience and take away from building a longer-term vision and community. Make media great again Small disclaimer: I’m one of The Ken’s paying subscribers because, beyond information gathering as part of my job, I’m interested in observing the ways technology is disrupting daily life. Emerging markets — where tech is advancing almost every aspect of everyday living — are a fascination, and India, with its billion-plus population and nationwide diversity, is arguably the country where the impact of tech could be highest. Yet there are few media outlets able to tell this story with clarity, interest and — above all — accuracy. With respect to that latter point, Dharmakumar explained that The Ken started in response to what he observed to be the Indian population’s general disinterest in media. “It became very apparent that there was a crisis of business journalism in India,” he said. “People were essentially not reading newspapers, just giving up. And I don’t mean just young people, even experienced investors would prefer to catch up on news via social media.” “Coverage was dumbed down, biased, and dense — people couldn’t relate to it and couldn’t find value in it,” Dharmakumar added. Inspired by some of the aforementioned subscription-based media plays — Dharmakumar specifically mentions The Information and Stratechery — the team of four decided it was “time someone did something about this in India,” and they created The Ken. Initially the project started out with postings on social media, before introducing an email-registration-paywall to float the idea of a barrier between reader and subject matter. Satisfied with what they saw, The Ken then went live to a paying audience. Dharmakumar isn’t revealing how many readers it has right now, but he said the company has exceeded its own expectations at this point. Indeed, it actually became a profitable business within two weeks of the launch of its website before going on to raise $400,000 from a bunch of reputable angel investors this year. Some of those backers include the founders of notable Indian tech startups Paytm, TaxiForSure and Freshdesk. (Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma also backed FactorDaily, another ambitious new media startup we wrote about, alongside other India-based news websites.) “While $400,000 may not seem like a lot of money these days, it’s a significant amount to build a focused, lean media business, which has also been generating revenue right from day one. As journalists, we’ve seen too many instances of companies losing their focus and fire in the belly after raising too much money too early on,” Dharmakumar wrote in a note to subscribers announcing the financing. “Business journalism lost the plot on this, many years ago when it started churning out articles that were either incremental, one-sided, dumbed down or dry and boring. We go to great lengths to make our stories anything but,” he added. Growing into the mainstream Despite criticizing the status quo, The Ken’s CEO said the business isn’t looking to rip out the existing media system in India, rather it sees a position working within it. “We are not attempting to replace traditional newspapers, we are a complement to one,” he said. “People read the news to find out what’s happening, we focus on what comes next, who is doing what, and where is the motivation?” The company’s course for the next six months is to continue to do what it is doing while growing its audience and deepening its reporting pool. After that period, it will look to new coverage areas it can branch into to give its readership a wider selection of stories and information. Dharmakumar is also keen to expand The Ken’s readership beyond its initial focus on business professional and tech industry watchers. “We want to take our stories to younger people who feel business news isn’t for them,” he explained. First up, apps for Android and iOS will come, which will help expand from those who currently rely on email to access the site and its stories. Other planned features include a comment section for stories and a Slack channel to enables readers to engage with writers directly, potentially to help steer editorial focus or raise potential areas for storytelling.

The last one we saw at HQ is the HTC 10 evo but like its name suggests, it was just a recycled HTC 10, and however lovely that one was - it was released almost a year ago. So you see we were very excited when the HTC U Ultra came to our office. HTC might be going through a rough patch lately, but most of us remember the company's glory days, and there are still some HTC fanboys around here, disguised as iPhone and OnePlus owners. When you first get hold of the HTC U Ultra it strikes you as a large device and for a good reason. It's taller and wider than the likes of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus or the LG V20, to which the U Ultra will be compared - especially the latter. It shares a unique feature with the V20 - a secondary screen positioned right above the main one. It's a small strip of display, large enough to fit a few app shortcuts or quick toggles (for the LED flash or toggling the Wi-Fi) or display a notification. Due to the U Ultra's large frame, it's hard to reach it with a finger, and any operation with it or the main display requires two hands for safety. The fact that the HTC U Ultra is so sleek and glossy doesn't help either. Speaking of which, every part of the U Ultra is polished and slippery so you'd best be very careful with it. But that inconvenience is compensated by the beautiful design. The HTC U Ultra back changes hues depending on your angle of view. Its front is piano black, its sides either silver of very lightly cyan while its glass back is the most interesting - a pearl-like white finish that shines in gold or purple depending on the light. The only thing to disrupt the pearl-white back is the camera lens - it's very big and sticks out notably. Underneath the sapphire lens lies a 12MP camera with a f/1.8 lens and a huge 1/2.3" sensor - the same size as that of the Google Pixel and the HTC 10 - so like them the camera of the HTC U Ultra has the biggest individual pixel of any flagship these days. This camera module has proven its worth in the past, so we expect the HTC U Ultra to take some great photos too. We'll hold our judgment for now, but you can go ahead and feast your eyes on the samples below. HTC U Ultra camera samples Interestingly, the selfie camera has a higher resolution than the main one, and it puts it to good use. The HTC U Ultra snaps some of the best-looking selfies around. It has a clever Ultrapixel mode that condenses 16MP snaps into 4MP ones - great for social media and also reportedly, with improved low-light performance. Selfies A comparison to the LG V20 is inevitable as they share several features such as the screen size and the secondary screen. Yet, in real life the two devices feel very different. The HTC U Ultra is sharper, sleeker and noticeably taller. The LG V20 feels metallic but also like it's made up of more than one part, while the U Ultra feels more seamless in the hand, like a unibody phone. At first glance, the HTC U Ultra makes a great first impression. If you like big phones, the U Ultra will feel comfortable and solid. It makes a great impression with its sleekness and its polish. And underneath all of this lies some of the best hardware you can find on a phone. Check back in with us some time next week for our full HTC U Ultra review.

It was the first known security breach at the White House since Mr Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington DC police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, California. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds on Friday night and asked whether he had a pass authorising him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied: "No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment," the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he "jumped the fence". The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident and no hazardous materials were found in his backpack, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court. Tran was also carrying a US passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Mr Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. "Secret Service did a fantastic job last night," Mr Trump said from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a "troubled person" and the situation as "very sad". Mr Trump was briefed on the matter on Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Mr Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned "Russian hackers" and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found "nothing of concern to security operations". Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. Friday's security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Mr Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency after Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Ms Pierson and stabilise the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. Mr Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. Besides Mr Kelly, joining Mr Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Mr Spicer. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. "We're having some great discussions," Mr Trump said. "The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well." He talked about inheriting "a mess" when he took office, but said everything would be "straightened out fast".

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Comments aAFont Size Fence jumper caught at White House POTOMAC FALLS, Va. — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. Secret Service did a “phenomenal job” apprehending a “troubled person” who got onto the White House grounds after climbing a fence on the property while Trump was inside the Executive Mansion. It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. The Secret Service said in a statement that the person was arrested without incident on the south grounds after climbing a fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. When approached by a Secret Service officer at 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied: “No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,” a police report said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran also was carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter that he had written to the president, the complaint said. Spoke to hacker, says ex-Trump adviser WASHINGTON — A political consultant and former campaign adviser to President Donald Trump said he communicated last year with a person involved in hacking Democratic National Committee emails. But Roger Stone said the conversations were “completely innocuous.” Stone told The Washington Times that his private Twitter exchange with “Guccifer 2.0” was “so perfunctory, brief and banal” that he had forgotten about it. Last summer, emails stolen from Democrats were posted by an online persona known as Guccifer 2.0. U.S. officials believe that individual is linked to Russia. Emails stolen from the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign later were released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. The U.S. government later concluded that the Russian government directed the Democratic National Committee hack in an attempt to influence the outcome of the presidential election. ACLU debuts protester training, website CORAL GABLES, Fla. — The American Civil Liberties Union staged a nationwide training event Saturday to make sure people are aware of their rights as protesters and to urge organized, public resistance by those opposed to policies of President Donald Trump. Organizers said the event on the University of Miami campus was livestreamed to locations in all 50 states. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said 200,000 people had signed up to attend one of about 2,000 events. The event, staged town-hall-style, was aimed at capitalizing on numerous demonstrations since Trump’s election in November and to make sure people know their rights to protest, Romero said. The ACLU also launched a new grassroots online organizing platform called PeoplePower.org. It’s billed as a way for people considering a protest or rally to connect and coordinate with others around the country with similar intentions and to provide details of ACLU initiatives. Paper: Balloon-crash warnings ignored SAN ANTONIO — U.S. regulators ignored expert warnings that hot-air balloons like one that crashed in July in Texas, killing 16 people, have higher accident rates than other aircraft and similar fatality rates, the San Antonio Express-News reported. The newspaper relied on government documents and internal emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, as well as testimony given at a federal hearing on the hot-air balloon crash near Lockhart. The balloon hit high-voltage power lines and crashed July 30. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn’t require balloon pilots to take drug tests or undergo medical evaluations like other pilots. It relies on an honor system that the pilot of the doomed balloon, Alfred “Skip” Nichols, did not follow. Nichols obtained his balloon pilot’s license in Missouri in 1996. At a National Transportation Safety Board hearing in Washington in December, medical experts testified Nichols was taking medications that should have precluded him from flying.

The International Business Times in an article titled, “What’s in Vault 7? WikiLeaks publishes huge trove of CIA secrets,” would explain: WikiLeaks has revealed the contents of the long-awaited Vault 7 – a huge batch of documents allegedly detailing the hacking tools used by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The whistle-blowing organisation said it may be the largest intelligence publication in history. It also stated that these tools were used across hacked platforms. It reported: This includes Samsung TVs, Microsoft Windows, Apple iPhones and smartphones using Google’s Android operating system. The techniques could be used to give the CIA the ability “bypass the encryption” of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo and Confide, WikiLeaks said. In George Orwell’s classic novel 1984, TVs would surveil  the population, serving like a universal closed circuit television (CCTV) network. The incremental emergence of just such a surveillance state since the book’s publication has often been described as “Orwellian.” With devices such as phones, laptops, and smart TVs like those manufactured by Samsung now quite literally surveilling the public, the consequences warned of in Orwell’s works have now become a reality. While the revelations from Vault 7 suggest the US CIA and its European counterparts exploited commercial platforms to build its invasive spying network, some analysts have pointed out that many of these security exploits, backdoors and surveillance features have most likely been created with the explicit cooperation of large technology corporations. Australia’s Financial Review revealed in 2013 in an article titled, “Intel chips could let US spies inside: expert,” that: One of Silicon Valley’s most respected technology experts, Steve Blank, says he would be “surprised” if the US National Security Agency was not embedding “back doors” inside chips produced by Intel and AMD, two of the world’s largest semiconductor firms, giving them the possibility to access and control machines. Corporations like Google and Facebook, the former of which created and maintains the above mentioned Android mobile operating system, openly collaborate with the United States government and the corporate and financial interests that dominate its domestic and foreign policy. It is highly likely, that in addition to assisting US special interests in the subversion of foreign nations and the facilitation of global war and instability, both corporations are also deeply involved in assisting in surveillance, spying and manipulating the public. Decentralizing IT  The alliance between these special interests and technology corporations, particularly in light of this most recent deluge of leaked documents, highlights the fundamental importance of decentralizing the design, development, manufacturing and distribution of information technology. Nations like Russia and China already find themselves in need of producing their own computer hardware and software. The use of domestically produced processors for government computers in Russia represents one tangible solution that can be used to overcome this obvious and growing problem. Nations like Russia and China also have developed their own social media networks, search engines and even operating systems to protect their respective information spaces. Nations that rely on “security experts” from abroad often find themselves the victims of elaborate infiltration efforts that end up compromising their information space more than had they taken no measures at all. Nations like Russia and China have entire pipelines through which human resources can be created and utilized for the construction of domestic information technology infrastructure and security. Other nations, particularly in the developing world must also create similar pipelines and organizations like Google and Facebook to dilute and displace the unwarranted influence these foreign tech giants have within their borders. Likening IT security to national security, one would find it equally absurd to entrust the former to a foreign agency or enterprise. No nation would reasonably entrust the defense of their physical borders to an outside military force, so why entrust the security of their information space to similarly foreign organizations? Yet that is precisely what is happening around the world. The CIA’s overreaching power as described in the Vault 7 leaks is only possible because of the vast reach of each and every platform the US intelligence agency used in constructing its techno-panopticon. Corporations like Samsung, Microsoft, Apple and Google reach into virtually every nation on Earth where information technology is prevalent, creating a virtual sea for the CIA’s sharks to swim through and hunt in. Draining this sea through decentralizing the control these corporations currently enjoy, vastly limits the hunting grounds the CIA has access to. Despite Vault 7 making this unpleasant reality a matter of public debate and concern, being aware of such vast abuses made possible by equally vast tech monopolies is not enough. Nations and individuals creating alternatives beyond the reach of the CIA and other agencies and entities like it  is essential in rolling back or at least complicating these invasive efforts. Similar threats to privacy and security exist both across the growing “cloud” online, as well as throughout the growing physical network known as the “Internet of Things.” And while both currently consist of likewise monopolized services and platforms, there is no reason why decentralized services and platforms cannot be used instead. Designers and developers around the world already have created and have made available (many times for free) such alternatives allowing people to create their own cloud servers and services as well as their own private “Internet of Things,” independent of universal networks agencies like the CIA have likely infiltrated and compromised. As a matter of national policy, governments around the world, outside of and targeted by the US-Euro surveillance network must make IT security as much a priority today, in the modern age of information and computing, as  conventional armies, navies and air forces have been in protecting a nation’s physical territory.

If restricting H-1B visas is a Trump administration goal and there are reasons to believe that is the case, then it’s time to imagine a world in which the US has lost its technological leadership. The US government is supposed to only issue 85,000 H-1B visas a year. In reality, it issued 172,748 in fiscal year 2015, and 140,000 a year on average between 2006 and 2015. That’s because the H-1B visas are issued for three years and can be extended for a further three years. Workers already in the US often get the extensions. They also need to reapply when they switch employers. There are no official data on the size of the US H-1B community, but it should be close to a million people. The total US employment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- the fields in which H-1B workers are employed -- reached 8.6 million people in 2015. It’s often said that software engineers are the factory workers of today: Their labor is often not particularly creative or intellectually demanding. These are the kind of workers tech outsourcing firms, which account for most of the H-1B visas, bring into the US. But not all the imported brains are the 21st century equivalent of assembly-line workers. A 2013 paper by Harvard’s William Kerr and the University of Michigan’s William Lincoln showed that increases in the H-1B population caused tangible growth in the number of US patent applications filed in major cities. Only about 70 percent of patent applications, according to that paper, are filed by people with Anglo-Saxon names; a large proportion of the inventors with Chinese and Indian names appear to be H-1B workers. The thousands of H-1B workers going to Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and other major tech companies are hand-picked talent, selected from a sea of applicants. What if the US firms stop getting these valuable imports because the Trump administration is trying to force these firms to hire Americans? And what if the administration also makes it harder for US universities -- where immigrants are responsible for about three-quarters of patent applications -- to attract foreign professors and students? The US will lose much of its competitive edge in the global tech wars almost immediately. Skilled foreigners won’t apply for jobs in the US, fearing unfair treatment at the hands of a mercurial White House. Those who seek visas may not get in. European and Asian companies will begin to snap up the top talent Silicon Valley is getting today. And a window of opportunity will open for European and Asian technology firms to catch up to US behemoths. More than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more were set up by immigrants. It’s a story of foreign-born capitalists hiring foreign workers to give the US a near-monopoly advantage in several areas of the technology industry. Even today, an anti-US geek in Europe could probably make do with non-US services. He’d get a mobile phone running Samsung’s Tizen operating system, Finnish-developed Sailfish OS or a version of Linux; he’d use Moscow-based vk.com for social networking, Russian-owned Yandex or Czech-owned Seznam for search, New Zealand-based Meta for cloud storage, German-owned Here! for maps, and Berlin-based Telegram for instant messaging. But that would be a series of exotic choices. Only Chinese people forced to do without Google search or Facebook by their government are justified in opting for weaker local services. Even years of sluggish technological development -- the worst that could happen to the US market leaders if they were to lose the ability to bring in international talent -- probably wouldn’t unseat them. But in areas where the US is not dominant yet, a diminished ability to import brains may cost it a shot at similar importance. Israel, Japan or China can seize leadership in battery technology, an area in which these countries are doing pioneering research. Canadian, German and Israeli companies could beat the US in autonomous vehicle technology. Asian companies such as Samsung, Sony and HTC, as well as Finland’s Nokia, could pull ahead in virtual and augmented reality. German and Scandinavian firms might get an edge in developing storage for energy generated by solar and wind plants. The races for the Holy Grail in these respective areas are still wide open. Firms, and nations, are running full tilt to win. It may be enough for the US to turn away a few hundred specific engineers, and for some other ambitious country to pick them up, to end US leadership hopes in a future multibillion-dollar market. It’s too early for the US to rest on its laurels; tech is, to a great degree, about hype and fashion. Lifestyles and preferences change, and in 10 years’ time, the current US tech leaders may be far less relevant than they seem today. And countries that keep their best tech brains or make a special effort to lure them from elsewhere will be the new kings. By Leonid Bershidsky Leonid Bershidsky is a Bloomberg View columnist. -- Ed.

Restaurants Real Estate Home Business With unlimited plans, a world without Wi-Fi? print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Changing tech With unlimited plans, a world without Wi-Fi? By Olga Kharif / Bloomberg Published Mar 12, 2017 at 12:02AM The Wi-Fi icon — a dot with radio waves radiating outward — glows on nearly every internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight. With every major U.S. wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a Wi-Fi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render Wi-Fi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer. “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide Wi-Fi for you now.” In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of Wi-Fi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access Wi-Fi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their Wi-Fi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston. “At Sprint Corp., where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a Wi-Fi hot spot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favor Wi-Fi, customers use more Wi-Fi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behavior.” At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker. The erosion of Wi-Fi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use Wi-Fi to connect to the internet. Wi-Fi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage. Some wireless carriers also still rely on Wi-Fi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity. “Wi-Fi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the Wi-Fi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple, Samsung, LG, Intel, Qualcomm and Comcast. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like Wi-Fi is likely very optimistic.” Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. Wi-Fi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly $20 billion industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers — mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. Wi-Fi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies. A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum — or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers — risks congesting the spectrum upon which Wi-Fi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from Wi-Fi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the internet. As LTE-U moves in, Wi-Fi may get drowned out. “Places where operators have traditionally looked to Wi-Fi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts. Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with Wi-Fi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fiber networks, like Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public Wi-Fi hot spots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 manufacturer of Wi-Fi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both Wi-Fi and LTE-U technologies. “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for Wi-Fi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its Wi-Fi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said. Another technology that risks making Wi-Fi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the U.S. Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas. More reliable than Wi-Fi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc., Charter Communications Inc. and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said. On top of all these threats to Wi-Fi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals. In the nearer term, Wi-Fi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines. “Before I would have to go and find a Wi-Fi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” 16700209 View next article in Business     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

However a follow-up report later suggested that the handset might be delayed a week to the 28th of April instead. However according to a new report from KGI Securities’ Ming-Chi Kuo, he has suggested that the release of the phone is still on track for the 21st of April. It should be noted that Kuo’s track record is great when it comes to Apple predictions and rumors, so we’re not sure how accurate his claims are regarding other brands. Also we should point out that the delay was originally reported by Evan Blass, a well-known leakster with an equally impressive track record, so it’s a bit hard to say who might be right in this case. That being said, Kuo’s report goes on to “confirm” that there will be two Galaxy S8 variants: the Galaxy S8 and the S8+. He also claims that the phones sold in the US, Japan, and China will come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, while the version sold in other parts of the world will be powered by the Exynos 8895. In any case this is something we’ll have to wait and see for ourselves, so do check back with us on the 29th of March for all the official details. Filed in Cellphones >Rumors.

The two Silicon Valley companies are fighting over technology that is seen as part of the foundation of the future of transportation, self-driving vehicles. The fight is also shaping up as a rematch of legal titans from another case that riveted Silicon Valley: the smartphone patent battle between Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. Morrison Foerster, which represents Apple in that case, on Friday said it would represent Uber in the suit by Alphabet. Alphabet is represented by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents Samsung. Waymo sued Uber last month over allegations that a former employee downloaded and stole more than 14,000 confidential files, including details on light detection and ranging sensor technology known as Lidar. Uber has denied the claims. It did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Lidar systems are similar to radar and shoot light beams to map out a street or environment. They are a crucial element of most self-driving car systems. Waymo, which originally said that two Lidar patents were infringed, on Friday in an amended complaint added a third patent. It also said that Uber infringed unpatented trade secrets, such as parameters and measurements for the light beam used in Lidar. It also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on the Lidar technology in question.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 12 March 2017 | MYT 2:00 PM A world without WiFi looks possible as unlimited plans rise Under siege: Good old WiFi is being beset by a whole new set of technologies, like LTE-U, CBRS and 5G, which threaten to render it obsolete. — AFP Relaxnews The WiFi icon – a dot with radio waves radiating outward – glows on nearly every Internet-connected device, from the iPhone to thermostats to TVs. But it’s starting to fade from the limelight.  With every major US wireless carrier now offering unlimited data plans, consumers don’t need to log on to a WiFi network to avoid costly overage charges anymore. That’s a critical change that threatens to render WiFi obsolete. And with new competitive technologies crowding in, the future looks even dimmer.  “You could see a big switch,” said Tim Farrar, founder of Telecom Media Finance Associates Inc. “Your coffee shops may be less compelled to provide WiFi for you now.”  In an all-data-you-can-eat world, consumers’ use of WiFi at public places like stadiums and airports will drop to a third of all mobile data traffic from about half, Farrar estimates. This means businesses not upgrading public access WiFi as often. Smartphone users might not even turn on their WiFi capability, according to Barry Gilbert, an analyst at researcher Strategy Analytics in Boston.  “At Sprint Corp, where unlimited plans are the norm, customers aren’t waiting until they get to a WiFi hotspot to watch the latest video. They are staying on cellular,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson LLC. “Customers are rational. When pricing incentives favour WiFi, customers use more WiFi. When pricing incentives shift, so does behaviour.”  At home as well. Almost a third of people don’t use a home broadband Internet connection because they have an unlimited data plan on their phones, according to a survey released Thursday by ReportLinker.  The erosion of WiFi’s influence is likely to be slow and uneven. While unlimited data plans make the technology less necessary for phones, many home devices, from a MacBook to an Amazon Echo, still use WiFi to connect to the Internet. WiFi also helps fill in gaps in some office buildings and homes that have spotty cellphone coverage.  Some wireless carriers also still rely on WiFi networks to handle a large portion of the growing volume of Internet traffic. Putting all of that Netflix-binging and Spotify-listening on cellular networks could strain capacity.  “WiFi has consistently stayed ahead in terms of performance and its ability to move large amounts of data,” said Kevin Robinson, vice president of marketing for the WiFi Alliance, a consortium of more than 700 companies, including Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, LG Electronics Inc, Intel Corp, Qualcomm Inc and Comcast Corp. “The market is going to decide which technology provides the best capabilities for the end user. To displace a technology like WiFi is likely very optimistic.”  Unlimited plans aren’t the only threat. WiFi has survived 20 years and spurred a roughly US$20bil (RM89.07bil) industry of gear, service providers and chipmakers – mainly because its technology is open to innovation and it operates freely in the nation’s unlicensed airwaves. WiFi now faces competition from other technologies that also run in those same frequencies.  Crowded airwaves  A new system called LTE in Unlicensed Spectrum – or LTE-U, which depends on a combination of new small-cell towers and home wireless routers – risks congesting the spectrum upon which WiFi relies. In decades past, the nation’s unlicensed airwaves were mostly known for their use by garage door openers, cordless phones, and the occasional baby monitor. Now they’re full of traffic from WiFi networks that connect smartphones, laptops, set-top boxes, game consoles, and a whole host of smart devices to the Internet. As LTE-U moves in, WiFi may get drowned out.  “Places where operators have traditionally looked to WiFi, they’ll leverage LTE-U,” said Kyung Mun, an analyst at researcher Mobile Experts.  Developed by cellular carriers and their vendors, LTE-U may act as a disincentive for companies experimenting with WiFi calling, including Comcast, and those dabbling in fibre networks, like Alphabet Inc’s Google.  But LTE-U also benefits users. Consumers don’t have to type in passwords and sign in to every network like they do for public WiFi hotspots. They can seamlessly move between their carriers’ cellular network and LTE-U, and not really know the difference.  LTE-U – and a related cellular advancement, LTE-LAA – will also require less equipment. A 180,000-square-foot building would need 24 new access points instead of about 80 WiFi hot spots, according to Amit Jain, vice president of marketing and product management at hardware maker SpiderCloud Wireless, which plans to ship LTE-U and LTE-LAA equipment in the second quarter. However, the total cost of deployment will be similar to Wi-Fi, Jain said.  Annual shipments of LTE-U/LTE-LAA-capable access points will increase to about 1.1 million units globally by 2020, up from tens of thousands in 2016, according to Mobile Experts.  “You could see LTE in the house, in the enterprise, and the role of WiFi morphing into something different: a legacy technology,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma.  Companies like Cisco Systems Inc, the No. 1 manufacturer of WiFi access points, are already considering developing new gear that can accommodate both WiFi and LTE-U technologies.  “It’s too early to say what will win out,” said Mike Iandolo, vice president and general manager at the mobile technology group at Cisco. “LTE has an advantage, but there’ll still be a place for WiFi.” The company’s goal is to ensure its WiFi portfolio evolves to meet the needs of customers, he said.  Citizen action  Another technology that risks making WiFi outmoded is something called CBRS, short for Citizens Broadband Radio Service. The new system lets anyone share a huge swath of spectrum currently being used by the US Navy. In February, Nokia Oyj, Alphabet and Qualcomm tested LTE technology on the airwaves to broadcast a live high-definition video of cars racing on a track in Las Vegas.  More reliable than WiFi, CBRS may ultimately be a better option for factories, airports and ports, according to Michael Peeters, head of innovation portfolio management at Nokia and president of CBRS Alliance, whose membership includes AT&T Inc, Charter Communications Inc and Comcast. The first CBRS devices should be certified for use in mid-2017, he said.  On top of all these threats to WiFi is the coming spread of 5G, which promises to let consumers download a high-definition movie in less than a second. By using CBRS, wireless carriers can deploy 5G faster and easier, using the shared airwaves instead of trying to acquire spectrum licenses at auction or through deals.  In the nearer term, WiFi is already starting to disappear from people’s daily routines.  “Before I would have to go and find a WiFi hot spot, which was very inconvenient for me,” said Michael Kimbrough, an entrepreneur in Birmingham, Alabama, who last month signed up for an unlimited data plan from Verizon Wireless. “Now I don’t have to do that.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested The Making of the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a three-part documentary Maybank’s new mobile app goes live for Android and iOS Expert: Girl who drove on wrong side of highway may have hyperactivity disorder The 'gay moment' that was cut - when Le Fou shows love bite A soft spot for Peter‘s pork noodles Will your parents be a burden to you?

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Published March 12. 2017 12:58AM | Updated March 12. 2017 10:54PM By DARLENE SUPERVILLE POTOMAC FALLS, Va. (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday praised the U.S. Secret Service for doing a "fantastic job" apprehending a "troubled person" who climbed a fence and was approaching a south entrance to the White House while Trump was inside the executive mansion. It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, "No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment," the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he "jumped the fence." The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. "Secret Service did a fantastic job last night," Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a "troubled person" and the situation as "very sad." Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned "Russian hackers" and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found "nothing of concern to security operations." Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. Friday's security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson and stabilize the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. Besides Kelly, joining Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Spicer. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. "We're having some great discussions," Trump said. "The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well." He talked about inheriting "a mess" when he took office, but said everything would be "straightened out fast." ------ Associated Press writer Matt Barakat in McLean, Va., contributed to this report. ------ Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap   White House press secretary Sean Spice, speaks to reporters as President Donald Trump meets with some members of his Cabinet and the White House staff, Saturday, March 11, 2017, at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 March 2017 by Military News Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is STILL a Powerhouse Shutterstock photo InvestorPlace – Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Investors should consider holding diversified companies as part of their investing strategy. These conglomerates operate in multinational jurisdictions, don’t rely on a single sector for revenue and in some cases, pay out a regular dividend. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) General Electric Company (NYSE: GE ), whose shares are valued at just 15.7 times forward earnings, has a dividend yielding 3.2%. Its long-term debt (of 1.39x equity) is more than manageable. If GE stock dips more, this is the stock to consider. In the third quarter, General Electric was third only to Microsoft Corporation  (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) in buying back shares. In Q3, the company bought back $3.7 billion. Apple repurchased $6 billion, while Microsoft bought back $4.4 billion. GE returned $30.5 billion to shareholders last year. This included a share buyback of $22 billion. The company is not a favorite pick among the analysts, despite the respectable General Electric dividend. JPMorgan added GE stock as a top stock to avoid, citing sub-par core operating performance. Investors need not pay any attention to analysts there. General Electric has strong leadership under CEO Jeffrey Immelt. It is embracing technology by focusing on the Internet of Things with its „smart machines” development. Growth Potential of GE Stock General Electric’s move to merge its oil and gas services business with  Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI ) is a net positive. The energy sector is uncertain and it faces slow growth. Despite the challenging oil and gas market ahead, GE stock still kept up with its pace of dividends and share buybacks. On its fourth-quarter conference call, General Electric said the sector is stabilizing : „In oil and gas, the environment continues to be challenging and activity levels remain muted, external market indicators appear to be stabilizing with expected more balanced supply and demand fundamentals, partly influenced by the recent OPEC production agreement. U.S. onshore rig count grew 33% versus the third quarter, but was essentially flat versus the beginning of the year.” Although orders fell 27% year-over-year, GE forecast no change in E&P spending. If the oil and gas market bottomed late last year, the company will start seeing orders growing at its Alstom unit. The offshore drilling and sub-sea will still be a drag this year. General Electric hopes business picks up in North America onshore. It also needs the Middle East and Europe to stabilize. If that does not happen, this segment will not meet the company’s expectation of a smaller revenue decline in the second half of the year. General Electric’s Earnings Outlook The 2017 earnings-per-share forecast of $1.60 to $1.70 a share may prove too low an estimate for GE stock. In the meantime, management is continuing with its plans on returning between $19 billion to $21 billion to shareholders this year. General Electric reported respectable growth in many of its units. For example, revenue at HCS (health and life science) grew by 2 %. Immelt expects Aviation to grow again this year. GE is also improving its operating efficiency. A new IT structure that runs horizontally will save the company around $450 million. Investors shouldn’t only consider General Electric the bellwether of the U.S. economy’s health, as its prospects also depend on the health of the world economy. A strong ISM manufacturing index number , which hit a two-year high, is just a one indicator suggesting GE stock’s outlook is bright. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, “No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,” the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he “jumped the fence.” The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. “Secret Service did a fantastic job last night,” Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a “troubled person” and the situation as “very sad.” Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned “Russian hackers” and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found “nothing of concern to security operations.” Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. Friday’s security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency’s director, Julia Pierson, the following month.

The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson and stabilize the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. Besides Kelly, joining Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Spicer. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. "We're having some great discussions," Trump said. "The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well." He talked about inheriting "a mess" when he took office, but said everything would be "straightened out fast." Associated Press writer Matt Barakat in McLean, Virginia, contributed to this report.

Its story began when, former schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were short of money to pay their rent, so they inflated an airbed, and hired out the sleeping space, for, as they put it later, “a few bucks.” Another friend, Nathan Blecharczyk, was an Internet ‘techie’ and, seeing the possibilities convinced the others to launch Airbed & Breakfast, evolving in August 2008 as AirBed&Breakfast.com. The partners funded the website by such diverse means as selling specially branded breakfast cereals, and as part of their strategy to attract crowdfunding, changed their name to Airbnb.com in March 2009. In a demonstration of how clever marketing, and giving people ‘something for nothing,’ can be insanely successful. It is an astonishing, almost inspirational story, that ranks alongside Steve Job’s Apple, and Mark Zuckerberg’s facebook, as a societal face-changer, or maybe that should read space-changer. Airbnb is seen as an opportunity for people to rent out spare rooms, or even their entire apartment or house, while they are not at home, thus earning some extra cash, and the company currently boasts on their website of more than 3 million listings globally, and 15 million guests worldwide, to date. So they must be doing something right, only the knives are out for the tall poppies of the accommodation ‘industry.’ I guess they, the Airbnb guys, probably wondered how they got away with it for so long, but now, the two global interest bodies who are piqued by the success of the upstarts, the taxman, and the big hotel chains, are starting to fight back. Now, whether they are right or not, is another question I guess, but the reality is that all over the world the purveyors of three, four and five star hotels, are rolling up their sleeves, and there’s no way they will fight fair! And we can forget any notion of Airbnb being a Don Quixotic presence in the hospitality industry. They are not doing it to help Joe Bloggs earn a few bob, they are doing it to earn dollars, via commissions, and they are using those ordinary ‘Joes’ to do it for them. I’m ambivalent, currently, about the outcome, but I do have concerns about the security aspect of people letting complete strangers into their homes. I guess that, for me, is the saving grace of the not as successful, couch-surfing. No money changes hands, and ‘guests’ are referred and recommended. The security aspect appears much less concerning. Anyway, I digress. This week, a New Zealand Tenancy Tribunal found against a couple letting out a room of their tenanted house, saying that it constituted ‘sub-letting’ and was therefore against the tenancy agreement with their landlord. They were required to pay $1300 of the $1500 they made from the deal, in reparation. Even worse, the taxation authorities are now looking closely at their finances. Inland Revenue New Zealand has reported that it is reviewing Airbnb operations, and is sending signals that, while a weekend here and there might be okay as a ‘little earner,’ they will certainly look to take their slice of pie from anyone obviously seeking to circumvent taxation. “At the end of the day,” said a spokesman, “if it is earnings, we will want what we are legally entitled to.” Airbnb is also sailing in somewhat muddier water in some areas as reports of discrimination begin to surface in the US, and all because someone publicised their interpretation that the Civil Rights Act (1968), actually allowed discrimination on the basis of race or religion, due to sub-letting not being mentioned in the act. San Francisco Mayor, Ed Lee, in 2014, bucked the trend by actually promoting, and passing through council, a law change allowing short term lets. Those engaged however, must be registered with the council, have public liability insurance, and pay city taxes of 14 per cent, the same as the big hotels. The Irish government supports the Airbnb concept, Canada is, like the States, divided, Germany and Europe are scrambling to protect their extensive hotel and B&B cultures, as much as the businesses, and globally, it appears the issue is polarising societies and governments. And what of Airbnb in Oman? Having checked out their web offerings, there is little to be critical of, with the prices generally much more reasonable than the local hotel industry. But, you bnb’ers, I don’t really think anyone is gonna leave you alone for too long, so ‘make hay, while the sun shines,’ might be a good philosophy. Airbnb is a remarkable phenomenon, changing the way the new generation vacations and visits, will the enthusiasm of the new age sleepover be enough to fight off corporate muscle. I don’t know, but it will be interesting to see if their recent stumbles, become a fall. — petersen_ray@hotmail.com About the author View all articles by Ray Petersen ← Dramatic day sets Team Oman Air up for battle A need to boost handicrafts industries → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent HM congratulates Irish president Trump’s travel ban faces block again Military wins big; environment, aid lose Municipality signs agreement for running Muttrah Fish Market Read More ...

The incident happened just before midnight while the President was at the White House. The suspect, identified in court records as Jonathan T. Tran, 26, of California, told the agency's officers that he was there to see the President. "No, I am a friend of the President. I have an appointment," Tran said when approached by an officer, according to a report released Saturday by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. Asked how he got there, Tran told officers: "I jumped the fence." The arresting officers found two cans of mace and a passport on Tran, who appeared in D.C. Superior Court shortly before 5 p.m. dressed in a dark blue hoodie and khakis. He spoke only briefly, offering a faint "yes" when told his rights. He faces a charge of unlawful entry and will be arraigned in federal court on Monday. The judge said there was probable cause to hold Tran because he could pose a flight risk and danger to the community. The police report, obtained by CNN, offers a description of the incident. White House security footage showed Tran jumping the fence at the northwest courtyard of the Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House, the report said. He was not detected, however, until approached by a uniformed Secret Service officer. At one point, Tran hid behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the south portico entrance, according to a complaint filed in US District Court. Secret Service officer Wayne Azevedo said in the complaint that during a search after the arrest, "two cans of mace were found on Tran, including one his jacket pocket. Tran was also carrying among other things, a United States passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by President Trump, and a letter he had written to President Trump." Azevedo also said "in the letter, Tran mentioned Russian hackers and said he had information of relevance. Tran alleged that he had been followed, and his 'phone and email communications (had been) read by third parties,' and that he had 'been called schizophrenic.'" After the incident, the White House was placed under security condition "orange," one of the highest levels of security for the Secret Service, an agency source said. The President was alerted about the intrusion late Friday night, an administration official said. The suspect was arrested by the Secret Service "without further incident," the Secret Service said in its statement. Trump said Saturday that the suspect was disturbed, calling the situation "sad" and saying he appreciates the work of the Secret Service. "The service did a fantastic job," the President said to reporters during a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia. "It was a troubled person. It was very sad." A Secret Service source said the backpack Tran carried was x-rayed before bomb technicians removed it from the White House grounds for further evaluation. The backpack was found to be free of any hazardous materials, the Secret Service said in its statement. But that brief statement released by a spokesman Saturday morning seemed to downplay the incident and contained very few of the details in the police reports and court records, including how close the suspect came to the residence, his intention to see the President and the mace he was carrying. A special Secret Service intelligence team interviewed Tran, who was taken into custody by Washington police. The suspect has no criminal history and no previous history involving the Secret Service, that agency said. A Secret Service emergency response team searched the entire White House grounds with K-9 dogs, including the first lady's garden, which is near the south entrance of the residence. Extensive searches were also conducted on East Executive Avenue and East Wing roadway. "Nothing of concern to security operations was found," the Secret Service said in its statement. The suspect's 19-year-old younger brother, Brian, from Milpitas, California, said Tran was "troubled" after being laid off from his job at an electrical engineering company. Tran had been "living in his car and eating junk food," his brother said. Tran graduated from San Jose State University with an electrical engineering degree and had been "stressed out from the job," his brother said. A Secret Service agent called Tran's family's home Friday night to inform them of the fence-jumping incident, his brother said, adding that his mother is "very troubled" about the matter. Tran has been "a very good brother to me," said the brother, a mechanical engineering major at San Jose State University. The investigation into the security breach continued Saturday as the Secret Service tried to determine how Tran gained entrance to the highly fortified White House complex without being detected, officials said. It is the first known major security incident at the White House since Trump became president two months ago. Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent, said Saturday on "CNN Newsroom" that the breach has the potential to be "catastrophic." "This is really troubling," said Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. "If someone came over the northwest fence of the Treasury complex, what that indicates is they didn't go over just one fence, they went over multiple fences. This has the potential to be a catastrophic breach of the White House complex. This is really disturbing, just the amount of real estate that this intruder was able to gain or bypass on the complex." "So the Secret Service has to really take a very hard look very quickly as to why weren't other defense measures alerted," Wackrow said. Asked Saturday if the Secret Service handled the situation correctly, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, the "Secret Service did a phenomenal job and they continue to provide phenomenal protection to the President and the first family, and the President was very appreciative of their efforts." Spicer added that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly "was kept aware of the situation the entire time." There have been numerous instances of people trespassing on the White House grounds over the last several years. In one notable instance in 2014, 42-year-old Omar Gonzales, of Copperas Cove, Texas, made it through the north portico doors with a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife in his pants pocket, according to the Secret Service. Gonzalez was apprehended just after making it inside the doors, the Secret Service said. The first family was not at the White House at the time. In another, the Secret Service apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn after he scaled the fence wearing an American flag-like cape while the first family was inside the residence celebrating Thanksgiving in 2015. Other incidents of trespassing include: A man tossed a backpack over the north fence in April 2016 before jumping over himself, where he was arrested. In April 2015, Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex while carrying a suspicious package, later deemed harmless, and was cornered by security dogs. Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, barely made it onto the lawn in October 2014 before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs, the Secret Service said. Adesanya, who suffers from mental health problems, had been arrested in a previous White House breach, his father said. In April 2014, a man wearing a hat of the Pokemon character Pikachu made it over the White House fence and onto the north lawn, where he was apprehended, the New York Daily News reported.

By Paul Ausick March 8, 2017 8:30 am EDT Print Email Tweet The Pixel smartphone from Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), has proven to be a major success for the company, at least as far as delivery delays can measure these things. The phones were unavailable to ship beginning in mid-January but have continued to sell, even including a projected two-month delay in actual shipments. Last Friday the company said it was working on the next generation of Pixel phones and, if everything goes according to plan, Google watchers expect the new phones to be launched in October. The annual update cycle that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has followed since launching the first iPhone in 2007 has become established as the industry norm, and Google’s senior vice-president for hardware, Rick Osterloh, said last week that consumers “can count on a successor this year,” even though he didn’t give a date. One feature missing from the next Pixel phone is likely to be the headphone jack, at least according to a report at 9to5Google. Apple dropped the 3.5 mm jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and it appears that Google is planning to do the same thing with the Pixel 2 and 2 XL, as the phones are being called now. Google used the headphone jack on the first Pixel phone as a differentiator from the iPhone, even promoting the jack as “satisfyingly not new.” But times change. Given that a dedicated headphone jack takes a relatively large amount of room in a very confined space, it makes sense that Google would want to use that space to support other, more advanced features. Competitor Samsung has already indicated that it intends to retain the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the upcoming Galaxy S8 phone. Osterloh also said that the Pixel 2 will continue to be the premium Android phone. The company has no plans to launch a more moderately priced phone, preferring, it seems, to leave that space for third-party players.

President Trump was in the White House at the time and was unharmed. A man carrying a backpack with mace and a letter for President Donald Trump was arrested Friday night after he breached security at the White House complex and was discovered by a Secret Service officer near the south entrance to the executive residence, officials said. The incident happened just before midnight while the President was at the White House. The suspect, identified in court records as Jonathan T. Tran, 26, of California, told the agency’s officers that he was there to see the President. “No, I am a friend of the President. I have an appointment,” Tran said when approached by an officer, according to a report released Saturday by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. Asked how he got there, Tran told officers: “I jumped the fence.” The arresting officers found two cans of mace and a passport on Tran, who appeared in D.C. Superior Court shortly before 5 p.m. dressed in a dark blue hoodie and khakis. He spoke only briefly, offering a faint “yes” when told his rights. He faces a charge of unlawful entry and will be arraigned in federal court on Monday. The judge said there was probable cause to hold Tran because he could pose a flight risk and danger to the community. The police report, obtained by CNN, offers a description of the incident. White House security footage showed Tran jumping the face at the northwest courtyard of the Treasury Building, which is adjacent to the White House, the report said. He was not detected, however, until approached by a uniformed Secret Service officer. At one point, Tran hid behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the south portico entrance, according to a complaint filed in US District Court. Secret Service officer Wayne Azevedo said in the complaint that during a search after the arrest, “two cans of mace were found on Tran, including one his jacket pocket. Tran was also carrying among other things, a United States passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by President Trump, and a letter he had written to President Trump.” Azevedo also said “in the letter, Tran mentioned Russian hackers and said he had information of relevance. Tran alleged that he had been followed, and his ‘phone and email communications (had been) read by third parties,’ and that he had ‘been called schizophrenic.'” After the incident, the White House was placed under security condition “orange,” one of the highest levels of security for the Secret Service, an agency source said. The President was alerted about the intrusion late Friday night, an administration official said. The suspect was arrested by the Secret Service “without further incident,” the Secret Service said in its statement. Trump said Saturday that the suspect was disturbed, calling the situation “sad” and saying he appreciates the work of the Secret Service. “The service did a fantastic job,” the President said to reporters during a lunch meeting with Cabinet officials at the Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, Virginia. “It was a troubled person. It was very sad.” A Secret Service source said the backpack Tran carried was x-rayed before bomb technicians removed it from the White House grounds for further evaluation. The backpack was found to be free of any hazardous materials, the Secret Service said in its statement. But that brief statement released by a spokesman Saturday morning seemed to downplay the incident and contained very few of the details in the police reports and court records, including how close the suspect came to the residence, his intention to see the President and the mace he was carrying. A special Secret Service intelligence team interviewed Tran, who was taken into custody by Washington police. The suspect has no criminal history and no previous history involving the Secret Service, that agency said. A Secret Service emergency response team searched the entire White House grounds with K-9 dogs, including the first lady’s garden, which is near the south entrance of the residence. Extensive searches were also conducted on East Executive Avenue and East Wing roadway. “Nothing of concern to security operations was found,” the Secret Service said in its statement. The suspect’s 19-year-old younger brother, Brian, from Milpitas, California, said Tran was “troubled” after being laid off from his job at an electrical engineering company. Tran had been “living in his car and eating junk food,” his brother said. Tran graduated from San Jose State University with an electrical engineering degree and had been “stressed out from the job,” his brother said. A Secret Service agent called Tran’s family’s home Friday night to inform them of the fence-jumping incident, his brother said, adding that his mother is “very troubled” about the matter. Tran has been “a very good brother to me,” said the brother, a mechanical engineering major at San Jose State University. The investigation into the security breach continued Saturday as the Secret Service tried to determine how Tran gained entrance to the highly fortified White House complex without being detected, officials said. It is the first known major security incident at the White House since Trump became president two months ago. Jonathan Wackrow, a former Secret Service agent, said Saturday on “CNN Newsroom” that the breach has the potential to be “catastrophic.” “This is really troubling,” said Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “If someone came over the northwest fence of the Treasury complex, what that indicates is they didn’t go over just one fence, they went over multiple fences. This has the potential to be a catastrophic breach of the White House complex. This is really disturbing, just the amount of real estate that this intruder was able to gain or bypass on the complex.” “So the Secret Service has to really take a very hard look very quickly as to why weren’t other defense measures alerted,” Wackrow said. Asked Saturday if the Secret Service handled the situation correctly, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, the “Secret Service did a phenomenal job and they continue to provide phenomenal protection to the President and the first family, and the President was very appreciative of their efforts.” Spicer added that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly “was kept aware of the situation the entire time.” There have been numerous instances of people trespassing on the White House grounds over the last several years. In one notable instance in 2014, 42-year-old Omar Gonzales, of Copperas Cove, Texas, made it through the north portico doors with a three-and-a-half-inch folding knife in his pants pocket, according to the Secret Service. Gonzalez was apprehended just after making it inside the doors, the Secret Service said. The first family was not at the White House at the time. In another, the Secret Service apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn after he scaled the fence wearing an American flag-like cape while the first family was inside the residence celebrating Thanksgiving in 2015. Other incidents of trespassing include: A man tossed a backpack over the north fence in April 2016 before jumping over himself, where he was arrested. In April 2015, Jerome R. Hunt, of Hayward, California, climbed the fence on the south side of the White House complex while carrying a suspicious package, later deemed harmless, and was cornered by security dogs. Dominic Adesanya, 23, of Bel Air, Maryland, barely made it onto the lawn in October 2014 before he was subdued as he fought off two police dogs, the Secret Service said. Adesanya, who suffers from mental health problems, had been arrested in a previous White House breach, his father said. In April 2014, a man wearing a hat of the Pokemon character Pikachu made it over the White House fence and onto the north lawn, where he was apprehended, the New York Daily News reported.

Unpacking the chicken box: The story behind Baltimore's carryout staple News Nation/World Trump praises arrest of 'troubled person' who jumped fence at White House White House intruder Estelle Doro / AP The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House. The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House. (Estelle Doro / AP) Darlene SupervilleAssociated Press President Donald Trump on Saturday praised the U.S. Secret Service for doing a "fantastic job" apprehending a "troubled person" who climbed a fence and was approaching a south entrance to the White House while Trump was inside the executive mansion. It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, California. When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, "No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment," the police report said. Asked how he got there, he said he "jumped the fence." The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident and no hazardous materials were found in his backpack, the agency said. Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. "Secret Service did a fantastic job last night," Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a "troubled person" and the situation as "very sad." Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned "Russian hackers" and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found "nothing of concern to security operations." Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. Friday's security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson and stabilize the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. Besides Kelly, joining Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Spicer. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. "We're having some great discussions," Trump said. "The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well." He talked about inheriting "a mess" when he took office, but said everything would be "straightened out fast." Associated Press writer Matt Barakat in McLean, Virginia, contributed to this report.

Armun Asgari (TMFFuture) Mar 11, 2017 at 7:07PM This article is the first in a two-part series aimed at exploring the rapidly developing state of voice computing from the investor's perspective. In Part I, I discuss why it's now increasingly clear that the human voice will become society's next major computing interface, and why it will continue proliferating through our homes and businesses. In Part II, I'll dive deeper into the new and emerging business models. In Part II, I'll discuss the various players involved in the race to commercialize the technology -- those best-positioned to profit today, those positioning themselves to thrive tomorrow, and those dropping the ball entirely. I'll also dive deeper into the fascinating business models voice computing will soon enable, and how those models will evolve as the technology continues to improve. Image source: Getty Images. For nearly 40 years, we've seen the computer evolve into an indispensable accessory of Western society driven by three powerful technologies that defined their eras and played a monumental role for investors along the way. The personal computer gave many of us our first glimpse at the digital world, normalizing the idea that such machines have a place in our homes and everyday lives. The internet tapped us into that world, offering us endless floods of information, entertainment, and commerce around which we willingly began shaping our civilization. And then the smartphone encouraged us to take that digital world everywhere we go, leaving nothing but a few taps on a touchscreen between us, our computers, and constant immersion. Now, a fourth technology -- voice computing -- is removing that last barrier. Reimagining the roles computers play Imagine driving down the highway, coming home from work, and without taking your hands off the wheel or hitting any buttons, asking your car to turn up the heat in your house, preheat the oven for dinner, and play your favorite album, all in the same breath. Picture negotiating with a street vendor in Beijing, having your phone translate the entire conversation between Mandarin and English out loud, so you can haggle in real time. Or how about a stuffed animal that can tell your daughter interactive stories every night before bed, reshaping the adventure at every twist and turn based on her responses and reactions. These aren't hypothetical scenarios -- they're happening right now. The human voice is well on its way to becoming the next major medium we use to interact with computers, and as we'll explore in this two-part series, voice computing is the burgeoning field of technology making it possible. Already spanning multiple consumer and enterprise ventures (think call center routing, digital dictation, or the virtual assistants on smartphones), the industry's ultimate aim is enabling people to carry on hands-free, conversational-style interactions with computers. It's an ambitious prospect capable of significantly expanding the roles computers play in our everyday lives, but it's also one that appears inevitable when considering the trajectory computers have taken, without fail, since their introduction, evolving in shape and form around contemporary technology to solve unmet needs. Image Source: Getty Images. And yet voice computing's evolution is different. Unlike any form of computing to come before it, the technology bypasses the physical realm, allowing users to query the internet, manage their surroundings, and connect to third-party services without ever having to touch a physical device -- all in the time it takes to form a sentence. If that sounds unnecessary, then consider just how limitless the applications could be. From the surgeon who needs to rapidly adjust the conditions of her operating room mid-procedure, to the disabled veteran who simply hopes to access the appliances in his home. The sheer number of everyday applications for such a technology has prompted Grand View Research to project the global market for voice recognition technology will reach $128 billion annually by 2024, an estimate that may undershoot the overall economic opportunity at play considering the potential verticals include healthcare, defense, entertainment, consumer goods, and more (I'll discuss these in more detail in Part II). There is one thing we can be certain of, however. Voice computing is extremely likely to transform the way we interact with technology in society, but before that can happen, a large-scale societal shift toward adopting the interface must occur, a shift that cannot occur until several key hurdles are overcome. Understanding the challenges ahead To analyze those obstacles, let's turn to the most promising application of voice-driven technology today: virtual digital assistants. Data Sources: Socratic Technologies, Vantiv, Statista. Chart by Author. Thanks to the success of the iPhone and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) other devices, Siri is currently the most widely used virtual assistant in the United States, but until recently, it's also perfectly exemplified what's holding voice computing back. To put it simply, speaking with Siri can often feel more like a novelty than a time-saver, a sentiment shared not just among Apple users, but most smartphone owners with access to similar voice computing technology. It's a problem we can break down into three fundamental hurdles. The first is that users must often resort to awkward combinations of hyper-specific phrasing and hurried robo-speak to have their speech accurately recognized. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and one the most respected names in the field, perhaps put it best in 2015 when he noted, "Speech recognition, depending on the circumstances, is say 95 per cent accurate. So maybe it gets one word in 20 wrong. That's really annoying if it gets one in 20 wrong and you probably don't want to use it very often. That's probably where speech recognition is today." The second hurdle is that even when our speech is correctly recognized, there still remains a strong chance it will be misinterpreted while undergoing natural language understanding, a process in which the assistant attempts to comprehend what we want using the sequence of words (and eventually, the tone, pace, and inflection) we give. And even if that speech is correctly understood, an assistant may still simply be unable to solve for the request due to technical constraints. Examples of both cases can be seen in the screenshot below, along with a sense of how frustrating the encounter can be. Image Source: Author's iPhone. Encounters like these make us feel as though we're wasting our time trusting our phones to do what we could have done ourselves with only a little more effort upfront. Over time, they build up, eventually discouraging us from even trying to use our assistants for anything complex, instead relying on them only for the most trivial of tasks, like setting alarms or creating reminders. Thankfully, these first two hurdles are solvable with data, third-party partnerships, and time, each of which the major players in this space have been actively accruing for years. Returning to our example, since Siri was introduced to the world in 2011, virtual assistants have grown far more capable of correctly interpreting requests thanks to advances in deep learning, a thriving field of AI being utilized by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Baidu, and others to improve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and other components of voice computing at astounding rates. (Click here for an outstanding story by The New York Times on Google's significant role in making this happen). Equally as important, decisions by Apple and its competitors to open their platforms up to third-party services have made today's voice-based assistants feel far more capable than in years past. These decisions allow Siri, for example, to call you a ride using your Uber account, or order a pizza through your stored Domino's information -- not unlike an actual secretary would do. As the potential behind voice computing becomes increasingly obvious in the coming months and years, we should expect more and more third parties to hop on board, eventually expanding the scope of what a partnership could entail (instead of ordering an Uber, imagine ordering a plane ticket). One look at the rate of growth for third-party commands available on Amazon's voice-based assistant, Alexa, can tell us a lot. Data Source: Voicebot. Chart by Author. With time, these technical achievements and partnerships will continue compounding, eventually making for a highly practical voice computing experience. Even marginal improvements in the technology will convince users to begin using voice as an interface more frequently. In the same talk regarding the current state of the voice industry, Ng went on to say, "I think that as speech recognition accuracy goes from say 95 per cent to 98, 99 to 99.9, all of us in the room will go from barely using it today, to using it all the time." He added, "Most people underestimate the difference between 95 and 99 per cent ... 99 per cent is a game changer." Although we're not yet able to predict when the technology will reach that point, if the recent pace of progress is any indication -- since Ng's speech, Baidu has built a program capable of dictating English three times faster, and with 20% less errors, than human beings -- it won't be much longer. In the meantime, an arguably far more important hurdle stands in the way. It's a problem shared by every other major computing medium in use today, only voice is actually solving for it. An instantaneous computing experience No matter the medium, we've always interacted with computers by issuing commands. In the 1950s, we meticulously punched those commands into cards before feeding them into hulking machines. Now, technology allows us to simply type, click, and, increasingly, speak them and expect a result. Yet despite these advancements, today's mediums still subject users to a unique set of delays, a sort of friction that inherently slows down the process between thinking a command and actually being able to communicate that command to your devices. A decade ago, that friction most likely entailed tracking down a PC with internet, using the mouse to open a browser, using the keyboard to run a search, and then sorting for the result. But today, for most Americans, it simply means reaching into our pockets for our phone, scrolling with our thumb, and tapping away. It's a process so effortless, the average American now checks their phone an estimated 46 times per day. It's even become fashionable to argue there's no longer enough friction separating society from our devices; that we're too plugged in to the digital world. So when you consider that voice computing's primary advantage is eliminating friction, it becomes tempting to dismiss the technology as a solution to a trivial problem. What that argument critically fails to consider, however, is that friction is about more than simple convenience, and that any amount of friction, no matter how small, fundamentally limits the dynamic between a user and their computing medium in two ways. Let's take the smartphone for example. Image Source: Pixabay. The seemingly trivial motions we make when reaching for our phone still require us to be in immediate proximity of the device. We have to walk over to kitchen counter if we left our phone there; we have to remember it's on the counter even before we can do that. Then, once we've reached our phone, we're required to physically handle it, a process that generally requires we have one hand free and able. That may not sound like much, but these limitations force our computing experience to revolve around the location of our device, as opposed to it revolving around us. They can create roadblocks for those with disabilities affecting their vision or hands (or really, even those who just have sticky hands, wet hands, or their hands full), those far away from their device, and most importantly, those with an immediate computing need. There's a reason speech is our most instinctual form of communication. If we have a question, and if we know those around us can answer that question, we don't pull out our phone and run a search, we open our mouths and ask. We do that because it's instantaneous. Now contrast that with having to locate your phone, having to type in your password, having to navigate to an app, having to tap, type, or speak your command. These behaviors are not instinctual, but we put up with them because the people around us usually don't have the answers, and because smartphones are our best alternative. But they don't have to be. The rise of voice  It's not obvious quite yet, but today's physically bound mediums have left a large hole to fill and voice computing is starting to fill it. Over the past two years, the technology has begun manifesting itself in the form of always-on, always-listening devices able to virtually bypass the friction inherent in today's major computing mediums. Currently, these devices are best exemplified by Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers, which employ far-field voice recognition technology allowing users to command Alexa from across multiple rooms and through various background noises at any time simply by calling for it out loud. Image Source: Amazon.com. Put another way, for as little as $50, Amazon's Echo is giving consumers their first glimpse at a frictionless computing experience. Following its initial setup, there's no pressing buttons, no looking around for the device, and no navigating through screens to issue a command. When it works correctly (like Siri, Alexa is still very much in its infancy and subject to misinterpreting commands) it really does allow users to convert their thoughts to a command in the time it takes to form a sentence, capturing the essential promise of voice as a medium. And if the early estimated adoption rate for the device is any indication -- Amazon hasn't officially released sales figures, but as of January 2016, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) estimates a staggering 8.2 million Echos have already been sold in the U.S. (a number that pales in comparison to Morgan Stanley's estimates of over 11 million), suggesting the device has achieved well over 5% household penetration -- early demand for a seamless computing experience is strong, and will likely grow stronger as capable competitors race to introduce their own offerings (see Google's Home, Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Spot, or Baidu's Little Fish), and as voice recognition, natural language understanding, and third-party support continue improving at rapid pace.  Data Sources: VoiceLabs, CIRP, KPCB, InfoScout. *2017 figures are VoiceLab projections. Chart by Author. To be clear, these devices will never replace today's existing computing mediums, but will rather augment them. While screens will remain the preferred medium for our more detailed and visual computing needs, voice will begin its ascent by taking on an increasing share of our more "conversational" demands, common requests we want addressed with the immediacy we expect from dialogue ("Cancel my doctor's appointment." "Pause that music!" "What's a good non-fiction book to read on the beach? ... Great, order that one.") As the technology grows capable of handling increasingly nuanced and complex requests, and as voice-enabled devices proliferate and evolve, we can expect more users to grow comfortable engaging with the technology around the home, in the workplace, and gradually more pervasive aspects of society. And that's where the real opportunities begin. The opportunity at hand Some of the biggest tech empires in modern history have been built around the personal computer, internet, and smartphone, each of which has provided the infrastructure for technology to penetrate deeper and more reflexively into everyday life, allowing creative companies to reach consumers in entirely new ways. In just 10 years, the iPhone helped Apple grow to become the largest corporation in the world, but it also popularized smartphone technology in the U.S., helping to create the infrastructure that in turn enabled Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet, Uber, Snap, Amazon, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and countless others to create businesses that reach deeper into our lives than any before. Image Source: Author's iPhone. And yet voice technology is going deeper. It's becoming an invisible, always-listening medium that surrounds us, weaving itself more seamlessly into the fabric of our lives than any before it. It's called on using our most instinctual, reflexive form of communication, and it's accessible in the time it takes to form words. It's a technology that provides tomorrow's innovators a far more intimate and pervasive way to help us satisfy our digital wants. It's a startling but increasingly inevitable reality for both investors and society. In Part II: The Playing Field, I'll discuss various players involved in the race to commercialize voice computing.
