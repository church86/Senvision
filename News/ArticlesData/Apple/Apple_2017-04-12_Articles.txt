The Cupertino giant is reportedly developing sensors that can detect sugar level in the blood to help people fight against diabetes. According to CNBC reports, Apple has also hired a secret team of biomedical engineers to develop these sensors.  This secret initiative was  initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The engineers are expected to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, close to the corporate headquarters, CNBC said. The news comes at the time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware, thereby jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Also Read: With help of Indian doctors, Google teaches its AI to detect diabetes eye problems Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet Inc unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing new field of medicine known as bioelectronics. The new company will be based at GlaxoSmithKline's Stevenage research center in north of London and a second research hub in South San Francisco. The company will focus on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body. To emphasise that it is serious in its health-related efforts, Google, through Verily that it owns, has also entered into partnership with Sanofi, to work on diabetes-related solutions. US biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics Inc have already shown early benefits of bioelectronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies playing around the idea of bioelectronics include Medtronic Plc , Proteus Digital Technology and Biogen Inc.  The company's shares were marginally up after the bell on Wednesday.With Reuters inputs For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @IndiaTodayTech and on Facebook at facebook.com/indiatodaytech For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in.ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.   Most Read Vodafone offers 28GB data and free calls for Rs 346, offer only until March 15 Apple iPhone 6 at Rs 28,999 isn't such a good idea.

And in the weeks preceding and following the release, online auction sites see an abundance of newly superseded iPhones hit the market.

Connect the device to iTunes and back up all your data - just in case Tap on the Settings icon Scroll down a little until you can see General and tap on it Scroll the bottom of the list and tap on Reset Tap on Erase All Contents And Settings Enter your passcode when prompted A small panel will slide up from the bottom of the screen. Assuming you're sure you want to wipe the device and you've saved all your data, tap on Erase iPhone Just to be sure, the panel will reappear and ask again. If you're sure, tap on Erase iPhone Once the process is complete, the iPhone (or iPad - the same process works on iPads) will be wiped of all your data and be ready for a new owner to set up.

Seems like an odd decision in the year 2017, but I didn't come here to judge. I'm legitimately curious why some people continue to pump their money into the MS Office Suite, despite mounting evidence that the software offers shitty security and a historically terrible user experience.

It will have to present with Apple’s unique design language, but the form will also have to follow the function as a modular device. For the practical minded user. The low end will have to be affordable, but it will also have to support the very best CPU/GPU/ and bus architecture. Here’s a concept video that pays homage to the (2008-2012) Mac Pro, has a modest desktop footprint, and still looks like it would be big enough to contain kind of power we drool for. Amazingly, it reminds me of HP’s Z2 Mini as well. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Mac Pro 3 Comments Add a comment Andrew_Holleron April 12, 2017 I’d like to see what 2017 hardware could be crammed into a design similar to the air cooled original Apple Cube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djNkIF8bz4w Yes, the Cube was an under-powered overly expensive vanity piece like the Twentieth Anniversary Mac but imagine what it could be with current hardware. April 12, 2017 at 6:48 EDT PM Rick Allen April 12, 2017 I think this is a good take on he word used at the Mac Pro revival event: Modular. There are design flaws as the GPU facing up in that small space has no room for pass through cables. I also think the M.2 SSD PCI/E connection would be a better choice than SATA III 2.5 inch drive. What is exciting is that people are excited and enthused to even think about Mac Pro design at this time. I only hope the actual product that Apple puts out is user upgradable and uses some industry standard parts for GPU / SSD / Memory. April 12, 2017 at 7:05 EDT PM furbies April 13, 2017 And where do we put the after market speciality PCIe cards ? And if we want 3.5″ multi TB HDDs ? An external enclosure / NAS ? And in a case that small whats the thermal envelope going to be ? And where is the PSU ? Is that going to necessitate a “power brick” ? Sorry, but the idea in the video is great. If you want a Mac Mini. It’s not a Mac Pro replacement / upgrade ! 😭 April 13, 2017 at 1:27 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

The long-awaited San Francisco development project, which opens late this year, has reportedly been competing for ideal tree specimen with the Silicon Valley titan's enormous doughnut-shaped campus. That, of course, is Apple Park, which opens this month, and sought 3,000 new trees for its central green space. The Transbay Center's landscape architect Adam Greenspan and contractor Patrick Trollip explained what it was like to scouri tree nurseries to the Chronicle. From the paper: Buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat business. And it’s been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple has been buying up 3,000 trees for its new Cupertino headquarters. When Greenspan and Trollip found a tree they fancied they would “tag it” with a locking yellow tag, so that nobody else — like Apple — could get it. Eventually all the tagged trees were moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the Transbay project team leased 4 acres. Transbay Transit Center Project via Facebook 60 trees have been delivered to the Transbay Transit Center so far — they began arriving in January — and the 5.4-acre rooftop garden is beginning to take shape, the tops of trees now visible from the street. “I think there is going to be a tree for everyone,” Greenspan told the Chronicle. “We have grand and stately trees, and we also have weird trees, quirky ones.” Transbay Transit Center Project via Facebook “This is going to be one of the great parks of San Francisco, and it’s going to be a public space unlike anything else we have,” said Gabriel Metcalf, president of the urban think tank SPUR. He's far from alone in that opinion, which is shared by the architect Cesar Pelli: The Chronicle's critic John King visited Pelli at his firm in New Haven this week, and after King commended Pelli on 560 Mission, his "favorite San Francisco tower of the past 15 years," Pelli responded with praise for the Transbay project. “I’m very proud of 560 Mission, but the transit center with the tower is much better — more important... The wonderful thing about those big projects is that they have a large impact on the city.” Pelli added, “That impact, if you plan and design it carefully, can be very much for the good.” Pelli is an interesting figure for King to invoke right now, since last week, the critic quoted the complaints of Stanley Saitowitz, an architect critical of SF Planning. "Planning wants textbook replicas," Saitowitz lamented. The department had no appreciation — or understanding — for architecture, he asserted. That lead Curbed to seek a rebuttal from John Rahaim, SF's Planning Director. Rahaim outlined an ethos of "preventing really egregious architecture," the kind of stuff that looks like "crap" in five years. "You can’t create great architecture through zoning and review," he said. In the late 1980s, Pelli himself designed a building for San Francisco that might not have stood the test of time: A 400-foot tower for Market Street that would have been crowned with a 120-foot lattice. But Pelli, who was the dean of Yale's school of architecture before founding his firm in 1977, is an example of a designer who's made peace with the difference between academic and actual architecture. Hey, if it's planning departments who prevent things like this vision of a future San Francisco, dug up by the Redditors of r/retrofuturism, then maybe we ought to thank them. via Reddit Of course, these flying saucers on the Embarcadero could be sort of cool, now that I think about it. What if we planted some trees on them?

By: Reuters | Updated: April 13, 2017 10:43 am Apple Inc has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors to treat diabetes. Apple Inc has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors to treat diabetes, CNBC reported citing three people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The engineers are expected to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, close to the corporate headquarters, CNBC said. The news comes at the time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware, thereby jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet Inc unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing bioelectronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves. US biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics Inc have already shown early benefits of bioelectronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies playing around the idea of bioelectronics include Medtronic Plc, Proteus Digital Technology, Sanofi SA and Biogen Inc. The company’s shares were marginally up after the bell on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Apple is gearing to launch its next-generation of iPhone. Apple iPhone 8 or iPhone Edition is expected to come with a radical new design as the year 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of iPhones. Apple will launch two more devices – iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus – along side the iPhone 8. Apple iPhone 8 is said to come with an OLED display and there will be no home button. Other expected include return of metal and glass design, wireless charging, 3D sensing technology and more.

Heart attack deaths rise when a large marathon is in town Being in a town where a major marathon is being run can pose a life-and-death hazard, researchers say. A new study of cities hosting the largest U.S. marathons has found that the odds of dying if you have a heart attack or cardiac arrest jump 13 percent the day the race is run. Hospitalizations drop where laws restrict trans fats People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study. Trans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They're found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture. Nursing home residents often untreated for chronic pain Many nursing home residents suffering from chronic pain don´t get any medication or don´t get enough to fully relieve their symptoms, a recent U.S. study suggests. Researchers examined data on almost 1.4 million residents in nursing homes nationwide from 2011 to 2012 and found that overall, roughly two in five had either intermittent or chronic pain. Apple hires secret team for treating diabetes: CNBC Apple Inc has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors to treat diabetes, CNBC reported citing three people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. Doctor tells U.S. court drug not suitable for Arkansas executions A surgeon told a federal court in Arkansas on Wednesday that a sedative the state plans to use in its lethal injection mix is not suitable for surgery and should be prohibited when Arkansas holds an unprecedented series of executions later this month. Arkansas plans to kill eight prisoners in dual executions over 11 days from April 17, although a federal judge has halted one execution. Death penalty opponents have said the rushed schedule is reckless and increases the chance of errors. Older adults may lose ability to manage money and medications A large proportion of older Americans will need assistance managing their medicines and finances as they age, and they need to plan for these changes along with their families, researchers say. Among people in their late 60s who had no trouble managing their medications, for example, one in 10 developed difficulties over the next 10 years, the study team found. Among 85 year-olds without difficulty managing finances, seven in 10 developed a problem in the next decade. Insurance, medical groups urge Trump to keep funding Obamacare subsidies Major medical groups kept up the pressure on U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday to maintain funding Obamacare subsidies that are paid directly to insurers, warning that not doing so would destabilize the individual insurance markets that millions of people use to buy health insurance. America's Health Insurance Plans, the American Medical Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians were among eight organizations that penned a letter to Trump. They urged him to "remove uncertainty about continued funding for cost sharing reductions," the billions of dollars that are paid to insurers to help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Hologic faces U.S. patent lawsuit over menstrual bleeding device Medical device maker Hologic Inc has been hit with a lawsuit alleging its product for treating heavy menstrual bleeding infringes patented technology developed by start-up Minerva Surgical Inc, court papers show. Minerva filed a complaint in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday saying it may seek an injunction blocking U.S. sales of Hologic's NovaSure Advanced system which began in February. The product was launched in Europe, Canada and Australia in 2016. Trump may halt insurer payments to force Democrats to table on healthcare U.S. President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he might consider withholding billions of dollars of Obamacare payments to health insurers to force Democrats back to the negotiating table on healthcare. Insurers and major medical groups have warned that not funding the payments, called cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans, could wreak havoc in the individual insurance markets. Trump told The Wall Street Journal that by withholding the payments, Democrats will call him to negotiate. More evidence ties insulin resistance to cognitive decline Having reduced sensitivity to insulin may lead to more rapid decline in memory and other mental skills in old age even among people who don´t have diabetes, a recent study suggests. So-called insulin resistance, the body´s failure to respond normally to the hormone insulin, is a hallmark of diabetes. Diabetes itself - a disease in which the body can't properly use insulin to convert blood sugar into energy - has been linked to cognitive decline and dementia, but the exact nature of the connection isn´t as clear.

(Reuters) Apple Inc has hired a team of biomedical engineers as part of a secret initiative, initially envisioned by late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors to treat diabetes, CNBC reported citing three people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. The engineers are expected to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, California, close to the corporate headquarters, CNBC said. The news comes at the time when the line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies are joining forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware, thereby jump-starting a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Last year, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Google parent Alphabet Inc unveiled a joint company aimed at marketing bioelectronic devices to fight illness by attaching to individual nerves. Also Watch: U.S. biotech firms Setpoint Medical and EnteroMedics Inc have already shown early benefits of bioelectronics in treating rheumatoid arthritis and suppressing appetite in the obese. Other companies playing around the idea of bioelectronics include Medtronic Plc, Proteus Digital Technology, Sanofi SA and Biogen Inc. The company’s shares were marginally up after the bell on Wednesday. No Comments.

The company has apparently hired a small team of biomechanical engineers to work on the project, which would monitor glucose levels through contact with the skin, rather than through invasive blood tests or similar mechanisms. It’s apparently been working on the sensors for five years The company is basing the team working on the sensors out of an office in Palo Alto, rather than at its main headquarters. The engineers have apparently been working on the sensor technology for at least five years, and it is complete enough that Apple has started feasibility trials at clinical locations in the Bay Area. The company has also hired consultants that are helping it navigate complex health regulations, CNBC says. The team is reportedly managed by Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of hardware technologies, but previously reported to Michael D. Hillman before he left the company in 2015. CNBC says the team is made up of about 30 people, including biomedical experts Apple hired away from major firms like Masimo Corp, Sano, Medtronic, and C8 Medisensors. Those hires, reported early last year, sparked speculation that Apple may indeed be working on such a product. The idea of wearable devices being used to manage conditions like diabetes was developed during Steve Jobs’ tenure as Apple head, but developing technology that can accurately measure blood sugar levels without piercing the skin is particularly difficult. John L. Smith, a biomedical expert who has published papers on the failure of non-invasive glucose sensors, said it was "the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career." Google is also developing glucose monitors Apple’s in-development solution reportedly shines light through the skin to check current glucose levels. Google is also working on its own glucose monitors, but has taken a different approach. The company is currently developing a contact lens that is intended to track blood sugar through contact with the eye, and a bandage-sized device being developed by its Life Sciences division. It’s not yet clear when Apple’s sensor will be complete, nor whether it would come as part of its own device, or be included in an Apple Watch or similar product down the line. If it can pull it off, however, the sensor could make life easier — and Apple products more desirable — for people with diabetes.

Josh Smith03/23/2016 What is the best iPhone SE color to buy? That’s a common question from buyers who are looking at upgrading to the new 4-inch iPhone. Apple announced four color options for the iPhone SE and there are a few things to consider before you choose which iPhone SE color to get. Keep in mind that if you have a favorite color or one that you are immediately drawn to you should probably just buy that iPhone SE color instead of debating the merits of the other options. The iPhone SE is available in Space Gray, Gold, Silver and Rose Gold. This matches the iPhone 6s, 9.7-inch iPad Pro and MacBook. If you plant to buy the cheaper Apple Watch you may want to match colors. Which iPhone SE color to get in 2016. If you are trying to decide which iPhone SE color to get you can stop into any store selling the current iPhones and look at the colors to see what you want. Users upgrading from the iPhone 4s or iPhone 5s will see new color options and Apple fixed the scratching issue with the iPhone 5s, so you can safely choose color options. Here is a fast look at the things you need to consider when you pick your iPhone SE color. iPhone SE Colors for Entertainment If you plan to watch a lot of movies and videos on your iPhone SE then you may want to buy the Space Gray iPhone SE. Space Gray is the iPhone SE color if you like to watch videos. This is the only one with a black bezel on the front. Take a look at the screen on your laptop, TV or monitor and the odds are good that the edge of the screen is black. This focuses your attention on the screen and avoids distractions that can come from the lighter edges around a screen. iPhone SE Colors for Style Pick an iPhone SE color that matches your style. When it comes to choosing which iPhone SE color to get, style is the biggest thing to consider. If you want to use the iPhone SE to coordinate with your personal style and your Apple Watch there are some things to consider. The Rose Gold and Gold iPhone SE colors definitely stand out, and can coordinate with jewelry and outfits well. If you want a blank slate, look at the Silver iPhone SE. With a white front and a silver back it looks nice with anything you wear or carry. iPhone SE Color Options You can see the iPhone SE color options below, which show off the new colors you can choose. If you are new to the iPhone you can see what the colors look like. iPhone SE Colors: Scratching, Wear & Fading How will the iPhone SE color you pick wear over time? We used to see problems with the iPhone 5 scratching, especially the black model. Make sure you clean your iPhone SE. Apple fixed this with the move to Space Gray and so far the other iPhone colors are holding up well over time. We don’t see any fading on the Rose Gold and Gold iPhone models we review. One thing that you need to keep in mind is that the Gold and Rose Gold iPhone Se colors can show discoloration more if you don’t care for your iPhone. If you leave the iPhone SE in a case while you work out or listen to music in the shower you need to take it out of the case and clean it every now and then or it can get discolored like in the photo above. iPhone SE Cases Keep in mind that many iPhone owners put the new iPhone in a case before they leave the store. That means you may not see more than the front of the iPhone and a small part near the camera. Think of how your iPhone SE color matches cases and accessories. If you plan to use an iPhone SE case you should consider how it will look with the color and style of case you plan to buy. There are clear iPhone SE cases that allow you to add protection and still show off the color of your new iPhone. Which iPhone SE Color Should I Get? Pick what iPhone SE color to get. Ultimately you need to pick the iPhone SE color that you like best. The biggest consideration is the front bezel and how it will work with your style of favorite colors. Here’s a short summary of what to consider. Space Gray iPhone SE – You’ll be watching a lot of movies, you don’t like white phone fronts. Silver iPhone SE – You want the iPhone SE color that works with any colors and cases available. Gold iPhone SE – You want an iPhone that stands out and you don’t plan on using a case. Rose Gold SE – You want an iPhone that is clearly the new iPhone SE, not an iPhone 5s, and that you will use without a case or with a clear case.  When we asked 13,000 readers which iPhone color they would buy, the most chosen color was Rose Gold. Space Gray is the second most chosen option by our readers. 9 Responses 03/24/2016 Thersathomas Reply waow…!m­­­­­­­­­y neigh­­­­­­­­­bor’s mo­­­­­­­­­m m­­­­­­­­­akes $80 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n th­­­­­­­­­e int­­­­­­­­­ernet .

Photo courtesy Village Community Boathouse BY SALLY CURTIS AND DEBORAH CLEARMAN | In all of the hand-wringing, wheeling and dealing around the future of Pier 40, little attention has been given to the community boathouses that have occupied space on the south side of the pier for almost 20 years. The last remaining community boathouse on Pier 40, Village Community Boathouse, is an all-volunteer nonprofit organization that provides free public access to New York Harbor, utilizing a fleet of traditional wooden rowboats, most of them built in the shop at Pier 40 in conjunction with local schools. The history of V.C.B. goes back to the late Mike Davis, founder of Floating the Apple. Mike Davis was a cultural archeologist working on a dig in Istanbul, when he noticed the many rowing craft and boathouses along the shore of the Bosporus, owned and operated collectively by neighborhood people. He knew that New York Harbor, too, had once been home to dozens of community boathouses where anyone could rent a boat. As recently as 1930 there were 40 neighborhood boathouses in the harbor. By the 1990s there was only one. The city’s waterways were considered polluted and dangerous. Inspired by his experience in Istanbul, Mike’s vision of providing universal public access to the New York City waterfront led him to found Floating the Apple in 1992. A little like Johnny Appleseed, his idea was to create community boathouses in neighborhoods all over the city. Mike commissioned an engineer and navel architect, Mike McEvoy, to design a 25-foot long “Whitehall gig,” named for Whitehall St. in Lower Manhattan, where the gigs were first built 250 years ago. Known as the “bicycles of the sea,” these boats were the most efficient way to get around the city’s waterways. In the 18th and 19th centuries Whitehall gigs were used in New York Harbor as workboats, rowing out to meet the tall ships and offload passengers, mail and baggage. In 1776, General George Washington evacuated his severely outnumbered troops from the Brooklyn side of the East River in a flotilla of Whitehalls to escape the British in the Battle of Long Island. With the newly updated Whitehall design, Mike Davis enlisted a crew of waterfront activists, including Don Betts, Brendan Malone of New York Harbor School, Louis Norris and others, to lead local residents and high school students in community boatbuilding sessions in the lobby of the old McGraw-Hill building on W. 42nd St. Once complete, the 500-pound vessels were loaded on dollies and rolled down 42nd St. to the Hudson River, sometimes with police or firefighters escorting with flashing lights, but always with lots passersby waving and pointing the boat crew on toward the water. At Pier 84 at the foot of 42nd St., the boats were launched into the Hudson. There were no boathouses as of then, however. But down at Pier 40, at W. Houston St., Tobi Bergman — the chairperson of Community Board 2 during 2015 and 2016 — was working to get youth sports fields and an indoor practice center, and was renovating a space once associated with a prison barge docked at the pier. Tobi is a legend of sorts among waterfront activists because he helped create the boathouse at Pier 40 by offering Mike Davis a dockside part of the space for it. Tobi recognized that he and Mike shared an interest in promoting youth sports, so he offered to share his modest space on the south side of the pier. In September 1997, Brendan Malone began building the Whitehall gig Rachel Carson in Tobi’s space on Pier 40, in collaboration with students from P.S. 811 and Junior Navy R.O.T.C. students from High School of Graphic Communication Arts. By the time the Rachel Carson was launched a year later, Tobi was complaining about the dust, noise and proliferation of gigs in their tiny shared space, and suggesting that Mike consider investing in a wood chipper. In 1998, the Hudson River Park Act created the park and the Hudson River Park Trust, with the mission to promote, encourage, and expand public access to the Hudson River and to promote natural, cultural and historic aspects of the river. Their shared vision made Hudson River Park and Floating the Apple a perfect fit. Mike and his mission were embraced by Noreen Doyle, now vice president of the Trust, who offered Floating the Apple a much larger space on the south side of the pier, which is now occupied by Village Community Boathouse. Eventually, in 2007, Mike moved back to Midtown to Pier 84, at W. 44th St., to a boathouse conceived and designed in conjunction with Doyle to fit the needs of the Floating the Apple mission, leaving the boathouse on Pier 40 to the newly incorporated V.C.B. Village Community Boathouse continues to realize the vision of Mike Davis and the Hudson River Park Act. V.C.B. would not exist without the consistent and generous support of Noreen Doyle and the Trust, which set the terms of the boathouse’s lease at $1 per year. This allows V.C.B. to offer rowing and boat building programs to the public free of charge. The V.C.B. boat building and rowing programs run from the boathouse on Pier 40 seek to fulfill the goal of universal public access to the waterways of New York City: All of the programs are free and are offered on a walk-in basis. During the rowing season, utilizing a fleet of traditional wooden rowing craft, V.C.B. offers community rowing two or three times per week. Novice rowers, with the guidance of an experienced coxswain, can practice in the safety of the embayment on the south side of the pier. Four oarsmen, each with one long sweep oar, sit facing the stern, where the coxswain steers and coordinates their rowing. Protected from the winds and currents by the pier’s massive structure, the embayment is uniquely suited for “learn to row” programs. Once “newbies” have learned to row sufficiently, V.C.B.’s senior coxswains take them out onto the river where they can safely experience the full force of nature in the winds, waves, tides and currents and see the city from a new perspective. V.C.B. is the only boathouse remaining in Pier 40 that offers free access to the water. Other boating outfits within the park are open to the public, but at a price that restricts access to those without the means to pay. Free kayaking is offered by Downtown Boathouse at Pier 26, at N. Moore St., but kayakers must stay within the boundaries of the embayment. In contrast, V.C.B. rowers voyage throughout the harbor: down to the lower harbor for a close-up of the Statue of Liberty, up the river to Hoboken Cove, or around the Battery to the East River. Directly serving the mission set out in the Hudson River Park Act, V.C.B. provides a physical connection to the water to all who live in, work in or visit Manhattan. In their 18 years at Pier 40, community boathouses have invited the public, including youth from local public schools, to utilize the city’s waterfront and harbor, improving people’s quality of life, fostering a sense of environmental stewardship, and establishing a spirit of collaboration in crewing or building a boat. V.C.B. has introduced tens of thousands of international visitors, local residents and young people to the joy of rowing on the Hudson and other waterways that surround New York City. In December 2016, the City Council voted to approve the transfer of air rights from Pier 40 to the St. John’s Center terminal across the street. The St. John’s developers will pay the Trust $100 million, to be used to repair the crumbling pier. Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at a City Council meeting that the city would support plans to redevelop Pier 40 that included preservation of the ball fields at the center of the donut-shaped pier. After several requests for proposals (R.F.P.’s) put out by the Trust for public-private partnerships — including Cirque de Soleil, an aquarium and high-rise residential towers — failed due to opposition from local politicians, Pier 40 stakeholders and local residents, it is time for the park’s administration, politicians and the community to work together to plan the future of the beloved pier. To that end, C.B. 2 has created the Future of Pier 40 Working Group. As an advising member of that group, we will advocate for the boathouses and other noncommercial boating access, to ensure that any plans should include preserving free community boating on Pier 40, whose southern embayment is the best-protected, most-usable piece of water in the park.

His name was not Steve, but he was convinced that he was on the verge of surpassing Steve's very successful Apple IIe. A prosperous engineer by trade, but a dreamer at heart, he was putting a good chunk of his life savings - and that of a few business associates, friends and family - on the line. He even enthusiastically offered me a few ground floor shares, but at the time I could scarcely afford lunch. His model, he argued, could do everything the Apple IIe could do, but faster and cheaper. He already had a few orders as his factory was getting close to launch just as I was heading back home to Canada in May 1983. I never heard of him again, but just a few months later, and a few miles north of where I had been living in California, Steve Jobs brought the world the first Macintosh computer and the rest, as they say, is summed up in that swirling, flushing sound. This tuition is expensive If they are honest, nearly every successful entrepreneur will admit to having broken off the rough edges of their business over the years by the rough and tumble experience of making a go of it. Even if the initial excitement of a new concept is still as intoxicating to them as it was decades before, they will still vividly remember the trials of starting up and grant some space for reflection over the dreams that mightn't have come true. The decidedly boring truth is that the best filter for risk is a history of having successfully navigated it. The adjudication of this is not resident in some government bureau, but rather in the undeniable profit/loss numbers, proven over time. There is no short-cut for a track record. Speculation in its dearth is sometimes richly rewarded, but more often punished. Those very few lottery winners are funded by whole bunches of lottery losers, and investing in start-ups is quite simply a risky concept. Up in smoke Take the budding business of recreational marijuana production for example. Now that our political leaders are about to sprinkle ferry dust on Pot Inc., there is a sense that profits will fly high. But viewing this, or any business as a sure thing is a puff of pure millennial magic. It is said that potheads can tend toward paranoia. A dose of that emotion would be useful here. Legalization of pot is not a free pass around the usual business risks, but a ticket headlong into them, rolled and licked tightly around its very own special set of jeopardies. As a general rule, take bigger bets on smaller risks, and smaller bets on bigger risks and you might be okay. But consider the unknowns Political and regulatory risk - What is the yet-unwritten pot legislation going to look like? Will it severely restrict distribution? Will it be popular at the next federal election? Will it be repealed? Will it be subject to sin taxes down the road? Competitive risks - What will all the other suppliers be up to? Will they be better at this than the company you have invested in? Will entry into the sector be open wide or restricted? Operational risk - The day-to-day putting together of things that make operations work well. Weather - Yes, weather. Where agricultural commodities are concerned, the usual risks apply. When weather is conducive to a successful crop, supply goes up, pressuring prices to go down. When the opposite is true, the opposite is true. Sometimes being on the right side of this equation is a matter of sheer luck and international growers might have better growing conditions. Financial risks - Is there a proven history of positive cash flow from operations? Is there access to additional capital from shareholders or lenders? Is the company carrying too much debt amidst a downturn in business volumes? Is management getting involved in large contracts they are ill-equipped to meet? (In new ventures most of this is speculative risk.) Also consider management quality, environmental risks and many other issues not listed here. Eventually, if the political environment remains consistently accommodative (by no means a sure thing), there will be some winners and some losers. It is a roll of the dice at this point to know with confidence who the winners might be. Unfortunately, given that markets are forward-looking, the share prices of most marijuana suppliers who might make a go of it are already inflated to reflect the sum of their hoped-for future profits. So we there is no getting in on the ground floor here. You might argue that many of these same barriers to success existed with Samsung, Apple, Microsoft or Amazon. This is true, but it also conveniently ignores the fact that hindsight is selective. Looking back there is also a long train of has-been competitors we no longer mention (Polaroid, Commodore, Blackberry, Nortel...). But ignoring all that, is this an industry you would be proud to show your children you profit from? They might just become a customer someday and argue that they were just trying to play a bigger role in the family business. And that would stink.

The team works out of a nondescript office in Palo Alto, according to three sources. The project is far along enough that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites and hired consultants to help it navigate regulatory pathways. Achieving a reliable way to track glucose levels without piercing the skin is viewed as a 'holy grail' for life sciences. The effort was initially envisioned by Steve Jobs who wanted smartwatches to monitor important vitals such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. One source there were 30 people working in the group a year ago. The glucose team is said to report to Johny Srouji, Apple SVP of Hardware Technologies. It's believed that Apple is developing optical sensors which shine a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. To succeed would cost a company "several hundred millions or even a billion dollars," DexCom executive chairman Terrance Gregg previously told Reuters. The breakthrough would be a boon for millions of people with diabetes, spur new medical research and open up a potential market for consumers to track their blood sugar for health and wellness insights. It could turn the Apple Watch into a "must have" rather than a "nice to have" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar. Hit the link below for more details...

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Report Claims iOS 10.3.2 Will Render The iPhone 5 Obsolete By Tyler Lee on 04/12/2017 19:57 PDT We know that Apple has plans to eventually move its users and apps into 64-bit territory, with reports claiming that iOS 11 will kill off support for 32-bit apps completely. However that might actually be happening a bit earlier than expected, or at least that’s according to a post on Forbes which claims that Apple could obsolete the iPhone 5 with iOS 10.3.2. As it stands, iOS 10.3.2 is currently in beta but according to the report, the update is only for 64-bit devices which the iPhone 5 is not, thus leading to speculation that maybe Apple could end up obsoleting the iPhone 5 as a result of the update. Now for iPhone 5 owners before you guys get too worked out, there seems to be a general consensus that will not be happening. According to the folks at Gizmodo, they have been informed by their tipster that the iOS 10.3.2 update was successfully installed on the iPhone 5. They then reported that a separate source has confirmed to them that the iOS 10.3.2 update will continue to support devices like the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, so for now it seems that iPhone 5/5c owners have nothing to worry about. No word on when iOS 10.3.2 will be released so we guess we’ll have to wait and see if this update will truly end up obsoleting the iPhone 5 or if it will be business as usual, but like we said for now it seems that maybe iPhone 5 owners needn’t get too worried yet.

Easter Workshop: Tips To Setup Your Creative Space This Long Weekend How To Prevent iMessages From Accidentally Appearing On Other Devices Thorin Klosowski Apr 13, 2017, 1:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  apple ios ios 10 mac macbook macos messages privacy sierra Share If you own multiple Apple devices, you've probably signed into all of them with your Apple ID. You've also probably noticed that when you get a Facetime call your computer rings, or when you get an iMessage your iPad beeps. For most of us, this is a small annoyance worth fixing. For others, it's a potential privacy nightmare. Case in point, the lurid tale of now-former Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, whose goofy love poetry iMessage thread with his former political adviser and mistress accidentally synced up with his state-issued iPad that he also happened to share with his wife. Whoops. Chances are, most of us want to keep access to iMessages on just our phones and maybe a laptop, and we don't need it on every Apple device we own. Here's how to audit where you're signed on and prevent something like this from happening to you. See All the Devices You're Signed Into First things first, lets give your Apple ID a little audit to see every device you're signed in on. Head to your Apple ID page and log in. Scroll down to the Devices section and take a look at where you're logged in. If there's a weird or old device here, click on it, then select Remove to log out. Now, you should know exactly what devices you own that are still linked up to you Apple account. Turn Off iMessage On Extra Devices You probably do not want to log out of you Apple ID entirely on every device. Good news though, you can turn off just Messages (and Facetime, while you're at it). How you do so depends on which device you're on: On iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch If you don't want iMessages showing up on an iPad or on an old iPhone, it's easy to disable: Open up Settings > Messages. Set the iMessage toggle to off. You may also want to disable Text Message Forwarding, which sends regular non-iMessage SMS messages from your phone to Messages on your Mac or iPad. Tap the Text Message Forwarding option, then uncheck any devices you do not want SMS messages to go to. On a Mac If you don't want iMessages showing up on your Mac, you just need to log out: Open up Messages. Click Messages > Preferences, then select the Accounts tab. Select your iMessage account, then click the Sign Out button. To log out of Facetime, open Facetime, then head to Facetime > Preferences, then click Sign Out. Now, your messages won't sync up anywhere you don't want them to. Share Your Purchases Without Sharing Your Private Data There's a chance that one reason you might be signed into your Apple ID on multiple devices is because your family doesn't want to purchase the same apps, music or movies multiple times. Well, in that case, you're doing things wrong. Don't share your account with your family; set up Family Sharing so you can both have individual accounts. With Family Sharing, you can share each other's iTunes, iBooks and App Store purchases without actually sharing accounts. This means your phone calls, iMessage conversations, Safari browsing history, photos and everything else that's linked to your Apple ID remains yours and yours alone. With Family Sharing, one person is the family organiser who sets it all up. That organiser adds other users to the account, then confirms any purchases someone else in the group tries to make. Theoretically, you could also do this with your personal account and a work account, which would help keep private data private. Again, set up here depends on which devices you have: On an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch Go to Settings and tap your Apple ID. Tap Set Up Family Sharing, then tap Get Started. Tap Continue to agree to being the Family Organiser, then follow the rest of the instructions to add additional members to your family group. From here on out, you can manage, remove or add new family members by heading to Settings > iCloud > Family. On a Mac Open up System Preferences. Click iCloud. Click the Set Up Family button, then follow the rest of the instructions to add additional members to your family group. You can now manage, remove or add family members by heading to System Preferences > iCloud > Manage Family. Enable Two-Factor Authentication Finally, the last thing you'll want to do is enable two-factor authentication if you haven't already. This not only secures your Apple ID and every device connected to it, it also prevents you from doing anything by accident in the future because it requires a few extra steps to sign in. With two-factor authentication, when you sign into a device for the first time, you need to authorise it with a verification code sent to another, trusted device. For example, if you get a new MacBook, you can't sign into your Apple ID on that MacBook until Apple sends a code to your iPhone. Yet again, set up depends on which device you're on. This might sound cumbersome, but Apple's implementation is less annoying than other options, and the security is well worth it. Two-Factor Authentication: The Complete List Of Everywhere You Should Enable It Two-factor authentication is one of the best things you can do to make sure your accounts don't get hacked. We've talked about it a bit before, but here's a list of all the popular services that offer it, and where you should go to turn it on right now. Read more On an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch Open Settings, then tap your Apple ID. Tap Password & Security. Tap Turn on Two-Factor Authentication, then follow the directions on screen to finish the set up process. On a Mac Head to System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details. Click the Security tab. Click Turn on Two-Factor Authentication and follow the directions on screen to finish the set up process. Now, your Apple ID is not only secure, it's also much less likely you'll accidentally sign into a device without realising the repercussions of doing so. Beyond all that, one final thing: Do not link your personal accounts to your company-issued devices, especially if you work for the government. It's not only bad form, it's also a privacy nightmare. Besides the fact that you may potentially look like a dummy when someone in your IT department figures it out, most company-issued devices grant access to everything you do on that device to your company. Which is to say, if you send an idiotic, racist, scandalous or whatever other stupid message to a friend on that device, your company might just happen upon it.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike Yesterday AAPL: 141.80 0.17 Growing number of 15″ MacBook Pro users report ‘popping’ sound coming from their laptop Chance Miller - Apr. 12th 2017 8:03 pm PT @ChanceHMiller MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro has been met with a wide array of responses since it was unveiled last fall. Now, a growing number of users are reporting that they hear a strange “popping” noise coming from their MacBook Pro. Reports of the issue have started picking up steam on Apple’s own support website, as well as other forums… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Users explain that the sound is a popping similar to that of when you “slowly squeeze a plastic bottle.” While some users explain that there doesn’t appear to be a rhyme or reason as to when the popping sound occurs, other say that it seems to happen during more intensive tasks like gaming and video streaming, especially when the MacBook Pro’s fans start to kick in.   On the other hand, some users have speculated that the issue relates to the hinges on the MacBook Pro where heat has caused some glue or plastic mount to lose some of its sturdiness. The issue seems to be plaguing mainly 15-inch MacBook Pro users, which makes sense considering the heavier screen panel of the device. I think the problem is actually from the hinges, as there is some natural flexing in the aluminum back of the display. I think the heat has affected the glue or some plastic mount in the display assembly. Another user writes: I am able to constantly reproduce the sound by pressing right at the bottom of the screen assembly in the middle. Apple’s response to the issue has been varied according to users. Some claim that Apple has replaced internal parts of the machine such as logic board, but without solving the problem. Others, however, report that Apple has pinned the issue to a small dent on the bottom casing, something that’s not covered under warranty and runs customers $130. It’s possible that the thermal expansion is what’s causes the dent on the bottom casing, thus meaning that the issue should be covered under normal warranty, unless Apple is uses the “wearable part” argument. Nevertheless,  it doesn’t seem that Apple has a clear idea in mind as to the root cause or fix of the problem. I took my laptop in to the genius bar for this popping noise. They said it is caused by this small dent on the bottom casing hitting the fan. They told me I had to replace the entire bottom casing for $130. Not covered under warranty because it’s user inflicted damage / a wearable part. Are you experiencing this popping sound with your 15-inch MacBook Pro? Let us know down in the comments.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple is developing its own power management chips, says analyst John Ribeiro 13 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News It appears that Apple is developing its own power management chips, according to a report from German private bank Bankhaus Lampe. The release of the report on Tuesday led to a sharp drop in the shares of Dialog Semiconductor, the current supplier of these chips to the iPhone maker. “The teams of both companies collaborate very closely and thus, Dialog cannot be replaced by a third-party supplier. However, Apple itself could replace Dialog,” writes analyst Karsten Iltgen. As evidence, the report cited 16 different job openings on Apple’s website for analog/power management engineers for the design centre in Munich alone. “A search on social networks such as LinkedIn revealed that Apple has already poached about 20 chip designers, some of them with long-standing experience, from Dialog,” says the report, which estimates that about 40 power-management chip engineers are currently working at the design centre in Munich, with a similar number working in the area at the centre in California. Industry sources in Taiwan suggest that manufacturing of samples of a power management integrated circuit for Apple is already underway, Iltgen writes. “The timetable seems to point to a potential application of the chips in the iPhone as of 2019,” the report says. The reported developments at Dialog could turn out to be a rerun of what is happening at UK company Imagination Technologies Group, which announced recently that it had been informed by Apple that the iPhone maker will soon stop using its intellectual property for graphics processing units for its iPhone and other devices, as it is working on a separate, independent graphics design. Imagination has questioned Apple’s ability to develop a GPU architecture from the ground up without infringing on the UK company’s intellectual property rights. For Apple, the moves could mean greater control over the components of its iPhone and other devices as it gears up for competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics. In February Xiaomi recently rolled out the Mi 5c built around its own Surge S1 processor, while Samsung uses its Exynos processors for some of its smartphones. An 80-person Apple power management chip team would be small compared to the 1,200 engineers at Dialog, including 900 chip designers, of which about 500 are believed to be working exclusively for Apple, according to the report. The Apple operation has reached a size that is starting to represent a threat for Dialog, according to Iltgen, who believes that a complete shift to Apple’s in-house development is unlikely in the short term. Apple and Dialog did not immediately comment.

Samsung Reclaims Top Spot in Global Smartphone Market By Park Keon-hyung Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory April 13, 2017 11:24 Samsung reclaimed the top spot in the global smartphone market in the first quarter of this year, after beating Apple. Due to the debacle surrounding the combustible Galaxy Note 7, Samsung gave the top spot to Apple for the first time in five years in the fourth quarter of last year. According to market researcher TrendForce on Wednesday, Samsung shipped out 80.14 million smartphones in the first quarter of this year, taking up 26.1 percent of the global smartphone market. Apple was runner-up with 16.9 percent, and China's Huawei came in third with 11.4 percent, followed by OPPO (8.1 percent) and Vivo (6.2 percent). LG was ranked sixth with 4.6 percent. TrendForce attributed Samsung’s recovery to the popularity of its low-to-mid-priced handsets. Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

Many had believed back then that the Apple Watch would be a groundbreaking health wearable, although so far we’re not really sure if you could look at it that way. There were rumors that it would come with all kinds of sensors to track the wearer’s vitals, such as their glucose levels which could come in handy for those with diabetes. Clearly that feature did not make the cut, but a report from CNBC has revealed that Apple has a “secret team” of biomedical engineers who are working on such a sensor for the Apple Watch. The team is allegedly working on a sensor that would be noninvasive and would allow for the continuous monitor of blood sugar levels. This will help those suffering from diabetes to get a better handle on their illness. Assuming they are successful, it would be seen as the “holy grail” for life science since it has proven to be rather challenging when it comes to tracking glucose levels without piercing the skin. The report goes on to add that this is something Apple has been working on for at least five years and was envisioned by Apple’s co-founder Steve Jobs before his death. We’re not sure if this technology will find its way into the Apple Watch Series 3, so maybe we shouldn’t get our hopes up just yet, and we should probably take the report with a grain of salt for now.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The next version of iOS officially abandons the iPhone 5 Yoni Heisler BGR NewsApril 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A forthcoming update to iOS 10 will reportedly leave the venerable iPhone 5 and forgettable iPhone 5c on the sidelines. When Apple rolls out the next incremental update to iOS 10 — iOS 10.3.2 to be exact — the software update will only be able to run on devices that feature a 64-bit processor. In other words, from here on out, forthcoming iOS updates will only be available for the iPhone 5s and later devices. Don't Miss: People who pre-ordered the Galaxy S8 from one carrier might get them before anyone else While this isn’t the most significant of developments, it is a bit out of character for Apple to break off support for older devices mid-cycle. Traditionally, Apple only breaks support for older devices when it rolls out large iOS updates in September, but with Apple keen on embracing a 64-bit future exclusively, the move was inevitable. Incidentally, iOS 10.3.2 doesn’t appear to be a major update as will introduce a few new Siri enhancements and some other minor features. Coinciding with Apple’s all-encompassing transition to 64-bit devices, 32-bit software on the App Store will also be getting the ax soon enough. As we covered earlier this week, iOS 11 will reportedly drop all support for 32-bit apps when it rolls out later this year. That said, if you still happen to be using some older 32-bit apps that haven’t been updated in quite some time, you may want to stay on iOS 10 or start looking for some app alternatives. As a point of interest, it’s been estimated that there are currently 187,000 32-bit apps currently residing on the App Store. Lastly, for any iPad users out there, the aforementioned iOS 10.3.2 update will only work on iPads released after October 2013. On the iPad Mini front, this means the iPad Mini 2 and subsequent releases. As for other iPad models, this means the iPad Air and all subsequent releases.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Files Apple Music Trademark Update to Cover Promotional Items like Caps, Lingerie, Masquerade Costumes, Wristbands & more | Main April 12, 2017 Secret Apple Team Closing in on Diabetes Testing Breakthrough using an Apple Watch   It's being reported tonight that Apple has hired a small team of biomedical engineers to work at a nondescript office in Palo Alto, miles from corporate headquarters. They are part of a super secret initiative, initially envisioned by the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, to develop sensors that can non-invasively and continuously monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes, according to three people familiar with the matter.   Such a breakthrough would be a "holy grail" for life sciences. Many life sciences companies have tried and failed, as it's highly challenging to track glucose levels accurately without piercing the skin.   The initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways, the people said.   The efforts have been going on for at least five years, the people said. Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. In 2015 Patently Apple posted a report about a European patent discovered that dated back to 2013 showing working covering Glucose and other aspects.   One of the people said that Apple is developing optical sensors, which involves shining a light through the skin to measure indications of glucose. A breakthrough here would be a boon for millions of people with diabetes, spur new medical research and open up a potential market for consumers to track their blood sugar for health and wellness insights.   It could turn the Apple Watch into a "must have" rather than a "nice to have" for people who would benefit from an easier way to track their blood sugar. You could read more about CNBC's story here.   Google is also working on this project as well. Patently Mobile covered two Google patents (one and two) on this back in 2014 relating to glucose testing via a contact lens system.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Zero Zero’s selfie drone, dubbed the Hover Camera Passport, is currently sold for US$499.95 in Apple stores both online and offline in the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong and the UK. Apple stores in the rest of the world will now begin selling the drone from May. The start-up had been selling the Hover Camera Passport on its website since the device launched last October, and the Apple link could mean a significant boost in orders. Customers eager to get their hands on the device will be able to immediately buy it off shelves in Apple stores, rather than wait several days for the product to arrive if ordered online. The model was launched to much fanfare last year, thanks to its fully-enclosed, foldable form as well as its artificial intelligence technology which allows the drone to recognise and follow the user. Shenzhen-based drone manufacturing giant DJI linked up with Apple last year as the exclusive launch partner for its Phantom 4 drone, with the latter showcasing the device in special in-store display. The Hover Camera Passport will also be available for demonstrations at select Apple stores, according to Zero Zero. “We’re thrilled to bring autonomous flying photography into the hands of consumers who are excited by truly innovative technology that impact their everyday lives,” said Wang Mengqiu, Zero Zero’s founder and chief executive. “By selling in Apple [stores], we want more customers to capture their memories in a near-effortless way through breathtaking perspectives that can be achieved through the Hover Camera Passport.” In a further effort to make the selfie drone more appealing to Apple users, the start-up has also made the Hover Camera Passport compatible with Apple video editing software including iMovie and Final Cut Pro X, allowing Apple users to upload photo and video content for sharing and editing by connecting the drone to their Apple device.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Chinese firm halves costs by hiring army of robots 2 Huawei chief sees no future for smartwatches 3 New plan could make it easier for Chinese firms to sell stocks 4 Tencent joins eBay and Microsoft in US$1.4b Flipkart investment 5 Review: LG G6 – possibly the best smartphone you can buy Shared 1 Huawei chief sees no future for smartwatches 2 Chinese firm halves costs by hiring army of robots 3 Tencent joins eBay and Microsoft in US$1.4b Flipkart investment 4 New plan could make it easier for Chinese firms to sell stocks 5 BlackBerry eyes fresh start in China as software company Commented 1 CK sells out 97pc of Harbour Glory as buyers ignore stamp duty 2 How Pepsi overstepped the line 3 Trump declares China not a currency manipulator and dollar too strong 4 Why won’t Hong Kong’s government let us take back our MPF? 5 China to ‘allow in more Hollywood movies’ to appease Trump on trade Promotions SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like China Tsai turns to home-grown weapons to boost Taiwan’s arms industry 11 Apr 2017 - 9:58am 8 Household appliances create Greener homes by turning food into fertiliser and monitoring recyclable waste In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Where Hong Kong got its thing for crowning people king 11 Apr 2017 - 7:31am [SCMP Archive] Greek life in Hong Kong Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School News Retirees to get up to HK$5,800 a month under HK$10b annuity plan 11 Apr 2017 - 11:08am 43 China Beijingers urged to report foreign spies for up to 500,000-yuan reward Apr 11th 2017, 6:19pm Insight & Opinion What does the HK Sevens have to do with Hongkongers? 10 Apr 2017 - 5:56pm 116 China US and North Korea ‘closer to brink’ of accidental conflict 10 Apr 2017 - 1:29am 61 Hong Kong Mainland blocks Hong Kong Film Awards as Trivisa wins top prize 10 Apr 2017 - 3:02pm 3 Hong Kong Cathay Pacific hits out at union after it ups stakes in dispute 9 Apr 2017 - 11:21pm 22 Politics Ill-fated IPO that could sway Malaysia’s election 9 Apr 2017 - 12:37pm 19 Opinion The hits and misses in Mar-a-Lago 9 Apr 2017 - 7:55am 11 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

The company submitted its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple's lawsuit, which was filed back in January. Among Qualcomm's five complaints is the allegation that Apple intentionally hobbled Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 so they wouldn't outperform those provided by Intel. Legally speaking, it has been a difficult year for Qualcomm. The initial lawsuit, filed in the US, was followed by additional suits in China and the United Kingdom. Before the Apple lawsuits, the company faced litigation from the US Federal Trade Commission for unfair business practices. In its countersuit, Qualcomm alleges that Apple "chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7," misrepresenting the difference in performance between iPhone models packing Qualcomm chips and those powered by its competitors. The company also claims Apple made threats in an attempt to keep it from making any public comparisons that might hint at the allegedly superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. With respect to the ongoing legal battle, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said: "After a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm." In addition, the countersuit claims Apple breached agreements and mischaracterized its negotiations with Qualcomm, interfered with longstanding agreements with Qualcomm licensees, and encouraged regulatory attacks against the company around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements. With total damages sought be both parties quickly racking up, it remains to be seen who will end up having to bear the ultimate cost should an out-of-court settlement not be reached.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Economist: ‘Risks of a (water system) takeover are extremely high' Wednesday Apr 12, 2017 at 6:00 PM Apr 12, 2017 at 6:13 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — A new analysis of the town’s ongoing water-system acquisition effort shows that water rates could be significantly higher under municipal ownership, a conclusion that contradicts assertions made by public officials. Conducted by economist John Husing, the analysis focuses on Measure F, which Apple Valley residents will vote on in a June 6 special election. Utilizing data from previously published research, Husing analyzed the potential impact incurring 30 years of revenue-bond debt might have on the town and its residents. According to the analysis, which looked at multiple possible cost scenarios, a $150 million bond paid back over 30 years at a maximum 12 percent interest rate — figures associated with Measure F — would result in much higher rates for customers. “This bond’s annual payments would be $9.2 million at 4.5 (percent) to $18.6 million at 12.0 (percent),” the analysis shows. “More likely payments would range from $10 million at 5.25 (percent) to $12.4 million at 7.25 (percent) as (interest) rates rise over the next two or three years during which any condemnation proceeding would be occurring.” Husing concludes the average increase in cost to customers would be “$502 or $620 per year equal to $84 or $103 per bi-monthly bill.” Additionally, for “the 92 (percent) of customers whose average bi-monthly bill is $129 ... this would increase their average bi-monthly water bill to $212 or $232.” That amounts to increases of 65.1 or 80.4 percent, according to the analysis, which said the “full average water cost increase per customer for 30 years at those rates would be $15,056 to $18,589.” In response, Town Manager Frank Robinson said Husing did not consult the town in preparing his analysis, adding, “his analysis appears to be based on data cherry-picked by his benefactor, Liberty Utilities.” Robinson criticized Husing for using previously published work “paid for by Liberty,” such as the Analysis Group’s recent report that found contested government takeovers are “typically very costly” while local governments “tend to underestimate acquisition costs by more than 100 percent.” Robinson was also suspicious of Husing's use of both California Public Utilities Commission data and the "outdated conclusions" of the 2011 Blue Ribbon Committee. For the record, the California Water Association — a consortium of investor-owned water utilities of which Liberty is a member — funded the Analysis Group’s report. Husing’s report, meanwhile, was financed by the Apple Valley Taxpayers Against Higher Water Fees — the group opposing Measure F — but Husing said the group was not allowed to edit his research, and he chose to release it independently. “Husing’s most dire conclusions are based on the maximum interest rate of 12 (percent),” Robinson said, “which he says himself is an ‘outside rate’ and that 8.25 (percent) would be unusually high, historically.” Further, Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett has said the town expects to pay far less, at a much lower interest rate, for Liberty’s water system than the $150 million Measure F suggests — something closer to the nearly $87 million assigned to the system in Missoula, Montana. Eliminating profits, taxes and company executives would make nearly $12 million available for debt service toward the town’s purchase of Liberty’s system, according to a report provided by Puckett on Wednesday. In March, before the release of that report, Puckett said the amount was $10.7 million. “Those additional resources ... could in fact be used to do additional capital improvement projects ... or lower rates,” he said recently. “Not in 30 years. Not in year two, three or five. But immediately upon completion of the acquisition process.” But Husing called Puckett’s assertions “unbelievably optimistic” considering acquisitions elsewhere were “not less expensive” and did not result in “more efficient” water systems. “The contention that they can lower rates ... (includes) a lot of heroic assumptions,” Husing told the Daily Press on Tuesday. “I really think that that’s just not in the cards. I understand why, superficially, you’d support it, but I don’t think the data supports it.” Husing’s analysis also discussed staffing increases and the impact those increases would have on the town’s operating budget. He used an Urban Futures study — conducted in 2014 for the town — that identified a warning sign concerning “the concept that a Town with no water agency knowledge would be able to efficiently operate such a complex system” to augment his findings. Between Fiscal Years 2010 and 2017, the town has had 123 to 140 full-time employees, the analysis shows, noting if the 2017 budgeted level is maintained in 2018, and the 41 full-time employees needed to operate Liberty Apple Valley are added, the town’s staffing would jump to 172 — “the highest in history and up 31 (percent) over 2017.” As a result, the town’s operating budget would increase by 43 percent, “from an approved $54.2 million in 2017 to $77.4 million,” an increase that would be exacerbated by customer-related issues, technical problems of obtaining water, keeping that water safe and maintaining approximately $6.4 million in system upgrades, according to Husing. “Taken together, these facts show that Urban Futures’ warning about the Town of Apple Valley’s ability to efficiently manage a complex new water system should be taken very seriously,” the analysis shows. Excluding upper management, Robinson said the town “anticipates the employees of Liberty Utilities would continue in their roles as experienced professionals.” He also detailed the qualifications of Greg Snyder — the director of Public Works — hired by the town in December 2015 for his experience that “covers 26 years in public works in which he has managed and operated water and wastewater collection systems.” While Husing acknowledged the increased costs on water customers would be less than what’s outlined in his analysis should the town pay an amount close to what was assigned to the Missoula system, he maintained “that the risks of a takeover and management of Liberty’s (system) are extremely high.” “The history has shown that for municipalities with no experience in this kind of operation, to try to take it by eminent domain has simply not worked,” he said. “This is a risk I would be very cautious of taking just given everything that I’m seeing.” Read Husing's full report here.

Could Increase Its Dividend for Years to Come This cash-generating machine's dividend could easily double in seven years. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Apr 12, 2017 at 7:31PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) "plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis," management said in its annual update for its capital return program in 2014. The tech giant has continued to do exactly this, increasing its dividend every year since it was initiated in 2012.  But with Apple's revenue and earnings growth facing headwinds recently, can the company continue to increase its dividend at similar rates as it has in the past? I think so. Not only can Apple boost its dividend by a nice rate this year, but it looks well positioned to increase its dividend at solid rates for years to come. Image source: Apple. A cash-generating machine Despite Apple's 7% and 11% year-over-year declines in revenue and earnings per share, respectively, in the trailing 12 months, Apple's balance sheet and cash flow statement still look poised to easily handle dividend increases for years to come. First, a quick glance at Apple's balance sheet reveals a mind-boggling $246.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Sure, $230.2 billion of this cash is held outside the U.S., but the company can easily access debt at very low interest rates because of its excellent credit rating. With a war chest like this, Apple can effortlessly handle its annual dividend payments, which are currently costing it about $12.3 billion per year.  Then there's its cash flow statement, which makes an even better case for the ease with which the company can pay dividends and increase them on an annual basis. Apple is currently bringing in about $52 billion of free cash flow annually. For a quick refresher on what free cash flow is, it's cash flow left over after both operating costs and capital expenditures are taken care of -- it's the good stuff management can use to boost shareholder value by paying dividends, repurchasing shares, making acquisitions, and more. With Apple raking in $52 billion of cash flow annually, the company's $12.3 billion in dividend payments have lots of room to grow. It's no wonder that Apple has been increasing its dividend as aggressively as it has. The company has increased its dividend at an average rate of 11% since it was initiated in 2012. Image source: Getty Images. More cash in your pocket Over the long haul, sustained dividend increases can help juice an investors' income stream significantly. Consider by how much Apple's dividend can grow over time if the company keeps up its average annual increase of 11%. In just seven years, its current quarterly dividend could more than double, growing from $0.57 per share to $1.18, or $4.72 annually. This would increase its dividend payments as a percentage of today's per-share cost basis from 1.6% to 3.2% in just seven years -- not bad. Apple's dividend is about to get some extra attention when the company updates its capital return program sometime this spring, as it does every year. If recent years are any indication of exactly when Apple will announce its latest dividend increase and share repurchase authorization, the company will share an update on the important program alongside its May 2 earnings report.  Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike May 15, 2015 12-inch MacBook month review: A great new Mac if you manage your expectations (Video) Dom Esposito - May. 15th 2015 6:04 am PT @macmixing Reviews MacBook Apple video Retina Display Comments (67) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit For the last month, I’ve been using Apple’s new 12-inch Retina MacBook almost exclusively. There’s no denying that’s it’s underpowered when compared to other models on the market, but is its portability worth the performance sacrifice? Can you really get anything done with a relatively small display, an Intel Core M processor, and more importantly, zero traditional USB ports? This won’t be an in-depth review of features and performance (check out Zac’s take on the MacBook for an in-depth look), but instead, I’ve mainly focused on my personal experiences over the month I’ve been using it. Does the Retina MacBook live up to the hype? Let’s go ahead and find out… I don’t normally review computers, but I’ve grown very fond of this MacBook. Other than one thing that I happen to do regularly for professional reasons, all of my other tasks have been done on Apple’s smallest laptop. The only time I switched to another computer was during video editing sessions, because this little machine unfortunately isn’t powerful enough to handle them. The 12″ MacBook is lightweight, thin, and super portable, but what makes the case for buying a compact $1,300 laptop? That’s the real question here. Honestly, thanks to its Core M processor, this is Apple’s netbook, though whether or not you’d like to perceive it in that way is up to you. But since I managed my expectations going into it, I’m perfectly fine with that. Design Apple’s latest design is as slick as it gets. This computer is so damn thin, Apple had to redesign major components to make them fit. First off, this is a fan-less MacBook: it doesn’t make a peep, as there are no moving parts inside. Apple also redesigned the keyboard specifically for this MacBook, using new “butterfly switches” that provide a 40% thinner keyboard assembly and 17% larger keys. Although it’s certainly not a keyboard for everyone, it’s actually a pretty easy keyboard to get used to, believe it or not. It took me a little while to feel this way, but I now prefer typing on this keyboard over my 15-inch MacBook Pro. Watch our 12-inch MacBook review video below: Along with the keyboard, Apple introduced a new Force Touch trackpad that provides a handful of new features that I rarely use. Most of these features were accessible on prior MacBooks using three-finger taps. If you’d like to check out some of those features, check out this article. Over time, Force Touch may well become better, and even though it’s thinner, the trackpad does feel just like using prior Apple trackpads. In addition to being beautifully thin, the new MacBook is available in a few different colors as well. I chose the Space Gray version, but honestly prefer the executive-style look you get with a black leather skin; it’s a stunning combination. For productivity, this is an iPad killer: it’s not much larger than an iPad with a keyboard case attached, has a larger, beautiful screen, and runs OS X. I’m a big fan of the Retina display; it’s awesome. If there’s any main selling point for this computer, it’s the size and quality of the screen. Apple’s display comes in at 12-inches diagonally with a 2304 x 1440 resolution, packing 226 pixels per inch and a 16:10 aspect ratio. It’s a great looking screen. At the center of the display’s top bezel you’ll find a 640×480 FaceTime camera. It’s not that great, but will get the job done for video calls. Along the top edge of the keyboard, you’ll find a large speaker grille. Despite the machine’s small size, these are without a doubt the best sounding speakers I’ve heard on a MacBook. They are pretty loud with nice warmth and treble. I was genuinely shocked by the sound quality here. From a peripherals standpoint, there’s only one USB-C port and a headphone jack on this MacBook. This will create a problem for most people, but I really don’t have an issue with it. I rarely use USB ports as it is, and most of my files are stored in the cloud. Apple offers several adapters you can lug around if that’s what you need, but I haven’t been bothered by the lack of ports, as I managed my expectations long before this MacBook shipped. Sure, another port or two would be excellent, and we’ll probably see that on the next model. Performance vs Portability & Battery life Sadly, the size of this MacBook is only possible by compromising performance; it doesn’t do well with CPU or GPU intensive apps, such as video rendering tasks. The major benefit here is portability, and I love that about this MacBook. Unfortunately, my professional work is difficult to do on this computer, but I can do everything else. There’s really not much else to say about performance. It’s not the fastest computer on earth, but it’s not the slowest, either; it’s still a Mac, just not a screamer. If you’re looking for a higher performer, you may want to consider Apple’s 13-inch or even 15-inch MacBook offerings. If you’re interested in benchmarks from the 12-inch MacBook, check out our unboxing and overview article here. As for battery life, this is another area where you’ll need to manage your expectations. It’s a small computer loaded up with batteries, but it’s not going to get you anywhere near Apple’s claimed 9 to 10 hours. I usually get around 4.5 hours of continuous usage out of a full charge with the brightness set at around 50%. I’d normally have Firefox (10-15 tabs), TweetDeck, Excel, iTunes (playing music), Messages, Notes, and HipChat running simultaneously. Fortunately, it charges in around 2.5 hours from 0 to 100%. You can even charge it with a portable battery pack and the proper adapter when on-the-go. Bottom line Do you need this MacBook? Nope. In fact, there are several other choices from Apple and other manufacturers that offer more performance and screen real estate for the money. But is it a very cool piece of tech to own? Yep. The 12-inch MacBook is certainly a beautiful piece of engineering and design, but not a must-have. I love everything about its design, but unless you’re using this under a certain set of expectations, it won’t satisfy all of your needs. This is the perfect size for traveling via plane and train, but lacks the performance to become my main computer. That being said, it’s the perfect sidekick to accompany my Mac Pro. This computer is nearly perfect for the average consumer, but far from a win for the traveling creative professional. It’s also a damn good looking computer, but you should look elsewhere if you need a computer for a lot more than its design and portability. So even though it doesn’t satisfy 100% of my needs, it will work for the majority of users across the types of things most people are doing with their Macs today.

Lukas Rotter - 2 years ago Reply Helpful review thnx Chris Weaver - 2 years ago Reply I am thinking of replacing my iPad Air 2 with this… I do wish it had built in 4G LTE… MacBooks would do well with this for a few users. Dom Esposito - 2 years ago Reply I’d love LTE built-in. Would make it much better for on-the-go use. Tethering is pretty simple though. PMZanetti - 2 years ago Reply Considering tethering to your iPhone is now automatic / on-demand by simply selecting it under the WiFi icon…its hard to justify additional built in LTE (that you would have to pay more for). Literally the ONLY downside is additional battery drain on the iPhone. But I’d rather that, than paying even more money for the same bucket of LTE. James Matlick - 2 years ago Reply Is this the 1.1 ghz processor or higher? If I get, not sure which one to get… Dom Esposito - 2 years ago Reply Yes it is. JStheoriginal - 2 years ago Thanks for clarifying…I was about to ask the same thing. :D James Matlick - 2 years ago I wonder how the 1.3 ghz one would do with video editing… Anyone know? tonyadams669 - 2 years ago Anyone with beyond retardedness, How the hell are you supposed to edit videos with such a slowest processor? E-Life (@e_life) - 2 years ago I got the 1.3 Ghz version 2 days ago and I gotta say iMovie is snappy. Rendering to files is slower than on my MBP, but defenitly workable. I don’t think you should run FCP on the MacBook. The overall feel of the MacBook is, although it’s not the fastest machine I have, it’s certainly not ‘slow’. Keyboard is awesome when you get used to it, display is immaculate and the trackpad is a mindf*ck 😊…I love it so far! acslater017 - 2 years ago Reply Great video, with a fair perspective. My only question is, what’s up your battery life being HALF that Apple claims? I find their battery estimates to be spot on these days. Are multiple Chrome tabs sucking its battery, or just everyday use didn’t live up to the claimed 9-10 hours? Dom Esposito - 2 years ago Reply Everyday use just didn’t live up to the claims. :/ I’m mostly running FireFox, Safari, TweetDeck, Excel , iTunes, and HipChat on here at once. Nandan Desai (@nnddesai) - 2 years ago What is the biggest energy consumer out of the above mentioned apps (You can find that under activity monitor). Also, IMO Wrike is better solution of ‘collaboration and sharing thoughts/files than HipChat. Gazoo Bee - 2 years ago Reply Yeah, all the other reviewers say that the battery life is very close to Apple’s claims also. If you’re going to post a review with such a different result from everyone else, you should at least try to explain it. You probably should have done testing with other users or with a different mix of apps etc. Kenny (@TheBeerStoreGuy) - 2 years ago Reply Great review! It confirmed a lot of what I had thought about it and it’s helped with my decision not to get one. I need something a bit more powerful. On a complete side note…I noticed you had a gmail icon on your dock. Is that a gmail desktop app or something else? Also, what is that USB hub you have under the desktop? Dom Esposito - 2 years ago Reply Gmail icon is a Chrome app. Basically a shortcut to the website haha. USB hub is a Satedhi 4-port hub from Amazon. Kenny (@TheBeerStoreGuy) - 2 years ago Awesome…did you create the chrome app yourself? And thanks for the info on the hub… Chris (@chriscarnie1) - 2 years ago Reply looks like the chrome app he’s using is Gmail GUI from the chrome store. rogifan - 2 years ago Reply What’s up with the ‘do you need it’ questions in product reviews these days? Like the Ars Technica headline for their Apple Watch review calling it “absolutely optional”. Really? If that’s the criteria we’re using now couldn’t one say just about every tech product is “absolutely optional”? Or just products in general. If people only bought things based on needs instead of wants the world would be a pretty boring and drab place. JStheoriginal - 2 years ago Reply Agreed. I SO don’t need this…no one even needs an Apple laptop…if they NEED to get online it can be with a basic cheap windows laptop. I think these reviews are more about whether the Apple-loving community as a whole would consider these new product launches to be worthwhile upgrades. rogifan - 2 years ago I hate the question though because most things people have they don’t really need. if this is the criteria now then I guess the MBP must be a huge failure because it has way more processing power and ports than most people would ever need. And I guess all these UHD phone displays and 4K TVs are huge failures because nobody needs them either. Oh and same with Xbox, Playstation, VR/AR etc. Nobody *needs* them either. Gazoo Bee - 2 years ago Reply I think the “do you need it” question makes perfect sense, especially considering the higher prices of today’s technology and Apple’s in particular. Also, your “Do we really need anything at all?” musing is a classic “reductio ad absurdum.” Sure, let’s all go back to using rocks for hammers and eating shit we find on the ground. Makes sense. charismatron - 2 years ago Reply Great review. I almost picked this up for my wife’s upcoming birthday, but on account of reviews like this I learned that would have been a terrible mistake. It’s slick design is a money magnet, but it’s performance, being what it is, puts it significantly below what my wife needs. Looks like we’ll both be rocking MBPs for the foreseeable future. Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago Reply I really enjoyed this review because it helped me finalize my decision not to get one. I was surprised at myself for even considering it; but, the form factor, portability, and desire for another computer did have me on the fence for a little while. The reason I wouldn’t get it is because it is essentially a $1,300 netbook, as stated in the review. I’ve had a $500 netbook before with similar specs (but three USB ports) and I can’t justify spending that much on a downgrade (performance-wise) from my MBP 13 2011. If the Macbook were closer to $800 (yes, I know this is Apple) I would probably sell my iPad Air 2 and get it. If it had two more ports and better real-world battery life I’d still be on the fence for $1,300. But, as it is right now I can’t justify that amount of money on this. Someone would have to be a true road-warrior or frequent flier to appreciate this, but why choose this over the current Macbook Air? Thanks for the review. JStheoriginal - 2 years ago Reply I think the main reason people really want this over the air is that the air’s screen isn’t great…non-retina. :/ srgmac - 2 years ago Which begs the question, why not upgrade the airs with retina displays? Everything else about the airs how they are right now is perfect IMHO except for the displays — they SUCK; I really don’t want or need a thinner device and I could care less about it being fanless. Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago I’m wondering if the Air will be discontinued now that the Macbook is the new king (or queen) of thinness? I don’t see the point in Apple selling both, especially now that the entire line is Retina for the exception of the Air. If Apple can improve the battery life and add two ports it’s a wrap for the Air. rogifan - 2 years ago I think the Airs will be gone in a couple years. Remember Apple was still selling the plastic MacBook in 2011. But I think the rMBP will replace them not the rMB. Maybe the rMB will get another port if the feedback to Apple is overwhelming for it. But my guess is Skylake will allow Apple to produce a thinner and lighter Pro. And this way Apple will be able to keep a real differentiation between the consumer and prosumer lines. Once the rMB gets cheaper there’s no reason to keep the Air around. Maciej Trybiło (@maciejtrybilo) - 2 years ago Reply Windows Vista was great if you managed your expectations accordingly. Dom Esposito - 2 years ago Reply Haha srgmac - 2 years ago Reply Lmao, remember those windows Mohave ads? They were so desperate :p srgmac - 2 years ago Reply Great review, although I don’t agree one should have to manage their expectations for $1300 USD. 4.5 hours of battery life on 50% display brightness? 480p camera? No thunderbolt ports, not even ONE? Come on…you can’t tell me this is too thin one tiny thunderbolt port…and given how we heard Apple tell us thunderbolt was the port of the future multiple times…this is just sad. The MacBook airs are better in every single aspect – including price, except for the display. I don’t understand why they don’t upgrade the airs to have retina displays; that’s what I really want. I guess I’m stuck with my MBAir until they either get thunderbolt 3 or retinas. But anyway, aren’t the airs portable enough? Does a few mm in thickness gone really justify the loss of everything else? IMHO, no, not even close. BTW, I can edit 1080p30 just fine on my MBAir connected to my thunderbolt storage and display. Scott Talbot (@Scott_Talbot) - 2 years ago Reply Everyone is free to their own opinion. But you are reaching in every category trying to make this seem horrible but no aspect is. Price? It’s not that expensive. Lack of thunderbolt 3? I own a mac pro and edit 6k raw footage and I don’t even use tb 2. 480p? Who cares? Like yeah it’s not HD but I don’t use Photo Booth or FaceTime enough to care. Battery is pretty good. I get like 8 hours on full brightness. BTW, 30p isn’t a framerate you should edit in. 24/23.976 is the standard. And I’m sorry I don’t edit films in starbucks. Aunty Troll (@AuntyTroll) - 2 years ago So why not get rid of the Mac Pro and just use one of these for photo editing? rogifan - 2 years ago Reply Adding a retina display to the MBA would esentially make it too much like the 13″ rMBP. I think it’s obvious the Airs will go away once the rMB comes down in price and the rMBP gets lighter. In a year or two you’ll esentially have your rMBA it will just be called rMBP. Scott Talbot (@Scott_Talbot) - 2 years ago Reply I’ve been using mine (1.1) a lot in the past month as well. I love it. I got that huge adaptor the other day. I’ve only had to used it once to transfer a bunch of films. I have a mac pro at home that I use for video editing but I’m between projects so I haven’t touched it recently. But the point is I’ve been creating 1080p presentation slides in photoshop with no problems. Yes you have to have a certain workflow to not need a port but I minimized plugging stuff into laptops years ago. And the performance… sorry but I think most of population will be okay with this laptop. And if you aren’t, or you think you’re too good for it, then buy another laptop and stop complaining. JStheoriginal - 2 years ago Reply For me it’s all about the retina display…so I’m more about deciding whether a rMBP or rMB is the best use of money. My husband just got the rMBP and it’s definitely not that light compared to my 2011 Air. Scott Talbot (@Scott_Talbot) - 2 years ago Yeah I love the retina screen. the new MB is just efficient. It’s the size of the 11″ air but with a 12″ screen that is retina so it shows the real-estate of the 13″. alfredprunesquallor - 2 years ago The rMB is actually significantly smaller than the 11″ MBA, the keyboard and trackpad are miles better, the display is bigger/retina and the performance is comparable. Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago Reply “And if you aren’t, or you think you’re too good for it, then buy another laptop and stop complaining.” This is a forum where people are encouraged to comment, which involves voicing their opinions on all things Apple. If people feel like discussing why they would or wouldn’t get a particular Apple product that is their perogative and contibutes to the discussion. Your comments here come across as a person who’s offended that someone doesn’t find practical or valuable the product that you chose to buy. Finally, just because you don’t use FaceTime a lot, Thunderbolt 3, or care for more battery life doesn’t mean there aren’t other people who consider those things as dealbreakers. Just chill out and don’t take everyone’s comments personally. We are just discussing tech here, not politics or sports. Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago And by the way, Scott, I wasn’t trying to come at you harsh or anything. I just think comments like yours are what change the ‘atmopshere’ of forums like this one. Dismissing someone by telling them to stop complaining because they don’t like your choice of computer really is messed up. Joshua - 2 years ago I think Scott’s point is more to the effect that people are commenting that this laptop serves no purpose because it doesn’t do X or doesn’t have Y. In that light, using the same logic you employ below, then, those comments are as useless and dismissive as what you point out. I agree with your assertion that forums should be places of idea exchange, but that’s probably old-fashioned and naive. Nowadays, forums are places to blindly insist that our own ideas are superior to anything anyone else has to say. . . . F- it. Do you really not see the inherent irony in the following: “I just think comments like yours are what change the ‘atmopshere’ of forums like this one. Dismissing someone by telling them to stop complaining because they don’t like your choice of computer really is messed up.” Brad Kramer - 2 years ago Reply Dom, Great review. Where did you get that leather cover? Chad Duerksen (@Chad_pole) - 2 years ago Reply Love mine. As a professional photographer, it does everything I need to do on the road. I still do video editing at home, but never needed a laptop for it. The 1.2ghz model is equivalent to a 2014 Air in terms of speed, so that works fine for me. The keyboard is amazing and I hope Apple adopts it for the desktop wireless version. Wouldn’t go back to a bulky Pro after having such a light and portable machine. Cocacolakid (@Cocacolakid) - 2 years ago Reply Yes, people spending $1300 should have to manage their expectations. Ridiculous. Francisco Javier Lopez Zuniga - 2 years ago Reply I purchased this laptop because quite frankly – it is gorgeous. I don’t mind paying for quality. But then I decided to use it – and it went downhill from there. I know experiences are variable – but for me – no way would i pluck down 1200+ for a laptop that at the end of day was horrible. Sure opening windows , browsing were ok. But when it came down to actually working with excel, word, email our in-house mac business software at the company i work for started to make it crawl. That twas enough for me to say hell with it and returned it. When i am on my business mode – running salesforce, all apps needed to make money are open this computer was worth 100 bucks. It is literally a netbook experience wrapped in apple. Slow. I put the funds from that purchase towards a new 2015 macbook retina and I am back pleasantville. By the way, I ran windows 10 on it. And that thing flew. Microsoft really did optimize windows. Funny thing about it it ran beautifully on this mac but on my surface pro 3 windows 10 lags a lot. alfredprunesquallor - 2 years ago Reply Well, I don’t know what your “in-house mac business software” is but I an using Outlook and all the Office apps on the 1.3GHz machine with no issues at all. Plus I’m getting more like 8-hour battery life (I don’t usually have seven apps and 15 browser windows open simultaneously though – I don’t know anybody that does that). Photoshop works nicely, Xcode, too. But it’s the size, weight and display that really are amazing on this machine (compared to the 13″ MBA I was using previously). I was able to downsize to a smaller briefcase, and believe me, that really makes a difference. amaiter - 2 years ago Alfred, your use is more aligned to what I do for my work at a consulting company. Most of the work I do as a consultant is in the cloud. Nowadays I find that most of the Fortune 500 companies crackdown on security limits the use of USB drives and whatnot, so the one port, compact, retina display solution would work for someone who travels and works mostly in the cloud and Microsoft Office. Do you still get 8 hours with Outlook open and online? That app alone kills the battery life of my 2012 15″ retina. Thanks for sharing your experience. Michael Paine - 2 years ago Reply I have had the Macbook for 2 weeks. It is great for travel and runs all my software well, including “legacy” Windows and DOS apps (via Parallels and DOSBOX). Michael Paine - 2 years ago Reply and to protect it in my backpack I am using a padded pouch that I bought for an iPad. There are a screenshot of the Macbook running Windows and DOS here: Thierry Rutaganira - 2 years ago Reply Hey Michael, How would you rate the speed of the Windows operating system you are using on your 2015 Macbook. I have been considering buying one for the past month, but haven’t because I cannot find any information on people’s experience with parallels on it. JStheoriginal - 2 years ago Apparently it’s really good! https://9to5mac.com/2015/05/15/retina-macbook-windows-10/ Michael Paine - 2 years ago Well XP is running better than it did on my last Windows computer in 2003! I only use it occasionally for legacy software.I installed Win8 out of interest but have not experimented with it. Michael Paine - 2 years ago Reply I have come across a limitation of the slower processor. I have been using Synk for several years to keep data (files) on an iMac and Macbook Pro synchronised. I thought Synk was not working when opened on the rMB until I displayed all activity. Then I realised it was taking a very long time to check the files on each folder. I ran the same app on the iMac (late 2012) and it runs at least 10 times faster. That is OK for me but other users who have no choice to use Synk on the rMB may find it frustrating. Charles Nordlander - 2 years ago Reply Yet another in a series of misleading reviews about the new Macbook, which all follow a similar pattern: the author criticizes it for being “underpowered” and/or offering “compromised performance,” and then fails to offer any real-world examples in which this is true. Actually, in this review, there was one: if video rendering is part of what you do for a living–which I’m assuming is true for the author, who seems to do pro editing work–then this is not the laptop for you. No kidding. This is as irrelevant as having an Indy race driver review a stock Mustang GT and criticize it for being underpowered for his line of work. Here’s the truth about the new Macbook: unless you’re a pro using power-hungry software all day long to earn your living–video editors, pro photographers and graphic designers, I’m talkng to you–it will easily handle any task that you’re likely to throw at it. And it’s not that you can’t run power-hungry software on the new Macbook–you can, and I’ve been using the Adobe CS6 suite of apps just fine, thank you–it’s just that it will take longer. That’s an issue for pros, but not for mainstream users. Senior Macworld editor Glenn Fleishman just wrote about his month-long experience using the new Macbook, in which–among many other tasks–he has been laying out a new 2,000 page book using Adobe InDesign with no problems whatsoever. Bottom line: for creative professionals who use power-hungry software to earn their living, this review tells them what they already knew: this new Macbook isn’t going to become your main computer. But for the 99.99% of us who don’t fall into that group, the new Macbook feels as fast and capable in real-world tasks as you’re likely to need, all in the lightest, smallest Macbook design ever. johanikra - 2 years ago Reply Voila @Charles thats exactly how it is. Also a previuous comment. I do not edit FCP X in Starbucks or any other but place but home alfredprunesquallor - 2 years ago Reply @Charles, I agree completely. I don’t think there have been many reviewers (including this one) that are “typical” users. Really? Seven apps running at once? Plus fifteen browser windows open? Who does that? Give me a machine that runs Outlook, Office, Photoshop and Xcode in a fair snappy manner with a retina display, give it the footprint of a piece of paper and an 8-hour battery and I’m good. If people want to call that a “netbook”, fine. Gazoo Bee - 2 years ago Reply I agree also, “performance” is actually subjective and it’s about response time. I used to see this all the time when I repaired Macs for a living. People would come in with what everyone who worked there would think of as the slowest piece of shit possible. We would find some way to politely tell the customer that maybe they should upgrade or give them tips for increasing performance by closing background apps etc. and they would be shocked at the suggestion that their computer was “slow.” To them, it had perfectly acceptable performance. For those in the industry, anything you have to wait for is a “problem,” but not so much for end users. Bram Jeurissen (@bramjeurissen) - 2 years ago Reply What Gmail app are you using? I’m very curious! Joshua - 2 years ago Reply Fairly sick of seeing sweeping generalizations like the following, regarding this computer: “…there’s only one USB-C port and a headphone jack on this MacBook. This will create a problem for most people…” I’m frankly quite surprised your editors let a comment like that through when reviewing the article. Do you have any research or reasoning to back up that statement? I’d be willing to bet that most of the people at which this laptop is aimed are in the same boat as you — most of their data storage needs are meet by the cloud (I’m sure Apple is hoping it’s iCloud that’s meeting those needs). Let’s agree not to perpetuate the myth that one USB-C port cripples the Macbook for “most people”, until we’ve established what the true wired connectivity needs are for “most people”.

BUT I decided to go for this as I offload all my intensive tasks to a server anyway. Hoping I won’t be displeased with the performance for everything else. Only gripe so far is I have to wait 3 weeks for it to turn up :( Steve (@StevenBrennanJr) - 2 years ago Reply My new Space grey Macbook may look gorgeous but it has the quality of a $200 computer. I’ve been experiencing so many problems with it, the FaceTime camera not working, the screen flickering, the computer turning on and off as it pleases, battery getting unusually hot and etc… I took it to Apple and they sent it out to get repaired. When I got it back from the Apple Store in Manhasset I played around with it for 40 minutes while they where replacing the isight camera on my defected iPhone 6 plus. Everything appeared to be fine so I thought nothing of it. They changed the entire screen and the bottom part that contains the battery and put all new wiring in. As soon as I got home all the issues that I had before sending it out to get repaired with Apple started to re-occur, and new problems started to present them selves as well. When I went to pick up the computer I felt and heard a component on the inside of the computer move(which is odd because the computer has no moving parts). Which made me infuriated because I got the computer back in worser conditions then before I originally sent it out. I called Apple care because a brand new computer should not be having these issues, its unacceptable. When I was on the phone with Apple care I demanded a new computer because I am a freshman in college and that is my main computer to do all school work on, my text books and basically my entire school life runs off of it. I can not afford to have the computer out of my hands for two weeks in a row. It is spending more time in the shop then it is with me. I said to them why can’t I just walk into an Apple store and say take this junky PC and give me a new computer. Then they said there no one can take care of something like that. Then I told Apple care theres always someone who can do something and demanded that they connect me to someone who could, and they refused to. Then they go on about how it takes longer to go through that process then it would to be repaired. Can someone please help me with this major issue? I would be so grateful. Apple should not take care of customers the way they did with me, and i’m sure this is not the first time Apple Care has treated someone like this. Dianne Ward (@dmwardphotograp) - 2 years ago Reply I am an Appleholic! I love all my products. I was in the market for an upgrade to my Ipad (second generation). I have a 2009 17 inch MBP that is a beast, and now seriously outdated. My work laptop is a 13 inch MBP which although much smaller than my personal 17 inch is still a bit big for outings when I don’t need the size, hence my desire for a new Ipad. Before purchasing my new gold Macbook, I put serious thought into a Surface Pro 3. I tried it out, and although it is very good, I just don’t like the Microsoft operating system for my personal user. This put me back into making the decision for a new Ipad (waiting for the November release of the Ipad Pro) or the 12 inch Macbook. I made the purchase Friday night and have to say I am thrilled. I had read so many reviews both positive and negative and thought I would post my thoughts as I have used it exclusely the past few days. 1. Keyboard – had no problem adapting to the new design, very comfortable. I read so many comments that people have had to adjust, for me it was natural from the first key stroke. 2. Performance – I am not a gamer and don’t do any video editing. I do edit photos and immediately installed Creative Cloud with Lightroom and Photoshop. (Having the OSX operating system was a big decision factor, I can only use Lightroom mobile on my Ipad and really wanted the full software). I do not do any crazy editing of pics, so for basic stuff, contrast, white balance, crop, etc. the performance is really good on the Macbook. The screen is a little small but a welcome trade off for the ease of mobility of this computer. I can slip it into my camera bag and hardly notice it is there. 3. Single Port – for me this was not a deal breaker. I hardly plug anything into my laptops, the only thing I needed is a SD card reader, which of course I also need a USB-C to USB dongle to be able to attach it to the computer. My camera also includes wi-fi connectibity so it is not 100% required, but I like the speed of transferring photos using a card reader. Since I don’t have to do this daily, not a big deal to have to attach something to the Macbook. 4. Retina Display – whats to say, it is AWESOME! Really could not justify the MBA 11 inch model without the retina display. 5. Camera – I hardly ever use it on my other laptops. So I hear it is not good, not a concern to me. All in all for my usage this is an outstanding computer. I love it! It definitely is the computer for me. I look forward to not having to take my other MBP and ipad when traveling. Just my thoughts, Apple makes a computer for every user type. There is no one stop option, you have to weigh out how you use the item and then select the model that best works for you.

Overall, food prices fell 0.3 percent in March, mainly due to lower fruit and vegetable prices. Fruit and vegetable prices were down 3.0 percent due to seasonally lower prices for apples and carrots. “Apple and carrot prices usually fall at this time of the year as we approach the colder months. One kilo of apples cost $2.88 in March compared with $4.40 in February and $5.04 in January,” consumer prices acting manager Nicola Growden said. "Apples remained slightly more expensive than the March 2016 average price of $2.67 a kilo." Higher prices for avocados and mandarins partly offset the decrease in fruit and vegetable prices. Grocery food prices rose 0.2 percent, with higher prices for chocolate (up 6.1 percent) and cheese (up 3.0 percent). Chocolate prices rose, influenced by higher prices for boxed chocolate. A 250g of boxed chocolate cost $8.74 in March, up from $6.77 in February. Cheese prices were at their highest level since August 2014. Annual food prices up, led by milk, cheese, and butter Food prices increased 1.3 percent in the year to March 2017, led by grocery food. This followed an increase of 2.2 percent in the year to February 2017. Grocery food prices increased 2.2 percent in the year, with higher prices for most dairy products. Fresh milk prices increased 6.5 percent, the largest annual increase since November 2014. Cheese and butter prices also increased, up 11 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Fruit and vegetable prices increased 2.6 percent, influenced by higher prices for carrots, kumara, and strawberries. Vegetable prices increased 4.4 percent and fruit prices increased 0.6 percent. Meat, poultry, and fish decreased 1.5 percent mainly due to lower prices for chicken. Chicken prices decreased 6.5 percent for the year, and have been falling annually since June 2015.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Industry  ⋮  Mobile Qualcomm Strikes Back at Apple – Countersues It Over iPhone and iPad Royalties By Omar Sohail Apr 11, 2017 16Shares Share Tweet Submit The partnership between Apple and Qualcomm looked to have been going smoothly until the former slapped the leading chipset manufacturer with a $1 billion lawsuit stating that Qualcomm charged royalties on tech that were not related to the company in any manner. In response to that, the chipset maker has struck back with a counter suit, stating that Apple has breached its contract with the firm. Among Several Accusations, Qualcomm States That Apple Misinterpreted the Latter’s Modem’s Performance in the iPhone 7 Family In addition to breaching the contract with Qualcomm, the SoC manufacturer states in its latest post that the company also interfered with long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple. It has also been detailed that Apple chose not to utilize the full performance capabilities of Qualcomm’s LTE chips present in its iPhone 7 family. Related The Samsung Galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8+ Un-boxed From A Very Special Box In Three Color Options Remember, Apple attempts to use more than one company’s components in order to seal a better price for the entire batch. Since more iPhones are sold in a given year than any of the company’s competitors’ mobile devices, its partners have no choice but to comply. Don Rosenberg, Executive Vice President has recognized the role of Apple in changing the tech landscape but has also stated unfair licensing terms from Qualcomm, as he states the following: Advertisement “Over the last ten years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services. But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm’s fundamental cellular technologies. Now, after a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm. We intend to vigorously defend our business model, and pursue our right to protect and receive fair value for our technological contributions to the industry.” The company will be seeking damages from Apple and will also be looking to prevent the California-based giant from interfering with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple in the future. Related Here’s The Samsung Galaxy S8 Hands On; Take A Look At The Device’s Stunning Design As a closing note, whatever the disagreements both companies had, Qualcomm has also displayed that it does not play the game fairly when it comes to possessing a huge market share in the mobile chipset market. Ever wondered why Samsung cannot supply its SoCs to other manufacturers? It is because Qualcomm has prevented the Korean tech giant from doing so in the form of a standard essential patent license. What outcome do you think is going to take place between the two tech giants? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Overall, food prices fell 0.3 percent in March, mainly due to lower fruit and vegetable prices. Fruit and vegetable prices were down 3.0 percent due to seasonally lower prices for apples and carrots. “Apple and carrot prices usually fall at this time of the year as we approach the colder months. One kilo of apples cost $2.88 in March compared with $4.40 in February and $5.04 in January,” consumer prices acting manager Nicola Growden said. “Apples remained slightly more expensive than the March 2016 average price of $2.67 a kilo.” Higher prices for avocados and mandarins partly offset the decrease in fruit and vegetable prices. Grocery food prices rose 0.2 percent, with higher prices for chocolate (up 6.1 percent) and cheese (up 3.0 percent). Chocolate prices rose, influenced by higher prices for boxed chocolate. A 250g of boxed chocolate cost $8.74 in March, up from $6.77 in February. Cheese prices were at their highest level since August 2014. Annual food prices up, led by milk, cheese, and butter Food prices increased 1.3 percent in the year to March 2017, led by grocery food. This followed an increase of 2.2 percent in the year to February 2017. Grocery food prices increased 2.2 percent in the year, with higher prices for most dairy products. Fresh milk prices increased 6.5 percent, the largest annual increase since November 2014. Cheese and butter prices also increased, up 11 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Fruit and vegetable prices increased 2.6 percent, influenced by higher prices for carrots, kumara, and strawberries. Vegetable prices increased 4.4 percent and fruit prices increased 0.6 percent. Meat, poultry, and fish decreased 1.5 percent mainly due to lower prices for chicken. Chicken prices decreased 6.5 percent for the year, and have been falling annually since June 2015. Nicola Growden explains the food price index results.

Lawsuits are motivated by self-interest. That’s an important principle to keep in mind when reading about the legal back-and-forth between two of the world’s largest companies. Apple in January sued Qualcomm, contending that the maker of smartphone computer chips abuses its control over essential mobile phone technology to overcharge Apple and others. Companies including Apple pay Qualcomm a percentage of each phone’s total sale price for the chipmaker’s patented wireless technology, whether they buy Qualcomm’s chips or not. Qualcomm struck back earlier this week by saying Apple misled US government regulators to spur them to crack down on Qualcomm’s business practices, including how the company calculates its royalty fees. By the looks of the litigation so far, this promises to be a nasty fight. Apple is seeking $1bn (€943m) from Qualcomm and billions of dollars more to compensate for years of overcharging. And if Apple wins, Qualcomm’s highly profitable business model is potentially at risk. Apple is not alone in its complaints about how Qualcomm calculates the fees for its technology. A crucial question, however, is why Apple is picking this moment to press the issue. Qualcomm’s model has been in place for a couple of decades. It could be that Apple reached a breaking point with Qualcomm. Apple may also be piggybacking on work of regulators in places like the US, South Korea and China, which have made claims similar to Apple’s about how customers pay Qualcomm. Or it could be that Apple’s iPhone franchise is financially vulnerable like never before, and litigation is the way a cornered corporation strikes back to protect a fragile business. The lawsuit against Qualcomm comes at a point when sales of new smartphones have slowed to a crawl. Research firm IDC expects global smartphone sales will increase 4.2% this year, a bit better than last year’s 2.5%, which was the slowest rate ever. Apple’s revenue from its iPhone line fell last year for the first time in the device’s history. That is a particularly painful set of market conditions for Apple, which generates about two-thirds of its annual revenue from iPhone sales. And perhaps more worrisome for Apple, it’s also becoming tougher for the company to maintain its remarkably consistent profit margins. Apple is known for being allergic to anything that dents its high and resilient gross margins — the percentage of total revenue left over after Apple pays to make its products. They have hovered around 38% to 40% quarter after quarter. It’s a figure on which Apple and its investors fixate. I’m not sure the company needs to focus anymore on continuing to hit those gross margin targets, but that’s a discussion for another day. The trouble is that costs for essential parts of smartphones, including memory chips and screens, have been rising, and phone makers are having trouble passing the full freight of the cost increases on to their customers. Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimated iPhone gross margins have dropped 15 percentage points since 2012 and will most likely decline further. To be fair to Apple, it has developed new lines of business, including sales of apps and streaming music subscriptions, that generate significantly higher margins than the iPhone does. But the iPhone remains the business on which Apple depends. Investors’ fears about Apple’s gross margin pressure have abated a bit in recent months. But the future trend is unmistakable. Apple keeps adding more high-cost parts and materials to the iPhone, including reportedly an ultra high-resolution screen in one of the next iPhone models and perhaps technology to enable future 3D or virtual reality-style features. Apple has been clever about finding ways to subtly increase the prices it charges for iPhones, but competition from Samsung and other makers means Apple can’t charge iPhone buyers enough to fully offset rising costs. Another lever Apple can pull, of course, is to lower its bills for the technologies and parts that go into the iPhone. Keep that essential goal in mind during what is sure to be many months of headlines about the Apple-Qualcomm dispute. This may be a fight between technology powers, but base human instincts are at work here. Apple’s courtroom battle is motivated by fear.

And things aren’t going smoothly. [Photos: courtesy of Fitbit] By Mark Sullivan04.12.17 | 7:58 pm Not too long ago, most consumers were satisfied that simple fitness trackers, not smartwatches, were a good way to enter the age of the “quantified self.” Sales of Fitbit’s trackers flourished, and the company held a successful IPO. But times have changed, the numbers show. More fitness-minded people are moving to smartwatches, mainly the Apple Watch. Fitbit, which is now working on a full-fledged smartwatch of its own, may find this a dangerous era in which to live. In the run-up to the launch of the Apple Watch back in 2014, Fitbit CEO James Park got the same question a lot: How are you going to compete? The assumption was that Apple would deliver a beautiful device that did everything a Fitbit did and much more. Park didn’t seem concerned in the least. He argued, rightly at the time, that fitness trackers and smartwatches were different things, and that there was lots of room in the market for both. After launching in April 2015, Apple Watch didn’t exactly set the world on fire sales-wise in the first year. Apple didn’t disclose numbers, but most estimates put the number between 10 million to 15 million units. Many consumers continued to be happy with fitness trackers that did a small set of things (like counting steps and monitoring sleep) and that cost well under $200. Fitbit sales remained strong heading into the company’s June 2015 IPO and beyond. But now, a quarter and change into 2017, Fitbit’s situation isn’t looking as good. Sales began to soften during 2016. The company cut its full-year revenue guidance back 8% midway through the year. It also reduced its unit sales forecast for the 2016 holiday quarter (its stock taking a hammering), and ended up selling 6.5 million trackers during the period. Revenue fell 19%. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch has its biggest quarter ever, selling an estimated 5.6 million devices. CEO Park attributed the lull to the mass market adoption curve: “. . . we have successfully captured a large portion of the innovator and early adopter segments in tracker market,” he said during a recent earnings call. “We believe the early and late majority segments of the tracker market represents an additional significant target opportunity of between 40 million to 80 million new tracker customers.” Apple made some important choices in last fall’s Apple Watch Series 2 to promote that mind-set. It noticeably shifted both the feature set and the marketing of the second version of the Watch to target the fitness crowd: The new device became officially waterproof (for swimmers) and added GPS (to track runs). There was even a new Nike+ Watch with special fitness bands and additional run-tracking software on board. The Watch’s message notifications and other communications features were downplayed. The migration from pure fitness trackers toward smartwatches is nothing new to Fitbit. Like its competitors, the company has gradually added smartwatch-like features to its trackers, such as smartphone integration features including message notifications and music control. It introduced heart-rate sensors to its devices beginning with the Charge HR in early 2015. Fitbit Blaze What should Fitbit do now? Well, if it buys the argument that the gravity in the wearables space is heading toward the smartwatch, it should release a real smartwatch, with all the trimmings, ASAP. Voila! Company executives acknowledged late last month that they are indeed building a full-fledged smartwatch to compete for the same consumers who might buy an Apple Watch. The device reportedly offers GPS, heart-rate monitoring, mobile payments, four days of battery life, a color display with 1,000 nits of brightness (like the Apple Watch 2), and a $300 price tag. That’s all great, but the context in which Fitbit is doing all this is, well, not ideal. The company is trying to grow from a fitness tracker company into a smartwatch maker just as the Apple Watch is gaining strength and as Fitbit sales are slowing. While Apple has successfully positioned the Watch as a fitness tracker that’s also a full-on smartwatch, Fitbit is just now trying to build its first real smartwatch. I’d much rather be Apple in that scenario. Fitbit Blaze An April 11 article by Yahoo Finance‘s JP Mangalindan cites sources saying Fitbit wanted to release its new smartwatch this spring but has delayed launch until the fall because of production problems. From the report: “In one of the more final prototypes, the GPS wasn’t working because the antennae wasn’t in the right place,” one of those sources told Yahoo Finance. “They had to go back to the drawing board to redesign the product so the GPS got a strong signal.” Yahoo Finance‘s story also reports that Fitbit is having trouble making the device waterproof, as the Apple Watch 2 is. It’s still unclear if Fitbit will be able to get these issues solved before it’s time to launch this fall. “Regardless of whether Fitbit manages to make it waterproof, I think they have to release the watch later this year,” one of Yahoo Finance‘s sources said. “It’s literally sink or swim time for them.” First Generation vs. Third Generation If Fitbit launches its first real smartwatch in the fall, it will probably debut at roughly the same time Apple will announce its third smartwatch—likely called the Apple Watch Series 3. And based on the Yahoo Finance report, it sounds like Fitbit, in the best case scenario, will be releasing a smartwatch with a feature set comparable to that of last year’s Apple Watch 2. And finally, Yahoo Finance’s sources say the Fitbit smartwatch will use the same squarish hardware design as last year’s aesthetically challenged Fitbit Blaze. Competing with Apple on hardware design is already a daunting challenge; if Fitbit recycles a lackluster design from last year for its new device, it suggests to me that the company has chosen to simply cede the beauty crown to Apple. Fitbit stock fell 2% on the Yahoo Finance report of smartwatch production delays. But these technical hiccups are just a small symptom of a much larger challenge. Fitbit, which is now 10 years old, may be dealing with the growing pains of becoming a smartwatch company.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe VR Samsung Gear VR (2017) vs. Google Daydream View Will Shanklin April 12, 2017 New Atlas compares the features and specs of the 2017 Gear VR (left) and Google Daydream View View gallery - 21 images Samsung has a new Gear VR with controller arriving alongside the Galaxy S8 later this month. While not much has changed besides the controller, let's look at the specs and features breakdown between the 2017 Gear VR and Google's Daydream View. Size Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information The Gear VR is a much larger headset. When positioned in the orientations you see above, the Gear is 25-percent wider, 16-percent longer and about the same height. Weight Daydream View is also 36-percent lighter. Build Daydream View's most striking feature is its (mostly) fabric design, which Google perhaps borrowed from the partially-fabric Oculus Rift. Colors In one of the few changes for the new Gear VR, Samsung ditched the old blue-black look for a dark gray color. Google gives you three Daydream colors to choose from. Android phone compatibility The Gear VR is still limited to Samsung flagship phones, while Daydream is targeting wider Android support. Right now, though, the more-established Gear VR has the longer list of supported phones. Gear-ready handsets include the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8+, S7, S7 edge, Note 5, S6 Edge+, S6 and S6 edge. The only Daydream-ready phones to date are the Google Pixel and XL, Moto Z and Z Force, ZenFone AR and Axon 7. While you'd expect Google to have the compatibility advantage in the long run, the apparent lack of early Daydream enthusiasm among Android manufacturers (LG, OnePlus, HTC and Samsung all skipped Daydream certification for their latest flagships) makes Daydream's future look a little murky. iPhone compatibility Given Apple's closed standards, the iPhone probably won't see any official or substantial VR support until Apple makes its own headset (if it ever does). Field of view Google has never stated the field of view specs for Daydream View, but our experience with Google's headset points to a noticeably narrower FOV than you'll find on the Gear VR. Keep in mind that the Gear's FOV will be a little lower than 101° if you use a smaller Samsung flagship (Galaxy S7, S6 or S6 edge) rather than one of the phablets (S8, S8+, S7 edge, Note 5 or S6 edge+). Display resolution Resolution isn't cut and dry, since it will depend on which phone you're putting inside either headset. The standard Gear VR resolution is 1,440 x 1280 per eye, though the Galaxy S8 and S8+ would technically crank that up to 1,480 x 1,440 per eye if the headset's lenses can utilize the entire display area. (We'll update when we can confirm.) Most Daydream phones will give the headset a 1,440 x 1,280 per-eye presentation, though the smaller Google Pixel phone will offer a mere 960p per eye experience. Display type You'll only find AMOLED screens on Gear VR-ready and Daydream-ready smartphones. Positional tracking Mobile VR still lacks positional tracking, so when you lean or move your body, the virtual world moves with you (rather than you leaning or moving within the virtual world). This is still the biggest limitation of mobile VR compared to higher-end PC setups. Motion controller While they're both a far cry from the advanced motion controls you can use with PC-based VR headsets (Oculus Touch and HTC Vive controllers), each of the mobile headsets now includes a rudimentary remote wand in the box. Without positional tracking or the ability to pair two together, however, these single controllers work more like Wii remotes than anything that lets you simulate having hands inside VR worlds. Trackpad The Gear VR's new controller essentially replaces the trackpad that was on the right temple of all previous Gear VR models, but the 2017 model still gives you that option as a fallback. Gamepad support You can also use a classic gamepad with the Gear VR – and some of its best games require one. Daydream View experiences are limited to the bundled motion control. Wireless In just about every other respect, mobile VR falls far behind PC VR, but its one advantage (well, apart from cost) is that it's wireless. Focus adjustment Glasses wearers have the option of wearing the Gear VR without their specs on, as you can turn a wheel on top of the headset to adjust the focus to fit your vision. Glasses support You also have the option, though, of wearing glasses underneath either headset. Connection port Like the 2016 model, the new Gear VR has adapters that let you swap between the USB-C enabled Galaxy S8 and S8+, and the rest of the microUSB-enabled Galaxy phones that play nice with the headset. Daydream View doesn't have a physical port that connects phone and headset. Software The Gear VR-ready Galaxies run Android with Samsung's TouchWiz UI, while Oculus handles the Gear VR UI and storefront. Right now the Gear VR has a massive content lead, as VR developers have been making content for it since 2014. Daydream's VR library should grow over time, but right now it's still fairly sparse. Release The new Gear VR releases on April 21, alongside the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Price Google offers a much cheaper package, as you get Daydream headset and controller for US$79. The previous Gear VRs already cost more than that, at $99, but with the controller added to the new model, its price jumps up to $130. Just remember that the headset itself is useless without a compatible phone – which powers the experience with display, horsepower, sensors and software – which will add significantly to the total cost.

Overall, food prices fell 0.3 percent in March, mainly due to lower fruit and vegetable prices. Fruit and vegetable prices were down 3.0 percent due to seasonally lower prices for apples and carrots. “Apple and carrot prices usually fall at this time of the year as we approach the colder months. One kilo of apples cost $2.88 in March compared with $4.40 in February and $5.04 in January,” consumer prices acting manager Nicola Growden said. “Apples remained slightly more expensive than the March 2016 average price of $2.67 a kilo.” Higher prices for avocados and mandarins partly offset the decrease in fruit and vegetable prices. Grocery food prices rose 0.2 percent, with higher prices for chocolate (up 6.1 percent) and cheese (up 3.0 percent). Chocolate prices rose, influenced by higher prices for boxed chocolate. A 250g of boxed chocolate cost  $8.74 in March, up from $6.77 in February. Cheese prices were at their highest level since August 2014. Annual food prices up, led by milk, cheese, and butter Food prices increased 1.3 percent in the year to March 2017, led by grocery food. This followed an increase of 2.2 percent in the year to February 2017. Grocery food prices increased 2.2 percent in the year, with higher prices for most dairy products. Fresh milk prices increased 6.5 percent, the largest annual increase since November 2014. Cheese and butter prices also increased, up 11 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Fruit and vegetable prices increased 2.6 percent, influenced by higher prices for carrots, kumara, and strawberries. Vegetable prices increased 4.4 percent and fruit prices increased 0.6 percent. Meat, poultry, and fish decreased 1.5 percent mainly due to lower prices for chicken. Chicken prices decreased 6.5 percent for the year, and have been falling annually since June 2015.

According to a new report from CNBC, Apple has a secret team currently working on developing a solution for treating diabetes that would be seen as the “holy grail” for the condition… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case The report, citing three people familiar with the matter, explains that Apple has hired a “small team” of biomedical engineers to work on the initiative. The team is said to be based out of an unmarked, nondescript office in Paolo Alto, California. The initiative sees Apple working on developing sensors that can constantly monitor blood sugar levels to better treat diabetes. While specific timeline information is unclear, the company is reportedly far enough along in it testing that it has been conducting feasibility trials: The initiative is far enough along that Apple has been conducting feasibility trials at clinical sites across the Bay Area and has hired consultants to help it figure out the regulatory pathways, the people said. One of the sources explained that Apple is developing optical sensors, which work by shining a light through the skin to measure glucose levels. To accurately be able to measure glucose level would be a huge breakthrough for Apple and the medical industry as a whole. Accurately detecting glucose levels has been such a challenge that one of the top experts in the space, John L. Smith, described it as “the most difficult technical challenge I have encountered in my career.” To succeed would cost a company “several hundred millions or even a billion dollars,” DexCom executive chairman Terrance Gregg previously told Reuters. Such an initiative was first imagined by Steve Jobs and Apple has been working on it for five years. Jobs imagined the solution being integrated into a wearable device, such as the Apple Watch. Jobs envisioned wearable devices, like smartwatches, being used to monitor important vitals, such as oxygen levels, heart rate and blood glucose. Apple has made a variety of acquisitions that lend credibility to this report. While specific information is still somewhat unclear, an initiative like this succeeding would not only help the success of Apple Watch, but also millions of diabetes patients.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Business  • Markets •  Money Real Estate Legal Corporate News One News Page > Markets > The Profound Implications Of 5 Increasingly Dominant Tech Companies The Profound Implications Of 5 Increasingly Dominant Tech Companies Wednesday, 12 April 2017 (9 hours ago) Authored by Lou Kerner via HackerNoon.com, I first wrote about the increasing domination Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon (aka FAMGA) in January of this year. It was not a particularly widely read piece. But every day since then, I’ve become surer of the simple, but profoundly impactful, realization that: 1. The most valuable companies in the U.S. are increasingly tech companies. 2. *The concentration of value (as denoted by market cap) being created in tech, is increasingly being created by the five largest companies, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon (aka FAMGA)* 3. The concentration of market cap in just five hands will have an *increasingly profound impact on innovation and wealth concentration in the U.S..* So I’ll keep beating the FAMGA drum. -FAMGA By The Numbers- As of Friday, April 7th , FAMGA stocks finished with an average market cap of $535 billion. The smallest FAMGA market cap is Facebook, at $407 billion. Number six in terms of market cap in U.S. tech land is Oracle at at $182 billion, just 45% of the market cap of Facebook. So there is massive, and growing, separation between FAMGA and the rest of tech in terms of market cap: As of April 7, 2017 The domination of technology companies in terms of market cap is actually a fairly recent occurrence. Just 11 years ago, Microsoft was the only tech company in the top 5: -FAMGA Stocks Have Meaningfully Outperformed the non-FAMGA stocks in the NASDAQ 100 Over The Last 2+ Years- The FAMGA stocks have had a great run the last two years, and that trend has continued so far in 2017, continuing to outpace the performance of the 95 non-FAMGA stocks in the NASDAQ 100: As of 4/7/17 As a result of the outperformance of FAMGA relative to the non-FAMGA stocks in the NASDAQ 100, the percentage of the total market cap of the NASDAQ 100 that is comprised of FAMGA market cap, has continued to grow: -The Implications Of The FAMGA Market Cap Concentration- *Innovation Slows In Monopolies/Duopolies* I’m not saying FAMGA are doing anything wrong. They are simply all great competitors benefitting from the “winner, or two winners, take all” markets that increasingly comprise most digital markets (and almost all markets are going digital). Take the internet advertising market. The good news is that according to the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), internet advertising was up 20% year-ver-year in 3Q ’16. *The bad news is that, if you take FAMGA out of the equation, internet advertising revenue probably shrank for everyone else:* Data From Jason Kint, Digital Content Next, Dec. 2016 The analysis above groups Amazon in to the “Everyone Else” category. Given that Amazon is estimated to have generated around $1 billion in advertising revenue, it’s likely that Amazon grew it’s advertising revenue by more than $40 million Q3 16 v Q2 ’16. The point is, that taking FAMGA out of the equation, the market is actually shrinking. What happens in shrinking markets? Innovation is stifled due to lack of competitive reasons to innovate, and due to lack of resources. CBInsights reported that global ad tech funding fell 33% in 2016 to $2.2 billion, from $3.2 billion in 2015, putting it back to where it was in 2013. That decrease is innovation withering in the ad tech market. E-commerce is in the U.S. is increasingly being dominated by Amazon, which *accounted for 53% of all e-commerce revenue growth in 2016,* bringing it’s growing control of the e-commerce market to 43% share. *Funding to e-commerce companies fell over 44% in 2016* to $9 billion according to CBInsights. That’s a lot less capital funding innovation in e-commerce. *Adjacent Markets Become Ripe For Domination* *Software is increasingly eating the world. *Technical superiority is increasingly the largest factor in who dominates different markets. Then it makes sense that FAMGA will increasingly dominate other markets. One obvious example of this premise is the public cloud space, where Amazon dominates: Amazon has roughly the same dominant global market share in the pubic cloud space as it does in U.S. e-commerce. Other FAMGA members, Google and Microsoft (along with IBM) are gaining share, and everyone else is losing. *Other Implications/Thoughts* There are numerous other important implications to consider, but I’’m going to write about three now, and save the rest for future FAMGA drumbeats. *First, it’s not just adjacent markets that are ripe for domination by FAMGA, it’s any new market with large potential that takes large amounts of capital and technical expertise. *Think about AR/VR (Facebook). Think about the race to space (Amazon). Think about self driving cars (Google). Now each of those areas have significant other competitors, but I believe FAMGA are well positioned to take dominant share in each of those markets. *Second, we’ve been here before. *Below is one of my favorite all time charts. It shows the market cap market share of the 100 most valuable tech companies in the U.S., over time: *In 1985, IBM controlled over 70% of the total market cap of the 100 largest U.S. tech companies. In 1998 Microsoft controlled 30% of the total market cap, and we were worried that Microsoft was stifling of innovation. In 2012, Apple controlled over 25% of the market cap. Google was the largest market cap for 42 hours last year. History has taught us that nothing is constant but change.* Finally, simultaneous with the rise of FAMGA, the pace of innovation is accelerating, and there are a huge number of companies creating massive shareholder value through innovation. Just last week, Tesla surpassed Ford in market cap, at $49.3 billion. Tesla is now worth just 2% less than GM. Netflix is worth $60 billion. Uber is worth $66 billion. Intel just bought Mobileye for $15 billion. AirBnB is worth $30 billion. So there are lots of competing forces at play here. It turns out, this is complex (who knew?).* But the forces compelling FAMGA to ever greater share of market cap are strong, and as it continues, the implications will be increasingly profound.* » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   You Might Like Other recent news in Markets Lavrov & TILLERSON Hold Joint Press Conference - Live Feed The Suspense Is Over: PUTIN MEETS With Rex Tillerson At The Kremlin WELLS FARGO Tumbles To Lowest Since November After Buffett Dumps 9 Million Shares Something Strange Happened During Yesterday's LONDON PM Gold Fix Loonie Jumps After BANK OF CANADA Holds Rates, Sees Output Gap Closing Sooner Trump Reverses On NATO: "It's No LONGER OBSOLETE" New Trump Memo Promises "Dramatically More Efficient" Government; Lifts FEDERAL HIRING FREEZE Watch Live: Trump Holds First Press Briefing With NATO SECRETARY GENERAL Stoltenberg Despite "Ruthless Economic War", VENEZUELA, PDVSA Avoid Default With $2.6 Billion Payment Dragged United Passenger Files LEGAL ACTION Over Forceful Deplaning Twitter Facebook Page People Donald Trump Jude Law Vladimir Putin Rafael Correa Current Topics Hudson River Secret Team New Zealanders Syria Chemical Longer Obsolete Spotlight 📺 Live TV Movie Reviews Staff Stories Which Country Just Banned UBER This Week?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Apple prices continue to fall from January peak Thursday, 13 April 2017, 10:52 am Press Release: Statistics New Zealand Apple prices continue to fall from January peak 13 April 2017 Apple prices were $2.88 a kilogram in March, down more than $2.00 since hitting a record high in January, Stats NZ said today. Overall, food prices fell 0.3 percent in March, mainly due to lower fruit and vegetable prices. Fruit and vegetable prices were down 3.0 percent due to seasonally lower prices for apples and carrots. “Apple and carrot prices usually fall at this time of the year as we approach the colder months. One kilo of apples cost $2.88 in March compared with $4.40 in February and $5.04 in January,” consumer prices acting manager Nicola Growden said. „Apples remained slightly more expensive than the March 2016 average price of $2.67 a kilo.” Higher prices for avocados and mandarins partly offset the decrease in fruit and vegetable prices. Grocery food prices rose 0.2 percent, with higher prices for chocolate (up 6.1 percent) and cheese (up 3.0 percent). Chocolate prices rose, influenced by higher prices for boxed chocolate. A 250g of boxed chocolate cost $8.74 in March, up from $6.77 in February. Cheese prices were at their highest level since August 2014. Annual food prices up, led by milk, cheese, and butter Food prices increased 1.3 percent in the year to March 2017, led by grocery food. This followed an increase of 2.2 percent in the year to February 2017. Grocery food prices increased 2.2 percent in the year, with higher prices for most dairy products. Fresh milk prices increased 6.5 percent, the largest annual increase since November 2014. Cheese and butter prices also increased, up 11 percent and 27 percent, respectively. Fruit and vegetable prices increased 2.6 percent, influenced by higher prices for carrots, kumara, and strawberries. Vegetable prices increased 4.4 percent and fruit prices increased 0.6 percent. Meat, poultry, and fish decreased 1.5 percent mainly due to lower prices for chicken. Chicken prices decreased 6.5 percent for the year, and have been falling annually since June 2015. Nicola Growden explains the food price index results.

Blood tracking could grow into a $12 billion market. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Talk about a smart Silicon sugar rush. Sources say Apple, Google and Samsung are working to get their new wearable devices to monitor blood sugar - without the needle prick. The tech titans figure that'll help turn smartwatches and bracelets into gotta-have gadgets. They see gold in glucose. Research firm Global Data predicts the worldwide market for tracking blood sugar will grow to $12 billion by 2017. 29 million Americans suffer from diabetes. The tech giants are hiring scientists and engineers, and they're developing services that'll turn their mobile devices into a health data hub. Apple's HealthKit that aggregates health data from various apps will come out on its new operating system this fall. There's speculation Google will release a "Google Fit" health tracking service at its developers conference this week. It has already developed a "smart" contact lens that measures glucose. Samsung, which showed off this prototype health band in May, is working to imbed a feature that flashes blood-sugar warnings in future Galaxy Gear smartwatches. Regulation could be an issue. If the new wearables are marketed to diabetics, they'll likely be regulated. But they may be able to skirt it if they're used for nutrition. The tech companies will likely start focusing on non-medical applications like fitness and education.

By By Monique Villa, opinion contributor - 04/12/17 06:40 PM EDT 1   © Getty Images Which item would you rather have stolen: your phone or your wallet? Ask anyone, and you’ll probably get the same answer: the smartphone is the most valuable property. ADVERTISEMENT It’s not surprising. In the digital era, the contents of a stolen wallet can be replaced in a matter of hours. Worst case scenario, you might lose the cash. But if the contents of your phone end up in the wrong hands, the results can be devastating.   Our mobile phones have become the living record of our lives: emails, photos, messages, plus all the data stored in the various mobile settings and the apps that we choose to download: bank and payment details, medical information, our very own movements tracked on GPS; even our shopping preferences are meticulously stored. Simply put: give me your phone, and I will know who you are - beyond appearances, beyond who you claim to be. Give me your phone and I will see the real you. As with most forms of new technology, you can claim that sophisticated digital databases create both a risk and an opportunity. And that explains why there are currently two types of people constantly seeking access to digital banks; the criminals, and law enforcement agencies. While no one argues that criminals should get hold of anyone's data, the question of whether law enforcement should have access to data belonging to individuals accused of committing serious crime is a different one, and one that is raising much debate. Some, like Ken Roth, the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, argue that digital privacy has become the ultimate human right frontier: no one, apart from the individual in question, should have access to it. Others, like Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance Jr, believe there is instead a moral imperative to override such privacy if access to personal data could help save others' lives. Anyone who has been hacked or - even worse - blackmailed because intimate data was stolen, will tell you that such an intrusion can feel just as violating as having someone break into your home. They would be keen to protect digital privacy at all costs. But what would they say if evidence of those very hackings was stored inside someone's phone, protected by the same right? In December 2015, two terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California. For weeks after the killings, the FBI tried to access the data of the iPhone of one of the attackers but was unable to get past the encryption. Apple did not provide a so-called ‘backdoor’ to allow the authorities to conduct the search. This past March, Apple unveiled its latest operating system that makes encryption an even bigger feature of its devices: the upgrade gives consumers a higher level of protection from mobile threats, like identity theft and hacking. Apple is not a stand-alone case. Tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Facebook take protecting our private information very seriously. They argue the government has no right to access our encrypted data, and that even if tech companies created a ‘backdoor’ to assist police and prosecutors, this could pave the way for criminals and foreign governments to hack into the system. Ensuring data on digital devices remains impenetrable works well among consumers, but it can also present great risks. How can prosecutors go after criminals who leave digital evidence of their crimes across secured phones and cloud devices, if data is backed by the strongest encryption systems? This debate is even more daunting when taking into account serious crimes such as human trafficking. It is estimated that there are currently some 46 million people living in conditions of modern-day slavery across the world. That is more than any time in history. Every day, people are literally sold into forced labor or prostitution. This is a fast-growing crime, one worth an estimated 150 billion dollars a year. That’s more than Apple’s quarterly profit, and the second most lucrative crime after drugs dealing. When it comes to trafficking, the equation is in fact-low, risk-high returns.  According to Department of State, there were just 857 prosecutions in the entire world for labour trafficking and servitude in 2015, the most recent year data is available. Of those 857, there were 456 convictions. That’s a very small number. This is because, in many cases, investigators lack hard evidence to ensure a conviction. Often that evidence is locked away in a mobile phone. Take the example of a 12-year-old girl who came to the attention of Safe Horizon, an NGO supporting human trafficking survivors. She had been a victim of rape and exploitation. It is believed that her attacker had strong evidence of all the crimes stored on his mobile phone. In 2014, police obtained a warrant to search his devices. But because of its passwords and encryption, they were never able to gather the evidence they needed. The case stalled. Is this one of those cases when justice should trump any privacy concerns? Here is the paradox: the United States Constitution clearly allows law enforcement to obtain access to ‘places’ where criminals might hide evidence, so long as they possess a search warrant issued by a judge. But smartphones that are protected by encryption are currently beyond the reach of the so-called Fourth Amendment warrants. And so it happens that police can search a criminal's house and bank accounts, but not his or her mobile phone. You can argue that law enforcement is trying to make encryption the enemy, while there are many other tools they could access to build cases against the most serious offenders, like human traffickers. In other words: they should step up their game and change strategy. But then you can also argue that, at a time when international crime takes advantage of technology, those very same companies building the tools in question should find a way to ensure they do no harm. This debate is a compelling one. I have still not made up my mind. But as I continue to consider all sides of the story, I fear the clock is ticking fast. Although increasingly, traffickers are being brought out of the shadows, criminals do not face any lasting consequences for their actions. Meanwhile corporations and government have almost complete access to our lives, making it even more important to protect invasion into privacy.  When it comes to stopping slavery, unless both sides find a meaningful consensus, we are failing both the rule of law and human rights.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish iPhone 8 Display-Based Fingerprint Sensor Remains An Issue By Adnan Farooqui on 04/12/2017 15:03 PDT It has been rumored time and again that Apple is going to do away with the physical home button in the iPhone 8 that’s due later this year. This raises the question about where the company plans on putting the fingerprint sensor. Some reports suggest that the iPhone 8 is going to have an optical fingerprint sensor that’s going to be embedded in the display itself. We’re now hearing that this remains the “biggest bottleneck” that the company is yet to solve. Analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company sent a note to investors today which shares information he has obtained from his own supply chain field work that Apple is facing yield issues with its next flagship smartphone. “For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display,” he writes, adding that the current yield rate of Apple’s own AuthenTec solution is low and that the company is unwilling to use an under-glass fingerprint sensor made by a third-party. If it’s unable to resolve these issues, the company might pull a Samsung and relocate the fingerprint sensor to the back of the device. Or it might announce the handset in the fall as previously planned but delay production so that it has additional time to sort out the issues before it puts out the product that it really wants. Whether or not that’s going to happen remains to be seen. Apple hasn’t confirmed anything about the next iPhone so far and it’s unlikely that the company will say anything about it before the actual announcement. Filed in Apple >Cellphones.

The Galaxy S8 is equipped with Qualcomm’s latest processor, the Snapdragon 835 (4GB Ram), while the iPhone 7 comes with Apple’s A10 processor (3GB Ram). Read: iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple Reportedly Having Trouble Embedding Touch ID Into Device's Display In the video, uploaded by EverythingApplePro, the user compared the speed of both phones by opening applications that people use all the time, such as Snapchat, Instagram and Maps. The iPhone 7 loaded faster when opening and closing apps, even checking for posts to load on Instagram. The iPhone 7 also loaded games, such as Minecraft and Super Mario Run, faster that the Galaxy S8. The S8 trailed one game behind the iPhone.  Web browsing was also shown to be faster with the iPhone 7. Read: Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs. iPhone 7: Which Has Better Battery Life? When uploading a four-minute video to YouTube, the iPhone 7 took half the time the S8 took to render the clip. It also took a lot for the S8 to export the video because it closed all the apps in the background, whereas on the iPhone all the apps were already loaded and just needed a bit to refresh. The user then turned the devices off and when powering up, the iPhone 7 started off faster than the S8, however some apps opened up faster with the S8. Here’s the full speed test video: Samsung revealed the Galaxy S8 and S8+ this spring, while the iPhone 7 was released last fall. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 8, iPhone 7S and 7S Plus this September.  Related Stories Apple Reportedly Developing Its Own Power Management Chips For Its 2019 iPhone Lineup Samsung Galaxy Note 8 vs. Note 7 Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Throughout the construction process, we’ve seen a variety of looks at the construction process, mostly via overhead drone footage. Now, we’re getting a different look at Apple’s new campus courtesy of Alex Westerlund, who designed the entire Apple Park campus in Minecraft… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case While we saw preliminary takes on this idea earlier this year, Westerlund’s newest video of the project shows the entire campus in its completed state. He explains that the project took him a total of 413 hours of work, first starting as a hobby then turning into a full-time commitment. He also notes that it was a challenge because of the spaceship ring design, which was hard to recreate with the Minecraft cubes. Everything is also completely accurate based on construction plans and topographical maps of Cupertino. My humble tribute to Apple, I present Apple Park! After 413 hours of work starting in December 2015, here is the result. It started out as a simple project, something to do when I binged on Minecraft, but it slowly evolved into a full time project, with over 166 hours of work put in during the final month of the project. What drew me to this is my appreciation for end to end design and a crazy idea in my head that said ‘Hey let’s build the world’s curviest campus in a video game based on cubes.’ It’s a 1:1 full scale replica This is built entirely by hand (no mods) It’s terrain-accurate, based off topographical maps of Cupertino and the official landscaping plans Each hill, path, and orchard are true to the construction plans, down the the placement of each handcrafted cherry tree. All the general areas are fully furnished (so, the fitness center, atriums, cafes, maintenance building, Glendenning Barn, everywhere but the office space) There are 28 cafes spread throughout main building, plus 2 outdoor cafes, 1 (presumably healthy) cafe in the fitness center, and of course the main cafeteria. A megabuild is any Minecraft build utilizing at least one million blocks (people kept wondering). Throughout the video, you can see nearly every aspect of Apple’s new campus, including the fitness center, Steve Jobs Theater, atrium, cafeteria, solar power cells, and much more, all in Minecraft-form. Check out the full video tour of the Minecraft Apple Park below.

Nay? by Natt Garun@nattgarun Apr 12, 2017, 5:43pm EDT share tweet Linkedin Last week, Apple confirmed it was working on refreshing the Mac Pro — a device the company has largely neglected since its launch in 2013. Apple also said that the new Mac Pro won’t be ready this year, but that hasn’t stopped designers from imagining what the new professional computer from Cupertino would look like. Germany-based CURVED/labs has envisioned one such iteration of the Mac Pro, with a modular design and a pro display that comes alongside. The concept ditches the trash can aesthetic for an upright Mac Mini with a Touch Bar at the front. It also swivels to the sides to allow users to upgrade various components, such as a graphics card (two of ‘em, in fact), hard disks, solid state drives, and more. And yes, unlike an Apple mobile device, this one does come with a headphone jack. On the display side, CURVED/labs envisions a 27-inch cinema screen with a Retina display. USB accessories are connected at the back. It goes without saying that the final Apple design will likely be drastically different than this. (Take a look at the German company’s iMac concept, for example.) There are also no mentions of any kind of cooling component, but again, it’s a concept, so feel free to praise or pick it apart as much as you’d like while we’re in the dream phase.

By Kelly McSweeney for Robotics | April 12, 2017 -- 20:11 GMT (13:11 PDT) | Topic: Innovation It's a camera that hovers. (Get it?!) (Image: ZeroZero Robotics) Just in case selfie sticks weren't enough, flying robots are now equipped to take photos. Starting April 12, you can try one right inside an Apple store. Zero Zero Robots announced that its autonomous camera drone, the Hover Camera Passport, is now available exclusively on Apple.com and in Apple stores in several countries.

Can drones do it? Cheap 3D vision bringing robots into the real world "We're thrilled to bring autonomous flying photography into the hands of consumers who are excited by truly innovative technology that impact their everyday lives," said MQ Wang, founder and CEO of Zero Zero Robotics, in a statement. "By selling in Apple, we want more customers to capture their memories in a near-effortless way through breathtaking perspectives that can only be achieved through Hover Camera Passport." While other drones have been sold through the Apple store in the past, this is the first one that customers can fly right in the store. Demos will be conducted through an iPhone so that even people who have never flown a drone before can try taking selfies with the Passport. The Passport is a safe bet, since its propellers are completely enclosed and flight is managed by proprietary artificial intelligence. A specially trained Apple Genius will also assist with every demo. The Hover Camera Passport is now available exclusively on Apple.com and Apple stores in select countries. (Image: Zero Zero Robotics) The Passport package will be available in Apple stores across the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong, and the UK for USD $499. It includes the drone, two batteries, a charger, an adapter, and a bag. There are also some new updates to Passport's user interface and editing capabilities. Passport is now compatible with Apple Video and Final Cut Pro X. With an app, Passport can also use machine learning to instantly select and edit the best photos and videos. A companion app called "Owner Mode" allows gesture-enabled snaps and a variation of shot angles. (Image: ZeroZero Robotics) "These critical updates that make Hover Camera Passport even easier to use, will guide users to a truly out-of-the-box flying robot through Hover Camera Passport," said Wang. "Our team has been working hard to continue to give consumers the most user-friendly experience with a flying camera."

It has sued numerous companies in the past for using its product names, such as the iPhone and the App Store. Now, Swiss watchmaker Swatch is facing such a situation and interestingly, it isn't the first time for the company. According to a report from Swiss website Watson, Swatch began using 'Tick Different' as a slogan on its newest Bellamy watches. It does indeed seem like the company drew inspiration from Apple's 'Think Different' slogan as it also registered the trademark in California. The company has now successfully managed to draw the wrath of the Cupertino giant, which has hired a top law firm from Zurich to deal with the matter. Apple is said to have filed a complaint with the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, which was refused by the organization. The company is now expected to take its case before the federal court. This isn't first time that Apple has locked horns with Swatch, as the Swiss company pulled off a similar stunt with iSwatch and had also attempted to trademark Steve Jobs' famous "One more thing" phrase. It remains to be seen whether the courts accept the legitimacy of the lawsuit or toss it out, but there is no denying that Swatch will get a bit of attention while this lasts.

Suppliers Should Be Paranoid Right Now Being an Apple supplier has always been a double-edged sword. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 12, 2017 at 4:41PM After Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) bombshell decision to drop Imagination Technologies, an announcement that utterly decimated shares of the British company, Apple's suppliers should all be re-evaluating their relationship with the Mac maker right now and assessing what kinds of risks they face. Imagination's situation was exacerbated by the fact that it derived fully half of all its revenue from Apple, so the loss of that business will wreak financial havoc on Imagination as Apple shifts to in-sourcing its graphics architecture development over the next two years. Apple's Mac GPU suppliers should also be concerned in theory, but any threat they face would be many years away, if at all. In the near term, Apple has quite a few semiconductor suppliers on the mobile side that run the risk of getting ditched next. IGNMF data by YCharts. Who's next? Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) has a reasonably high chance of getting cut next, according to Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh (via Tech Trader Daily). Synaptics, which specializes mostly in touch-screen microcontrollers but has recently been diversifying into biometrics and display drivers, had a relationship with Apple back in the iPod days (think of the iconic clickwheel), but that relationship came to an end long ago. The company bought its way back into Apple's supply chain with the $475 million acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers in 2014 (Apple had reportedly considered acquiring Renesas at the time). The analyst warns that the display driver chip that Synaptics currently supplies to Apple could be worth bringing in-house. In-sourcing display driver chips would give Apple more control over power and performance while also reducing dependence on Samsung for OLED displays. Apple has hired former Renesas engineers, so it's quite possible that Apple is already working on an internally developed version. Vinh considers the risk of Apple pursuing this route as "moderate to high." Also named as another possible at-risk supplier is Dialog Semiconductor.  Image source: Apple. In terms of quantifying this risk, Synaptics has five unnamed customers that represented 10% or more of revenue last quarter, ranging from 10% to 21%, according to its most recent 10-Q. The worst-case scenario would be that Apple is that 21% customer and plans on dropping Synaptics soon, but Synaptics has a larger relationship with Samsung, so the 21% customer is probably the South Korean company. Regardless, the exposure is nowhere near the dangerously high 50% exposure that Imagination had. Vinh assigns a "low to medium" risk that Apple drops audio codec supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), which has ridden Apple's coattails for years. In-sourcing the audio codec would be quite feasible from a technical perspective, but the analyst does not believe that Apple would realize much in the way of benefits by doing so, either in costs or performance. Cirrus Logic also invests heavily in research and development, roughly $200 million per year, and it would be extremely expensive for Apple to in-source to a level that could yield differentiated features. That being said, the risk is still rather large, as Apple represented a whopping 85% of revenue last quarter, according to Cirrus' most recent 10-Q. The broader trend is that Apple's chip ambitions seem to have no bounds, particularly for anything it deems a "fundamental" technology. Apple will always have a broad supplier base, but wherever it sees strategic value (differentiation, costs, roadmap control, etc.) in in-sourcing, investors should expect Apple to slowly but surely cut out suppliers whenever it can.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Could Apple's Latest Figurative Trademark Filing Relate to their New Apple Music TV Streaming Service? | Main | Secret Apple Team Closing in on Diabetes Testing Breakthrough using an Apple Watch » April 12, 2017 Apple Files Apple Music Trademark Update to Cover Promotional Items like Caps, Lingerie, Masquerade Costumes, Wristbands & more   Apple has filed an update relating to their Figurative Apple Music trademarked logo in both Hong Kong and London. Apple has added International Class 25 to cover promotional items carrying their trademark such as clothing like caps and jackets along with jogging suits, headgear, Halloween costumes and more. Perhaps some of these items will be giveaways to fans of on Beats 1 and so forth – but look for Apple to sell these costly items in Apple Stores in the future.   Apple's Euro Trademark Application In-Part for Apple Music   Apple filed their update under International Class 25 with the following specific verbiage:   "Clothing; footwear; headgear; shirts, t-shirts, sweatshirts, jogging suits, trousers, pants, shorts, tank tops, rainwear, cloth bibs, skirts, blouses; dresses, suspenders, sweaters, jackets, coats, snow suits, ties, robes, hats, and caps, sun-visors, belts, wristbands, scarves, sleepwear, pajamas, lingerie, underwear, boots, shoes, sneakers, sandals, booties, slipper socks, swimwear; waterproof clothes; raincoats; masquerade and Halloween costumes."   Apple's inclusion of "Waterproof Clothes" is both odd and interesting considering that they filed for a patent covering water resistant fabrics.   Apple's application number in Hong Kong China is 304104521. The filing was first made in Jamaica in late 2016.   Update: As a side note, MacRumors posted a report at 4:42 p.m. PDT today showing Apple T-Shirts with "Close the Rings Challenge 1.0" as noted below. You have to wonder if this was the inspiration to file for the updated trademark. Of course the Apple event was about fitness and the trademark is about Apple Music, but once Apple created the T-Shirts they probably knew that they wanted to promote Apple Music this way in the future which required their trademark to legally cover promotional items.     About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News What Apple vs Qualcomm could mean for the iPhone’s future What Apple vs Qualcomm could mean for the iPhone’s future By Lewis Leong Mobile phones   Dueling lawsuits and a question of performance Shares Apple dropped a bombshell in January by suing Qualcomm, one of its biggest hardware partners, for $1 billion. Qualcomm is the chipmaker responsible for the vast majority of mobile processors, such as the Snapdragon silicon found in most Android phones, as well as chips that connect to cellular networks, used in Apple’s iPhones.  Fast forward to this week, and Qualcomm fired back at Apple with a 134-page countersuit of its own, allegedly the tech giant crippled the performance of its cellular chips in order to protect Apple’s other cellular chip supplier, Intel.  If you’re confused by all the back and forth, let’s break down why Apple and Qualcomm are suing each other in the first place and what this could mean for the future of the iPhone. Why is Apple suing one of its biggest chip suppliers? Apple’s lawsuit [ PDF] against Qualcomm stems from the latter’s patent fees. Apple claims Qualcomm is overcharging it by inflating patent prices. In a statement provided to CNBC, Apple claims Qualcomm charges “at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.”  Apple goes on to say, “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with. The more Apple innovates with unique features such as Touch ID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations.”  Qualcomm charges Apple licensing fees which are calculated as a percentage of the total cost of iPhones, according to Fortune, which amounts to about $15 per phone. Apple claims this is monopolistic as well as unfair to other chipmakers as Qualcomm’s licensing costs piggyback off the cost of the iPhone as a whole.  Furthermore, Qualcomm levies a licensing fee on Apple regardless if its chips are used in a phone. This means Apple pays Qualcomm once to license its patents and pays again to purchase Qualcomm’s silicon. For comparison, most component suppliers bundle their intellectual property license fee with the sale of their chips.  Apple isn’t the only one upset with Qualcomm. The San Diego-based company has come under fire in recent years for monopolistic practices. Just two years ago, Qualcomm paid $975 million to China for anti-competitive practices. In December 2016, Qualcomm was hit with a $873 million fine in South Korea for the same thing. Then in January this year, Qualcomm was charged with anti-competitive practices in the US by the Federal Trade Commission. Why is Qualcomm suing Apple?  In its countersuit filed Monday [ PDF download], Qualcomm claims Apple deliberately slowed down its 4G LTE chips in the iPhone 7 to hide that Intel’s 4G LTE chips, which Apple also uses, performed far worse. The lawsuit also claims Apple encouraged “regulatory attacks” on Qualcomm’s business in different countries by “misrepresenting facts and making false statements.” Qualcomm didn’t specify a dollar amount in damages it’s seeking from Apple.  “Over the last 10 years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to consumers with its popular products and services,” Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “But Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies.” Certainly the most damning part of Qualcomm’s suit is its claims the iPhone maker deliberately slowed down Qualcomm chips to hide supposed inferior performance of chips made by Intel, which Apple also uses in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. This allegation is supported  by data unearthed by researchers at Twin Prime Inc., a mobile app optimization company, and Cellular Insights, an independent organization that tests radio performance of consumer devices.  Speaking to Bloomberg in November 2016, Twin Prime’s head of product Gabriel Tavridis said, “The data indicates that the iPhone 7 is not taking advantage of all of Verizon’s network capabilities. I doubt that Apple is throttling each bit on the Verizon iPhone, but it could have chosen to not enable certain features of the network chip.”  Although no official reason was provided, the researchers speculated that Apple throttled CDMA Qualcomm chips found in Verizon and Sprint phones to match the slower performing Intel chips found in GSM iPhones (AT&T and T-Mobile) to create the illusion of equality among its phones.  This way, every iPhone 7 would perform the same across networks, even though iPhones sporting Qualcomm’s 4G LTE chips could perform better. For reference, Qualcomm’s X12 modem in the iPhone 7 is capable of downloading data at 600 Mbps, compared to the 450 Mbps of Intel’s modems.  This isn’t the first time Apple has used chips with differing performance. When the iPhone 6S came out in 2015, reviewers initially noticed some battery life differences between the iPhone 6S phones with TSMC-made chips and those with chips from Samsung. However, a later Consumer Reports test showed negligible performance differences between the chips. We’ve asked Apple and Qualcomm for comment on the lawsuits, and we’ll update this story if we hear back. What does all this mean for the iPhone?  Although we may not see the outcome of the Apple vs Qualcomm battle for some time, we can speculate what all this might mean for Apple and its iconic smartphone from here on out.  If Apple is successful in suing Qualcomm for monopolistic practices, we could potentially see cheaper iPhones since Apple doesn’t have to pay Qualcomm as much per device.  However, Apple also has to answer if it deliberately slowed down 4G performance in its Qualcomm-equipped iPhones in order to create performance parity across handsets. If this is true and in breach of contract with Qualcomm, Apple may have to pay a hefty fine.  In either case, it’s clear Apple and Qualcomm’s relationship won’t be the same moving forward. Apple may look for other chipmakers that can provide better value to help the company lower the price of its iPhones amidst tough competition from cheaper Android phones. Apple is already using Intel, but may seek out other chipmakers to prevent an over reliance on one manufacturer. With the iPhone 8 release around the corner, Apple may ditch Qualcomm’s LTE chips altogether for Intel’s new XMM 7650 chips, according to an AppleInsider report. The Intel chip is capable of up to 1 Gbps download speeds and up to 225 Mbps uploads, marking a 45% performance increase from the modems in the iPhone 7. The iPhone’s silicon future, it seems, is already starting to change. iPhone 8: all the latest news and rumors Related news 10 best gaming mice: best gaming mouse to buy Google Home now makes sure you never miss a flight Project Scorpio dev kit is so powerful, we wish it was the real thing Download of the day: AndreaMosaic See more Mobile phones news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Most of these apps are optimized for the bigger screens of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, Phone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus — but they will work fine on smaller screens like the iPhone SE or iPhone 4s too.

The Best iPhone Apps Here are the iPhone apps that I use the most. These are the iPhone apps that I keep on my home screen and the dock. Although this list doesn’t break down into nice categories, here is a look at the most useful iPhone apps I own. I’ll leave the default Apple apps off this list, but there are many on my home screen that I cannot live without. Google Maps – Hands down a better way to get from one place to the next or to search for places than Apple Maps. It has yet to tell me to drive off a non-existent bridge. I cannot say the same about Apple Maps. Huntington – Even with text notifications it is important for me to have access to my banking app on the home screen, and the ability to remotely deposit checks with the iPhone. SoundCloud – A great way to check out sets from music festivals and hard to find tracks from DJs and artists before they are on other services. Spotify – The best way to listen to music on the iPhone. Spotify is more evolved than Apple Music and it is a bargain at $9.99 a month. Audible – I listen to an incredible number of Audiobooks and Audible is the best place to buy them. With a subscription I save on audiobooks each month. Dark Sky – Great, hyper local forecasts and push notifications that tell me when it is going to rain or snow. Alien Blue – This is still the best iPhone Reddit app I’ve found, but I am looking for a replacement. Slack – If you work on a team or in a small office forget the hassles of email for internal communication and switch to Slack. You’ll love it. Asana – This is a to do list app and service that works great for teams, but you can also use it for your own tasks and projects. MyFitnessPal – MyFitnessPal is one of the best weight loss iPhone apps and it was the key to helping me lose 25 pounds this year. After a break I am back in the app to keep the weight off. Nest – The Nest app connects to my Nest thermostat to let me control the temperature of my house from bed or from a hundred miles away. This saves me energy and it’s an awesome convenience app. Harmony – I use the Harmony app along with the Logitech Harmony Ultimate Home remote and hub to control my home entertainment and lights. I can tap on Play Xbox One and the Tv, Xbox, soundbar and lights all turn to the right settings. I can also control my TV volume and channels with the iPhone. Hue – I control and customize five Hue lights with this app. I will be upgrading soon to use Siri to control the lights. Lutron Caséta – The Lutron Caséta app lets me use Siri and the app to turn lamps on and off at home using the Caséta Wireless switches and to control my Kitchen Lights after I replaced the switches. No need to upgrade bulbs for a smart home experience. MyQ – This app lets me open and close my Chamberlain WiFi garage door with my iPhone. I get push notifications, although on iOS 9 they sometimes double up, to let me know someone opened the door. HDE OTP – I use this app instead of Google Authenticator to track the many One Time Passwords I need to use as Two-Factor Authentication for several websites. Hangouts – Google Hangouts is an essential tool for communicating with friends, co-workers and family. LastPass – I only need to remember one password and I can use my long list of complicated passwords. Touch ID allows me to reach them with the touch of a finger instead of typing my password out. Read my LastPass review. Tweetbot 4 – The newest version of Tweetbot is an amazing way to connect to Twitter. It handles all my needs for sending messages and the new Activity tab removes the need for me to use the default Twitter app to track follows and retweets. Gmail – The Gmail app is a great way for most users to check email on the iPhone and an essential app for many people on our team. Notion – Notion.ai is the best iPhone email app you can find. It delivers smart notifications, easy inbox management and even knows when someone asks you a question. You need to try this app out today. These three apps earn an honorable mention on my home screen list since I keep them with easy access on my second home screen so that I can always access them. Evernote – The new Notes app is my go to app, but Evernote still offers a great place to save and track notes. I used this to track all communication about lost luggage and to share the notebook with interested parties easily. Workflow – Workflow lets you automate activities and tasks on the iPhone 6s, and it supports 3D Touch quick actions to your favorites. I am just scratching the surface of what it can do and I am amazed. Kindle – The Kindle app is my go to app for reading. I love it because I can use it to start a book, read more later on my Kindle and also always have the freedom to jump to another platform. 1Password – If you aren’t a fan of LastPass, 1Password is an excellent option that helps you keep all of your passwords safe behind, you guessed it one password. Calm – When you need a break from your hectic life, the Calm app will help you relax and refresh using your iPhone, headphones and a chair. Ring – You’ll need the Ring doorbell to make use of this app, but once you install it you can see and talk to people who ring your doorbell, even if you are miles away. Best iPhone Photography Apps I use these iPhone photography apps to make my photos look better, connect to my camera and share photos and videos. I use iCloud Photo Library to back up my photos, but if you don’t you should check out Flickr or Google Photos. YouTube Capture – – Record videos quickly and upload to YouTube in a snap. Perfect for content creators. Camera+ – A handy app that can perform magical automatic fixes for photos that need better lighting with one touch. Instagram – Fun place to explore photos and share photos. 3D Touch makes browsing in the Explore mode easier than ever. PlayMemories Mobile – I use this app to connect to my Sony RX 100 III and transfer photos to the iPhone for editing and sharing. Pixelmator – My favorite desktop photo editor is now on iPhone allowing me to quickly fix up and edit photos. iMovie – I often shoot review videos on the iPhone 6s and I can use iMovie to edit the 4K video I shoot and then choose to upload in 4K or in 1080P. TouchReTouch – This app performs miracles when you need to restore an old photo that has cracks, creases and damage. Simply amazing. Darkroom – This is another photo editing app that I enjoy using on the iPhone 6s. One thing I like is that there are sliders on one screen to adjust multiple options so I can easily adjust one and then the next. Afterlight – Powerful photo editing tool with filters, lots of control and the option to tap to see the original and let go to see your current edits for easy before and after editing. Layout – A simple tool from Instagram to combine photos into a collage on the iPhone to share on Instagram or another service. Best iPhone Games Here are the best iPhone games that I enjoy playing. There are a lot of great iPhone games out there and we expect to see more games add 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s in the coming weeks and months. Monument Valley – A fun and challenging puzzle style game that tasks gamers with moving the environment around until you can get your character to the right door. Threes! – Slide tiles around to match up numbers. Starts off simple, but gets challenging quickly as your numbers climb higher. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. Siegefall – A strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, but with a less cartoonish look. This is my favorite of the tow games and worth trying out. Clash of Clans – We can’t list off the best apps without touching on Clash of Clans which many iPhone users are addicted to playing. If you like it, you probably love it. Shadowmatic – My latest addiction is a puzzle type game where you move objects around to create a shadow on the wall. It is a simple premise, but the difficulty increases as you progress. Does Not Commute – Guide cars around the city to get them to the destination without crossing and crashing with the traffic you already put into place with earlier cars. Madden Mobile – A small fix of Madden on the iPhone. It isn’t as good as Madden 16 on the Xbox One, but it is a fun way to pass some time. Smashy Road: Wanted – A fun time waster for driving around and escaping the police with simple graphics. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for the iPhone screen size. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Super Sharp – This fun puzzle game is challenging, incredibly fun and frustrating. You cut parts of the level to hit targets and often need to set up several cuts to proceed. Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Here are the go to apps I use to watch video on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. I don’t keep as many on here as I do on the iPad Air 2, but there are must have apps in this list. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on my iPhone using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. WatchESPN – Finally I can use DirecTV to login to WatchESPN to see sports events and Sports Center on the go. NFL Mobile – With my Verizon iPhone 6s I can watch the Sunday Night, Monday Night and Thursday Night Football games live on the iPhone. Remote – The fastest way to control the Apple TV from the iPhone. Makes selection, searching and entering passwords very easy. Netflix – How else can I keep up on Narcos and binge watch too many TV shows on my iPhone for $8 a month? ESPN – I use this app to track teams, which lately simply lets me see how the Miami Dolphins are losing before my coworkers mention it. NFL Sunday Ticket – I am constantly busy on Sunday, no matter how I plan it, so I rely on NFL Sunday Ticket to watch the Miami Dolphins on my iPhone 6s. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Hulu – If you don’t want to pay for cable, this is one of the easiest ways to keep up on the latest shows without buying a bunch of season passes in iTunes. HBO Go – Watch HBO on your iPhone using your cable login, or use HBO Now to watch with a subscription direct to HBO. Access new shows and the full library of HBO Shows, plus current movies. YouTube – The YouTube app is the fastest way to watch YouTube videos on your iPhone and a great way to subscribe to channels you like. Amazon Instant Video – Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on the iPhone including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Business iPhone Apps I use these apps to keep on top of business needs from my iPhone, from tracking packages, checking invoices paid and other utilities. These iPhone apps help me get things done. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. Speedtest – I often find myself testing the network connection and mobile connection before working or uploading a big file. With this app I can see if my current location supports what I need to do. Scanner Pro – Scanner Pro lets me quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. PayPal – Quickly send money, transfer money and make payments without the need to have cash on hand. Chrome – I don’t use Chrome as my main iPhone browser, but it is handy to have installed for use with the various Google apps I rely on and for checking the open tabs from Chrome on my Mac. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. It does eat through battery life fast and it can crash, but it allows me to get work done with just an iPhone. Google – This is essentially the Google Now experience on the iPhone. It allows me to see important information and I use it for push notifications when orders I place ship and I get an email about it. Quicklytics – The best Google Analytics app for the iPhone. Real time view, overall stats, and access to filters that let me run more detailed reports from the iPhone. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. I can then share an expense report in a few minutes from the web after the trip. Quickbooks – Although QuickBooks can be a pain to use in some instances, the app is a fast way to look at the most important information relating to my account. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. I use the Parkmobile app to pay for parking in many locations. I can even re-up parking without going back to my car if I am held over in a meeting. Sheets – My most used web app is Google Sheets. I use this app to reach important spreadsheets on the go. I don’t do a ton of work on them while mobile, but this makes it easier to reference. Pages – There are still times where I need to open a Pages document on my iPhone and I also use this to check the word count of items written in apps that don’t offer a word count tool. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Paper by fifty three – This is a go to app for sketching and marking up images. It is easier to use on a bigger screen, but it is still handy to have on the iPhone 6s. Best iPhone Shopping Apps I use these iPhone shopping apps to save money on groceries and to simplify shopping from my iPhone for almost anything I need. I leave alerts on for GasBuddy since it will tell me if gas prices are going up in my area, but most of the other apps don’t get permission to push notifications. Amazon – The fastest way to order from Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime this is a must have app. Meijer – I use this app to clip coupons digitally that I use in the store to save significantly. If you use another grocer, like Kroger, check out this guide to digital grocery coupons. Square Register – When my wife works a craft show we use this app to accept credit cards from our phone. It works like a charm. Apple Store – The fastest place to order a new iPhone is also a handy place to look for iPhone 6s accessories and other Apple items. Best Buy – As a My Best Buy member I use this app to make purchases and to check my points balance as well as see if the local store has something I want in stock. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the new mobile ordering option the Starbucks app isn’t just a great way to pay from Wallet. You can use this to place an order and skip the line at a busy Starbucks. Chipotle – An easy way to order from Chipotle so you can skip the line and get that Burrito goodness. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Credit Karma – Use Credit Karma to get a free look at your credit score and you can get alerts when actions that impact your credit happen. Hobby Lobby – If you shop at Hobby Lobby you need to have this app installed so you can save 40% on one item each week. Best Health Apps RunKeeper – I’ve shifted a lot of my workouts to the Apple Watch’s built-in tracker, but when I want more detail, the Runkeeper app is a solid tool that can help you track your fitness goals. Fitnet – I just started testing Fitnet. The free iPhone app offers up short focused workouts based on your goals and includes an Apple Watch app and an Apple Watch complication that shows your progress. Activity – This app installs automatically once you connect an Apple Watch. It is an easy way to see how often I hit movement and workout goals. It can motivate or shame me into doing a better job. Sleep Cycle – This app uses your iPhone to monitor your sleep and then it will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep patterns. Best iPhone Apps for Social Media Facebook – I honestly go back and forth between uninstalling and installing the Facebook app because there are times I don’t want the distraction of Facebook in my hand. I always leave notifications off. Facebook Messenger – This app is the way that I keep in touch with many friends, and it is a must have on the iPhone 6s. Snapchat – I don’t snap a lot, but I enjoy using the fun new Snapchat Lenses to change the look with fun augmented reality filters. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. Best iPhone Travel Apps StubHub – When you need to find tickets for a concert or sporting event that is sold out, StubHub offers a trusted environment to find the tickets you want. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation. Flightaware – Always know where a flight is. This is the best way to track the flights that your loved ones or business associates are on. Hotel Tonight – Score last-minute reservations at amazing hotels at a bargain. You can book for tonight or up to seven days out. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. TripAdvisor – This is the fastest and easiest way to find things to do and check reviews of hotels and attractions on your iPhone. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze is a tool i use when traffic is an issue. It helped us avoid a huge traffic jam and get to an event with minutes to spare instead of waiting in traffic and missing out on an amazing experience. Yelp – Yelp is my go to tool for finding a new place to eat in a new city. We also use it to discover new stores when in a bigger city and on the hunt for something local. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. 12 Responses 02/24/2016 Brittanylcarlson Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

Workflow – Workflow lets you automate activities and tasks on the iPhone 6s, and it supports 3D Touch quick actions to your favorites. I am just scratching the surface of what it can do and I am amazed. Kindle – The Kindle app is my go to app for reading. I love it because I can use it to start a book, read more later on my Kindle and also always have the freedom to jump to another platform. 1Password – If you aren’t a fan of LastPass, 1Password is an excellent option that helps you keep all of your passwords safe behind, you guessed it one password. Calm – When you need a break from your hectic life, the Calm app will help you relax and refresh using your iPhone, headphones and a chair. Ring – You’ll need the Ring doorbell to make use of this app, but once you install it you can see and talk to people who ring your doorbell, even if you are miles away. Best iPhone Photography Apps I use these iPhone photography apps to make my photos look better, connect to my camera and share photos and videos. I use iCloud Photo Library to back up my photos, but if you don’t you should check out Flickr or Google Photos. YouTube Capture – – Record videos quickly and upload to YouTube in a snap. Perfect for content creators. Camera+ – A handy app that can perform magical automatic fixes for photos that need better lighting with one touch. Instagram – Fun place to explore photos and share photos. 3D Touch makes browsing in the Explore mode easier than ever. PlayMemories Mobile – I use this app to connect to my Sony RX 100 III and transfer photos to the iPhone for editing and sharing. Pixelmator – My favorite desktop photo editor is now on iPhone allowing me to quickly fix up and edit photos. iMovie – I often shoot review videos on the iPhone 6s and I can use iMovie to edit the 4K video I shoot and then choose to upload in 4K or in 1080P. TouchReTouch – This app performs miracles when you need to restore an old photo that has cracks, creases and damage. Simply amazing. Darkroom – This is another photo editing app that I enjoy using on the iPhone 6s. One thing I like is that there are sliders on one screen to adjust multiple options so I can easily adjust one and then the next. Afterlight – Powerful photo editing tool with filters, lots of control and the option to tap to see the original and let go to see your current edits for easy before and after editing. Layout – A simple tool from Instagram to combine photos into a collage on the iPhone to share on Instagram or another service. Best iPhone Games Here are the best iPhone games that I enjoy playing. There are a lot of great iPhone games out there and we expect to see more games add 3D Touch for the iPhone 6s in the coming weeks and months. Monument Valley – A fun and challenging puzzle style game that tasks gamers with moving the environment around until you can get your character to the right door. Threes! – Slide tiles around to match up numbers. Starts off simple, but gets challenging quickly as your numbers climb higher. Alto’s Adventure – Jump and ski your way to the bottom of a never-ending mountain as you collect llamas, run from village elders and collect power ups. Agar.io – Control growing circle that expands as it absorbs smaller circles until you are the biggest blob on the board. Simple, but addicting. Siegefall – A strategy game similar to Clash of Clans, but with a less cartoonish look. This is my favorite of the tow games and worth trying out. Clash of Clans – We can’t list off the best apps without touching on Clash of Clans which many iPhone users are addicted to playing. If you like it, you probably love it. Shadowmatic – My latest addiction is a puzzle type game where you move objects around to create a shadow on the wall. It is a simple premise, but the difficulty increases as you progress. Does Not Commute – Guide cars around the city to get them to the destination without crossing and crashing with the traffic you already put into place with earlier cars. Madden Mobile – A small fix of Madden on the iPhone. It isn’t as good as Madden 16 on the Xbox One, but it is a fun way to pass some time. Smashy Road: Wanted – A fun time waster for driving around and escaping the police with simple graphics. Fallout Shelter – Manage resources and grow your shelter in this Fallout game that is a perfect fit for the iPhone screen size. Fun and frustrating at the same time as you balance inhabitants and resources. Super Sharp – This fun puzzle game is challenging, incredibly fun and frustrating. You cut parts of the level to hit targets and often need to set up several cuts to proceed. Best iPhone Entertainment Apps Here are the go to apps I use to watch video on the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. I don’t keep as many on here as I do on the iPad Air 2, but there are must have apps in this list. DirecTV – I can watch live TV on my iPhone using my DirecTV subscription. I don’t get all of my channels, but there are enough great options. WatchESPN – Finally I can use DirecTV to login to WatchESPN to see sports events and Sports Center on the go. NFL Mobile – With my Verizon iPhone 6s I can watch the Sunday Night, Monday Night and Thursday Night Football games live on the iPhone. Remote – The fastest way to control the Apple TV from the iPhone. Makes selection, searching and entering passwords very easy. Netflix – How else can I keep up on Narcos and binge watch too many TV shows on my iPhone for $8 a month? ESPN – I use this app to track teams, which lately simply lets me see how the Miami Dolphins are losing before my coworkers mention it. NFL Sunday Ticket – I am constantly busy on Sunday, no matter how I plan it, so I rely on NFL Sunday Ticket to watch the Miami Dolphins on my iPhone 6s. Xbox One SmartGlass – With this app I can connect to my Xbox to change the game I am playing, enter in text and see and respond to messages without leaving a game. Yahoo Fantasy  – You can use this app to track almost any thing you need to stay on top of your fantasy sports team. Hulu – If you don’t want to pay for cable, this is one of the easiest ways to keep up on the latest shows without buying a bunch of season passes in iTunes. HBO Go – Watch HBO on your iPhone using your cable login, or use HBO Now to watch with a subscription direct to HBO. Access new shows and the full library of HBO Shows, plus current movies. YouTube – The YouTube app is the fastest way to watch YouTube videos on your iPhone and a great way to subscribe to channels you like. Amazon Instant Video – Amazon Prime members can use this to watch free streaming video on the iPhone including movies and TV shows without an additional subscription. Best Business iPhone Apps I use these apps to keep on top of business needs from my iPhone, from tracking packages, checking invoices paid and other utilities. These iPhone apps help me get things done. UPS – With UPS My Choice and this app I can see when packages will come and even change delivery options if I need to. Fedex – With this app and registration with FedEx I can see all FedEx packages coming to my house from Ground and Express in one place. Even when I don’t have a tracking number. Speedtest – I often find myself testing the network connection and mobile connection before working or uploading a big file. With this app I can see if my current location supports what I need to do. Scanner Pro – Scanner Pro lets me quickly scan in a document without a scanner. The results are amazing and you would swear that it came from a full size scanner in an office. PayPal – Quickly send money, transfer money and make payments without the need to have cash on hand. Chrome – I don’t use Chrome as my main iPhone browser, but it is handy to have installed for use with the various Google apps I rely on and for checking the open tabs from Chrome on my Mac. Facebook Pages – I use this app to manage several Facebook pages. There is no real alternative, but it is still one of my must have apps. WordPress – If you work in WordPress this app can be a lifesaver when mobile. It does eat through battery life fast and it can crash, but it allows me to get work done with just an iPhone. Google – This is essentially the Google Now experience on the iPhone. It allows me to see important information and I use it for push notifications when orders I place ship and I get an email about it. Quicklytics – The best Google Analytics app for the iPhone. Real time view, overall stats, and access to filters that let me run more detailed reports from the iPhone. Expensify – An easy to use expensing app that captures receipts and cash transactions easily. I can then share an expense report in a few minutes from the web after the trip. Quickbooks – Although QuickBooks can be a pain to use in some instances, the app is a fast way to look at the most important information relating to my account. Parkmobile – No change, no problem. I use the Parkmobile app to pay for parking in many locations. I can even re-up parking without going back to my car if I am held over in a meeting. Sheets – My most used web app is Google Sheets. I use this app to reach important spreadsheets on the go. I don’t do a ton of work on them while mobile, but this makes it easier to reference. Pages – There are still times where I need to open a Pages document on my iPhone and I also use this to check the word count of items written in apps that don’t offer a word count tool. Dropbox – Still the most accessible and easy to use cloud storage client I’ve found. This is an easy way to get to my files and to upload files for access from anywhere. Paper by fifty three – This is a go to app for sketching and marking up images. It is easier to use on a bigger screen, but it is still handy to have on the iPhone 6s. Best iPhone Shopping Apps I use these iPhone shopping apps to save money on groceries and to simplify shopping from my iPhone for almost anything I need. I leave alerts on for GasBuddy since it will tell me if gas prices are going up in my area, but most of the other apps don’t get permission to push notifications. Amazon – The fastest way to order from Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime this is a must have app. Meijer – I use this app to clip coupons digitally that I use in the store to save significantly. If you use another grocer, like Kroger, check out this guide to digital grocery coupons. Square Register – When my wife works a craft show we use this app to accept credit cards from our phone. It works like a charm. Apple Store – The fastest place to order a new iPhone is also a handy place to look for iPhone 6s accessories and other Apple items. Best Buy – As a My Best Buy member I use this app to make purchases and to check my points balance as well as see if the local store has something I want in stock. Gas Buddy – Find the cheapest gas near you and get an alert when gas prices are set to go up so that you can fill up before the price changes. Starbucks – With the new mobile ordering option the Starbucks app isn’t just a great way to pay from Wallet. You can use this to place an order and skip the line at a busy Starbucks. Chipotle – An easy way to order from Chipotle so you can skip the line and get that Burrito goodness. OpenTable – This is the fastest way to get a reservation at a restaurant. Forget calling and checking multiple times over the phone and checking with your group. See what is open and then book it without making a call. Credit Karma – Use Credit Karma to get a free look at your credit score and you can get alerts when actions that impact your credit happen. Hobby Lobby – If you shop at Hobby Lobby you need to have this app installed so you can save 40% on one item each week. Best Health Apps RunKeeper – I’ve shifted a lot of my workouts to the Apple Watch’s built-in tracker, but when I want more detail, the Runkeeper app is a solid tool that can help you track your fitness goals. Fitnet – I just started testing Fitnet. The free iPhone app offers up short focused workouts based on your goals and includes an Apple Watch app and an Apple Watch complication that shows your progress. Activity – This app installs automatically once you connect an Apple Watch. It is an easy way to see how often I hit movement and workout goals. It can motivate or shame me into doing a better job. Sleep Cycle – This app uses your iPhone to monitor your sleep and then it will wake you up at the best time based on your sleep patterns. Best iPhone Apps for Social Media Facebook – I honestly go back and forth between uninstalling and installing the Facebook app because there are times I don’t want the distraction of Facebook in my hand. I always leave notifications off. Facebook Messenger – This app is the way that I keep in touch with many friends, and it is a must have on the iPhone 6s. Snapchat – I don’t snap a lot, but I enjoy using the fun new Snapchat Lenses to change the look with fun augmented reality filters. Untappd – This is a social network for beer lovers that can help you find new beers to try and enjoy. Best iPhone Travel Apps StubHub – When you need to find tickets for a concert or sporting event that is sold out, StubHub offers a trusted environment to find the tickets you want. TripIt – The best all in one travel organizer that tracks your hotel, flight, car rental and other activities simply by connecting your email to the app or forwarding a reservation.

Hotel Tonight – Score last-minute reservations at amazing hotels at a bargain. You can book for tonight or up to seven days out. Grub Hub – An essential tool for ordering delivery from restaurants without making a phone call. Available in 800 cities and includes 30,000 restaurants. TripAdvisor – This is the fastest and easiest way to find things to do and check reviews of hotels and attractions on your iPhone. Waze – While I normally rely on Google Maps, Waze is a tool i use when traffic is an issue. It helped us avoid a huge traffic jam and get to an event with minutes to spare instead of waiting in traffic and missing out on an amazing experience. Yelp – Yelp is my go to tool for finding a new place to eat in a new city. We also use it to discover new stores when in a bigger city and on the hunt for something local. Glympse – This tool can help you tell people when you will get to a location. Just share a Glympse with them and they can see your current location and estimated time of arrival. 12 Responses 02/24/2016 Brittanylcarlson Reply 0=1my best friend’s half-sister makes $87 /hr on the laptop .

The news comes after rumors circulating last year suggesting the G6 would launch with an iris scanner and LG’s own mobile payment platform, LG Pay. LG was reportedly already making technology that merges the camera sensor and iris scanner. Read: Samsung Galaxy S8 vs. LG G6: Comparison Review Of Specs, Features And More LG has reportedly teamed up with facial recognition firm Oez and the software for the LG G6 could launch as early as June, when LG Pay takes off. Paying with facial recognition could boost LG above its smartphone rivals. LG Pay would compete with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. LG’s payment service would be different, since it would work with facial recognition, while Apple Pay works with Touch ID and Samsung Pay allows purchases with a pin or fingerprint ID. Read: Apple Vs. Samsung Pay: Apple Adds More Than 20 U.S. Banks To Apple Pay Meanwhile, Apple and Samsung are making their own moves towards face recognition. Samsung revealed its latest phones, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, with its own facial recognition technology for unlocking the devices. However, the technology looks like it can be easily be tricked. Recently, a YouTuber demonstrated that the facial recognition feature on the Galaxy S8 can easily be fooled by a full-screen selfie. On the other hand, previous rumors suggest Apple will release the iPhone 8 with a face recognition feature. An analyst’s note to investors in January said the 10th anniversary iPhone could include “some form of facial/gesture recognition supported by a new laser sensor and an infrared sensor mounted near the front-facing camera.” Related Stories The Better One Between Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 iPhone 8 And LG G6 Price And Specs Comparison Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Download: Beta 2 of iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, tvOS 10.2.1, watchOS 3.2.2 Released By Uzair Ghani Apr 10, 2017 8Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has opened up its floodgates and released beta 2 of iOS 10.3.1, macOS 10.12.5, tvOS 10.2.1 and watchOS 3.2.2. Apple Pushes Out Second Beta of its Pre-Release Software Lineup The Cupertino giant has kicked off its week by seeding brand new beta builds of its mobile software to developers who are currently enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. Luckily for those who are running beta software, you can grab the software over the air, meaning you are not required to be tethered to a Mac or PC for anything. Until or unless you are performing an installation from scratch for whatever reason. Related iOS 10.3.2 & macOS 10.12.5 Public Beta 2 Released – Download Today iOS 10.3.2 users can download beta 2 over the air by heading over to Settings > General > Software Update. Once the download shows up, simply tap on Download and Install to kick things off. Remember one thing though: your device must have more than 50% battery remaining and connected to WiFi for installation. If you don’t fulfill either of those requirement, the installation process won’t move forward. macOS 10.12.5, on the other hand, can be grabbed directly from the Mac App Store. Simply launch the app hub from Launchpad or the Dock, then click on the Updates tab at the top. Over here, just wait for the page to refresh and download the available update. Advertisement tvOS 10.2.1 beta 2 can be downloaded by navigating to Settings > System > Software Update on your Apple TV. Whereas watchOS 3.2.2 beta 2 is available via the Watch app on the iPhone, and then navigating to General > Software Update. Related Download: macOS 10.12.5 Sierra Public Beta Now Available Apple Watch users are strictly required to place their wearable on its magnetic charger otherwise the installation won’t happen at all. Furthermore, once you have downloaded and installed any watchOS beta onto your Apple Watch, you cannot downgrade back to the publicly available firmware version. Be very clear of this fact before going ahead with the installation of beta software on your device. All of the above mentioned software is available to download directly from Apple Developer Program website as well. The bits can only be accessed if you are a paying developer with Apple, otherwise things are a no-go. We will update our readers if Apple has packed something noteworthy in its software, so stay tuned.

Get ready for phone-free streaming. By Emily Bary April 12, 2017 2:48 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Soon you'll have one less reason to pay for Apple Music, and one more reason to buy an Apple Watch. Illustration: Getty Images Do you want the good news or the bad news first? One of the best features of the Apple Watch is the ability to listen to music on the go, without needing your smartphone nearby. Doing so, though, requires something most people still don’t have: a subscription to Apple Music. Get the best of Barron's Next every weekday.

Review our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy. Users of Spotify, which has more paid subscribers than Apple Music, have been left out of the Apple Watch magic. They still need phones to stream Spotify, even with a watch on their wrist. That’s about to change. A Spotify app for the Apple Watch is on its way, Apple Insider wrote Wednesday. A third-party developer, Andrew Chang, had been working on such an app on his own and chronicling his progress on Reddit. The app looked sleek and was well-reviewed. Then, earlier this year, Spotify appeared to get in the way. Now Chang is working with the company on a final product, for which a release date hasn’t been announced. Once it happens there will be one less reason to pay for Apple Music. The good news for Apple, is that convenient Spotify playback on the Apple Watch could make people more likely to get the watch. It’s awfully freeing to leave your heavy phone behind when you go on a run and just pop in a pair of AirPods -- another thing people might be increasingly likely to buy. And even if you’re carrying the iPhone, a Spotify app will make streaming more convenient. After all, who doesn’t want to change songs from their wrist? Big Picture: A new Spotify app on the Apple Watch will mean one less reason to pay for Apple Music -- but perhaps one more reason to buy an Apple Watch.

Created by Zero Zero Robotics, the Hover Passport is a lightweight drone made from a carbon fiber material, so it’s portable and easy to take with you everywhere you go. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In addition to being for sale on Apple.com and in retail stores, Apple is taking its partnership with Zero Zero Robotics a step further and offering in-store demos of the product. In 42 retail stores around the country, Apple is offering users the ability to try the Hover Passport before purchasing it. Once training has been completed, however, demos will come to every Apple Store. The Hover Passport comes in at just 242 grams and folds together for easy portability. Despite the small form factor, it’s relatively powerful as well. It can travel at speeds up to 17 miles per hour and features face and body tracking, allowing it to follow you around and capture photos and video. It features a 13MP camera with 4K video support. Additionally, the Hover Passport can capture 360 degree panoramic video. You get 10 minutes of hover time per charge. In the press release announcing the Apple retail availability, Zero Zero Robotics touts that the Passport seamlessly integrates with Apple’s Final Cut Pro and iMovie editing software, as well. Zero Zero Robotics says one of the biggest differentiating features of the Passport compared to other drones is how easy it is to fly. The company says that the Passport is powered by proprietary artificial intelligence, meaning there’s little to no learning curve: A category leader among consumer-grade autonomous flying cameras, Passport is breaking ground by offering customers an accessible self-flying camera, that powered by proprietary artificial intelligence, allows anyone to operate it out of the box in both indoor and outdoor environments. Everything you need for the Passport is available through the companion iOS app. This includes things like video editing, settings, and more. One of the highlight features of the app, however, is its automated media editing app. Together, the iOS app and Passport use machine learning to “instantly create bite-sized, moving clips of your moments by selecting and editing your best photos and videos to share with family and friends.” In Apple retail stores and online, you can purchase the Hover Camera Passport Apple-exclusive bundle for $499. In this bundle, you get the drone itself, two batteries, one charger, adapter and a carry bag. The Passport is available from Apple in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, and the U.K. Full press release below: HOVER CAMERA PASSPORT INTRODUCES NEW USER INTERFACE — NOW AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVELY ON APPLE.COM AND IN APPLE STORES San Francisco, CA, April 12, 2017 — Zero Zero Robotics, the forward-thinking robotics company pioneering the future of consumer-friendly, smart robotics, today announced that its flagship flying camera, Hover Camera Passport (Passport), is now available exclusively on Apple.com and in Apple stores in five countries and regions.

The revolutionary update rethinks the traditional flying camera user experience and is designed to guide and educate consumers, with no prior knowledge or experience with a flying camera, on how to operate Passport out of the box. • Automated Media Editing – Available via the Hover Camera App, Passport will use machine learning to instantly create bite-sized, moving clips of your moments by selecting and editing your best photos and videos to share with family and friends. “These critical updates that make Hover Camera Passport even easier to use, will guide users to a truly out-of-the-box flying robot through Hover Camera Passport,” said MQ Wang.  “Our team has been working hard to continue to give consumers the most user-friendly experience with a flying camera.” Hover Camera Passport is available on Apple.com and in Apple stores in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom starting today and will be available in additional countries and regions next month.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (11) Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000 by Josh Centers It will be 2018 at the earliest before we see the redesigned Mac Pro that Apple has promised (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017), but if you need a cylinder-style Mac Pro in the interim, there’s some good news: Apple has rejiggered the configurations to provide existing higher performance options at lower prices. (These changes have been called a “speed bump,” but in our opinion, a speed bump requires the introduction of a faster CPU that was previously unavailable. In comparing the technical specs, it seems clear that all Apple did here was drop the prices on existing configurations.) For $2999, the new low-end configuration gets the specs of the previous high-end configuration, which equates to a $1000 price drop. It moves from a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.5 GHz 6-core Xeon E5 and from dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics processors with 2 GB of VRAM to dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM. The new $3999 high-end configuration moves from a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.0 GHz 8-core Xeon E5. It too gets beefier graphics processors, trading dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM for dual AMD FirePro D700 graphics processors with 6 GB of VRAM. These aren’t new options, and our best guess based on current prices is that this configuration also received a $1000 price drop. Oddly, given the fact that these are existing options, the Apple online store reports this configuration as “Currently unavailable.” Both models now feature 16 GB of RAM standard, up from 12 GB for the low-end model, with upgrades to 32 GB ($400) or 64 GB ($1200) available. They come standard with 256 GB of flash storage, and you can boost that to 512 GB ($200) or 1 TB ($600). For the ultimate performance, you can still upgrade to a 2.7 GHz 12-core Xeon E5 CPU ($2000). A tricked-out Mac Pro still costs a whopping $6999! Nor do any other specs change. Notably, the Mac Pro still relies on Thunderbolt 2, so you can’t connect new accessories like the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Besides the six Thunderbolt 2 ports, it still has four USB 3.0 ports, two Gigabit Ethernet ports, one HDMI 1.4 port, and yes, a 3.5mm headphone jack with optical digital output. For wireless connectivity, it features Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. These improvements aren’t likely to make anyone jump on the Mac Pro train, but if you need to buy additional units for your business in the near future, they’ll provide more performance for the money. For many desk-bound professionals, the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display is a better choice, and most of us here at TidBITS now use that machine.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael Lever  2017-04-04 17:43 I have a 27inch 5k retina display. When i switch off at the end of each day, the screen sometimes displays an array of coloured lines before finallty turning off. I say sometimes because it's random. Is this normal or a sign of problems to come? Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-05 10:48 I almost never actually power my 27-inch Retina iMac down (only when I go on vacation), so I'm not sure if this is in any way normal or not. I haven't seen what you describe, or at least not enough that it has registered. For the most part, there isn't much win in turning the iMac off as long as you let it sleep so it's using almost no power while it's not in use. Reply trippp  2017-04-09 23:18 The new iMacs seem to have an issue with the colored lines at shutdown. This is something the Geniuses thought Apple was working on. It seemed to me like an obfuscation, but at least it was an acknowledgment that someone thought there was a real issue that needed to be dealt with. In the past I have considered this sort of thing a sign of trouble. That was four months ago now and the issue is still with us. I chalk it up to yet another example of Apples thinking that a 25billion dollar Macintosh business is not really worth their time when there are iOS devices to be be designed and sold that bring in many times that figure. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-04-11 00:16 Adam, I've found from actual experience that on days I have my iMac powered down the most, I save electricity. I track my daily KwH consumption and normally I have my iMac powered up from about 7 AM to about 2 AM, or 19 hours. If I'm going to be gone most of the day, I power it down when I leave. Since I have it scheduled to power up at 10:30 PM and power down at 2 AM on the days I'm gone, it may only be on those 3.5 hours, saving me about 15.5 hours of energy. That savings shows in the daily readings. Sure it may only be a few KwH per day, but when you are paying 20¢/KwH the savings add up. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-11 10:13 An iMac uses about half a watt while turned off, and about 1.3 watts in sleep. So there's almost no difference in power usage and minuscule cost savings. Call it 20 watt-hours of usage for a day, or .02 KwH, which works out to less than half a cent per day. http://images.apple.com/environment/reports/docs/imac_27inch_per_may2011.pdf I'd have to do some testing with a power meter, but my suspicion is that the spike in power usage at power on might result in overall higher usage than regular sleep/wake cycles. Reply Laine Lee  2017-04-04 18:36 If you've ever seen Star Wars Episode I, you know that a communications disruption can mean only one thing: invasion. If you've followed Apple for a while, you know that a substantial price reduction can mean only one thing: imminent release of a new model. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 19:08 Except that they explicitly said that there would be no new Mac Pro this year. Sorry! Reply James  2017-04-06 09:27 This is the second site I've seen with this headline. They didn't drop the price, they bumped the specs up. The price for the low end machine is still the same as it was, and the price for the high-end is still the same... you just get slightly more power for your $ now. Reply Steve Nicholson  2017-04-06 10:09 Just like with relativity, it all depends on your frame of reference. If you're looking at it from the amount of money you're spending, it's a speed bump. If you're looking at it from the machine you're buying, it's $1000 cheaper. Both points of view are valid. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-06 12:07 As I said in the article, in our opinion, it's not a speed bump if there are no new configurations. Had Apple made a previously unavailable CPU available with a faster clock speed, that would be a speed bump. This is all three-year-old technology at lower prices. It's still welcome, it's just not the same thing. Reply Charles Jacobs  2017-04-08 09:01 Could this now be the super Mac mini that so many have asked for? Is the price still too high? I just checked - a fully decked out Mini is $1999!!! Certainly this is twice the performance.

Turns out that’s not exactly the case. A report from Forbes had assumed because the latest iOS 10.3.2 beta was only supporting 64-bit devices, it meant the 32-bit devices still used by millions of smartphone owners had been earmarked for the glue factory. However, as The Mac Observer points out, Apple’s developer site still includes restore images for both of the models, proving it’ll run the 10.3.2 beta. Related: iOS 10 review However, today’s scare may simply be a stay of execution for iPhone 5 and 5c owners, given WWDC and iOS 11 is right around the corner. Apple will tell us which devices will support the next-gen operating system following the traditional keynote address. Cupertino, to its credit, has been fair when making the newest software available to as many of its hardware customers as possible. The iPhone 5 arrived back in 2013, so customers have enjoyed a decent ride up until now. The phones' days are surely numbered, it's just a case of how long Apple can continue to provide a good experience on that legacy hardware. Would an inability to access the latest operating system prompt you to upgrade your device? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

U.K. chip designer Imagination Technologies was Apple's most recent victim: Its stock tumbled as much as 71 percent in a single day after an announcement that Apple would stop using its intellectual property within 15 months to two years. Apple has also gone after Qualcomm, launching a $1 billion legal attack over royalty charges. Now a company called Synaptics may be at risk, according to Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh. That's because Synaptics makes the technology that helps power mobile phone displays — an industry where change is afoot. show chapters Trader on Apple suppliers: These pullbacks are an opportunity    Tuesday, 11 Apr 2017 | 12:19 PM ET | 03:32 More smartphone manufacturers are favoring OLED displays — the kind of colorful, edge-to-edge screens smartphone screens made almost exclusively by Samsung. If Apple wants to use those screens in upcoming phones, it may seek to reduce its reliance on rival Samsung and make its own technology, Vinh wrote. Suppliers that may be less at risk include Cirrus Logic, Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks, according to Vinh. To be sure, not everyone agrees: A Needham analysis published by Barron's over the weekend speculated that Synaptics has upside "after Apple de-risking." Synaptics declined to comment, citing a quiet period ahead of its quarterly earnings. Shares fell about 2 percent on Wednesday. Apple's chip ambitions Apple has been investing heavily in making and designing its own chips. Apple spent more than $10 billion on research and development in 2016, up from $8.07 billion in 2015 and $6.04 billion in 2014. Much of that spending goes to chips, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said earlier this year. The iPhone maker is particularly powerful because a litany of companies rely on it for 20 percent of their revenue or more. Maestri said that making its own chips helps Apple "push the envelope on innovation .... better control timing, cost, quality." "We think Samsung looks to integrate semiconductors to save costs, but Apple is different as it only looks to integrate components if it believes it can get performance benefits to differentiate its products," Vinh wrote.

On Monday Qualcomm filed a countersuit against Apple, seeking damages for alleged contract pledges, mischaracterized agreements, and misrepresented facts, and accusing the Cupertino, Calif. tech giant of both lying to regulators to spur federal investigations, and lodging threats against Qualcomm to hide its own use of inferior parts in some iPhones, according to Bloomberg. “We were really stunned by some of the things that they included in their suit,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg told Bloomberg. “This is our attempt to respond to some disturbing elements in their complaint.” At the standoff’s heart is a dispute between Apple and Qualcomm over how much the latter is allowed to charge device manufacturers to use its patented technology, which underpins all modern smartphone systems; Qualcomm earns the majority of its revenue by licensing its technology to manufacturers – including Apple – whether they use its chips or not. Bloomberg notes that the company has lost $10 billion USD in market value since Apple’s suit was filed on Jan. 20. Apple’s declined to comment on Qualcomm’s suit, referring Bloomberg to its earlier lawsuit, in which it accused Qualcomm of illegally trying to control the chip market and withholding more than $1 billion USD in “rebates” to punish Apple for talking to regulators in South Korea. “We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts,” the company said in its Jan. 20 statement. Unlike its rivals, Apple does not pay Qualcomm directly, opting instead to pay the chip maker through its Asian contract manufacturers who build the iPhone. Rosenberg alleges that it’s currently meddling in Qualcomm’s agreements with those suppliers, such as Foxconn Technology Co., in a bid to negotiate more favourable licensing fees, and is behind regulatory investigations of Qualcomm’s worldwide business practices as well, lobbying with “false and misleading statements to induce regulators to take action against us because it would be in their commercial interests,” according to Bloomberg. Reporters Ian King and Susan Decker note that in December, Qualcomm was given a record fine of $1.03 trillion USD won (approximately $1.167 billion Canadian) for violating antitrust laws, and that in January it was accused by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission of forcing Apple to exclusively use its chips in return for lower licensing fees. The company is also under investigation in Europe and Taiwan. Qualcomm’s Rosenberg told Bloomberg that his employers didn’t ask to fight Apple, which remains a valued customer. “We, of course, would like to continue to and will continue to do business with Apple,” he said.

App Sleeper can hide almost all apps. Can block all internet access. Reports photos posted on social media. Cons Easily disabled. Some features didn't work in our testing, or didn't work properly. On wake, App Sleeper puts apps in alphabetic order and removes apps from folders. No category-based content filtering. Expensive. Bottom Line ForceField gives iPhone-wielding parents a degree of control over their children's activities on iOS and macOS devices, but some features didn't work correctly in our testing, and its pricing is way out of line with the competition. By Neil J. Rubenking If your modern kids are all about their devices, a parental control system that worships the desktop is outmoded and irrelevant. ForceField focuses strongly on mobile devices, with apps for both parent and child. It's iOS-centric (there's no Android app), though it can cover a child's Mac account too. While it does some things well, I also ran into features that didn't work in my testing, and the price is way out of line with the competition. //Compare Similar Products Compare Kaspersky Safe Kids (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% uKnowKids Premier (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Familoop Safeguard (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Mobicip (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Qustodio Parental Control (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% FamilyTime Premium (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Net Nanny (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Norton Family Parental Control (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% Xnspy (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% For $11.99 per month, you get two parent accounts and one child account, with no limit on the number of iOS devices for the child. Each additional child costs $3.00 per month. That's expensive. For 12 months of the service, you pay $143.88. The only costlier iOS parental control tool I've reviewed is Xnspy (for iPhone), at $149.99 per year. Many similar tools cost less than $50 per year. View All 8 Photos in Gallery Editors' Choice Kaspersky Safe Kids (for iPhone) protects any number of children on any number of devices for just $14.99 per year. That's right. For $14.99, you can use ForceField to track two kids for a month. Or you can use Kaspersky Safe Kids to track any number of kids for a whole year. And where ForceField covers only iOS and macOS, Kaspersky adds Windows and Android protection. Getting Started with ForceField Not surprisingly, your first step is to go online and sign up for an account. I suggest you take the product for a 30-day free trial spin, to see if it's what you want. During the signup process, you can add contact info for a second parent and add your child to the account. I did this online, but you can also do it from the ForceField iOS app. There's a guided setup option that walks you through initial configuration steps. If the steps seem at all daunting, concierge installation help is available. You can schedule a call with a ForceField installation expert who will walk you through all the necessary steps. I installed the parental app on an Apple iPhone 6 with no trouble. It's the child app that might send parents calling for help. Child App Installation For testing purposes, I installed the child app on my Apple iPad Air. To install the app on the child's device, you don't just go to the App Store. Rather, you go to a special URL where a wizard walks you through all the necessary steps. First, it asks you to confirm that you have the device's unlock code and the child's Apple ID login credentials. Later on, you'll also need the child's social media credentials. Note, too, that you must use Safari for this process. I tried to do it using Chrome, and it got stuck. Like Kaspersky and Familoop, ForceField uses mobile device management, or MDM, to control the child's iOS devices. While MDM originated to allow businesses to control company devices, it's also quite effective in a parental control setting. The wizard warns that you have to go through a series of warnings and prompts to get MDM activated. You must also enter the device passcode during the process. Once the MDM profile is active, the wizard takes over the installation process. You do have to confirm the installation and provide the appropriate Apple ID credentials. Removing Kaspersky's MDM profile requires a code that you get from your account online. ForceField offers no defense, though you do get a notification if your child disables ForceField by removing the profile. App Sleeper On first launch, the ForceField child app warns that use of the App Sleeper feature can cause your apps to appear in alphabetical order on the home screen, and may remove them from their folders. This is an annoying occurrence, but it happens when you use MDM to remove access to apps. FamilyTime Premium (for iPhone) exhibited the same problem when I turned its app blocker on and then off. The behavior is on Apple, not on the apps. So just what is App Sleeper? When invoked, it hides the icons for all apps except a few that come with iOS. In testing, I found that only these apps remained: Calendar, Photos, Contacts, Clock, Maps, Home, TV, Notes, Reminders, Settings, App Store, Messages, Mail, and Music. I couldn't even take a screenshot of the home screen. The purpose of App Sleeper is to limit distractions during times when the child should focus on something important, such as homework. From the parent app, you can manually invoke it at any time, and wake the apps when homework time ends. You can also set a timer so that apps wake automatically after however many hours or minutes you choose. If you wish, you can set a daily App Sleeper schedule, either for each day individually, for every day, or for school nights. The scheduler lets you define a single time-span, meaning you can't, say, set it to activate during the homework hour and again during bedtime. In testing, App Sleeper was completely effective. Any apps other than the chosen few became totally unavailable. An iPad with just those basic apps present is pretty darn boring, and not a distraction at all. Browsing Rules ForceField doesn't attempt traditional category-based content filtering like what you get with Kaspersky, Familoop, Net Nanny (for iPhone), and others. If that's what you were looking for, ForceField isn't for you. But it offers its own take on browsing control via its own proprietary browser. The first setting under browsing rules determines whether the child can use Safari. ForceField makes it very clear that if you allow use of Safari, it can't track or control your child's browsing, so be sure to disable Safari. Once you do so, Safari simply vanishes from the child's device. For total control and monitoring, you will have to uninstall Chrome and any other browsers from the child's device. Even then, a resourceful child could evade control by, for example, posting a link in the Facebook app and then going to that link within the app. This requirement to use a proprietary browser is very common in iOS-based parental control systems. Norton, Net Nanny, and a few others include detailed instructions telling parents how to disable other browsers using Restrictions in the Settings app; ForceField doesn't. Familoop Safeguard (for iPhone) is a rarity; because it installs a VPN, it can filter all web traffic. Qustodio also offers VPN-based filtering, but it's an awkward, separate installation. Once you've eliminated other browsing choices, your child will have to use ForceField to get online. At the lightest level of control, without invoking the Blocking feature, you can force YouTube Restricted Mode on, and force Safe Search in Google, Bing, and Yahoo. With the Blocking feature turned on, any time your child tries to visit a website for the first time, a warning appears instead, with a link that lets the child request access. This immediately generates a notification in the parent app, with a preview of the page and links that let the parent tap to allow or deny access. Once you approve a site, the child can visit it freely. ForceField also comes with a library of more than 400 curated, child-friendly, educational sites. By default, it doesn't block these, though you can set it so that even the curated sites require parental permission. There's one more level of browsing control, and it's brutal. With one tap, you can cut off all internet access in the ForceField browser. This doesn't affect any other apps, just ForceField. From the app's menu, the child can send a request for online time. This request generates a parental notification, from which parents can deny the request or allow it for a specific time. In testing, though, I found that this feature didn't work. Even when I granted the request for time, the child app didn't respond. My contact at the company verified that this is a known problem. Activity Report and App Report ForceField's Activity Report simply lists all sites your child has visited. Instances of the URL my.forcefield.me, which represents the ForceField home page, dominated the list in my testing. I suggested to my company contact that they consider suppressing that URL from the report. Parents can tap any URL in the list to see the site. Or they should be able to. In testing, I found that tapping an URL actually opened a different URL from the list. My contact at the company said the most recent app version fixed that bug and suggested that I update. She later verified that the bug was still present, however. Tap App Report in the parent app to view a list of all apps installed on the child's device. You can tap an app to see it in the App Store, but that's it. There's no option to block or uninstall a particular app. To be fair, that level of app management doesn't seem to be possible under iOS; it's more an Android thing. Photo Report You might think the Photo Report would display photos snapped by the camera app, but that's not what it does. Photo Report very specifically lets you see any photo the child posts on Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Twitter, or Tumblr. To enable it for a given social media network, you must have the child's login credentials for that network. If a clever child removes the ForceField app, that's the end of photo reporting, though you do get a notification of the child's chicanery. Once you've configured access to one or more social media networks, the Photo Report displays a newest-first list of all the photos your child posts. But photos are all you get; you don't get to see the description, or who's tagged. The social media feature in Kaspersky lets parents see all posts, not just photos. What's Not Here The option to monitor or block calls and texts is common in Android parental control systems, but not under iOS. Like most competing products, ForceField doesn't offer that feature. uKnowKids Premier (for iPhone) does monitor calls and texts, but it does so after the fact, by reading them out of iCloud. Geolocation, on the other hand, is a handy feature found in many iOS parental control products. Qustodio, Norton Family Parental Control (for iPhone), and Xnspy are among those that let parents check on their child's location. Kaspersky, Familoop, and FamilyTime take the concept a step further, with full-scale geofencing. Parents can define areas like home and school, and get an alert when the child enters or leaves one of these geofenced areas. Needs Work ForceField is a spiffy iOS-focused parental control tool that lets parents exercise a degree of control over their child's device and internet use. However, in testing I encountered features that didn't work, or didn't work correctly. Those need work. The pricing model could use some work as well. I can't get over the fact that for the same $14.99 price you could cover two kids for one month with ForceField, or unlimited kids for a year with Kaspersky. That difference is even more significant because Kaspersky Safe Kids (for iPhone) is our Editors' Choice for iOS-based parental control. Our other Editors' Choice is the very different uKnowKids Premier (for iPhone), which manages unusually detailed monitoring by mining the child's iCloud data.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Share Written by Mike Murphy April 12, 2017 If you’ve ever been to an Apple store, you’ll know that they’re often a frenetic hive of energy, a barely contained chaos of overflowing Genius Bar appointments and random people crowding in just to check their email on a new Mac or play music on Bluetooth speakers. But it’s possible that things are about to get even crazier. The Hover Camera Passport, a small consumer drone produced by Chinese startup Zero Zero Robotics, is about to go on sale at Apple stores, the company announced. And starting today, prospective customers at a few US locations will be able to actually get a demonstration of the $500 drone flying around the store. In the @qz office @mcwm is currently flying a drone that sounds like one thousand mosquitoes in your ear while you are sleeping at once — Nikhil Sonnad (@nkl) November 4, 2016 Quartz reviewed the drone last year. While it’s a one of the most portable, safe, and easy-to-use drones available, it’s also exceedingly loud. And not only is it loud, but the sound its four small motors produce whenever its flying is so high-pitched that my colleague compared it to a swarm of mosquitos attacking your eardrums. Add that in with the giant potted trees and living walls that Apple’s been installing in its stores, and your next trip to pick up an iPhone might feel a lot like an excursion into the rainforest. The Hover Camera (Zero Zero Robotics) The drone will be available at Apple’s online store starting today, and rolling out in Apple stores across the globe. Customers will be able to see Apple employees briefly flying the drones for them, and showing off the Hover Camera’s facial tracking software in store. Apple already stocks other drones in its stores, including the DJI Phantom and Mavic Pro lines, but these larger, more expensive drones aren’t available for demonstrations. Thankfully, the Hover Camera Passport’s propellers are all contained in a sturdy casing, so even if swarms of drones soon start buzzing around Apple stores, we hopefully won’t hear about any horrendous accidents in the near future.

Apple breached agreements and encouraged regulatory attacks in a scheme to coerce unfair licensing terms, Qualcomm claimed. Apple's suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Southern California, argues that Qualcomm used its dominant position in semiconductors to force it to pay billions in additional royalty payments for technologies like Touch ID or Apple Pay, or even added memory, all of which have nothing to do with the Qualcomm baseband processor chipsets used in mobile phones. The value of Qualcomm's technology has been proven over almost 30 years through hundreds of licensing deals negotiated with virtually every major handset maker in the history of the industry, including Asian firms that make iPhones and iPads, argued Don Rosenberg, general counsel at Qualcomm. Apple Balked "Over the past 10 years, Apple has played a significant role in bringing the benefits of mobile technology to its customers with its popular products and services," Rosenberg acknowledged, "but Apple could not have built the incredible iPhone franchise that has made it the most profitable company in the world, capturing over 90 percent of smartphone profits, without relying upon Qualcomm's fundamental cellular technologies." Qualcomm has spent more than $40 billion in research and development over 30 years, according to its court filings. Apple has launched legal cases against Qualcomm in multiple jurisdictions in the UK, China and Japan, Qualcomm noted. Apple previously filed monopoly claims against other suppliers, including Nokia and Samsung. The financial details in support of the companies' claims have not been made public. Both Apple's original suit and Qualcomm's answer and counterclaims were heavily redacted prior to release. "My understanding is that Qualcomm's fees were passed along to Apple through a third-party company that Apple does business with," said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan. "Then, I hear, Apple refused to pay those fees," he told the E-Commerce Times, "and that started the whole ball of yarn unraveling." Regulatory Review Days before Apple filed its suit, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission brought a lawsuit against Qualcomm, alleging that it used its dominant position in baseband processors, a form of semiconductor used in mobile phones, to enforce anticompetitive supply and licensing terms onto phone manufacturers. The terms, according to the suit, involved a no license, no chips policy that forced mobile phone companies to agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms or the company would not ship the processors. Apple was banned from receiving competitive processors from 2011 to 2016 in exchange for reduced royalty payments, the FTC alleged. An FTC spokesperson declined to comment on the case. The Korea Fair Trade Commission late last year imposed a record $865 million fine against Qualcomm for abusing its dominant position to impose unfair licensing terms on handset makers. Qualcomm limited the ability of competing chip makers to work with phone manufacturers, the commission ruled. Raising the Stakes There is no question that Qualcomm technology is central to the evolution of the iPhone, and that Qualcomm has done more than any other company to bring mobile phone technology to the market, said Les Santiago, research director for wireless and IoT semiconductors at IDC. However, Apple's claim is based on the argument that it added features to the iPhone that had nothing to do with Qualcomm's technology, and it therefore should not have to pay Qualcomm additional royalties, even though the payments were linked to the cost of the iPhone, he told the E-Commerce Times. "From that point of view, there is merit to Apple's claims," Santiago said. Qualcomm's counterclaim raises the stakes in the case to an entirely new level, he added. "I had previously thought that Qualcomm would settle its case with Apple, its largest customer, at the earliest possible [date]," Santiago said. "Now it looks like the battle may drag on for a while." Apple and Qualcomm officials did not respond to our requests to comment for this story.

Best iPhone, iPad, & Apple TV game controllers Lincoln today introduces the 2018 Navigator, an all-new full-size SUV that combines modern luxury with advanced technology – elevating family travel to first class… A twin-turbo V6 engine projected to produce 450 horsepower provides smooth power whenever you need it, delivered through a 10-speed transmission. Navigator’s lighter, high-strength aluminum-alloy body removes nearly 200 pounds, helping create a more refined ride. The Android Auto functionality is built-into the vehicle’s 12-inch display that runs Ford’s SYNC 3 platform, and also includes Apple’s CarPlay support. Optional 10-inch adjustable rear seat displays are available for beaming content from the front console to passengers in the back. Lincoln also has a deal with Sling that lets owners view live TV channels via a Slingbox product at home. In addition to the 12-inch touch display, the new Navigator will include a “Head-Up Display that presents “selected information on the windshield instead of the instrument cluster.” 2018 Lincoln Navigator The SUV also offers other tech comforts in its various configurations, including wireless charging, Wi-Fi hotspot functionality for up to 10 devices, six USB ports, four 12-volt power outlets and a 110-volt plug. There are also available options for Trailer Backup Assist tech, a 360-degree camera and enhanced park assist, and Adaptive cruise control. There aren’t any specifics on availability just yet, but you can get more details on the new vehicle in Lincoln’s press release below: NEW YORK–Lincoln today introduces the 2018 Navigator, an all-new full-size SUV that combines modern luxury with advanced technology – elevating family travel to first class. Wireless charging and standard Wi-Fi keep everyone connected. Advanced technology allows the driver to effortlessly adjust the vehicle to make driving easier or more enjoyable – in any weather or terrain. With more space for your belongings than any other large SUV*, the all-new Navigator assures almost nothing is left behind. “Quiet luxury is both a look and a feeling,” says Kumar Galhotra, president, The Lincoln Motor Company. “The all-new Navigator embodies both. The sleek styling, spacious interior and technology are all designed to make each trip effortless.” Modern elegance Navigator’s elegance is on display before the doors even open. Upon approach, the chrome Lincoln star logo on the grille softly illuminates**. Then, LED lighting in the lower front body and taillamps subtly engages, and a luminous Lincoln welcome mat appears beneath the front doors. At night, interior ambient lights sequentially illuminate each of the SUV’s three rows. During the day, a panoramic roof fills the cabin with natural light. A twin-turbo V6 engine projected to produce 450 horsepower provides smooth power whenever you need it, delivered through a 10-speed transmission. Navigator’s lighter, high-strength aluminum-alloy body removes nearly 200 pounds, helping create a more refined ride. Additional weight savings have been reinvested in features such as towing capability and quietness. For example, laminated front and side glass contributes to the quietest Navigator cabin ever. The all-new Navigator offers speed-dependent adaptive lighting, a new Lincoln technology that provides a wider spread of light at lower speeds for increased visibility – helpful when driving through residential areas. As the vehicle accelerates, the beam of light narrows to help eliminate the glare off signs or other distractions. Beneath the sleek interior are inclination and intrusion sensors, which trigger an alarm if someone attempts to move or enter the vehicle. Spacious, luxurious interior Inside, spaciousness comes in all three rows, including storage in each to keep the cabin clean and organized. The all-new Navigator’s advanced cargo management system offers an adjustable shelf behind the rear seats that allows clients to create storage customized to their needs. Even with the vehicle parked on an incline, the feature ensures groceries won’t roll out when the liftgate is opened. The interior layout is clean and uncluttered, with a simple, soothing ambience. “When designing the Navigator, we put an emphasis on ultra-luxury touch points,” says David Woodhouse, Lincoln design director. “We took everything the client would see and touch, and made sure it would look and feel a little more exuberant, a little more indulgent and incredibly beautiful.” Staying connected is easy in the all-new Navigator with six USB ports, four 12-volt power outlets and a 110-volt plug. An available wireless phone charger in the first-row center console media bin eliminates tangled cords. The client experience is further elevated through Lincoln’s new Personal Profile. It uses the key fob to recall individual driver preferences for adapting seat, mirror and pedal positions, as well as climate control and entertainment settings. For owners desiring a more personalized look, Navigator comes with three Lincoln Black Label options – an exclusive collection of interior design themes and materials, plus a host of membership privileges. First-class seating for all Even when the all-new Navigator is fully packed, each occupant can sit in comfort. The driver and front-seat passenger enjoy Perfect Position Seats, which offer massage, heating and cooling functionality, and can be adjusted up to 30 different ways. Standard SYNC® 3 with both Apple CarPlay™ and Android Auto™ compatibility enables clients to manage audio, phone, navigation and more from the vehicle touch screen or steering wheel-mounted controls. Second-row passengers have their own audio and climate control, while third-row seats feature power recline capability. An available rear-seat entertainment system allows passengers to stream content wirelessly with an Android device to one of the 10-inch adjustable screens mounted on the rear of the front seats. Content also can be accessed through more traditional devices like an SD card, an HDMI cord or a USB, as well as through SYNC AppLink™, which permits the front-seat passenger to monitor and select viewing content. Each screen can display different content, allowing a personalized entertainment experience for every passenger. Through Lincoln’s agreement with Sling Media, those who own a Slingbox can access their TV channels on the go. The standard Wi-Fi allows for up to 10 mobile devices at a time to be connected. Clients can enjoy available Revel® Ultima audio with 20 speakers that work in concert with Navigator’s interior design and acoustics. This transforms the cabin into a personal theater with three distinct listening modes – stereo, audience and on-stage. Family-friendly technology Navigator is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. A 12-inch configurable instrument cluster allows drivers to choose the information they want displayed. An available Head-Up Display can show selected information on the windshield instead of the instrument cluster. This helps drivers keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. It’s also easy to adjust to changing conditions. With the turn of a dial, the driver can adapt the Navigator to changing road or weather, and enjoy a smooth, confident ride. Additional available technology includes: Trailer Backup Assist, which automatically steers the vehicle to turn a trailer the desired amount – meaning less time required to perform the task. Navigator is expected to deliver more towing capability than any other premium full-size SUV 360-degree camera and enhanced park assist, which reduce stress from parallel and perpendicular parking. The system integrates views from four cameras to create an overhead image so the driver can see all around the vehicle Adaptive cruise control, which automatically slows Navigator in stop-and-go traffic – resuming speed when traffic allows *Cargo and load capacity limited by weight and weight distribution. **Lincoln star illuminates on Reserve and Black Label models only.  Jordan Kahn @JordanKahn Jordan writes about all things Apple as Senior Editor of 9to5Mac, & contributes to 9to5Google, 9to5Toys, & Electrek.co.

The iPad Pro + Apple Pencil combo allows the artist to create illustrations that Mashable has described as “bright, arresting sports imagery.” To celebrate the Golden State Warriors’ NBA-best regular season record, and star Kevin Durant’s return to the team just in time for the 2017 NBA Playoffs, the iPhone maker has shared images and videos showing off the illustration coming to life from start to finish. Zilla, who goes by the real name Robert Generette III, used Adobe’s Illustrator Draw app for iPad to draw the NBA star. As part of Warriors Fan Night, his work will be featured during tonight’s halftime at the Golden State Warriors regular season finale in Oakland. All fans who enter Oracle Arena this night will receive a special Warriors Fan Night T-shirt that features Warriors players, coaches, fans and legends. Furthermore, the first 10,000 fans shall receive Warriors “Starting 5” Cheer Card. Both the T-shirt and the Cheer Card were designed by Zilla. Here’s an animated GIF showing Zilla bringing Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant to life with a little help from his iPad Pro, Apple Pencil and Adobe’s creative apps. Very impressive indeed. “The Washington Wizards have also commissioned Rob Zilla to create portraits and murals of their players using iPad Pro and Apple Pencil,” writes Apple. Mashable says that drawing an illustration like this with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil takes between two and five hours. The artists typically uses a combination of reference, transparency and freehand, allowing him to draw over a reference photograph.

Club and Gizmodo Media Group may get a small share of the sale. Click here to learn more. You’ll find a selection of the day’s best deals below, but for more, be sure to visit Kinja Deals. Three-Pack Anker PowerLine Lightning cables, $20 Since you named Anker’s kevlar-lined PowerLine cables as your favorite Lightning cables, the company has come out with the nylon-braided PowerLine+ collection, and the lifetime warrantied PowerLine IIs. But the originals are still way better than the crappy cable Apple includes in the box, and today, you can get three of them for the same price Apple charges for one. BeatsX Wireless Headphones, $130 If AirPods don’t fit in your ear, or if you just think they look dumb, the long-awaited BeatsX include the same Apple W1 chip for seamless pairing and device switching, and you can already save $20 on a pair, in multiple colors. Anker PowerCore 10400, $20 Anker PowerCore 15600, $27 Anker’s PowerCore battery packs are your favorite portable chargers, and it’s not even close. And today, two of the most popular models are $4-$5 less than usual. These don’t include Quick Charge or USB-C like some newer models, but they’re compact workhorses that will reliably keep your devices powered on for days at a time. 1byone 40 mile amplified HDTV antenna, $20 1byone makes some of the most popular HDTV antennas on Amazon, and its 40 mile amplified model is down to $20 right now. Just note that 40 miles is an optimistic estimate that you’d only experience like, in the plains of rural Nebraska. Buildings and hills will cut that range down fairly significantly. For more information, check out Lifehacker’s guide for choosing and setting up an antenna. Up to 25 percent off Egyptian cotton sheets Egyptian Cotton is one of the softest things you can sleep on, but it comes at a price. Amazon is thankfully helping you out there with their sale on Egyptian Cotton sheets from Chateau Home Collection. Get a set for as low as $58, with your choice from nine different colors. While you’re gonna want to sleep on these sheets, don’t sleep on this deal because it ends today. Dr. Meter luggage scale, $7 with code 9CFXCB7P United employees probably won’t bludgeon you with battery-filled tube socks if your bag is too heavy, but I guess you never know. So if you’d rather be safe than sorry, this luggage scale is only $7 right now with code 9CFXCB7P. Buy two Michelin Stealth wiper blades for $20 If your wiper blades have seen better days, Amazon will sell you two Michelin Stealth replacements today for $20. Just add any two to your cart (shipped and sold by Amazon.com), and the price will automatically be reduced to $20 at checkout. The deal even works if you buy two different sized blades, so you should have no trouble finding a combination that fits your car. Naked Gun trilogy, $15 Next month will see the Blu-ray re-release of the Naked Gun trilogy—which I’m sure has absolutely nothing to do with society’s new wave of O.J. Simpson hysteria—and you can preorder all three films for $15. Humble intergalactic bundle Humble’s newest bundle includes up to seven space-themed games, including Planetary Annihilation: Titans and Galactic Civilizations II and III, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Offworld Trading Company. You’ll need to donate at least $15 to get a copy, but considering the six other games you’ll also receive, and the fact that it’s selling for $40 on Steam right now, I’d say that’s a fair trade.

Rachel Jacoby ZoldanApr 12, 2017 2:09PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestGiphy / Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Considering there are at least two mega Apple keynotes annually where a slew of new technologies are rolled out, it shouldn't be a huge surprise to learn that the iPhone 5 is about to become obsolete, as first reported by Forbes. What makes the iPhone 5 and 5C (it's cheery, colorful cousin — remember?!) slow death different from the rest is that it isn't centered around a new model drop day; rather, it's due to the latest operating system update — or rather, beta test — to iOs 10.3.2. Because while it is just a beta test, the new iOs requires that an iPhone have a 64-bit processor, something neither the iPhone 5 nor the iPhone 5C has. (Theirs are half that, at 32 bits each.) And although the beta update is just focused on small bug fixes reportedly, including some tweaks to clarify your every Siri query or command, it's still only for the larger processors. Other devices affected by this update include any iPads older than the iPadMini 2 model as well as fifth generation-and-under iPod Touch models. While Apple doesn't disclose all of their sales figures, the iPhone 5 was a huge success, reportedly earning the Apple an impressive $90 million in sales. (The 5C's numbers, however, were not revealed publicly.) Which means that hundreds of people will likely be affected by the inevitable upgrade when it goes from beta to full-blown release. This marks the first time Apple has forced a software update far before a major model change (the next Keynote, along with the drop of the iOs 11 operating system, is expected in September). And what it really boils down, though, is the message that Apple will no longer provide service options for all of their older models — something we haven't seen from the tech giant before. And pssst: If you've got a newer model of the iPhone, find out how to make it extra secure, since that fingerprint lock might not be so foolproof anymore.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Gear How to Prevent iMessages From Accidentally Appearing On Other Devices Thorin KlosowskiYesterday 2:13pm Filed to: security privacy apple ios ios 10 messages mac macbook sierra macos 30 2 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink GIF If you own multiple Apple devices, you’ve probably signed into all of them with your Apple ID. You’ve also probably noticed that when you get a Facetime call your computer rings, or when you get an iMessage your iPad beeps. For most of us, this is a small annoyance worth fixing. For others, it’s a potential privacy nightmare. Advertisement Case in point, the lurid tale of now-former Alabama Governor Robert Bentley, whose goofy love poetry iMessage thread with his former political advisor and mistress accidentally synced up with his state-issued iPad that he also happened to share with his wife. Whoops. Chances are, most of us want to keep access to iMessages on just our phones and maybe a laptop, and we don’t need it on every Apple device we own. Here’s how to audit where you’re signed on and prevent something like this from happening to you. See All the Devices You’re Signed Into First things first, lets give your Apple ID a little audit to see every device you’re signed in on. Advertisement Head to your Apple ID page and log in. Scroll down to the Devices section and take a look at where you’re logged in. If there’s a weird or old device here, click on it, then select Remove to log out. Now, you should know exactly what devices you own that are still linked up to you Apple account. Turn Off iMessage On Extra Devices You probably do not want to log out of you Apple ID entirely on every device. Good news though, you can turn off just Messages (and Facetime, while you’re at it). Advertisement Sponsored How you do so depends on which device you’re on: On iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch If you don’t want iMessages showing up on an iPad or on an old iPhone, it’s easy to disable: Open up Settings > Messages. Set the iMessage toggle to off. You may also want to disable Text Message Forwarding, which sends regular non-iMessage SMS messages from your phone to Messages on your Mac or iPad. Tap the Text Message Forwarding option, then uncheck any devices you do not want SMS messages to go to. On a Mac If you don’t want iMessages showing up on your Mac, you just need to log out: Open up Messages. Click Messages > Preferences, then select the Accounts tab. Select your iMessage account, then click the Sign Out button. To log out of Facetime, open Facetime, then head to Facetime > Preferences, then click Sign Out. Now, your messages won’t sync up anywhere you don’t want them to. Share Your Purchases Without Sharing Your Private Data There’s a chance that one reason you might be signed into your Apple ID on multiple devices is because your family doesn’t want to purchase the same apps, music, or movies multiple times. Well, in that case, you’re doing things wrong. Don’t share your account with your family; set up Family Sharing so you can both have individual accounts. Advertisement Advertisement With Family Sharing, you can share each other’s iTunes, iBooks, and App Store purchases without actually sharing accounts. This means your phone calls, iMessage conversations, Safari browsing history, photos, and everything else that’s linked to your Apple ID remains yours and yours alone. With Family Sharing, one person is the family organizer who sets it all up. That organizer adds other users to the account, then confirms any purchases someone else in the group tries to make. Theoretically, you could also do this with your personal account and a work account, which would help keep private data private. Again, set up here depends on which devices you have: On an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch Go to Settings and tap your Apple ID. Tap Set Up Family Sharing, then tap Get Started. Tap Continue to agree to being the Family Organizer, then follow the rest of the instructions to add additional members to your family group. From here on out, you can manage, remove, or add new family members by heading to Settings > iCloud > Family. On a Mac Open up System Preferences. Click iCloud. Click the Set Up Family button, then follow the rest of the instructions to add additional members to your family group. You can now manage, remove, or add family members by heading to System Preferences > iCloud > Manage Family. Enable Two-Factor Authentication Finally, the last thing you’ll want to do is enable two-factor authentication if you haven’t already. This not only secures your Apple ID and every device connected to it, it also prevents you from doing anything on accident in the future because it requires a few extra steps to sign in. With two-factor authentication, when you sign into a device for the first time, you need to authorize it with a verification code sent to another, trusted device. For example, if you get a new MacBook, you can’t sign into your Apple ID on that MacBook until Apple sends a code to your iPhone. Yet again, set up depends on which device you’re on. This might sound cumbersome, but Apple’s implementation is less annoying than other options, and the security is well worth it. Here's Everywhere You Should Enable Two-Factor Authentication Right NowHere's Everywhere You Should Enable Two-Factor Authentication Right NowHere's Everywhere You Should Enable Two-Factor… Two-factor authentication is one of the best things you can do to make sure your accounts…Read more Read more On an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch Open Settings, then tap your Apple ID. Tap Password & Security. Tap Turn on Two-Factor Authentication, then follow the directions on screen to finish the set up process. On a Mac Head to System Preferences > iCloud > Account Details. Click the Security tab. Click Turn on Two-Factor Authentication and follow the directions on screen to finish the set up process. Now, your Apple ID is not only secure, it’s also much less likely you’ll accidentally sign into a device without realizing the repercussions of doing so. Beyond all that, one final thing: do not link your personal accounts to your company-issued devices, especially if you work for the state. It’s not only bad form, it’s also a privacy nightmare. Besides the fact that you may potentially look like a dummy when someone in your IT department figures it out, most company-issued devices grant access to everything you do on that device to your company. Which is to say, if you send an idiotic, racist, scandalous, or whatever other stupid message to a friend on that device, your company might just happen upon it.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 12, 2017 at 1:00PM What happened Earlier this morning, BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) announced that it had been awarded $815 million through a binding arbitration decision. A licensing dispute arose between BlackBerry and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) approximately a year ago, and the two companies entered into arbitration. The dispute centered around whether or not a royalty cap applied to payments made under a specific license agreement. Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has sued Qualcomm in four different countries, claiming that Qualcomm was effectively extorting it and leveraged an unofficial "no chips, no license" policy to extract inflated royalties, among other allegations. Image source: Apple. Does it matter? The arbitration decision would seem to imply that there are situations where Qualcomm has been overcharging for royalties, as the decision sided with BlackBerry and the Canadian company will now receive a refund for those overpayments. That could suggest that Apple has more of a case, if another licensee has won its own fight over royalty overpayments. However, Qualcomm reminded investors that these two cases are not related. In its statement, Qualcomm noted: "The arbitration decision was limited to prepayment provisions unique to BlackBerry's license agreement with Qualcomm and has no impact on agreements with any other licensee." Qualcomm likely anticipated that there could be a tendency to connect BlackBerry's win to Apple's current lawsuits. The mobile chip giant said that the BlackBerry case revolved around a single issue on whether Qualcomm's voluntary per-unit royalty cap applied to BlackBerry's non-refundable royalty prepayments for subscriber units between 2010 and 2015. Each license agreement is unique, and Qualcomm had inked a much broader "business cooperation" agreement with Apple that was much more complex and covered a wider range of issues. The amount of money at stake is also significantly higher, so arbitration is unlikely and Apple does not appear open to settling. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm. The Motley Fool has the following options: long January 2018 $90 calls on Apple and short January 2018 $95 calls on Apple.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike Yesterday AAPL: 141.80 0.17 Building an iPhone 6s for $300 using recycled parts from China Greg Barbosa - Apr. 12th 2017 10:59 am PT @gregbarbosa iPhone View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Scotty Allen, a world traveller with an appetite for the unknown, had decided that he would take on the challenge of making his own iPhone. Traveling to Shenzen over a period of months, Allen discovered he could buy all the components needed to make his very own iPhone, and all for less than half the price of a new one… When Apple launched the iPhone 6s originally, iFixit wasted no time in taking the entire device apart, but it’s not often that someone wants to build the phone from parts. IHS estimated that the 16GB iPhone 6s Plus cost Apple roughly $236 in parts, providing a sizable margin with the phone’s launch price of $650. Allen’s final project ended up costing less than half of the launch price. Allen’s DIY iPhone project began when someone mentioned to him the possibility of building a phone with all the parts around Shenzen’s market. He took that on as a challenge and over the following months began buying the parts necessary to do so. He estimates that after having completed the project, he most likely spent over a $1000 in parts but around $300 for the final product. … I spent well over $1000, but a lot of that was parts and tools I didn’t end up needing. I’d say it’s probably around $300 worth of parts in the actual phone. I think around $300 or so. Maybe a bit more. – Strange Parts Focusing on the main components of the phone (logic board, display, battery, and back casing), Allen took to Shenzen’s markets to find everything he needed. He had hopes to solder together his own logic board, but said it turned out to be a more difficult endeavor than he originally thought. This is most likely because of the Touch ID and Secure Enclave’s pairing. He ended up purchasing a recycled logic board that came with the Touch ID sensor included. Apple’s Secure Enclave is tied to each individual Touch ID sensor, so if he had gotten the two components separately, Touch ID wouldn’t have worked. From his post about the journey, he mentions that he built an iPhone 6s instead of a 7 because the parts were easier to come by. …iPhone 7 parts are pretty hard to come by in the markets. It’s not totally clear why this is, but I have some ideas. A lot of the parts come from recycled/broken phones, and so it would make sense that there just isn’t that much supply yet. I also think there’s probably really high demand for iPhone 7 parts, so what parts are available may get traded before they make it out into display cases. Be sure to read about the entire journey over at Strange Parts, and watch the detailed video below.   Image Credit: Scotty Allen Greg Barbosa @gregbarbosa Greg Barbosa is the Product Manager at Electrek, 9to5Google, 9to5Mac, and 9to5Toys and a writer for 9to5Mac.

The concept comes following Apple's announcement that both devices are in development for release as early as next year. The Mac Pro has always been controversial: for some it simply was the "trash can" (due to its design), for others a powerful machine. At CURVED we have been producing our videos on the Mac Pro for many years. But ever since its release an update failed to materialize. That was three years ago. The CURVED/labs concept from the current Mac Pro predecessor and adds swiveling case components for easier access and other improvements. The Specs: ● the side doors can swivel/rotate to open ● 2 x slots for full-size graphics cards ● slots for adding/exchanging hard disks/SSD drives ● a slot for replacing the processor ● slots for adding/replacing memory ● ventilation holes on the top to release hot air from the computer ● power on/off button on the front in form of a touch-ID button ● touch bar on the front, which can display information about internal components etc. ● microphone/headphone jacks on the front for easy access ● SD card on front ● connectors on the back: USB-C, USB, FireWire, LAN, HDMI ● unlock button on the back (looks similar to that on current MacPro), which will unlock the side 'doors' so that they can open The companion Cinema Display features a 27-inch screen, very narrow edges, and USB connectivity at the back.

Harpal Singh DHANORA April 12, 2017 23:25 IST Updated: April 13, 2017 08:25 IST more-in Telangana’s experiments have yielded hot weather varieties Apple cultivation isn’t something one expects to see in the tropics. But in the hills of north Telangana, an experiment to change that is, literally, bearing fruit. In a small orchard in Dhanora village, Kerameri Mandal, Kumram Bheem Asifabad district (one of the four districts carved out of what was Adilabad) apple trees planted a year ago are fruiting. The achievement is a result of a few years of experimentation in apple genomics by scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, which produced ‘low-chilling’ varieties of the plant, that is, they are able to withstand hot weather. Last year, an experiment in apple cultivation at the Regional Agriculture Research Station at Chintapally, Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, demonstrated that the fruit can be grown in the hot and arid uplands of Kerameri. The scientists say that the area is conducive for growth of the modified apples, as it is at about 2,300 feet above sea level. “Dhanora is surrounded by hills, while cold winds from the North are not blocked owing to deforestation,” Dr. A Veerabhadra Rao, senior Principal Scientist at CCMB said. CCMB supplied 120 tribal farmers with about 2,000 grafts of three low-chilling varieties. Kendre Balaji, a local farmer, is growing 150 plants, a mixture of all varieties, using organic cultivation methods which improve the nutritional value of his soil. His plants have shown excellent growth, including flowering and fruiting. “The apples are expected to taste good,” said Professor Ramesh Agarwal, CCMB’s Chief Scientist.

Increase / Decrease text size Joe Clark   - Reporter 12th April 2017 Add to favorites Which smartphone retains its value the longest? A new report details what your phone is actually worth. If you’re the kind of person to sell your smartphone after upgrading then Apple is the best choice for you, according to a new report. The tech selling site musicMagpie has released data indicating that Apple is a clear winner when it comes to retaining value, beating out other leading brands such as Samsung. musicMagpie estimates that Apple and Samsung account for 51% and 22% of the UK phone market respectively, according to eBay sales data, and this level of demand means that prices typically remain higher for longer. Liam Howley, marketing director at musicMagpie, said: “The clear winner when it comes to phone depreciation are Apple users. iPhones have a reputation of being premium products and after the initial fall in price when a model is launched, the iPhone holds the most value after a 12-month, and even a 24-month period which are both average contract lengths.” “This is good news for savvy consumers who are looking to cash in after their phone contract ends as they know they’ll get the best value from their old iPhone if they are re-selling once they upgrade, or better still, that it really pays to sell your phone as soon as possible if you’re planning to upgrade.” So how much is your phone actually worth? musicMagpie found that after one month of ownership an iPhone 7 depreciated, on average, 34% from its RRP, whereas the Samung Galaxy S7 lost 50% of its value. The study also found that the depreciation suffered by iPhone models is lower with each iteration of the devices. The iPhone 5 lost 65% of its value after six months on the market, whereas the iPhone 6 lost less than 40% within that same time period. On the opposite end of the spectrum, musicMagpie found that the biggest depreciation came from HTC. The HTC one M9 lost 65% of its value in just one month, and 75% after a year. The average contract last roughly 24 months and in that time the HTC One M7 and M8 lost 86% and 83%, respectively. Tags Research Smartphone value Previous ArticleAutobots, roll out!

Advertisement Apple, Microsoft and Wal-Mart were among the 50 largest U.S. companies that are parking about $1.6 trillion in offshore tax havens to reduce their U.S. tax burden, according to a study published by Oxfam America on April 12. Oxfam America said the sum for 2015 was a $200 billion increase over the prior year. The report cites the companies' own data. While not illegal, the companies "used a secretive network of 1,751 subsidiaries in tax havens to stash" their earnings outside the United States, Oxfam said in the report released ahead of next week's meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. "Tax avoidance has become standard business practice across the globe,” said Oxfam senior advisor Robbie Silverman. “Corporate tax dodgers cheat America out of approximately $135 billion in unpaid tax revenues every year Apple is at the top of the ranking with more than $200 billion in offshore funds, followed closely by Pfizer laboratories ($193.6 billion) and Microsoft's IT group ($124 billion), the report said. U.S. law allows companies to keep profits from foreign operations offshore indefinitely, to avoid corporate taxes that are among the highest in the industrialized world. While the corporate tax rate is nominally 35% at the federal level, Oxfam said these 50 companies had an effective rate nearly 10 percentage points lower. During his campaign, President Donald Trump proposed cutting the rate to 15%, and allowing companies to repatriate their cash reserves with a one-time tax of 10%. Oxfam criticized both proposals, saying the tax cut would help profitable companies and wealthy shareholders at the expense of important anti-poverty programs. And the drastic reduction in corporate income tax will "feed into a destructive race to the bottom that has seen countries across the globe slashing corporate tax rates in recent years," the report said. Meanwhile, "repatriation holidays reward companies for keeping money offshore and avoiding their taxes" and "incentivizes companies to move their profits to tax havens in expectation that they will eventually benefit from a one-time tax cut." "President Trump promised to fix the rigged political and economic system yet his tax reforms will further enrich powerful corporates at the expense of ordinary people and small businesses," Silverman said. "The President and leaders in Congress must rethink their reforms and build a tax system that works for everyone and not just a fortunate few."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Tops Smartphone Shipments Chart in Q1 due to Flooding the Market with Massive Low-End Model Shipments | Main | Apple Files Apple Music Trademark Update to Cover Promotional Items like Caps, Lingerie, Masquerade Costumes, Wristbands & more » April 12, 2017 Could Apple's Latest Figurative Trademark Filing Relate to their New Apple Music TV Streaming Service?   In Q1 2017 Patently Apple posted two reports about Apple's possible new TV services. The first was titled "Apple hires new Apple TV VP to Strengthen, Focus and Accelerate new Content and Services," and the second titled "Apple Still in the Hunt for a Transformative Acquisition to set Apple TV on Fire Prior to the Arrival of the Mobile TV Revolution." In March Macworld UK wrote that "Rumors that Apple has been planning to launch a streaming service have been floating around the internet for years, now the company has revealed its plans for two programs: Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps, both of which will stream to Apple Music subscribers in the first half of 2017."   Today Patently Apple discovered a new figurative trademark that Apple filed in China relating to a new streaming audio and video service.  Whether it's the official logo for the Apple service or a new icon that will be delivered to our iDevices if we subscribe to the service is not known at this time.   China: Apple's Figurative Trademark Application In-Part   Apple's Figurative Trademark   Apple's new figurative trademark was filed under International Class 009 with the specific verbiage: "Computer software for transmitting, streaming, receiving, playing, routing and storing audio, video, images, and multimedia content."   By Apple's description in their class filing It sure sounds like this could be the new figurative logo for Apple Music's streaming Video and Audio Service. The figurative trademark is clearly an offshoot of their AirPlay Logo with a triangle and rectangle as noted below. The filing notes that the trademark filing was originally made in Trinidad and Tobago in October 2016 under number 51934. The trademark was also filed in London by Locke Lord (UK) LLP.   About Comments: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit comments.

Apple is showcasing his work illustrating NBA stars like Kevin Durant using the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil with an exclusive look at how Zilla creates from start to finish. Sony A6500 To celebrate the Golden State Warriors’ NBA-best regular season record—and star Kevin Durant’s return to the team just in time for the 2017 NBA Playoffs—artist, teacher and sports fan Robert Generette III shares an exclusive illustration of Durant coming to life on iPad Pro. Zilla uses the excellent Adobe Illustrator Draw app for iOS to create these incredible illustrations. Color me impressed. Apple says these illustrations created with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil will be featured during halftime tonight at the Golden State Warriors regular season finale: The Golden State Warriors, as part of Warriors Fan Night at tonight’s regular season finale in Oakland, will feature Rob Zilla’s illustrations of Warriors players, legends, coaches and fans designed on iPad Pro. The Warriors will also recognize the artist and his work at halftime. And Mashable profiled the artist earlier this year where he said the process usually takes between two to five hours using the larger iPad Pro: Drawing these images, Generette explained, can take anywhere from two to five hours. Generette uses a combination of reference, transparency (in which he starts the drawing over a photo – the iPad Pro 12.9 inch he uses has enough screen real estate to host both a drawing app and the reference photo) and freehand. But the method is usually determined by the timeline and budget.

While we don’t expect to see an update that addresses every opportunity left for watchOS in one year, there are certainly a lot of areas ripe for improvement considering how new Apple Watch and watchOS are. Read on for our watchOS 4 wish list below and share your own ideas in the comments. Sony A6500 More Apps Ultimately voice and Siri may prove to be the most efficient way to interact with Apple Watch, but I still prefer a user interface that I can tap around for a lot of tasks. watchOS 2 brought Apple’s Reminders app as a list, for example, after watchOS 1 relied on Siri for adding entries to Reminders and punted to iPhone for viewing that list. watchOS 4 could do the same with Apple’s Notes app. You can already use Siri to create or add to text notes, but there’s no way to see Apple Notes on Apple Watch which could be very convenient. Notes can contain text, images, maps, and more elements that are viewable in other apps (and you can view email on Apple Watch) so there’s no technological barrier here. Speaking of missing apps, I’m really hoping this is the year we see Apple’s Podcasts app come to Apple Watch. You can receive alerts for new podcast episodes on watchOS, but you can’t do much else with podcasts from Apple Watch. Remote playback would be a start, but ultimately the goal would be syncing and offline playback. Playing audiobooks from iBooks is another opportunity, but both might require cellular connectivity and streaming to be done well. Find My iPhone is another missing app from watchOS, although you can already ping your connected iPhone from Control Center. You can’t ping AirPods, however, even though iOS 10.3 made that possible from iPhone. Apple could add AirPods pinging to Control Center, but that screen is already overly busy (more on that in a bit). A dedicated Find My iPhone app that looks something like Apple Watch’s Find My Friends app could scale better and even map and locate other devices like iPads and Macs. Improve Core Apps watchOS 4 can also improve the apps that are already included on Apple Watch. Take Calendar for example. The app has improved in recent updates, but Calendar is still limited to showing just current month view. You can’t scroll back and see March if it’s April, and you can’t scroll forward and see May either. Some constraints may be necessary on current hardware, but ultimately the Calendar app should be as flexible as the iPhone app (or limited to a single year at a time, not month, if needed). Apple’s Activity app could also be more comprehensive. This is one area where I do expect to see improvements. Other sport watches can’t assume you have an iPhone paired so more comprehensive workout data is available on the watch itself. Apple Watch does display a decent summary of post-workout data right after an exercise, but you need to refer to the iPhone after the workout is saved. This is one complaint health and fitness device reviewers still have with Apple Watch despite the focus on activity tracking with watchOS 3 and Apple Watch Series 2. System Improvements watchOS 3 was a big step forward in usability thanks to speed improvements and a rethinking of how navigating much of the system should work. That included the introduction of Control Center in place of Glances which had some of the same functionality, but this move wasn’t entirely a step forward. For example, Now Playing is now an app in the Dock that requires a button click and usually some swiping and a tap to access when it was previously a swipe up in most cases. The easy solution here is make Now Playing a swipe over from Control Center similar to how it works on iPhone. Volume control is also something that can be improved in watchOS 4, especially with AirPods becoming popular. There are a lot of ways volume control could improve throughout watchOS, but the easiest solution to me would be making the Digital Crown the volume control when the proposed new Now Playing card is added to Control Center. Control Center could also benefit from a general rethinking in watchOS 4. Adding new functionality makes the current single screen Control Center rely on scrolling on any size Apple Watch. The AirPlay toggle to connect to AirPods, for example, is the bottom option which requires scrolling. I rarely use some of the other buttons that are placed first but use AirPlay daily during workouts. Apps that can’t launch without iPhone need updating Media syncing is another area that could benefit from improvements as I’ve written about before. Syncing music is limited to a single playlist and has odd storage and track number limitations that don’t make much sense (you can’t use all free space for syncing music). Again, cellular connectivity and streaming may be the easiest solution to these problems, but there’s some improvements that could be implemented in the meantime too. I would also love to see Apple push developers to revisit their Apple Watch apps now that watchOS has matured and improved greatly since day one. A lot of Apple Watch apps from big name companies like Twitter and Instagram haven’t changed since launch but could benefit from using new watchOS features. More evangelizing or incentivizing developers could be a benefit for consumers. More Customization Personalization and customization is one of Apple Watch’s strongest features, and there are even more opportunities in this area going forward. watchOS 3 introduced new Apple Watch faces including Activity Digital and Numerals after watchOS 2 brought new photo watch faces. watchOS 4 will likely include additional watch faces if this trend continues, but a watch face gallery on the App Store is ultimately what users want. Apple set the groundwork for this with the watch face gallery in the Apple Watch app on iOS 10, but that currently only promotes new first-party Apple Watch faces and complications. Third-party watch faces on the Apple Watch could be as big as third-party apps on the iPhone if the right tools are in place and flexibility is allowed. Finally, watchOS 4 could improve customization by adding the ability to have custom tones for alerts like new messages and phone calls. You can already do this on iOS of course, but watchOS doesn’t offer the flexibility. This is something I regularly see readers mention and one of my first complaints when first using Apple Watch at launch. Apple could provide a preset list of tones for different alert types or go even further and let you pair specific alerts with specific contacts like on iOS. For example, I had different tones for my wife and mom than other contacts on iOS before I used Apple Watch. Now all alerts have the same tone regardless of which contact on Apple Watch. What would you like to see on Apple Watch with watchOS 4? Let us know in the comments and stay tuned for more coverage going in to WWDC 2017 on June 5th!

The company is reportedly planning to terminate its contract with German chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor, which makes the iPhone's power management integrated circuit (PMIC), and start developing its own battery management chip. The new technology would potentially allow Apple to extend the battery life of the iPhone without using a larger battery - something that Chief Design Officer Jony Ive has ruled out, because it would hamper the design of the device. Sources told Reuters that Apple has set up two power management design centres in Munich and California, with 80 engineers hoping to have the new chip ready for inclusion in iPhones from 2019. Hydrogen battery to enhance iPhone battery life for up to a week (Photo: iFixit) That means it won't be included in Apple's next iPhone model , expected to launch in September 2017, but could be used in future models. "In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part," said Bankhaus Lampe analyst Karsten Iltgen.

Dialog Semiconductor did not comment on the latest rumour, claiming it remains comfortable with its financial outlook for "good revenue growth" in 2017. However, its share price also fell 36% on Tuesday to a seven-month low.

Rumours suggest that it will be made entirely from glass and come in three size options. At least one of these is thought to feature a curved OLED display - similar to Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge - and boast 4K resolution.

News Opinion Commentary Commentary: Why United likely won't lose altitude in China Passenger forcibly removed from United Airlines flight This video posted on social media shows a passenger on an April 9, 2017, United Airlines flight from Chicago O'Hare International Airport to Louisville being removed by security. (Jayse D. Anspach) This video posted on social media shows a passenger on an April 9, 2017, United Airlines flight from Chicago O'Hare International Airport to Louisville being removed by security. (Jayse D. Anspach) Adam MinterBloomberg View By mid-afternoon Tuesday, Chinese online anger at United Airlines was running so hot that the hashtag #UnitedForcesPassengerOffPlane was receiving 20 million views per hour on the Sina Weibo social network. Such fury is more typically reserved for geopolitical spats with the likes of Japan and South Korea. It's little wonder that the outrage earned the attention of United Continental Holdings Inc. shareholders, who drove the company's stock down 4 percent while the hashtag was still atop the rankings. On the surface, the nosedive might seem warranted. China is the world's fastest-growing major commercial aviation market, and the preferences and prejudices of Chinese passengers will shape airline fortunes for years to come. But in the medium term, United has less to fear from those millions of irked Chinese netizens than one might think. Remember, United is hardly the first foreign company to spur a nationalist backlash in China. In recent years, firms ranging from Toyota to Apple have suffered protests and boycotts that moved from the web to the real world. At their worst, these campaigns have received government backing. For example, in 2008, thousands of Chinese protesters targeted Carrefour, the French supermarket chain, due to rumors that the company had donated money to the Dalai Lama, as well as mistreatment of Chinese Olympic torchbearers as they ran through Paris. And in 2012, protesters boycotted Japanese carmakers in the wake of a China-Japan territorial dispute in the East China Sea. Some Japanese carmakers required months to recover from the disruption to their businesses. But despite high-profile online and offline campaigns, the protest against Carrefour fizzled quickly as protesters put down their banners and went shopping once again. That tends to be the fate of most Chinese consumer boycotts that aren't rooted in long-standing regional hatreds. Chinese consumers, like their counterparts elsewhere, are simply too practical and quality-focused to let political values get in the way of a good deal or a sexy product. For example, Apple has been on the receiving end of multiple protests in recent years, many related to its warranty policies. Yet the brand remains wildly popular in China. United's situation is only slight more complicated than Apple's. Much of the outrage at the airline was sparked by the widespread belief that David Dao, the passenger forcibly removed from his United flight, was Chinese. But the fact that Dao is Vietnamese-American took much of the edge off that argument. Equally important, Dao's mistreatment wasn't particularly extreme by the standards of Chinese airlines. Violence on Chinese flights to and from Hong Kong has become so common that cabin crew members for Hong Kong Airlines are now given compulsory instruction in martial arts to protect themselves and other passengers. As bad as United may seem, Chinese airlines are often presumed to be worse. And United enjoys one other key advantage in China: As in the U.S., it faces little competition. Thanks to a series of bilateral agreements between the U.S. and China, U.S. airlines are allowed to make only 140 round-trip flights between China and the U.S. per week (Chinese airlines get 180). Routes to the most popular cities (Beijing and Shanghai, most prominently) are also tightly limited, giving consumers far less choice than they would have if the trans-Pacific market were completely open. That works to the advantage of United and other established airlines; not surprisingly, efforts to open up the market further have been stalled for years. For now, that means that the impact on United's bottom line in China -- and its incentive to improve its image -- is likely to be limited. But the airline shouldn't take its position for granted. Chinese consumer tastes are evolving and growing more sophisticated. Within the next decade or two, Chinese passengers will form the world's largest traveling public, and their influence on airlines -- both foreign and domestic -- will be decisive. What might seem like brief turbulence today could then become the kind of scandal that grounds a company. Bloomberg View Adam Minter is a Bloomberg View columnist.

UNDERCOVER IN AN IPHONE FACTORY: What it's really like to work in a Chinese mega-factory, according to a student who spent 6 weeks there Kif Leswing Apr. 11, 2017, 3:29 PM 153,158 facebook linkedin twitter email print Imagine going to work at 7:30 every night and spending the next 12 hours, including meals and breaks, inside a factory where your only job is to insert a single screw into the back of a smartphone, repeating the task over and over and over again. During the day, you sleep in a shared dorm room, and in the evening, you wake up and start all over again. That's the routine that Dejian Zeng experienced when he spent six weeks working at an iPhone factory near Shanghai, China, last summer. And it's similar to what hundreds of thousands of workers in China and other emerging economies experience every day and night as they assemble the gadgets that power the digital economy. Unlike many of those workers, Zeng did not need to do the job to earn a living. He's a grad student at New York University, and he worked at the factory, owned by the contract manufacturing giant Pegatron, for his summer project. China Photos/Stringer/Getty; Samantha Lee/Business Insider Dejian Zeng spent six weeks in the summer of 2016 at a Pegatron facility on the outskirts of Shanghai for his summer project. He told us: He was paid 3100 yuan (about $450) and housing for a month of work, including overtime. He slept in a dorm room with seven other people. What happens when a factory starts producing an unreleased iPhone. Factory workers usually cannot afford new iPhones. There's an Apple-promoted app that the factory wants all its workers to download. Why it can get stinky in the factories. Why he believes iPhone manufacturing will never come to the United States. People entering a Pegatron factory.Dejian Jang Like many tech companies, Apple makes nearly all its computers and phones in China, using contract manufacturers like Pegatron. That has recently become a contentious political issue, with President Donald Trump calling for Apple to bring manufacturing — and the jobs that come with it — back to the United States. At the same time, Apple's overseas manufacturing has long been a target of criticism from some groups that point to workers' long hours and low wages. Leaders in the tech industry say Apple has shifted its practices to address previous controversies over its factory workers in China. In March, Apple released its annual report looking at its manufacturing operations. To see what the situation was like firsthand, Zeng went to work undercover in Pegatron's ChangShuo factory last summer, armed with a fellowship from NYU. The factory he worked at was profiled by the BBC in 2014 and Bloomberg in 2016, with the reporting focusing on whether some workers were forced to work overtime shifts. Apple employees are on the ground at the Pegatron facility every day, an Apple spokesman told Business Insider. Apple performed 16 audits at the ChangShuo Pegatron factory, finding that 99% of workweeks were under 60 hours, with the average workweek for people assembling Apple products clocking in at 43 hours. Wages at Pegatron have increased more than 50% over the last five years, and they are higher than the Shanghai minimum wage, the spokesman said. Pegatron didn't comment. Zeng, who plans to work at a Chinese human-rights nonprofit when he graduates, said he believed a strike was imminent at the Pegatron plant when he went to work there. No strike happened, but Zeng got a look into the daily lives of factory workers who assemble iPhones. Here's what he told Business Insider about his experience. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. The view of the campus from Zeng's dorm room.Dejian Zeng Kif Leswing: So what did you do? I'd love to hear about your day. Dejian Zeng: At the beginning, I was assigned to the assembly line in the department called FATP, final assembling testing packing. We put the iPhone together. One line might have about 100 stations. Each station does one specific thing. At the beginning, I work on iPhone 6S. And then after August, we are working on iPhone 7. When I'm working iPhone 6S, I do two stations. One station at the beginning I did fastening speaker to housing. What I did is that I put the speaker on the case, and I put a screw on it. The [iPhone] housing — we call it the back case — is moving on the assembly line, and that's when we pick it up, and now we get one screw from the screw feeder, and then we put it on the iPhone and then put it back, and it goes to next station. Leswing: You were in charge of one screw?A typical dorm at Pegatron.Dejian Zeng Zeng: It's like, that's the work. I mean, it's simple, but that's the work that you do. Over, over, over again. For whole days. Leswing: Did it drive you nuts? Zeng: The first couple of days you're very concentrated because you couldn't catch up the speed of the assembly line. You need to be very quick to catch up. So you're very, very focused. It makes you very tired, but it keeps your mind on it. You have no time to think about things. I need to get quicker and quicker. And then, after awhile, you get more familiar to it, and that in the end, I can even do this screw by closing my eyes. It is just like that. So after that, you get a lot of time that you have nothing to do. That's when people feel very annoyed. Because in the Pegatron factories, any kind of electronic devices are not allowed to be inside the factories. It makes you very boring there because you can't listen to music. Sometimes workers talk with each other, random chats, but sometimes your line manager gets very upset by that. They say, "Keep your voice low." Leswing: So when and where did you wake up every day? Zeng: I wake up in a dorm shared by eight people. The dorm is not on the factory campus — it's in a place about 10 minutes drive, and they have a shuttle bus for us. At the beginning, I would have work on the night shift. I wake up at 6 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. The assembly line starts working at different times. Some coworkers start working at 7:30 p.m., some workers at 8 p.m., some like 8:30 p.m, some at 9:30 p.m. I started at 7:30 p.m, so I take the shuttle bus at 7 p.m., and then we start getting to the factory about 7:15 p.m. After roughly two hours, you have a 10-minute break. During the break, many people sleep. And it's kind of a struggle because this is not a very long time. And if you want a drink of water or if you want to go to the restroom, you need to walk out a huge workshop and then go to the restroom, and then come back in — takes about 10 minutes. View As: One Page Slides Zeng presenting his summer project at NYU.Dejian Zeng "I mean, it's simple, but that's the work that you do. Over, over, over again. For whole days." Leswing: So the bathrooms are not around? Zeng: It becomes a struggle when you're very sleepy but also you need to drink some water. You can only do one thing. It's just go to the restroom or come back and take some sleep. Leswing: You just came back from a 10-minute break. What do you do now? Zeng: After another two hours, we got a 50-minute break for lunch. Generally, there are vegetables, meats, and sometimes it's like buns or noodles — and then basically it's like three vegetables, one meat, with rice. That's generally a meal. Sometimes they have apples, pears, some fruits as additions to the meal. The whole factory eats there. It's a huge canteen room. If you have finished the meal earlier [than 50 minutes], you can take some sleep also. Sleep is really a thing in the factory. You can see that in the lounge — we have a lot of long sofas, but it's not really a very comfortable sofa. It's like you can feel the iron. People just sit there and sleep. But you can't lay down. There are people walking around. If they see you lay down, they will swipe the ID and take a record of it. And they put the record in your profile. And then they will publish it to your whole assembly line, so your manager would come and yell at you later. Sometimes if it happens multiple times, they deduct money. Leswing: How much money would they take if they caught you sleeping? Zeng: It's not catching you sleeping — it's catching you laying. There are certain behaviors that you can't do. The same thing happens if you accidentally bring a phone into the factories. It's not even getting inside. It's like when you're past the metal detectors and it sounds and you pulled out your phone. You're on the record. Or your lighters. Any metal. A cafe outside the Pegatron campus where people can get a bite to eat.Dejian Zeng Leswing: Did you like the food, and were you charged for it? Zeng: Yeah, we get charged for it, and it depends on what kind of food you choose. There are 5-yuan meals, 8-yuan meals. But that was inside the factories. There are also restaurants inside the campus that people generally go eat at after they finish their work. Sometimes, if you're working on day shift, then that was more expensive. That was like up to 20 yuan, something like that. Leswing: Was the food high-quality? Zeng: I wouldn't say that. The chicken that I get ... I never see the breasts or thigh. It's always the neck or certain parts that you can't identify. The chicken that I get ... I never see the breasts or thigh. It's always the neck or certain parts that you can't identify. So I wouldn't say that's a very good meal. But it keeps you full, and you're very hungry, so it keeps you full anyway. It's reasonable. Not very good, but you have no other choice. Leswing: Do you talk with people at lunch? Zeng: If you are eating with your friends, sometimes you do. A lot of people just eat by themselves. You go get your meal, and then you eat, because it's like if you can eat it faster, you get more sleep. After the lunch break, you work for two hours — two hours, and there is another 10 minutes in the middle of it. Leswing:And by this point, you've worked six hours. Zeng: After two more hours — and about eight hours total — working, then it depends on whether you need to do overtime or not. If you don't need to, you're off. Everybody is off. But generally, if you need to do overtime, it depends on if it's Monday to Thursday or it's Friday. Friday, only work two hours overtime. Monday to Thursday is 2.5 hours overtime work. And then you do one whole day, eight hours, on Saturday also. So total, the time workers spent in the factory is 12 hours, generally including the breaking times and lunchtime. Leswing: Does that also include you waiting in line to go through a metal detector and that kind of stuff? Zeng: Doesn't include. If you included those, you should include 30 minutes more. Leswing: All right. So you're done. It's 7:30 in the morning. What do you do? Zeng: I would generally go have another meal afterward. Then you take the shuttle bus, go back to your dorm, take a shower — if you're lucky, there is hot water. Sometimes there's no hot water or there's no water at all. After a shower ... people either go to internet cafe, play video games, watch videos, something like that, or you lay down, watch videos on your phone. Leswing: Pretty much everyone has a phone? Zeng: You have a phone. The dorms provide Wi-Fi. But to access the Wi-Fi, you need to do something. You need to either download some apps for them or click something — comments or something — to earn some virtual coins. You use the coins to get on the Wi-Fi. Twenty-four hours is 20 coins. And then downloading apps sometimes are like 20 to 30 coins or something. So is it you can buy coins — like I remember it's like 100 coins about 5 yuan, something like that. But a lot of people just keep downloading. It's like a business. You need to need to do that to get access to Wi-Fi. In that same platform that you earn coins, there are free videos still available. So I think there's something good, that workers can watch videos for free. I would like to go to bed about 10. You don't have a lot of time. You get very tired. And then most you can watch is one movie and then you really need to go to bed. And then the other day, you wake up at 6:30 again. And that's just a routine. Leswing: Did you have any friends? Zeng: I made friends with my roommates and also my coworkers on the same assembly line, but it's like the station around me, so we're sitting together. So those are very good friends. And I also made some friends at the first couple of days, when we do some training. But during the training, you are together. Later, you get distributed. Leswing: Your dorm roommates aren't going to be the same people. Zeng: No, we don't work on the same assembly or nearby, and sometimes we work on different shifts. So sometimes I never see my roommates for a month because we are on a different shift, and they shift it every month. Leswing: Do you know anyone there with a family? Zeng: Yeah, they are with their girlfriends or their wives. Sometimes they rent an apartment outside the campus. You can choose to do that, but it's very pricey. But if you have to, that's the only way. There are no dorm rooms there for a couple. Leswing: So when you were on the assembly line with you with your mates, what did you talk about? Zeng: That's where I find that the stereotypes about workers is not right. I had thought they [would be] uneducated. Wrong. They are talking about a lot of things. They talk about the China-US relationship, foreign relations in the South China Sea, because at that point there is news on that. Most talk about movies, horror movies, and then sometimes they talk about their lives. They need to support their families back in the rural area. They want to send their kids to do some dancing classes. So it's like being a parent kind of thing. And sometimes entertainment news, celebrities, all the things that young people talk about. And they know other things, they even talk about American history sometimes. Leswing: Did your coworkers like their jobs? Zeng: So I would say we don't like it and we don't hate it. We just consider it a job that can give us money. Nobody enjoys the process, because the purpose of getting to work is waiting to get out. The only thing that we're thinking about is really money, money, money. I need to get some money from my family, I need to support my life, support my kids. That's the only thing in their mind. Sometimes they don't even care how tired they are. Some workers have worked at different factories and think Pegatron has stricter management. You can't use your phone in their factory. You can't listen to music. Sometimes there are people walking around that don't allow you talk too loud. So some workers have a comparison and think Pegatron has stricter controls. That's something that gets them annoyed. Leswing: Is it a respected job? Is it a job that people go, "Oh, that's a decent way to earn a living"? Zeng: I don't think so. People working the factories are also working on becoming a security guard, deliveryman, housekeeper. So it's the same kind of level of position. You don't see it as better. I think the only way to look at the factory job is that you really keep people from being homeless. Because you need no skills, you just get into the factories. They don't even ask you any questions. During the interview, you can just get in that day. And then they take care of your meals and your dorm. So it's like if you really have nowhere to go, if you're in the city alone and have no relatives to support you, go to the factory. You might earn some money, a little bit, and then gradually you can get your life together. Leswing: Did anyone see it as a career? Zeng: I don't think people really see it as a career. The turnover rate is very high. It's very normal for workers to leave after two weeks or a month. Some workers get there and if they don't like it, they quit very quick. But some people can stick there longer. And after one year, you can get promoted to become the line manager. There are different structures. At the lowest level, you're an operator, and then you get into the multitask worker [position]. The third level is group leader, and then it's line manager. Then above is section manager, and then there's the division manager, and then there is the factory director. There are workers that can really move up this chain. But we think that, at most, you can become a line manager. But there are people who could get promoted by that chain, but not a lot of people can sustain that kind of life for that long time. And then the pattern of Chinese migrant workers is that they go out to the city and do jobs for a year, and then they quit, then they go back home to stay one month for a new year or something like that, and then go out or find another job. Leswing: Did your coworkers use Apple products? Zeng: Some workers have iPhones, but not very many because of the monthly wage. If they are affordable for workers, then they will buy Apple. But they are saying, "I really want that?" Can they save two months' wages to get an iPhone? They won't do that. The phones they generally use are Chinese productions like Oppo or something like that. Leswing: Do the people working there at Pegatron know they're assembling Apple products? Zeng: They know. We all know that we are assembling Apple products. We even know "this is the iPhone 6" or "this is the iPhone 7 that's coming out." Everybody knows. Leswing: So what did you know when production switched from the iPhone 6 to the iPhone 7? Did people know that this was an unreleased product? Was there additional security around it? Zeng: The controls gets more strict. They increased the sensitivity of the metal detectors. So you know some girls, they have bras? And so they couldn't pass the door because they had the metal in the bra. And so a lot of the girls had to change all of the sudden that day because they increased the sensitivity. And then you passed two security checks. There's a lot of security checks. Here's how it works: Our factory, when we got to working, they are already assembling the infrastructure of the assembly line. They have this curtain circling it so you can't even see how the infrastructure is, right? We were working at the same workshop, but there are people doing construction there. And then after they've finished construction and need to move people in, we were moved out and working in another building of the factories. And then they prepare everything, and everybody moved back in. And then producing iPhone 7 — at that point it was a trial production. That kind of experience is totally different from when we produced iPhone 6S because that's a whole day, and I consider it as torture. Because one day for 12 hours, you only produce five phones. You sit there and have nothing to do, waiting for two hours. Sometimes they don't allow you to speak. You just sit there quietly and have nothing to do, and wait until the next phone comes in. You're trying to assemble it, and then you put it back and you wait for another few hours for the next one to come in. When we were producing the iPhone 7, they have Apple staff there every single day to monitor the process. Because it's a new product, they want to see if there are new problems. The management of the factory becomes very, very careful. It needs to be very, very clean. All the case-holders need to be in the exact position of where they should be. The process changed a lot because it used to be just an assembly line. They made it a clean room — like they want to keep the dust out. So every time you get in, you need to have a roller to clean all the dust, and then you get it, and all of these procedures, you need to do that. Management is very careful, constantly walking around. You're not allowed to talk or sleep. When you don't talk and are just sitting there for a couple of hours, you get sleepy. I was falling asleep three times one day, and every time when the multitask workers, the assistants of the line manager, would walk out and would spot me sleeping, they would say, "No, no, no," and wake me up. The third time he caught me sleeping, he said, "You, stand up." And so I was standing next to the assembly line, not even allowed to sit. Leswing: Were you doing the same screw for the iPhone 7? Zeng: No. At the later part of producing the iPhone 6S, I was switched to another station called camera cowling. So they have a protector on top of the camera, and I need to have the cowling fastened. It also was putting in two screws so the camera would be where it is. Leswing: Cowling. That is a word I've never heard before! Zeng: There's a lot of terms. There's a lot of terms. Leswing: Do the factory workers — they obviously work for Pegatron — but do they think they work for Apple at some level? Zeng: They definitely know they are producing Apple products and consider themselves a part of that process. A classroom where workers are informed about safety and factory overtime rules.Dejian Jang Leswing: How did you know that there was Apple staff? Zeng: They tell you. They say, "The client is here." They call Apple "the client." Sometimes Apple staff comes to do an audit or something like that. They walk around the assembly line. They say, 'The client is here.' They call Apple 'the client.' Sometimes Apple staff comes to do an audit or something like that. They walk around the assembly line. They were always very serious about it, and we would be told, "The client is here." Leswing: Do people who work for Pegatron know the Apple story? Here in the United States, Apple is seen as one of the important companies, something that drives us. You know, there's this whole legend about Steve Jobs and its current CEO Tim Cook. Are they aware of that? Zeng: I don't think they understand Apple that much. I think the general concept is they know that Apple sells a lot of iPhones, that a lot of people consider it as something fancy. I think that's their understanding. It depends on the worker. Some workers I know are real tech fans. There's one worker who sat next to me, he was 18. He had just gotten out of high school and was trying to get into college after his summer job. He was a big fan of Apple, so he could talk a lot about Apple. Leswing: And did he think it was so cool that he was working on an iPhone that hadn't come out? Zeng: Yeah, people sometimes considered it as a very cool thing — typically when they were working on an iPhone 7 and know it's not yet out. Leswing: Overtime pay seems to be the big issue. It's the one China Labor Watch [an activist labor group that worked with Zeng] pushes — they had all these pay stubs, and it seems to be, you know, a quality-of-life issue. But it's also hard to explain. Zeng: Apple has really been following the rules. They do pay 1.5 times pay when overtime is during your workday, and they double it when it's on Saturday. All the payments are legit. I would say they're following the policy. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that Pegatron had 99% compliance with workers working under a 60-hour workweek, and Pegatron workers who make Apple products work for 43 hours per week on average.] But the overtime thing, from my experience, it's involuntary. You can't leave easily. And then every time you ask, "Can I leave?" they would just say, "You have to work on the assembly line." And so you know that every station needs to have somebody doing it. And if you leave, who is going to do it? It's not easy to ask to not do overtime. It's involuntary. I would say that's the issue. Workers don't have a choice. If I don't want to work, if I'm really tired today and I don't want to work, I can't do that. I think that's the issue. The overtime thing is also complicated because sometimes you hear about a worker who demands that "I want to work overtime. I want that money." But they are being pushed to that path because the base salary is just too low. I can't make a living without doing overtime, that's why I "volunteer," quote unquote, to do that. The factories know it also. The workers, too. They know that when you get into the factory, you need to do overtime to get your payment. Leswing: So when you say overtime, does that mean over 60 hours a week? Zeng: Over eight hours a day, that was overtime. Another thing is that when I was there, most of the time, it wasn't a busy season. A lot of the time shifts over 60 hours [a week] are when it's a busy season. After I left factories, they started a massive production of the iPhone 7. And I still have a connection with workers there. They said that they start working on Sunday. And one worker who I talked to said he had been working for 11 days straight. Leswing: Eleven days in a row? Zeng: Yeah, consistently for 11 days. It's obviously over 60 hours when you start working on Sunday also. So I think they have a different standard during busy season and not busy season. I don't know how the factory gets past the system where workers need to record their working time. Because when you go to work, you swipe your card. And my friend said they do swipe their cards when they work on Sunday. And I think it's an obvious violation of Apple policy. I don't know how the factory gets past that. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that it conducted 34 audits covering Pegatron workers, including 29 at facilities in China, including 16 at the ChangShou factory. Apple found 99% compliance with a 60-hour workweek.] Leswing: Did you notice any negative effects from people working too many hours besides just sleep. Zeng: I don't think you give workers enough time to do other stuff. The time left in your life is very, very limited. It's just a couple of hours. And then there's not much you can do. I consider that a problem. In the new report, they said a lot of workers get opportunities for training in some programs — they can develop their careers and stuff like that. But when you are working 12 hours, you are exhausted. And the only thing you want is some rest, and there's not enough time for that. Leswing: What if someone wanted to take a vacation? Zeng: My friend said that when it's busy season, you can't take it. They just don't allow it. And even if it's not a busy season, when you request it, they will ask, "So what are you doing?" But when it's not very busy, they sometimes grant it. I would say that the attitude is not very good. It's always like you are trying to make trouble for them, whether you're asking for overtime or to not work overtime or are asking for leave. They will have a very bad attitude towards you. Leswing: Who was your boss? Zeng: In the assembly line, the power structure is very clear. The person you receive direction from the most is your group leader. They give you demands. They are the ones who hold meetings after work to summarize today's performance. They are the ones who keep pushing you, saying, "We have 500 pieces left, keep working!" The person you receive direction from the most is your group leader. They give you demands. They are the ones who hold meetings after work to summarize today's performance. They are the ones who keep pushing you, saying, 'We have 500 pieces left, keep working!' The capacity of the whole campus, I think, is 100,000 [workers]. When I was there, there were about 70,000 workers. In Pegatron, they are building new buildings. They are expanding. Leswing: Why don't Pegatron workers unionize? I understand obviously China has a different union system than the United States. Zeng: There are a couple of reasons. As I mentioned, the only thing the worker thinks about is money. If unions can bring them money, they might want it. That's why in 2010 there was a big case in the Hainan auto factories. And then they had a big movement and requested, "We need to have a union, we need to have our own elections," and stuff like that. But in that movement, you see that once workers get their money back, when they got their wages increased, they didn't care about the union thing. "As long as I get my money back, I don't care." And the workers couldn't strike for seven days. These people need the money every single day. They can't afford to do a strike by themselves. Another thing is that I see there's no structure for being on strike or unionized. There's no leader. You need leadership for those people who go to the factories. They're just very, very ordinary people. You go to work, and then you work 12 hours, and then you get out. If there's nobody saying, "We need to do this stuff," then they just keep working. Another point to point out is that the turnover rate is just so high. People react to disappointment by walking out — "I just leave the factory. I hate this place. I just go. There's other factories and other jobs. I just go." So the high turnover rate plays a role. It's very hard for people to have that kind of unity. It's like, "I've worked with these people for a month, this guy is leaving tomorrow, and this guy arrived yesterday." Leswing: Are there any open secrets at Pegatron? Zeng: So we know that there are some stations on the assembly line where we know the jobs are easier than on other stations. There are some stations that you just need to put a sticker on. There are some positions — for example, doing trash recycling — you don't have nothing to do. You just sit around for a while there until there's some trash to pick up and classify. And so there are some stations that are easy, and those stations go to people the managers like. Sometimes they're girls. Most of the cases they go to girls, and the men are always doing the screwing. Yeah, it's always the screwing. Leswing: Is there anything that Pegatron knows is like a bright-red line, like underage workers? Zeng: I think they care about underage workers. I can see that they're doing stuff trying to control it. They are very careful about safety training. That's part of training they do well, but that's just about safety. They only do two days of training, and the focus is on safety. "We know that there are some stations on the assembly line where we know the jobs are easier than on other stations." Workers shortly after receiving their Pegatron-issued workwear.Dejian Zeng Leswing: What's the mobile platform called? Zeng: I only remember the Chinese one. It's called 掌知识 (Zhang Zhishi). It's an online platform where Apple uploads a lot of security trainings, sometimes about careers. Leswing: And it's uploaded by Apple? Zeng: I think they said that they developed this platform with Apple. Workers can log in to learn about the material. They scare you. The first day they said: "OK, everybody gets this QR code. Scan it on your phone and download this app. And if you don't download this app, you won't get distributed to the assembly line tomorrow." So everybody downloaded it, and sometimes when you're working on the assembly line, the manager would say, "Has everybody downloaded this? Remember you need to download this." After that second training, we got our clothes, our hats, our slippers — they're pink, and the hat is blue. The pants are blue, and then the slipper is dark. Leswing: And you only get one of those? Zeng: I only got one of those, so on the weekend you need to wash it. And sometimes people don't wash it for a whole week. You get sweaty. You get very stinky. Some peers get very stinky. But you only get one set — that's the thing. I only got one of those, so on the weekend you need to wash it. And sometimes people don't wash it for a whole week. You get sweaty. You get very stinky. Some peers get very stinky. But you only get one set — that's the thing. And you need to have the full set when you get into the factory. They're very, very strict about it. Here's one detail I remember: When the subfactory's leader comes, they say, "Listen, are you pregnant? Raise your hand." And then nobody did. And then he said, "If you think you are going to be too tired standing up, you can come up to me now." And he said, "If you are a student worker, if you are going to work here less than three months, please stand up." And then nobody stood up. The reason he did it is that if somebody stood up, they lost their job. Leswing: Oh, wow. Zeng: We also needed to get injections. We had to get vaccinated. But before we got vaccinated, they asked if you have any serious diseases or if you have something going on with your immune system, which was intended for HIV patients, please stand up. And he asked a few questions before we got the injections. I saw it as a violation of privacy because we were in a big room with more than 100 people. The fourth day we came back and did more training. Those trainings are more about Apple's standards. They said, "Here are a few things that our client cares about," including involuntary overtime and child workers. They listed the four or five core violations that Apple cares about. There's all kinds of different trainings, even about building personal relationships and how to manage your money — all kinds of things. But I could see that the training was required by Apple, because after that training we had to do a written test, and the answers were all from the trainings. We did a couple of tests because there are different trainings that are supposed to be done over several days. But we did them all at once and then took the exams. There's one exam that was very difficult. The first question was about translating terms from Chinese to English, and I didn't even understand some of the English. Leswing: Your English is fantastic though. Zeng: For the very hard test, they give you the answers and just said to write down what they told you. After all the tests, we have an evaluation on the training. They gave us an evaluation — "how did you feel about the training?" They are very careful with that piece of paper. They said: "Don't make any mistakes. We need this paper to be very clean with no modifications on it." It was a scale where one was the worst and five was the best. They said we could do four or five. And so everybody did four and five, and they submitted it. Another thing to mention is the bonded labor. I still say that there are contractors of the suppliers who are holding workers IDs. In Pegatron, the workers come in different ways. Some workers are directly recruited. Some are referred by a subcontractor — Pegatron has a relationship with them. When they refer people, if those people can work in Pegatron over 20 days, Pegatron pays a certain amount of money for that referral. So it's a huge business. All the stores nearby [the factories] are referral companies. I know all of the workers, some of my close friends are my roommates — they come from that kind of channel. They were recruited by the subcontractor. You need to give your ID to them. And then if you are able to stay in the factory over 20 days, you get 800 yuan or something. It's a huge amount for [the workers], but it's the one-time payment. So they get extra money by going that [referral] channel. It's a very complicated issue there. Leswing: But people do have their ID held by the agents, by the subcontractors. Do you think they're spotting all violations? Zeng: Pegatron has a survey system that accepts complaints from workers directly. That is a good system, but it has not been implemented in Pegatron factories, at least factories I worked at. They have a complaint system, but who is handling those complaints? A factory worker. So you are submitting complaints of the factory to the factory staff. I submitted my complaint saying that I had been forced to do overtime, I don't want to do that, but my manager didn't allow me to leave earlier. And they don't want me to file a complaint here. So I don't see the system there is working. But I would say that if Apple does have a system that is directly reporting to Apple, that might be better, like what they have in Foxconn. It's a very concrete recommendation to Apple. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that it has employees on the ground at Pegatron every day to support its operations in addition to monitoring whether the factory is complying with Apple's standards.] Workers bring their luggage to the dorms after registering at Pegatron.Dejian Zeng Leswing: Tell me about your first day at Pegatron. Zeng: You show up in front of the factories and see a lot of people waiting in line with their luggage. There's two members of the staff sitting at a table with their computer. You just walk up to them and they ask you for your ID, they swipe it and record it in their computer, and then, later on, they ask for your hand. They look at your hands to see whether they are intact, and then they ask you to recite the English alphabet. Leswing: Why? Zeng: Because you use English letters on the assembly line. For example, my station was called E26. Sometimes they need to use English letters. Leswing: Do most Chinese people know the English alphabet? Zeng: Some of them do. And if they really want to get this job, they will ask their peers to teach them. It's just 26 letters. Sometimes people get it wrong, but it's just a procedure. Even if you can barely finish it, they still let you in. After, people take your fingerprints, and then you need to do a physical examination. You pay 70 yuan for the physical examination. Leswing: You have to pay? What if you show up without money? Zeng: You borrow money from other people. They're looking for tattoos, blood, and other things. If your blood tests positive for HIV or you're pregnant, I don't think you're allowed. For pregnant people, I'm sure you're not allowed. For HIV, I'm not sure. The doctor was very explicit, even before we paid. They said, "Listen, if you are pregnant or if you have a tattoo over 10 centimeters, you're not allowed to get in the factory, so don't bother to do the physical examination." The next day, there's a lot of paperwork, for your bank account and stuff. And then we also need to do facial recognition because when you get inside the factories, they do facial recognition in addition to swiping your card. You record that information, and they prepare your ID card for you. On the third day, you start getting paid. After you sign the contracts, they start training you. Leswing: So what are the main safety things? Zeng: They let you know that if you are injured, you are able to go to the hospital and get reimbursed. So that was good. And they consider a lot of things to be "occupational injuries." For example, if you spill hot water when you are getting water from the fountain and then you get burned, they pay for it. If you break your leg when you are working downstairs inside the factories, they pay for it. And that's a good thing. After the safety training, there was another training about your salary. It was about overtime, about Social Security, and about the mobile, the union WeChat platform. So they covered all those things, but the speaker goes very, very quickly. I mean, I can tell he wasn't even in the mood to do it. I paid 100% attention trying to take notes, but I couldn't. It was too fast. The whole slideshow was finished in 20 minutes or something. Leswing: And that was about your money. Zeng: It's about my money! It's very important. It's about how I get paid. I learned about my overtime pay later on, on the mobile platform that had the slides on it. A worker community center with restaurants, computers to check hours and wages, and even a basketball court.Dejian Zeng Leswing: How much did you make for your six weeks there at Pegatron? Zeng: I stayed there for one and a half months, or six weeks. So one day they pay you monthly. So I get the first month is about 3100 yuan, so that's about $450. Leswing: Not enough to buy an iPhone. Zeng: Definitely not — and that is for a month's production. And then I get that half month, like 1500 yuan. Leswing: And do you think that was in line with your coworkers there? Zeng: Yeah, people are pretty much getting the same rate. But the number I'm giving to you is the base salary plus the overtime payment. [Editor's note: Apple told Business Insider that the base wage at Pegatron has increased more than 50% in the last five years and is higher than the Shanghai minimum wage.] The base salary is very low. The pay salary is 2320 yuan, which is set by the Shanghai city government. So that is just meeting the minimum wage. And then the over time, the payment is added on that. That minimum wage is the same for everyone around the city. They always meet the minimum wage required by law. Leswing: Here in the United States, we have President Trump now, and one of his big themes is bringing manufacturing back to the United States. Zeng: From the labor perspective, I don't think it's very realistic for bringing labor-intensive manufacturers into the US. Why I'm saying that — just think about wages. Chinese people are getting 2320 yuan, which is about $400 per month. How much are you going to pay for the US workers in terms of base salary? If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the US, I won't see it create a lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the US, I won't see it create a lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. The only reason why we do it is because the labor is even cheaper than the machine. Leswing: What would you recommend for an American, a European, a customer who is worried about these human issues, how can they create change? Zeng: This is a very tricky issue because I personally think a boycott or stopping the customers who are buying Apple products is not realistic. It's very hard to mobilize that much people to stop buying Apple. Talk more about it. You do more posting to your social media, and be aware that every day when you use your iPhone, just think that there are a lot of people working day and night to produce this kind of piece [he holds up his iPhone SE] right now you're using. There are human hands behind this. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile The one feature Samsung’s Galaxy S8 doesn’t have might delay the iPhone 8 Chris Smith @chris_writes April 12th, 2017 at 12:47 PM Share Tweet More and more reports seem to indicate that Apple’s iPhone 8 might not be available in stores this coming September, which is usually when new iPhones arrive. It seems like some of the novel features in Apple’s 2017 flagship also come with manufacturing issues that could be harder than expected to overcome. A new research note now says that one of the key iPhone 8 features that won’t be seen on any of the phone’s biggest rivals may actually be the reason Apple and its partners are having so much trouble setting up production. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a report seen by Apple Insider that Apple is dealing with yield issues for the iPhone 8’s Touch ID sensor. The analyst says that reports suggesting 3D sensing tech is what’s causing delays with the iPhone 8 are not accurate. “For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display — the current yield rate of Apple’s in-house AuthenTec solution remains low, and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors’ products,” the analyst wrote. A report said a few weeks ago that Samsung had similar plans for the Galaxy S8, but Synaptics wasn’t able to deliver its in-screen fingerprint scanning technology in time. That’s why the Galaxy S8’s back was redesigned to incorporate the fingerprint sensor next to the camera. Arcuri says that if Apple can’t solve the issues, it has only three options: ditch Touch ID altogether in favor of the new facial recognition capabilities in the phone (which would be an awful idea), move the Touch ID scanner to the back (still quite awful, but less awful), or delay the iPhone 8 launch. In the event Apple goes with the third option, the company would likely still unveil the iPhone 8 alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in September.

Apple hasn’t ever cut device support with a minor point update, and that holds true for iOS 10.3.2. iOS 10.3.2 includes support for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c The news started at Forbes with a report saying the beta version of iOS 10.3.2 is 64-bit only. Since the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c are 32-bit devices, that would preclude them from the update. Both phone models are included in Apple’s iOS 10 supported device list, and that hasn’t changed with any updates so far—including the recent 10.3.1 release. Apple’s developer site includes a restore image for both phone models related to the 10.3.2 beta, and that’s proof they aren’t getting the cold shoulder. In other words, iOS 10.3.2 runs on the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c, just like it does on newer model iPhones. We don’t know what’s coming in iOS 11 yet, but we’ll have a better idea come June when Apple previews it at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference. If Apple is dropping iOS support for the 5 and 5c, odds are that’s when we’ll find out.

The iPhone 8, (what could also be called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro or iPhone Edition,) is rumored to come with a an OLED screen display, a 3D-sensing camera and could do away with the home button. However, the new Touch ID is the feature causing the most trouble, analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company said in a note. Read: iPhone 8 Could Feature 'Smart Connector' For Wireless Charging, AR And VR Accessories "For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display— the current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products," Arcuri said citing his own supply chain field work. If Apple can’t fix the problem, Arcuri gave three solutions to fix the issues. The first would be to ditch Touch ID and rely completely on facial recognition. Another option would be to move the Touch ID to the back of the iPhone, although that wouldn't be user friendly, Arcuri pointed out. The third solution would be to delay production of the iPhone 8, but still announce the device this fall alongside the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus. Read: iPhone 8 Release Date Rumors: Pre-Orders Begin In September But Shipping Could Be Delayed, Report Says Other rumors have suggested problems with the iPhone 8’s 3D-sensing front camera. The iPhone 8 was rumored to have a delayed release date because key components being produced by STMicroelectronics in a factory in Crolles, France would not be ready for September. However, a research note from Barclays analysts said Apple will release the iPhone 8 this fall, but in limited quantities. In the recent note, Arcuri also didn’t believe the 3D sensors would cause a delay for the iPhone 8. Apple is expected to release the iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and iPhone 8 this September. Rumors suggest the three iPhones will come with True Tone display and the iPhone 8 will sport a Smart Connector for wireless charging and AR and VR accessories. The 10th anniversary smartphone could have a price tag higher than $1,000.

(AAPL) Stock Is Still a Top Buy AAPL stock has gained more than 20% year-to-date, and many fear a reversion. Here are three reasons that won't happen.

(CRM) Stock Is Hot, But Stay Away … For Now View All Posts Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gotten its groove back. For the year so far, AAPL stock has logged an impressive 22% gain, outpacing other tech heavyweights like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). Heck, Apple’s even edging out Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) at the moment. Granted, I’d understand if investors get cautious here. Apple, which sports a massive $743 billion market cap, will have a tough time mustering the buying power to continue its standout gains. There are other concerns, such as the political situation. Might the Trump’s Administration hawkishness on trade have an impact, especially in China? Or could a border tax make outsourcing more expensive? And what about the growing restrictions on immigration? A repatriation tax has been baked into AAPL stock, too, but it actually has to happen for Apple to wring any value out of it. These are all legitimate issues, but Apple still has many key advantages that should bolster returns. Today, we’ll look at three. There’s Still Value in AAPL Stock Apple stock still remains a decent bargain despite its outstanding run-up YTD. Right now, AAPL trades at just 14 times earnings, versus 21 for growthier Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), but even MSFT trades at 20x. Meanwhile, the average multiple for the S&P 500 is roughly 20. Apple has also attracted the attention of some of the world’s best value investors, including Joel Greenblatt’s Gotham Asset Management, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (NYSE:BRK.B) Warren Buffett. Apple certainly has enormous financial resources, which it can use to execute more buybacks or pump up its regular dividend, which right now yields just 1.6%. In talking about the Trump administration’s potential for a repatriation tax holiday, realize that likely would go toward a big stock repurchase program or a special dividend, but because it’s not consistent cash flow, that would be less likely to go toward raising the regular payout. Still, Apple has a lot of money to work with — roughly $245 billion in cash and investments. The iPhone Supercycle The fate of AAPL stock is ultimately tied strongest to the iPhone, which still produces 60% of the company’s sales. The good news is that the latest model — iPhone 8 is the most likely name — should soak up substantial demand. This is the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone, and Apple has made no bones about wanting this one to be a statement.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 'Amaranth Apple Festival' newest summer event for downtown Springfield Wednesday Apr 12, 2017 at 11:36 AM Apr 12, 2017 at 3:54 PM By Staff report The newest food-and-music festival in downtown Springfield takes its inspiration from famed author-poet and Springfield native Vachel Lindsay. Downtown Springfield Inc. announced Wednesday the Amaranth Apple Festival -- based on a mystical fruit from Lindsay's 1920 novel "The Golden Book of Springfield" -- is scheduled for July 14-15. At least 25 restaurants are expected to provide local signature dishes. The Amaranth Apple Festival, similar to the old Taste of Springfield, is intended to highlight the food, culture and history of the city, DSI executive director Lisa Clemmons Stott said in the announcement. The event is a successor to last year's Bacon Throwdown Festival. "We've always been looking to sprinkle the weird and wonderful downtown," said Clemmons Stott. "We've also been on a mission to remind Springfield why it has always loved its downtown." Downtown auto dealership Isringhausen Imports is the premier sponsor. Festival proceeds go toward DSI programs for revitalization of the downtown historic-commercial district. Clemmons Stott said a DSI board member suggested the connection to the Lindsay novel, which envisions a utopian Springfield set in 2018.The Amaranth Apple is portrayed as a source of appreciation for Springfield's beauty. Lindsay was born in the home-turned-state-historic-site at Fifth and Edwards street named for him. The Vachel Lindsay Association also is taking part in the festival. Recording and solo artist Matthew Sweet of Omaha, Nebraska -- best known for his role in the 1990s revival of American "power pop" and the song "Girlfriend" -- is the headliner for two days of music featuring acts from Springfield, Rockford, Detroit, Chicago and Nashville, Tennessee. Additional information, including on DSI plans for a Whiskey Lounge and a Wine Lounge, is available online.         About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Advertise With Us Contact Us Subscribe Place an Ad Commenting Rules Archives Marketplace Cars Homes Classifieds Newspaper Ads Sections News State Government Sports The Voice Local Entertainment Information Social Media Directory E-edition Today's Front Page Text Alerts Calendar Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Arcuri, citing his own "field work" within the supply chain, said the current yield of Apple's in-house AuthenTec-based fingerprint sensor solution is low, while noting that Apple seems unwilling to use an outside solution at this time. If Apple cannot resolve these yield issues, he sees three different scenarios: • Apple removes Touch ID from the 5.8-inch iPhone entirely and relies solely on facial/iris recognition. Arcuri said this is unlikely, as it's not secure enough, risky, and would potentially create issues with Apple Pay. • Apple puts Touch ID on the back of the 5.8-inch iPhone, but in a different place than the one on the Galaxy S8, which can be hard to reach. Arcuri said this would not be a user-friendly or optimal solution to say the least. • Apple delays production of the 5.8-inch iPhone, but still announces the device in early September alongside updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models.Arcuri said Apple is aiming to finalize its fingerprint sensor specification by May, but if its in-house AuthenTec-based solution is not feasible due to yield issues, mass production of the tentatively named "iPhone 8" could be delayed until September, compared to its usual late July to August timeframe. Arcuri still expects Apple to announce the 5.8-inch iPhone alongside updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models in September, but supplies may be extremely limited or unavailable whatsoever until later in the year. That timeline echoes recent predictions from Apple analyst Brian White and investment bank Barclays. It's also a scenario that has occurred with nearly every previous iPhone launch. Last year, the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black was a highly popular model among customers, and shipping estimates for online orders quickly slipped to several weeks out. It wasn't until around November that it became more widely available. The device, which has also been called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro, or iPhone Edition, is expected to feature a new glass and stainless steel design, wireless charging, longer battery life, a new front-facing camera with 3D sensing capabilities, and improved water resistance. It also won't have a physical Home button. Touch ID-related yield issues may be the reason why 5.8-inch iPhone components and schematics have yet to leak from the supply chain. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus parts began to leak around March last year. Cowen and Company maintains an "outperform" rating for AAPL with a $155 price target.

Rating: 18 Votes busyscott 14 hours ago at 09:46 am Well, on the bright side, I'm fairly certain at this point that MacRumors could just put up one blog that says, "Everything is delayed" and take the rest of the year off.

It's being called the Samsung Galaxy iPhone S8. Really, the Galaxy S8 has a fingerprint reader below the screen? I thought they pulled a classic Samsung with the design and put it next to the camera on the back so that you're bound to leave smudges on the lens. Rating: 14 Votes Dave245 14 hours ago at 09:50 am Please don't put Touch ID on the back of the iPhone. If they can't put it in the screen they should just delay it until they get it right. Rating: 13 Votes Rogifan 14 hours ago at 09:54 am Nothing wrong with putting the Touch ID Sensor on the back of the phone. It may not be convenient since you need to pick up a phone off a table or desk, but the emphasis is being put on facial/Iris detection. As long as the sensor is always on and doesn't need an active backlit screen to activate, it should be fine. I'll take bezels over Touch ID sensor on the back of the phone. If they move it to the back them I'll keep my current iPhone.

Will it stick with a design similar to the current cylinder, aka the trash can? Or perhaps it will return to a more classic Mac tower or box design, or something new entirely, in order to accommodate the machine’s so-called “modular” design that will allow easy upgrades for key components. Imagining the possibilities, the folks over at Curved.de put together the concept below. The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac The concept takes a form-factor somewhere between the Mac mini and a smaller version of Apple’s old “cheese grater” Mac Pro design. The box includes side doors that can swivel and rotate to open, 2 slots for full-size graphics cards, replaceable hard disks and SSD drives, and, well… a slot for replacing just about everything. There aren’t a ton of specifics or suggestions on how this would be achieved in such a box, but we can only dream that Apple is reaching for something similar when it said “modular.” The concept also has an SD card on the front, and USB-C, USB, FireWire, LAN, and HDMI on the back. We’re not sure the integrated Touch Bar on the front of the machine makes a lot of sense, but Apple’s new iMac coming later this year is said to include a new keyboard and we’d love to see the touch screen come to a standalone Apple keyboard like the company detailed in a recent patent. To go along with its vision of what a new modular Mac Pro might deliver, Curved also imagines what a new Apple Display could look like. Apple confirmed this month that it will return to making external displays alongside the new modular Mac Pro. That news came after reports that Apple was exiting the standalone display business following its decision to promote LG-made displays as official options for its new MacBook Pro.

When he started, Zeng was in charge of connecting iPhone 6s speakers to the back case and putting one screw in to hold it in place for more than 12 hours a day (including overtime). Two-hour stretches of work were punctuated by 10 minute breaks where many people try to catch any sleep they can, sometimes choosing to close their eyes over going to the bathroom for a drink of water. “It becomes a struggle when you’re very sleepy but also you need to drink some water,” Zeng said. “You can only do one thing. It’s just go to the restroom or come back and take some sleep.” The 50-minute lunch break in the middle of the day is also a popular time to sleep, with employees flocking to sofas scattered through a lounge area. But the factory has its own peculiar protocols for these naps as well, mandating that employees are allowed to sleep, but not allowed to lay down. “There are people walking around. If they see you lay down, they will swipe the ID and take a record of it,” Zeng said. “And they put the record in your profile. And then they will publish it to your whole assembly line, so your manager would come and yell at you later. Sometimes if it happens multiple times, they deduct money.” Pegatron is stricter than some other Chinese manufacturers, not allowing employees to bring a phone into the plant, listen to music or even talk too loud. Controls became even stricter when the factory shifted to producing the then-unreleased iPhone 7, with more security checks and increased metal detector sensitivity that even picked up the metal wire in female employees’ bras. Zeng said the trial production of the new model was “torture,” spending 12-hour days producing five iPhones. “You sit there and have nothing to do, waiting for two hours. Sometimes they don’t allow you to speak,” Zeng said. “You just sit there quietly and have nothing to do, and wait until the next phone comes in. You’re trying to assemble it, and then you put it back and you wait for another few hours for the next one to come in.” During the early production of a new model, Apple staff is on-site every day, and the factory managers become much more careful. The facility goes from a standard assembly line to a clean room, with employees expected to use a roller to take the dust off their clothes before going inside. When Apple employees walk the floor, management puts everyone on high alert. “They say, ‘The client is here.’ They call Apple ‘the client’” Zeng said. While Apple claims ” Pegatron had 99% compliance with workers working under a 60-hour workweek, and Pegatron workers who make Apple products work for 43 hours per week on average,” Zeng said in his experience overtime work was only voluntary in the loosest sense of the word. “You can’t leave easily. And then every time you ask, ‘Can I leave?’ they would just say, ‘You have to work on the assembly line.’ And so you know that every station needs to have somebody doing it. And if you leave, who is going to do it?” Zeng said. “It’s not easy to ask to not do overtime. It’s involuntary. I would say that’s the issue. Workers don’t have a choice. If I don’t want to work, if I’m really tired today and I don’t want to work, I can’t do that.” When iPhone 7 production ramped up after he left, Zeng’s contacts still working at the factory told him they even began working on Sunday, with one man working for 11 days straight. “I don’t know how the factory gets past the system where workers need to record their working time. Because when you go to work, you swipe your card. And my friend said they do swipe their cards when they work on Sunday. And I think it’s an obvious violation of Apple policy,” Zeng said. After the work day is done, employees take the shuttle back to company dorms and hope there’s hot water (or any water at all) for a shower. After that, employees can sped some down time in an internet cafe, watch TV or play video games. If they want to use the internet on their phones, though, there are some other rules. “The dorms provide Wi-Fi. But to access the Wi-Fi, you need to do something,” Zeng said. “You need to either download some apps for them or click something — comments or something — to earn some virtual coins.” Vacation is also available in theory, but in practice requesting time off is difficult at best. Time off isn’t approved at all during peak production season, and even in the down times asking for a vacation is frowned upon. “It’s always like you are trying to make trouble for them, whether you’re asking for overtime or to not work overtime or are asking for leave.,” Zeng said. “They will have a very bad attitude towards you.” Zeng said safety training is a primary focus when people are hired, with downloading an Apple-created app about safety a primary requirement for starting your job. Management also makes periodic visits to the floor to ask questions of their employees, like if they’re pregnant, if they’re exhausted or if they’re students who are working for a short period of time. But he never saw anyone stand up in response to these questions for one simple reason. “The reason he did it is that if somebody stood up, they lost their job,” Zeng said.

"For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display— the current yield rate of Apple's in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and AAPL seems unwilling to use other vendors' products," Arcuri wrote. If Apple is unable to resolve yield issues there are three possible courses of action, suggests Arcuri. First, Apple could ditch Touch ID in favor of facial recognition. Second, Apple could move Touch ID to the back of the smartphone. Finally, production could be delayed but the iPhone 8 could still be announced alongside the iPhone 7s. Arcuri does not believe that there will be any delays related to the 3D sensor. t's widely expected that the 10th anniversary iPhone will be a massive update. It will purportedly have a chassis made of reinforced glass with a stainless steel metal frame and an edge-to-edge display that has no bezels on the top and bottom. Additionally, the front camera, Touch ID, speaker, and other sensors will apparently be embedded into the display. Another report claims that the device would be a clear piece of glass with a next-generation OLED screen. The 5.8-inch screen is said to feature a main 5.15-inch display area with a reserved 'function area' below for virtual buttons. The device may use a stacked logic board design freeing up space for a larger battery pack. More recently, Apple is said to be equipping the phone with wireless charging, an iris scanner or face scanner, and a 3D camera.

[via AppleInsider] Follow iClarified Comments (1) Add Comment Rain Man - 7 hours ago My guess Apple will chicken out and just make the iPhone 8 look like the 7 but with less bezels. Still have its home button and my guess is they also keep the aluminum back.

Analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, however, contends that iPhone 8’s rumored in-screen Touch ID sensor remains its biggest bottleneck. Arcuri’s note issued to investors Wednesday mentions poor yields for iPhone 8’s Touch ID, suggesting Apple might even change the design of the handset if its in-screen fingerprint reader cannot be produced in volume in time for a fall launch. “For the 5.8-inch OLED version, the biggest bottleneck remains integrating an under-glass fingerprint sensor into the display. The current yield rate of Apple’s in-house AuthenTec solution remains low and Apple seems unwilling to use other vendors’ products,” reads the research note. Apple is highly unlikely to tweak iPhone 8’s design this late in the game. It’s been well accepted that Apple’s engineers want to create a nearly full-screen iPhone, which would require putting a fingerprint reader, along with other sensors and components, behind the display in order to create a seamless bezel-less front. I also don’t think they’re likely to ditch Touch ID and rely solely on facial recognition, as Arcuri suggested. What if Apple instead moved Touch ID to the backside of the phone, like Samsung did for the Galaxy S8 series? I don’t think such a solution would fly with iPhone fans either. Instead, Apple will likely pre-announce iPhone 8 alongside the iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus updates this fall while delaying production of the OLED handset. iPhone 8 concept via Martin Hajek for German magazine Computer Bild Source: AppleInsider Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend KGI: iPhone 8’s FaceTime camera to support 3D sensing, AR, biometric authentication & more DigiTimes: iPhone 8 with in-screen fingerprint sensor entering mass production in September UBS: Apple has 1,000 engineers working on augmented reality, tech to debut in iPhone 8 iPhone 8 predicted to have 3 GB RAM and come in 64GB and 256GB flavors Related Topics Analyst, Analysts, Apple, Fingerprint Sensor, iPhone, iPhone 8, News, Rumors, Touch ID Abhijeet Gupta Please no sensor on the back.

With the iPhone 8, otherwise known as or code-named iPhone X, Apple may show that they’re not simply holding back features from power users – they’ve just been lying in wait. Apple Pencil This smartphone might be the first to incorporate Apple’s Pencil device. This might – possibly – happen even though the Apple Pencil is clearly a size meant for larger devices. Apple has seen the image Samsung has made with the Galaxy Note series – the S Pen included with the Galaxy Note is an integral part of what makes it look and feel like a premium work-friendly device. It’s clear that fallout from the fires in the Galaxy Note 7 are not stopping consumers from buying Samsung smartphones. The leap in sales for the Galaxy S8 this year suggest that the Galaxy Note 8 will be a monstrous success. Apple’s strategy with the Apple Pencil recognizes the lack of love consumers have for all-in-one devices. That is the perception that if a speaker, for example, is sold separate from a television, it’ll automatically be of a higher quality than anything the television can offer. As the Apple Pencil is sold separate from the iPad Pro, it’s perceived as higher quality than anything Samsung or Microsoft (Surface devices) can offer. I would not be shocked to find that Apple presents an iPhone X with compatibility for the Apple Pencil (or a new Apple Pencil 2017 model) later this year. Creating a perception of expandability with this device is right in line with the strategy Apple’s run with on the iPad pro and the Apple Watch, too. Curved OLED Display As you’ll see in the early renderings above and/or below, this iPhone 8 does not necessarily have a curved display. Not in the way we’ve come to expect with devices like the Galaxy S8. Instead, rumors of slightly flexible OLED display technology coming to Apple’s hardware will probably have more to do with internal fittings. The display glass, on the other hand, will create the perception that this iPhone 8 / iPhone X has a curved-edge display – more curved than ever before. But since there’s no real benefit to having a curved display – at least, not one that Samsung has shown yet, there’s little reason to make the same move on iPhone 8. Unless Apple has a secret plan that they’re holding back while they leak schematics for case-makers. Of course, that might cause havoc amongst those very early case-makers who put extra heavy borders on the left and right of the display. Any way we look at it, Apple’s move to a curved-edge display on an iPhone 8 would be for aesthetic purposes only. Features for devices made by Apple generally require both form and function to appear in a final product. A few early specs The images above and below come in part from renderer and leaker Benjamin Geskin, posted to iDrop News. It’s through this set of renderings that we’re to understand that this device will not have an “edge-to-edge” display – it wont go right up to the end of the device with no border in-between. In addition, a number of leaked specifications have created an interesting picture well before release: iPhone 8 / iPhone X Specifications (Unofficial) • Display: 18.5:9 ratio 5.8-inch OLED display • Processor: Apple A11 (possibly) • RAM: 4GB • Internal Storage: 128/256GB • Camera: At least Dual 12 MP, (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, quad-LED (dual tone) flash • Front-Camera: At least 7 MP, f/2.2, 32mm, 1080p@30fps, 720p@240fps, face detection, HDR, panorama • Battery: At least 2900mAh • Connectivity: Lightning connector, Bluetooth 4.2 (or 5), Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, nanoSIM, NFC, Smart Connector (like iPad Pro) • Additional: Touch ID Scanner, IP67 water/dust resistance, Wireless Charging This set of specs, along with a size at around 150mm tall and 73mm wide without a display that curves down the edges would require a more traditional solution. Instead of moving the edges out, the top and bottom move up and down. This iPhone would have a new aspect ratio at 18.5:9 – with smaller bezels above and below than ever before. The bezel sizes at the left and the right are expected to stay the same as they have been in the past. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Specifications (Official) • Display: 6.2-inch Super AMOLED Quad HD+ display (2960×1440, 529ppi) • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor — Octa core (2.3GHz Quad + 1.7GHz Quad), 64 bit, 10 nm process / for Global versions: Samsung Exynos 8895 processor — Octa core (2.35GHz Quad + 1.9GHz Quad), 64 bit, 10 nm process • RAM: 4GB • Internal Storage: 64GB USA / 64/128GB China • Camera: 12 MP, f/1.7, 26mm, phase detection autofocus, OIS, LED flash • Front-Camera: 8 MP, f/1.7, autofocus, 1440p@30fps, dual video call, Auto HDR • Battery: 3500mAh • Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 5, Wi-Fi, 4G LTE, 3G, nanoSIM, NFC • Additional: Fingerprint Scanner, Iris Scanner, IP68 water/dust resistance, Wireless Charging Above you’ll see the official specifications for the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. Based on the historical release schedule and spec-matching Samsung’s presented over the past year, this should be a decent look at what’s possible for the Galaxy Note 8. Expect – perhaps – a slightly more powerful processor, and a more advanced S Pen inside, too. What a weird-looking camera array Both the front and the back of this phone appears – in these renderings based on leaks – to be going vertical. While previous iterations of double-camera setups on smartphones have been either horizontal or sort of… odd looking… this rendering shows how Apple could make it look sleek. We have very little information on the camera setup either front or back – everything you see in the specs above is conjecture for the cameras. That’s just suggesting that they’ll be at least as good as the iPhone 7 Plus – which of course they need to be. If the Smart Connector makes its way to the final product, I would not be surprised to see at least one Apple-made case that connects to the three pins and benefits the camera. Wrap-up Have a peek at a creative article I wrote earlier this year called How to present an iPhone Pro. There I’ve laid out one way in which Apple could make this Pro presentation happen. Another good place to wrap one’s mind around the possibility that Apple could eventually create an iPhone Pro comes from the article Apple’s road to iPhone Pro – there I’ve tapped into the possibility of the Apple Pencil coming to iPhone for the first time.

United Airlines deserves the abuse, but from who? Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock By Lance Ulanoff2017-04-12 15:57:36 UTC Good one, Qatar Airways, you’ve “united” …*snicker*... to accommodate passengers and your app “Doesn’t support drag and drop.” You are hilarious.  Congratulations on your tweet. It means the United Airlines trolling has officially jumped the shark.  SEE ALSO: People are trolling United Airlines with these brutal new slogans I get it. When United dragged a passenger literally kicking and screaming off one of its flights, it screwed up, big time. It couldn’t even get its myriad non-apology apologies right. It deserves to be dragged and trolled. And it has been, gloriously. Qatar Airways, based in Qatar, which sits between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, has expanded internationally in recent years (it has 150 global destinations) and is trying to compete with big boy airlines like United Airlines any way it can. We’re united in our goal to always accommodate our passengers, even with our app updates. pic.twitter.com/1K3q76qOp6 — Qatar Airways (@qatarairways) April 12, 2017 It’s digital, the app is real. However, the app update in the tweet Qatar sent out on Wednesday may be some clever Photoshop work. And, oh yes, Qatar is being clever, and using United Airline’s monumental mistake to toot its own horn and promote a big announcement on April 24.  Seriously? Trolling United and self-promotion all in one icky tweet? Obviously, Qatar is just doing a bit of piling on. I mean, everyone is trolling United and some expertly so. The best of them, though, are from regular people, commentators, and comedians like Jimmy Kimmel. Should another airline really be joining in? What if tomorrow, someone gets dragged off a Qatar Airways flight, or worse? I keep thinking of another airline, Qantas, that quietly operated for decades without a plane crash. No airline would be insensitive enough to troll another airline for a tragedy like that, but Qantas was also smart enough to never explicitly tout its own safety record. I think most people were unaware of it until the 1988 movie Rain Man, where Dustin Hoffman's autistic character refused to fly any other airline than Qantas because it “never crashed.” Point is, brands should always hesitate to point out competing brands failures on the off chance that they suffer the same fate. When some Samsung’s Galaxy Note7 smartphones blew up last year, not a single other handset manufacturer talked opening about it. Chief competitor Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, never publicly mentioned it.  Clearly, they could have. Apple could have created a funny TV ad, tweet or even made an offhand quip on stage while launching the Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. They didn’t because it would not have helped Apple. You might think that’s remarkable after Samsung trolled Apple during the Note7 launch for dropping the 3.5 mm jack from smartphones, while the ill-fated Note7 still had it. But it’s not, because it’s fine to troll a competitor on feature differences and controversies surrounding explicit product decisions (like the headphone jack). A violent incident that is more anomaly than service is not, for a competitor, troll-worthy If there is a finite amount of good will for any market or brand category to go around, then United Airlines lost most of it on April 10. No other airline had to do anything to collect it. They gather it up simply by not being United.  Qatar Airways straining itself to be funny at United’s expense and blatantly promoting an upcoming announcement probably drains away some of that free goodwill and shifts it to other, silent airline competitors. I’m not arguing that there is no moment when brands can’t engage in public discussions, but they are always riding a razor's edge. On one side is recognition of humanity and cleverness and the other is another blade that will cut them as deeply as if they were the ones at the center of a typically negative national fascination. When the lights unexpectedly shut off during the 2013 Super Bowl, Oreo Cookies executed an amazing instant reaction tweet that was both on-brand and incredible funny. It was human and smart. Surely there was a risk in doing this. What if someone had been hurt when the lights turned off? No one was and instead we all watched our TV screens with fascination and wondered, “What the hell is going on?” Oreo reminded us “We can still dunk in the dark.” At that moment, Oreo was us and it won the brand Olympics for instant reactions.  Qatar Airways' tweet comes days and many smart and funny reactions after the United Airlines incident. It’s not a reaction, it’s a calculation and a poor one at that.  The only good thing to come out of it is that, at least I hope, everyone knows that United “Drag and Drop” hot takes and trolling have jumped the shark.

We explain how to back up that data and then reset your iOS device to factory settings. Wipe your iPhone or iPad and remove all personal data By Jim Martin | 12 Apr 17 Whether you're selling your iPhone or taking it for repair you should reset it to delete your accounts - including your Apple ID, Facebook, ebay, email and other accounts - and remove all your content including apps, photos and music. Here's how to reset an iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to factory settings. See also: How to set any song as your iPhone ringtone How to reset iPhone or iPad: Summary Reset an iPhone or iPad using Settings, General, Reset, Erase all content and settings. You will be prompted to enter your passcode and Apple ID before the process completes. How to soft reset an iPhone or iPad If your phone has locked up and you just want to restart it but none of the buttons work, then hold the power button and home button down at the same time until the device turns off and you see the Apple logo. Then let go and your phone or iPad will be back to normal. How to back up an iPhone Even if you use iCloud, it's sensible to make a full backup by connecting your iPad or iPhone to your computer, unlocking it, waiting for it to show up in iTunes, and then clicking on it in the left-hand pane. It should open the Summary screen, where you'll see a Backups section. Simply click the Back Up Now button. (Check the Encrypt iPhone backup box if you want all your passwords to be saved.) How to reset an iPhone Once that's done, you can begin the reset proces. It's also worth remembering to remove your SIM card before you pass on the iPhone or iPad on, as this may have information stored on it, and you might want to continue using it in a new phone or tablet. Here we've used an iPhone running iOS 9 but it's exactly the same on an iPad and a very similar process in older versions. Step 1. Tap Settings, then General. Scroll down until you see Reset. (In iOS 9 you can also pull down in Settings and search for Reset.) Step 2. Tap Erase All Content and Settings. Depending on whether you've set a Passcode and / or a Restrictions Passcode (they are different) you might have to enter that code or password in order to erase and reset it. There is no way to reset the device unless you enter the code(s). Step 3. Now you will have to enter your Apple ID password. This is so the account can be removed from your device, and Find My iPhone can be switched off. If you merely restore an iPhone via iTunes, you'll be asked to enter the Apple ID and password when it reboots. Resetting it using the method we're describing here will prevent the iPhone asking for an Apple ID when it restarts. Step 4. The reset process can take a minute or two, after which you'll see the welcome screen asking you to swipe to continue. It's then ready to be sold on or taken to an Apple Store for repair.

They store. Why? Because consumers are frugal here. They feel streaming, re-streaming movies or music is a waste — of time, money, data and so on. Little wonder then that the streaming industry is a suitably fledgling one in this price-sensitive market. In 2015, shows an estimate, nearly three crore people streamed music in this billion-plus-populace market. But not anymore, it seems. Broadband is exploding, thanks to new, daring ISPs and falling data tariffs and copyright battles are prompting many users to download legit, high quality music. And the industry hopes about 30 crore people would stream music in India by 2020. Enter the Big G It’s in this backdrop that one must look at and listen to the recently launched Google Play Music online service and see how it fares against rivals such as Apple Music, Gaana, Saavn and Jio Music. To start with, Google Music is a low-cost, high quality affair as it offers an introductory tariff of ₹89 a month (₹99 after the first month). Of course, there is a free-trial period of 30 days as well (Apple has a 90-day trial time). The interface looks surprisingly cluttered and confusing. You’ll need some fine-tuning to get used to the homepage and the library. But savvy users may have felt the same when they started negotiating Apple Music. Google allows you to stream in high quality — 320kbps, tad better than Apple Music’s 256 kbps. For the audio puritans, this may seem a happy plus. You can adjust audio quality in the settings. And what’s cool-er is that you can cast the music to a Chromecast-enabled TVs or similar devices The collection of music is quite good, even though it’s not complete. Regional languages, especially Malayalam, Tamil, which we have tested, are well represented. Even some rare vintage tracks are available for streaming. That said, this is a job in-progress, and finding your favourite tracks is a pain; Google needs to really wring its algos here to make it hassle-free. Synching AI One feels Google could have employed more artificial intelligence (AI) into developing this online music store. Music ‘curation’ could have had tad more intelligence because ‘suggestions’ based on tracks you are listening to seems to be in need of improvement. One can hope the algorithms will get perfected as we move on. Also missing is a cloud-enabled seamless synching faculty for the same account across multi-devices. Interestingly, Google Music is linked to YouTube and your searches instantly fetch video results from YouTube as well. But the videos cannot be played when your screen is off. That’s one annoying issue YouTube should sort out, not just for making Google Music better, but for its own sake. We didn’t find a lyric button in the dropdown menu along with the tracks. This is an important tool in a third-world market. Hope Google will add that in one of the updates. Several music player software, especially the ones in the Linux environment, nowadays offer this facility and Google can easily sew it into the service. In sum, Google Music enters India at a time when the streaming infrastructure is getting robust and it can surely benefit from this. If it can improvise and enhance its repertoire and pour in more AI into the service and keep it cost-effective, Google Music can soon strike the right chord with music buff in India. So, as they say, watch this space.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Galaxy S8 vs. original Galaxy S: From copying the iPhone to outpacing it Chris Smith @chris_writes April 12th, 2017 at 11:15 AM Share Tweet Apple announced the iPhone in 2007, and it soon became clear to Samsung that the iPhone was the device to replicate to succeed in the mobile business. The company has often been accused of copying everything about the iPhone with its Galaxy S phones. Lawsuits between the two revealed that “books” were written at Samsung about how to copy the iPhone, but this didn’t stop the huge conglomerate from continuing to get inspiration from Apple’s mobile creations. However, Samsung significantly improved its design game in recent years, and the Galaxy S8 is a culmination of those efforts. A comparison between the original Galaxy S and the Galaxy S8 shows how far we’ve come in just a few short years. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 The Galaxy S8 is probably the best-looking smartphone out there right now, thanks to its gorgeous Infinity Display and its curved design. The iPhone 8 is expected to feature a similar design, a rumor that actually predates all Galaxy S8 leaks — so in a way, Samsung already had a hunch this was going to be the next mobile design trend. The original Galaxy S was probably one of the best iPhone alternatives back in 2010, and it was the handset that helped Samsung conquer the smartphone business in the years that followed. Today, the Galaxy S is definitely not the phone you want to carry in your pocket, especially considering what 2017 smartphones can do. YouTube channel EverythingApplePro created a thorough comparison between the Galaxy S8 and the original Galaxy S that shows Samsung’s incredible progress over the years, and it’s a pretty fascinating video.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile iPhone 7 Home Button, if Damaged, Cannot Be Repaired and Requires Recalibration – Apple Limiting Options? By Omar Sohail Apr 9, 2017 10Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has been criticized incessantly for blocking 3rd-party repairs on its current-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus such as replacing the display. Now, according to a new experiment, the company has taken it to the next level. Using its software, Apple is taking extreme measures to make sure that the iPhone 7 becomes unrepairable and if you happen to damage one and it requires immediate replacement, it is mandatory that you take a trip to the nearest Apple Store. Swapping the Existing Home Button With Another One Present on a Different iPhone 7 Handset Will Still Disable Touch ID – Apple Locking Out Repair Flexibility? In a video compiled by Michael Oberdick, it is shown two iPhone 7 models with their displays damaged, prompting the replacements of their respective components. The only problem with this approach is that if the process is not carried out by a qualified Apple Store employee, Touch ID is going to be disabled on your phone. The person who has initiated the repair process narrates that even if you swap the damaged iPhone 7 home button with a brand new one taken from a different iPhone 7, the software will lock out Touch ID. Related Can Galaxy S8 Take Down Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus in the Latest Speed Test? This is happening because if you recall, the home button is not an actual button that functions mechanically. If delivers haptic feedback to the user to simulate a real button press (thus giving Apple more control over the software) and if you have accidentally damaged it, then you will have to take it down to the nearest Apple Store. This is where the home button is going to have to be recalibrated by a qualified Apple employee. In the company’s defense, it states that it wants dexterous and capable individuals carrying out the repair or replacement procedure, while some might argue that the tech giant is looking to limit options for the consumer to make a quick buck. Another example of this can be spoken off when talking about the removal of the headphone jack. Advertisement In this manner, Apple will be able to earn more royalties from 3rd-party manufacturers wanting to manufacturer Lightning headphones or earphones, which is a smart business decision, but it is not always convenient for the end-user. What are your thoughts on Apple’s move to limit repairability options for users if their iPhone 7 home button gets damaged? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike Yesterday AAPL: 141.80 0.17 Analyst: iPhone 8 fingerprint sensor integrated into screen facing low production yields, Apple may change design Benjamin Mayo - Apr. 12th 2017 7:52 am PT @bzamayo iPhone 7 iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit According to one analyst, Apple is facing a significant bottleneck in the production of the bezel-less iPhone 8. As the device’s front is expected to be mostly screen (and almost no bezel), the Touch ID sensor is being re-engineered. Cowen and Company’s Timothy Arcuri is claiming that yields of a new fingerprint sensor that would be integrated into the iPhone 8 screen are low (via AppleInsider) and that Apple may consider other less-exciting designs if the production problems cannot be solved. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here Rumors suggest Apple will debut three new iPhone devices in 2017. One device is purported to be a major radical redesign, featuring a 5.8 inch OLED display, larger battery, 3D camera, wireless charging, and bezel-less front, plus two iterative updates that retain the same chassis as the current iPhone 7 series. The OLED iPhone has been rumored to cost in excess of $1000 — and offered in 64 GB and 256 GB configurations. With no bezels, Apple would ideally integrate the fingerprint sensor of the 5.8-inch iPhone 8 into the display itself; this is the most magical solution. The analyst says Apple is trying to do just that, using an under-glass fingerprint sensor based on Apple’s AuthenTec technology. However, there are currently yield issues with these components. If Apple cannot fix the production bottleneck, Arcuri says it will have to consider using an alternative iPhone 8 design. He offers three alternatives. Apple could ditch the fingerprint sensor entirely and rely solely on face recognition for biometric authentication. Arcuri says this is not the most unlikely option as face recognition is novel, new and not developed enough to be the only biometric mechanism. The company could also decide to use a less-futuristic design where the fingerprint sensor is simply moved to the back of the phone. This has actually been rumored before: it would basically mean the current Touch ID sensor is moved from the front of the device to just below the Apple logo on the back. Finally, Apple could delay the launch of the phone until it can fix the production problems. There have been several reports about the iPhone 8 launching later than September, so this is not completely unsubstantiated. Obviously, Apple is trying to bring the best it can to market, the most elegant solution being the fingerprint sensor integrated into the display. Whether the company will be able to overcome the yield problem is yet to be seen. In general, the analyst report makes it sound like the design of the iPhone has not been finalized and is yet to enter full-scale production. This would explain why we are yet to see the cavalcade of schematics and case leaks that are usually all over the web by this time in the cycle. Apple’s radical new iPhone 8 is expected to be unveiled in the fall, alongside two iterative iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models.

Arcuri has long maintained that Wall Street's estimates for Apple's next iPhone are "way too low," accounting for projected sales of both new iPhones and the iPhone 7 series in September through December. But a resurgence in China would be an especially crucial boost to the company. This time last year, Apple missed Wall Street's earnings expectations, due largely to a 26 percent decline in sales in Greater China. Major regional shopping hub Hong Kong has been plagued by the strong dollar, and the company faces an upswing in competition from local brands like Huawei,Oppoand BBK. To be sure, Apple is tight-lipped about its plans for future products, and typically doesn't comment on speculation. But Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in October that he is "very bullish on China" long term. Despite a customer base that's primed to buy, Arcuri said that Apple still has some issues left unresolved with the upcoming phone. Apple may be trying to integrate a Touch ID sensor into a new type of OLED display, a feat that remains challenging, Arcuri wrote. That could delay the shipments of the phones, which have long been launched at events in September. "The goal continues to be finalization of fingerprint sensor spec by May, but if the internal solution is not workable, assembly of this OLED version could be slightly postponed to Sept vs. the normal late July to August timeframe which would effectively delay shipment (although launch would still come in early Sept)," Arcuri wrote.

The mystery of knitting ... remains a mystery Photos of the day 04/12 SUBSCRIBE Apple crumble for two fits nicely into a 6-inch cast iron skillet. The Pastry Chef's Baking | Caption Loading... Carol Ramos The Pastry Chef's Baking April 12, 2017 —I cycle through various baking obsessions from time to time. I’m in the beginning of one with cast iron skillets. I had a gift card to Sur la Table that I’d received last Christmas begging to be spent. I already knew I needed espresso powder for the Mocha Cream Cheese Brownies but there was still room on my gift card so I wandered the aisles to see what would catch my fancy. What caught my eye, as always, was the “made in the USA” label. I’m a big believer in buying “local,” including buying US-made goods as much as possible. It isn’t always easy or readily available and is often more expensive but I’d rather buy less to make up the price difference if I can buy USA-made. Fortunately, cast iron pans are often made in the US and they’re reasonably priced. I bought this one at Sur la Table for $11.95 and found the same one on amazon for $8.49 and at Target for $7.99. I already had an 8” cast iron skillet, also made in the USA, but I wanted the smaller one for dessert size. I haven’t done a lot of skillet cooking or baking but that’s not to say I couldn’t start. And start I did with making up this Skillet Apple Crumble. I had a lone Granny Smith hanging out in my refrigerator and I got the bright idea of making myself an apple cobbler. At first I had in mind making it more like a skillet apple pie with a real pie crust on top. But as I put this together, I changed my mind and reverted back to the crumble idea. I made up this recipe, also something I don’t often do as I’m more of a follower of recipes than a creator of them. But, really, it’s hard to go wrong with an apple cobbler or crumble; it’s a very forgiving dessert. The cast iron skillet was perfect for this one because I softened/semi-caramelized the apples in the skillet directly with a little butter, sprinkled on some nutmeg and cinnamon (from Penzey’s, naturally) and a little sprinkle of brown sugar. Let it cook to semi-soft state, add a few dollops of salted caramel, then cover with the crumb mixture. The crumb mixture I also made up from cobbling – haha – together bits from past recipes. Some flour, a little brown sugar, granulated sugar, generous dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon, melted butter and a little milk to hold it together in biggish crumbs. Cover the apples entirely with the crumb mixture then put the whole thing into the oven to bake. 10 rhubarb recipes for spring It might go without saying but I’ll say it anyway for any other cast iron skillet novices: Make sure you’re using a potholder to touch the skillet handle with, even when it’s on the stove and before you put it in the oven (and after as well, of course). The heat from the stovetop fires up the whole skillet, including the handle so it’ll burn your unprotected hand. I might have some firsthand knowledge of that ... just sayin’. This turned out really well as my first skillet dessert creation. The Granny Smith apple was tart and I hadn’t used enough sugar in the apples themselves to tone down the tartness but the crumb topping and the salted caramel dollops made it a perfect complementary combination. The topping also crisped up so it provided a terrific contrast to the softness of the apples. Of course, there’s no point having warm apple crumble without a scoop of vanilla ice cream (to everyone except my brother-in-law who thinks combining flavors and textures is a travesty) so that also went well to provide a cool contrast to the warm cobbler. In the picture, you’ll see I put the ice cream off center. That’s because I knew I was only going to eat, at most, one half of the cobbler. While a 6” skillet is a nice size, it’s mostly a nice size for two and is more than one serving for someone who still wants to fit into her existing clothes. The only downside to the skillet is it isn’t microwavable so when I went back for the second half of the cobbler the next day, I ate it at room temperature. Turns out it wasn’t bad that way either, although I did forego the ice cream that time around. First world problems abound. Look for further cast iron skillet obsessing to come. Skillet apple crumble for two 1 large Granny Smith apple, peeled and sliced 2 tablespoons butter 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 2 tablespoons brown sugar or 2 tablespoons salted caramel For the topping: 2 tablespoons butter, melted 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons granulated sugar 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 2 tablespoons milk 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 2. Using a 6" cast iron skillet, melt butter over low heat and add apple slices. Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg then brown sugar if using, stirring gently until sugar has melted. If using salted caramel, cook apples until slightly softened then dollop caramel over apples. 3. Topping: Combine melted butter, flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Mixture will be crumbly with loose flour. Dribble in milk, a little at a time, until mixture gathers together in crumbly pieces and there's only minimal loose flour.

A new report by TrendForce stated that "The market demand going into the second quarter is expected to remain relatively weak as consumers are holding off their purchases in anticipation of the 10th anniversary iPhone devices that will arrive in the third quarter. Smartphone sales will be fairly lackluster until the second half of this year." That was about the most honest narrative of the entire report before going out of it's way to slant it Samsung's way.    The fact is that Apple only sells premium smartphones. Samsung on the other hand ships dozens of smartphone models that are not in the premium category. Did the TrendForce report show us iPhone 7 vs Galaxy 7 sales stats to see if there was massive growth on Samsung's part? No – of course not. That would have made Samsung look really bad.   Though to be fair, TrendForce did make it clear that "Samsung's sales results for its high-end smartphones fell short of expectations in the first quarter as consumers' confidence in the brand had yet to fully recover from the recall of Galaxy Note 7." They just failed to provide a fair comparison with the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 to show that when there's a fair comparison made, Apple was the clear winner.     The key to the report states that "Nevertheless, Samsung continued to do very well in the mid-range and low-end segments of the market." Yes, of course, segments of the market that Apple doesn't participate in.   The one tiny part of the TrendForce report that acts as a nice smoke and mirror marketing piece for Samsung, was overly played up by Samsung fans and the Korean tech press today with wall to wall coverage.   The massive chart shown below is from the Korea Herald today to illustrate how badly they want to pump up Samsung overtaking Apple, knowing full well that Apple doesn't play in the profitless lower end of the market. That didn't matter to them. All that mattered is that Samsung beat Apple. That's all that they wanted to convey to their fan base. But it's not just the Korean press playing this up – the tech world in general is pumping up the Apple angle of the report.      To make it clear that the win for Samsung was based on low-end smartphone shipments, the TrendForce report states that "Strong sales of the Galaxy J series made Samsung the only brand posting production volume growth for the first quarter."   What is the Galaxy J series? This Samsung line-up of smartphones is to compete with the likes of Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and now the new Nokia line of phones that sells in the $185 - $240 range. Apple doesn't sell profitless phones in that range. So the volume win in the profitless low-end in Q1 for Samsung is no victory over Apple. It's a complete disconnect from reality to think that it does; it's completely meaningless unless you're a Samsung fan site or a mindless tech site if they've provided no context to the stats found in the TrendForce report.   To tilt the report further against Apple, TrendForce notes that "The total production volume of all iPhone devices for the first quarter of 2017 fell by 36% compared with the previous quarter and declined by 41% versus the same period a year ago." The first quarter after the holiday quarter always falls off, so the decline is merely a 5% drop. But TrendForce frames it dramatically by saying iPhone sales fell by a whopping 36%.   Yet did the TrendForce report balance it out by giving us a comparison of the Galaxy S7 sales drop off from Q4 to Q1 2017 and year over year? Ha! – of course not. That would have made Samsung look bad, again.   The report went on to fanatically focus on Apple's declining figures for the next quarter as well: "TrendForce estimates that the total production volume of all iPhone devices for the second quarter will reach around 43 million units, a decline of 17% from the preceding quarter. Apple will likely to lower the production of existing iPhone models as the company prepares for the launch of the next-generation devices in the third quarter."   Did the report offer analysis on other brands like Vivo, Sony or Lenovo for Q2? No, and why is that? Is the iPhone the only smartphone that will decline in Q2? I rather doubt it. But slamming Apple once again is a way to put Samsung in a positive light against their archrival.   The bottom line is that the TrendForce report is definitely slanted to give Samsung a mental edge over Apple and that's how the market is digesting the report today. Case in point: The Korea Herald was glad to report and play up that "Apple, the archrival of the South Korean smartphone maker, slid to the second highest with 16.9 percent."   Of course Apple slid nowhere when you consider the fact that Samsung's premium smartphones continued to be a complete dud in Q1. That's the real story, but it's not the one that TrendForce had any interest in selling. It's a Samsung wins over Apple story at any cost, even if it means twisting the value of the facts that have no meaning in relationship to Apple whatsoever.    About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Wish list: What I’d like to see in a new iMac Roman Loyola 12 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News When Apple met with select members of the media to talk about the Mac Pro, Apple VPs also mentioned that the company plans to update the iMac this year. The gap between updates for the iMac isn’t as long as the Mac Pro, but it’s been a while. The current iMac was released in October of 2015, well past the yearly updates Apple used to issue. So the iMac is due. Pike’s Universum, which has an eagle eye for finding references to future Apple products in Apple’s operating system code, reported on some specs that could be used for the new iMac—though the site says that the information should be “handled with care/skepticism.” I’ll point out Pike’s findings in each section below, along with my commentary. The latest CPUs Pike’s Universum says that the high-end iMac could have an Intel E3-1285 v6 processor. This is a Xeon processor that’s not on Intel’s E3 v6 Family list, so you can either dismiss it as not true, or it could be a processor not yet developed. Intel does have older Xeon processors with the E3-1285 part number, so it does seem feasible. Intel released the E3-1200 v6 processor family in late March, so if there’s any credence to Pike’s report, it checks a box on my iMac wish list: that Apple use current CPUs, not ones that are a generation behind. It’ll be interesting if Apple decides to go with a quad-core Xeon processor, which is used in professional workstations. During the Mac Pro briefing, the iMac was mentioned as being used by professionals, and since a ship date for the future Mac Pro has not been announced, Apple could want to fill the professional demand in the meantime by offering a super fast iMac. Apple offers multiple models of the iMac, with 21.5- and 27-inch display. You’ll probably see Core i5 or Core i7 processors in the 21.5-inch iMacs, and then a Xeon processor in the 27-inch model. Let’s hope those Core processors are from Intel’s 7th generation. 16GB of memory   Besides the fast performance, another reason for using a Xeon processor in the high-end iMac is its support for Error Correction Code (ECC) RAM. ECC RAM has a chip that’s dedicated to finding and fixing memory errors. Standard RAM doesn’t have this capability, but it’s also less expensive. So you should experience fewer memory errors when using EEC RAM. What I’d like to see with the iMac is a standard configuration of 16GB of memory. Currently, it’s at 8GB. I’d also like to see Apple make the RAM user accessible on all iMac models, not just on the high-end 27-incher, so you can upgrade to 32GB or 64GB at a later date. Make Fusion Drives standard A solid-state drive would be great because of the speed benefits, but it’s expensive and will drive the price of the iMac up. Apple currently stocks 1TB hard drives in its standard configurations of the iMac, and a 1TB SSD would be really pricey. Pike’s Universum says that the new high-end iMac could have an NVMe SSD, which would be awesome, but there’s still a price consideration for the lower-priced iMacs.   A good compromise would be to make a 1TB Fusion Drive standard. A Fusion Drive is a hard drive that’s combined with flash storage and seen on the Mac and a single storage device. This provides fast file access and spacious file storage. A Fusion Drive upgrade for the current iMac is only $100. Hopefully Apple could find a way to offset the cost of making it a part of the standard configuration. Easier to access ports Apple puts its iMac ports on the back, because they’re ugly and they ruin the aesthetic of the iMac’s front appearance. If you need to regularly access those ports, however, it’s annoying. You have to reach around and scrape up the back of the iMac as you try to fit a connector into a port. Or you have to move the iMac itself, which can be disruptive if you have a special hardware setup. But Apple won’t move the ports from the back. Maybe they have data that shows that it’s not really an issue. Maybe the data they have says customers want a change, but Apple doesn’t care, it’s sticking to its design. I can wish, but I know that in this case, it won’t happen. Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and USB 3 Here’s a wish that has a really good chance of coming true. I can easily see Apple replacing the Thunderbolt 2 ports on the current iMac with Thunderbolt 3/USB-C on the new iMac. I hope Apple retains the other ports on the back of the iMac: USB 3, ethernet, the headphone jack, and the SD card slot. I don’t see a reason for Apple to eliminate these ports, but I can also see Apple deciding to offer only Thunderbolt 3, and then telling people that you can use a dock like CalDigit’s TS 3 Lite ($200 on Amazon). That would mean paying extra money for something that used to be included. But on the bright side, a dock addresses my issue with port access. External GPU support The iMac’s all-in-one design limits the type of GPU that can be used. You can’t use one that generates a lot of heat. But if lots of pros are using iMacs, a pro-class GPU accessible externally would address the needs of graphically-demanding apps. An external GPU is also on my wish list for the Mac Pro. In that article, I said that an external GPU is the type of product you usually wouldn’t see from Apple, but if it can be used by any Mac, it makes it more feasible. And as I noted in the Mac Pro wish list, macOS needs some updating to support an external GPU.

Technology Apple In-Sourcing Hit List To Spare Cirrus, Skyworks: Analyst REINHARDT KRAUSE 4/12/2017 Reprints Apple (AAPL) is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency chips for iPhones, making it less likely Broadcom (AVGO),  Qorvo (QRVO), or Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) could be displaced by the iPhone maker, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst. While Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh says Apple also is unlikely to develop its own audio chips — a plus for Cirrus Logic (CRUS) — he speculates that Synaptics (SYNA) could be at risk of losing business. San Jose-based Synaptics makes chips that control iPhone displays. Shares in Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, and Skyworks fell on Tuesday after a report that Apple will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. That report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors Apple that was phasing out its graphics chips in iPhones. "In light of concerns over Imagination Technologies graphics chips and Dialog Semiconductor power management chips being insourced at Apple, we believe the risk of Synaptics being displaced is medium to high, while we see risk of RF suppliers and Cirrus Logic being integrated as medium to low," Vinh said in a report. "We believe the risk that RF semiconductors would be insourced is low, given high technical barriers to entry and protection of intellectual property." Dialog stock fell 14% on Tuesday in Germany. Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe downgraded Dialog to "sell" saying that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone. Expectations for a strong iPhone upgrade cycle in late 2017 had been rising, sending chip stocks up. IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Nvidia and Inphi are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless group. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. Apple as well as rival Samsung have been developing their own in-house microprocessors to perform the heavy-duty in smartphones. "We think Samsung looks to integrate semiconductors to save costs, but Apple is different as it only looks to integrate components if it believes it can get performance benefits to differentiate its products," added the Pacific Crest analyst. Shares in Apple were up 17 cents to 141.80 at the close on the stock market today. Broadcom stock lost 3.8% to 209.20, Cirrus Logic stock fell 2.3% to 61.91 and Skyworks stock slipped 2.6% to 97.59. Shares in Synaptics sank 2.3% to 50.60. RELATED: Qualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7 The Strongest Evidence Yet For An iPhone 'Supercycle'?

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents.

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones?

Swatch is using the slogan to market a wristwatch containing a contactless payment chip. Apple says the phrase unfairly references its Think Different campaign, which ran in the 1990s. According to Swiss news site Watson, Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said the similarity was purely coincidental. He said the slogan was a nod to one of its own campaigns from the 1980s: "Always different, always new." Apple used Think Different in its adverts from 1997 to 2002, in what was thought to be a response to IBM's Think ad campaign. A 1998 television advert, featuring black-and-white images of historical figures such as Einstein and Gandhi, won an Emmy. Previous clash In the complaint to the Swiss Federal Administrative Court, Apple's lawyers Lenz & Staehelin said the tagline was long considered "the core of the Apple brand". Legal experts say that, to win the case, Apple must show that Swatch's use of the phrase Tick Different provokes an association with Apple products in the minds of at least 50% of consumers. A similar complaint lodged at the same time with the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property was rejected. Swatch was granted trademark status for the phrase Tick Different in the US in 2015. It also has the trademark for the slogan in Switzerland. This is not the first time the two companies have clashed. In September last year, the UK Intellectual Property Office upheld Swatch's opposition to Apple's efforts to trademark "iWatch" in the UK. It ruled that the term was too close to "iSwatch" and "Swatch".

The all-new TLX A-Spec takes the sedan's design in an even more emotional direction, further broadening the brand's appeal to younger buyers. The Acura TLX also will be one of the most technologically advanced and well-equipped vehicles in the segment with new technology features including Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™ and AcuraWatch™ standard on all grades. The 2018 TLX is slated to go on sale at Acura dealerships nationwide in June. New York Auto Show    The 2018 TLX boasts a more aggressive and sporty look inspired by the Acura Precision Concept that debuted last year, a design direction that has successfully influenced the styling of the 2017 MDX luxury SUV. Acura's signature diamond pentagon grille, paired with changes to the sedan's stance, proportion, wheels and sheet metal boosts its presence on the road. "We've really upped the ante in terms of styling, emotion and road presence, more effectively communicating the TLX's dynamic capabilities," said Jon Ikeda, Acura vice president and general manager.         The 2018 TLX design illustrates its three variants with distinct characteristics. The 2.4-liter i-VTEC inline-4 cylinder TLX receives a sporty new front fascia featuring the diamond pentagon grille, a new bumper, more sculpted hood, fenders, redesigned Jewel Eye™ headlight design with LED turn signal and a new standard 17-inch wheel and tire package. The V6 TLX models add an aggressive, refreshed rear fascia with exposed, rectangular dual-exhaust finishers, rear diffuser and standard 18-inch wheels. The V6 TLX with Technology Package adds a new chrome side sill garnish, all-new seats with contrast piping and stitching, and a power-operated thigh extension on the driver's seat. The Advance Package gains additional technology including trapezoidal LED fog lights, Surround View Camera system, built-in wireless charging pad, white LED ambient light piping in 10 locations throughout the cabin, a heated steering wheel and heated rear outboard seats, a body-colored decklid spoiler, and power-folding side mirrors. Acura's acclaimed torque vectoring Super Handling All-Wheel Drive® (SH-AWD™), the best handling all-wheel drive system in the industry, is available for the first time on all V6 TLX models, previously available only with V6 models equipped with Technology or Advance Packages New TLX A-Spec Reflecting Acura's Precision Crafted Performance DNA, the new TLX V6 A-Spec is available in two-wheel drive and SH-AWD™ configurations, adding character and performance inside and out. An exclusive front fascia, round LED fog lights, aggressive side sills, rear diffuser accented by large, round dual-exhaust finishers and gloss black decklid spoiler creates an even bolder character. Exclusive, dark finish 19-inch wheels paired with wide 245-series tires complement a sport-tuned suspension with more aggressive damper settings and retuned electric power steering for a sharper, more precise handling experience. TLX A-Spec models with SH-AWD also receive a stiffer spring rate and rear stabilizer bar for improved body control. Gloss black trim and A-Spec badging on the rear decklid, fenders, side sill garnish and steering wheel completes the look. On the inside, a host of sport-oriented refinements and premium features include exclusive leather seats with increased bolstering, red driver's meter highlights, brushed aluminum-look interior trim, and a thick-rimmed sport steering wheel. Two A-Spec exclusive interior color choices are offered: Red leather or Black leather with Alcantara™ seat and door inserts. Premium enhancements borrowed from the top trim Advance Package include wireless charging pad, ventilated front seats and red LED ambient light piping (white on the Advance Package).   Technology Enhancements The 2018 TLX is the first Acura to feature a refreshed dual-screen user On Demand Multi-Use Display™ (ODMD 2.0) interface that supports Apple CarPlay™, Android Auto™ and Sirius XM 2.0. New software improves the system response time and offers more intuitive menus and command structures for a seamless and quicker user experience – approximately 30 percent faster. An enhanced 7-inch touchscreen has a capacitive display that is more responsive to the touch and is positioned within easy reach of the driver and front passenger. With its unique AcuraWatch™ suite of technologies, the 2018 Acura TLX is the only vehicle in its class with standard crash avoidance and active driving-assistive features. AcuraWatch™ includes Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) with automatic emergency braking, Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKAS), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow (LSF) and Road Departure Mitigation (RDM). AcuraWatch uses a millimeter wave radar and monocular camera sensing technology to detect other vehicles as well as lane markings and can help intervene to prevent or mitigate the severity of a collision. With Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow and Lane Keeping Assist, AcuraWatch can significantly decrease the driver's workload during freeway cruising by maintaining a set speed and following interval, initiating both braking and throttle inputs, and adding steering input to help the driver maintain their position in the detected lane.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kulbhushan Jadhav Malcolm Turnbull Narendra Modi IPL 2017 Arvind Kejriwal News Money Apple indicates plans for local plant; no decision on sops: Nirmala Sitharaman Nirmala Sitharaman Shares22 Thu, 13 Apr 2017-01:07am , PTI Apple has sought concessions such as duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment for smartphone manufacturing. The government today said the US-based iPhone maker Apple has indicated plans for introduction of selective manufacturing lines in the country this year. However, no decision has been taken yet on concessions demanded by the US-based company for setting up local manufacturing facility in the country, Commerce and Industry Ministry Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha. "Apple in their communications, indicated their plan for selective introduction of manufacturing lines in Spring 2017," Sitharaman said in a written reply. Apple has sought concessions such as duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment for smartphone manufacturing and service/repair for a period of 15 years. With sales tapering in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world -- and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does this through contract manufacturers. The company sells products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro. Replying to a separate question, she said that cement demand is expected to increase in the next financial year on account of various flagship programmes of the government such as 'Housing for All' by 2022, Smart Cities Mission, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Freight and Industrial Corridors and National Highways Expansion.

Apple analysts are ditching stock in the company’s third-party component supply chain, warning that the iPhone maker has begun bringing development of many pieces used inside its next-generation devices in-house. Apple takes over Apple clearly intends bringing as much of its supply chain in-house as possible. Just over a week ago, UK company Imagination warned that it would cease using Imagination’s GPU designs within 18-24 months. “Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” the UK firm warned. Apple has already hired numerous Imagination engineers to work on its own proprietary GPU processors, and is advertising for more. That would have been that, I guess, but yesterday saw another UK-based Apple parts supplier hit by claims it may be losing Cupertino’s business. Dialog Semiconductor shares fell a dramatic 20 percent following a Bankhaus Lampe analyst warning. Managing power  “There is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own power-management integrated circuits and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” wrote analyst Karsten Iltgen. The analyst cited speculation heard by themselves that Apple is building its own power-management chips. There has been “a steady stream” of Dialog engineers to Apple in the last few years, a Bloomberg report claimed, noting that the smaller firm’s 1,500 engineers far outnumber the approximately 80 thought to be working on the project at Apple. The number of people Apple employs to work on this component may not mean too much, given that it already boasts extensive chip expertise across graphics and processors. Is it not possible the company is leveraging the combined strength of teams drawn from different disciplines? Power management This is a power management matter. Not in terms of electrical power, but in terms of control of the supply chain. Apple drives profitability for key firms in the mobile sector, and those profits are used to develop technologies then made available to competitors in the vertical markets it plays in. Apple management may no longer be interested in financing external R&D departments for its competitors. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen an Apple supply chain decision impact third party component makers: Wolfson Microelectronics hit the ground fast once Apple ceased using its DACs, that company now sits within the Cirrus Logic family. (The latter company also owes around 70 percent of its business to the Mac maker). Current, core, and currency Follow the current and you see signs of other activity within the Apple supply chain core. Credit Suisse this morning warns that Synaptics may also be at risk as its biggest client moves component design in house. The company builds interface technologies, driver displays, and biometric tech for Apple. The analysts didn’t say there was a definite risk, just that it was more at risk than other companies that remain in the component supply chain. The assessment isn’t unreasonable. Synaptics left the chain in the iPod days, but its 2014 acquisition of LCD driver manufacturer, Renesas SP Drivers, apparently bought it back into the frame. What makes that situation interesting is that Apple had itself bid for Renesas SP, and has (according to this report) hired engineers from that firm to develop its own LCD tech. Et tu, ARM? This storm of rumor and speculation is hitting stock prices across Apple’s supply chain. While it’s open to question if this is just a case of investor jitters and market speculation, it does beg asking one more thing: Will Apple replace ARM? There seems little reason for the company to do so, but the recent Softbank acquisition and use of ARM technologies in products from a range of competitors means it’s a question worth asking. After all, if Apple wants to control the primary technologies used inside its products, why wouldn’t it want to develop a completely unique processor? We can all recall the bad old PowerPC days when the fortunes of the Mac were damaged by Apple’s then partners, IBM and Motorola. That lesson must surely inform some of Cupertino management’s current decisions. A New Electronics editorial today speculates the company may even imitate Samsung in a move to RISC-V. One thing is for sure: this game is in play and it’s hard to figure out what the next move might be when looking into CEO Tim Cook’s poker face. Perhaps AAPL will grant a little more insight when it reveals its Q2 2017 results on May 2. I’m in no doubt this succession of significant moves reflects a company putting together the kind of foundations it needs for a highly significant product play. Want a prediction? I can't help but imagine significant M&A activity soon -- why would Apple bet a billion on a ride sharing company, and not bet a similar amount on securing its own processor supply?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple may be working on game-changing iPhone battery tech Chris Smith BGR NewsApril 11, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share A few days ago, news broke that Apple plans to stop using Imagination’s GPU technology in iPhones at some point in the coming two years, as the iPhone maker is developing its own graphics chip for iOS devices. That may be great news for iPhone buyers, but Imagination’s stock tanked almost immediately, since losing iPhone business is a crucial hit for any parts supplier. Similar news came out on Tuesday, and it had the same effect on a different chipmaker. It turns out that Apple is looking to improve iPhone battery life by designing its own battery chips. Don't Miss: The only Samsung phone more exciting than the Galaxy S8 isn’t as exciting as we thought Unlike Imagination a few days ago, Dialog did not confirm Apple’s plans. Bankhaus Lampe financial analyst Karsten Iltgen cut his rating on Dialog Semiconductor from “hold” to “sell,” saying in a research note seen by Reuters that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chips for the iPhone. This chip could replace Dialog’s power management integrated circuits (PMIC) as early as 2019. Dialog’s shares were down by as much as a 36%, Reuters explains, down to a seven-month low. Apple happened to account for more than 70% of Dialog’s 2016 sales, according to the analyst. This proves yet again how important Apple’s iPhone business really is, especially to smaller companies. Unnamed industry sources told Banhaus Lampe that Apple is setting up power management design centers in Munich and California, with as many as 80 engineers already working on a battery-saving chip for the iPhone. “In our view, there is strong evidence that Apple is developing its own PMIC and intends to replace the chip made by Dialog at least in part,” Iltgen wrote. A different source familiar with the matter confirmed the news, saying that Apple is poaching Dialog engineers in Munich “like crazy.” If Dialog sounds familiar, that’s because the company’s endeavors have been linked to the iPhone 8 in recent months. An exciting rumor claimed the handset will support long-range wireless charging thanks to technology from Energous. Dialog’s partnership with Energous was seen as an indirect proof that Apple is interested in long-range wireless charging for the iPhone 8. But those rumors soon lost their appeal, as reports indicated the game-changing Energous technology isn’t ready for the iPhone. And if today’s report is accurate, Apple may never go for long-range wireless charging tech enabled by Dialog.

However, the handsets are said to have been ignored for iOS 10.3.2 update. It is reported that betas of iOS 10.3.2 released so far have ignored iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c handsets. This means, millions of people from across the globe, who still hold on to these old phones, will not get iOS 10.3.2 update.

Qualcomm today filed its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple’s January lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of California. The full details of the suit can be read in a 139-page document (PDF) released by Qualcomm, but the company has five key complaints — including the claim that Apple deliberately didn’t use the full potential of Qualcomm chips in iPhone 7 phones so that they wouldn’t perform better than the modems provided by Intel. Qualcomm says that Apple “chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm’s innovation),” and when Qualcomm iPhones supposedly outperformed Intel iPhones, “Apple falsely claimed that there was ‘no discernible difference’ between” the two variants. The company also says that Apple prevented it from revealing to customers “the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets.” As part of its five core arguments, Qualcomm says Apple “threatened” it to keep quiet about the differences between Intel and Qualcomm iPhones, preventing Qualcomm from “making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.” READ  Microsoft Releases Fifth Windows 10 Preview In A Row With Only Bug Fixes And Improvements Other complaints in the countersuit include claims that Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm, encouraged attacks on the company in a number of markets by misrepresenting facts and making false statements, and interfered with Qualcomm’s existing agreements with other companies. Apple’s original suit against Qualcomm was filed in January this year in the United States, and claimed $1 billion from the chipmaker, arguing that it had been drastically overcharging for the use of patents. That was followed up by two additional suits — one in China and one in the United Kingdom — that also focused on patents and designs. A case filed in Beijing claimed 1 billion yuan ($145 million) for Qualcomm’s abuse of China’s monopoly laws. Tim Cook said that Apple had “no choice” but to sue Qualcomm, even after the two companies had worked together for many years, saying that he and his company “didn’t see another way forward.” According to Cook, Qualcomm was “insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,” collecting money on features like Apple’s TouchID fingerprint readers and cameras. READ  Tech Proving A Real Game-Changer For Growth in Africa The Apple suits came after the Federal Trade Commission filed its own litigation against Qualcomm in January. The FTC also took umbrage against Qualcomm’s use of its patents: specifically, how it wouldn’t sell modems to companies who didn’t also agree to pay royalties on phones that didn’t use Qualcomm modems. As part of the FTC’s case, some of the chipmaker’s other behind-the-scenes deals also came to light — including a 2007 agreement with Apple that saw Qualcomm refund some patent royalties if Apple promised not to make a WiMAX phone. In today’s countersuit, Qualcomm says it seeks — among other things — damages from Apple for “reneging on its promises in several agreements,” and to stop Apple interfering in deals with manufacturers for iPhone and iPad parts.

Josh Smith09/12/2016 The iOS 10 update is here with a plethora of new features in a more compact download. The iOS 10 update will still take some time to download and install, so not all users should jump and start as soon as the iOS 10 release time arrives. With the iOS 10 update users get new Messages apps, shared iPhone notes, better control of read receipts and a ton of new Messages features. Check out what’s new in iOS 10 for more details. The iOS 10 update runs on most devices device currently running iOS 9, but not all. One question we hear every year with this major update, and that we are already hearing from readers is, ” How long will the iOS 10 update take to download and install?” How long will the iOS 10 update take to install? There is no single answer, but based on our experience with earlier updates we can help you figure out how much time you need to set aside to download and install iOS 10. If you try to download the iOS 9 update as soon as it is available, you will likely see longer download times, that will make the overall installation take longer. Waiting a few hours after the iOS 10 release time can drastically speed up the process. How Long Does the iOS 10 Update Take? Assuming Apple doesn’t run into server problems and you are on a fast Internet connection and you are prepared for the iOS 10 installation it could take as little as 30 minutes to install iOS 10, but that is variable, and it is a good idea to budget an hour. The table below outlines how long each step may take to complete as you work through the process of downloading and installing iOS 10. Task Time Sync (Optional) 5-45 minutes Backup and Transfer (Optional) 1-30 minutes iOS 10 Download 15 Minutes to Hours iOS 10 Update 15-30 Minutes Total iOS 10 Update Time 30 minutes to Hours The iOS 10 update will take longer during the first several hours of the iOS 10 release date as millions of users attempt to download and install the update. If you want to avoid the long download times, try installing iOS 10 later in the day or wait a day for faster speeds. Although the first two tasks are optional, we highly recommend a recent backup of your iPhone before you install iOS 10. The odds of a problem wiping out your phone are small, but it can still happen. With a recent iTunes or iCloud backup you won’t lose anything. Check out our guide to 10 things to do before installing iOS 10 for other tips about how to prepare and cut down on the time it takes to update once Apple starts the downloads. iOS 10 Download Times The iOS 10 download sizes vary from one device to the next, but you should expect to see a more manageable update than two years ago when Apple required massive amounts of storage. The iOS 10 update size is just 1.00GB on for many users although some may see a 1.79GB update. The iOS 10 update is not huge, but it will take a little while to download. In a best case scenario the iOS 10 download will take 15 minutes, but we saw the iOS 8 download times hit six hours as soon as the update was available. Many of these high iOS download times sped up, but if you attempt to download within the first hours of the release, expect to see some times longer than 15 minutes. iOS 10 Installation Time The iOS 10 installation should not take very long to complete. In most cases this will finish within 15 minutes or less. It’s a good idea to make sure you have longer if something goes wrong or in case it takes longer, but this is a safe bet. The iOS 10 installation will likely be faster than the iOS 10 download. When the iOS 10 install is taking place you cannot use the iPhone or iPad at all. Make sure you keep this in mind before you tap install, as you will be otherwise unable to make calls or send texts. During this process you can expect the iPhone or iPad to restart several times. Backup, Sync & Transfer Purchases The longest steps in the iOS 10 update are the housekeeping ones that many users avoid until a major update, or wish they already did when something goes wrong. [contextly_sidebar id=”2q0UCKuf0bZgbf8qG5BWp4zBiUiBhExE”] If you don’t use iCloud Backup, it is a good idea to make sure that you plug-in to your computer and perform a backup before installing iOS 10. If you have not done this in a while, expect to spend 15 to 30 minutes on this process. When you are connected you may also want to transfer purchases from your iPhone or iPad to iTunes. If you choose to do this they will restore back to your device if you need to restore from a backup, if you skip this step they will not. At the least we suggest a recent backup, since you can get your apps from the App Store again if you need to. You can see what’s new in iOS 10 in the video above and see more details about these new features and changes in the slides below that compare iOS 10 to iOS 9.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike Yesterday AAPL: 141.80 0.17 After Imagination and Dialog, Synaptics could be the next Apple supplier to lose out – Credit Suisse Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 12th 2017 5:33 am PT @benlovejoy AAPL Company iPhone Synaptics View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit With Apple increasingly seeking to bring chip and component design in-house, the next company to lose out could be display driver maker Synaptics. The prediction was made by Credit Suisse analysts, who said that the company was at ‘moderate to high risk’ of losing its Apple contract. The prediction follows Apple’s warning that it plans to stop using Imagination Technologies GPUs within two years, causing the company’s stock to drop dramatically, and a separate report suggesting that Apple also planned to drop Dialog as a supplier … NordVPN Synaptics acquired the display driver chip technology from Renesas in 2014 in a $475M buyout. It had been rumored at the time that Apple might buy Renesas directly, but Reuters reported that those talks failed. Apple may not have been best pleased with Synaptics when the company announced in 2015 that it would be making force-sensing touchscreen controllers for Android smartphones just a month after the announcement of 3D Touch on the iPhone 6s/Plus. Business Insider saw the analyst note from Credit Suisse which attempts to predict which current Apple suppliers are most at risk of losing their contracts as the company moves more deeply into in-house chip design. The analysts highlighted the fact that Apple has hired a ‘significant number’ of former Renesas engineers. Synaptics (SYNA, Sector Weight) Risk: Medium to High. We see moderate to high risk of Apple looking to insource its display driver IC, given (1) as we previously noted, Apple has hired a significant number of former Renesas RSP engineers, and (2) we believe Apple has been developing its own internal OLED DDIC. We believe Samsung will use its own internal DDIC for the OLED iPhone and Synaptics for the next- generation LCD smartphones. Why would it make sense? By optimizing and using its internal solution, Apple could optimize power and performance with its internal graphics engine. Additionally, it would lessen its reliance on Samsung for OLED displays. Cirrus Logic was felt to be at ‘medium to low’ risk of losing its Apple business, while RF Suppliers and Skyworks Solutions were considered at low risk. Apple’s increasing focus on in-house chip design lends further weight to the idea of eventual ARM-powered Macs using Apple-designed CPUs.

The Korean tech giant claimed a 26.1 percent share in the global smartphone market compared to Apple's 16.9 percent. In the wake of last year's Galaxy Note 7 recall due to defective batteries, Samsung with 18.5 percent was dethroned by Apple's 20.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. "Samsung continued to do very well in the mid-range and low-end segments of the market. The economically priced, high-performing Galaxy J series sustained Samsung's shipments and contributed significantly to the expansion of the brand's overall smartphone production volume," TrendForce said in a statement. "Samsung was the only brand that saw positive growth in production volume during the off season of the first quarter." Samsung is set to release its latest flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone next week after receiving rave reviews and it is expected to help the Seoul-based company continue its positive performance in the foreseeable future. Preorders for the new handset have topped 600,000 in just five days. "Samsung is expected to post flat growth for its second-quarter smartphone production volume. The S8 devices and the J series, which are contending for market shares respectively in the high-end and the mid-range to low-end segments, will keep Samsung's shipments relatively stable in the second quarter," TrendForce said. The research firm forecast that for the entire 2017, Samsung is estimated to increase its production volume by as much as 5 percent compared with 2016. Chinese smartphone makers Huawei, Oppo and Vivo rounded out the top five, while LG came in sixth with a 4.6 percent market share. As for LG, TrendForce said that its shipments will benefit from the arrival of the G6, unveiled in February, predicting that the company's production volume will reach around 18 million this quarter. The world's production of smartphones reached 37 million, down 23 percent from the three-month period earlier due to lower production at Chinese makers. ksw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter Is US pre-emptive strike on N.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple drops from first to fifth place in Laptop Mag’s annual survey Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, April 12th, 2017, 05:21 Category: Hardware, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Microsoft, News In as much as you may love your Apple notebook, Apple’s wares seem to be on the decline according to Laptop Mag. The publication, which has awarded Apple the top spot in its annual survey since 2010, placed Apple’s notebooks at fifth place alongside Acer but behind Lenovo, Asus, Dell and HP. The magazine had the following to say about Apple’s recent products: To pick the winners, losers and also-rans, we evaluated the 10 biggest laptop brands to determine which offer the best combination of quality products, cutting-edge innovation, helpful support, sleek designs and strong value. Because of its modest review scores, expensive products and lack of ports, Apple fell all the way down to fifth place after receiving top honors every year since the Best and Worst Brands debuted in 2010. Apple’s lowest scoring category turned out to be ‘Value and Selection’, albeit Apple, in recent years was cited for providing a ‘good, better, best’ portfolio with a limited number of machines and options. It was also noted that while the MacBook line was seen as an investment that would provide a return over the lifetime of the device, the recent MacBooks, including the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, have broken this rule. The article also points out Apple’s very high initial price that may not be worth the investment as time goes by. The 2016 MacBook refresh, per the article, was not seen as adding a significant amount of features or functionality to accompany the price. The Touch Bar was only added to the top end models, creating a secondary interface on these machines but at the cost of removing the function keys. More importantly, developers cannot assume that a macOS machine running their code will have the Touch Bar, so anything in the Bar needs to be available in another part of the interface. The Touch Bar, though considered neat, might not be an integral part of macOS for many years, even if it does become available on Apple’s external keyboard in the future. Apple now also has to contend with other notebook manufacturers oming to terms with the high-end market and bringing out designs that not only match, but surpass Apple’s choices with the MacBook range. HP’s Spectre 13 offers the thin and ultraportable experience that rivals the MacBook and MacBook Air. Alternative OS users can pick up Linux machines like the Orion that work off the shelf and the gaming community (not particularly well served by Apple) has a mix of gaming laptops from the mainstream manufacturers and companies such as Razer. Where Windows notebooks are concerned, Windows 10 notebooks are seen as having addressed concerns and frustrations brought out by Windows 8. Microsoft also seems to have found the notebook’s place in a modern, cloud-connected world as well. While this is disappointing news for Apple, it may be the incidental kick in the ribs Apple needs to make something truly extraordinary for its MacBook line come the next generation.

The reality is that (as reported recently) the new MacBook Pro models have been the best selling Apple notebook computers fin the companies history. It quickly surpassed the annual sales of any previous version of the MacBook Pro, and Apple has been having a difficult time keeping up with the demand. In fact (Gartner statistics), Apple saw a 4.5% increase in shipments in the first quarter of 2017, flying in the face of a slumping overall PC market which declined by 2.4%.

This week's question is: What person, in your opinion, changed history more than anyone else? In my opinion, I believe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. changed history more than anyone else. That's because today we are all equal,no matter our race, and we have him to thank. My school isn't segregated, public bathrooms aren't just for people with white skin or for just people with dark skin, and we just recently had our first African American president, and he completed both two terms. If it was wasn't for him and his, "I Have a Dream" speech, life after Martin Luther King Jr. wouldn't be the same. Grace Iervolino Grade 7 Readington Middle School I think the person who changed history the most is god. I'd choose him considering he created all of us and without him none of us or anything would even be here on this Earth. Therefore, god changed history completely by creating the first human. Natalie Gerstein Grade 7 Readington Middle School I choose Martin Luther king because he stood up for what was right.He wanted people to think that being being different was okay,however,he wanted the blacks and whites to be fair and so that everyone could get along. Bianca Colaluca Grade 7 Readington Middle School I think if you were talking about sports Michael Jordan would be the one that changed history the most. He got rejected from the high school team and ended up being the best and one of the most successful basketball players of all time. Gregory Lavish Grade 7 Readington Middle School The person who changed history the most was the person who kicked Adolf Hitler out of art school. Adolf Hitler was an artist and went to an art school. Eventually he got kicked out and became a dictator later in his life. So the person who decided to kick Adolf Hitler out of art school changed history the most because without them there would have been no World War II. Becca Bowser Grade 7 Readington Middle School Someone that changed history a lot wasn't in my time. His name was Martin Luther King Jr. He stopped racism once and for all. He led the black men and women to complete freedom. Now, today we have all sorts of races living in this beautiful country. Corey Paulson Grade 7 Readington Middle School In my opinion the person who changed history the most is Adam Savage. Andrew Bennett Grade 7 Readington Middle School Me Thomas Micco Grade 7 Readington Middle School A person that is important in history is George Washington. One reason is because George Washington was an American politician and general who served as the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797 and was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. For example, he made laws, fought in very important wars, commanded the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), and was the first President of the United States, serving from 1789 to 1797. That is why I believe that George Washington was a very important person in history. Meghan Sebeth Grade 4 Milford Public School Thomas Edison was an American inventor who invented the electric light bulb, the phonograph, the motion picture camera, electric car and the electric power station.  He was a very intelligent man who mainly self-educated himself through reading.  He spent any extra income he had on chemistry sets.  When he was young boy he became deaf but nothing stopped him from continuing to invent things.  He was a very successful man whom we are lucky that he developed such wonderful items that we use in everyday life. Joey Cucinotta Grade 4 Copper Hill School The person, who changed history more than anyone else, in my opinion, was Louis Pasteur. He was a French biologist, microbiologist, and chemist. He lived in 1822-1895.  He is awesome for changing history due to his many discoveries in Science that saved lives. First, he created vaccines for deadly diseases. Two of these diseases, rabies and anthrax, had no cure at that time and meant you were going to certainly die. Additionally, his medical discoveries found that by simply washing your hands you could reduce germs.  This was especially important since the doctors who performed surgery did not think they had to wash their hands. Many people they worked on died from bacterial infections even though the surgery went fine. Finally, he is best known for his invention of the way to treat milk so that it doesn't grow bacteria and goes bad and can make you very sick.  It is known today as Pasteurization.  I think having a disease fighting process named after you makes you worthy of changing history. Max Kenny Grade 4 Milford Public School There are many people that changed history but there is one that is most important. Of course, there was Thomas Edison who invented the lightbulb and Nikola Tesla who made a motor. The person I think is the important is Christopher Columbus because he discovered America without even knowing that it was even there. He thought there was nothing across the ocean, so people would just go to the next side of Britain, but he ran into the Native Americans in America. This could have been very bad because the Indians didn't know Christopher Columbus; A discoverer is like an inventor. Justin LaVigne Grade 4 Milford Public School The person, in my opinion, who changed history more than anyone else is Ben Franklin for many reasons.  First, he invented many things. For example, he discovered that lightning was electricity, so he invented the lightning rod.  His invention is still used today to keep homes from being struck by lightning.  Also, he published a well-known book called Poor Richard's Almanack.  It is still popular today. Next, he was involved in negotiating the end of the Revolutionary War.  He was a big help for our country during this time.    Last, but not, least, he helped write and signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.  That means he helped get independence for the United States from Great Britain.  Franklin changed history in many ways, and is still very well known today. Mason Irani Grade 4 Milford Public School There are many reasons that George Washington changed history more than anyone else. My first reason is that he was the first president. Without him there probably would be no president right now. Also, he led the Continental Army in victory. That proves he is a great leader. Most of the time he had to leave without bringing his wife Martha Washington. That must have been hard. It is hard to imagine what life would be like now without George Washington. Julia Gabriel Grade 4 Milford Public School I have used my phone several times today. I have texted people, looked up a definition, used the calculator, and played an entertaining game. Thanks to the work of Martin Cooper, I can do these things anywhere and anytime. He was an American engineer as well as a leader in the wireless communications industry. While he was at Motorola in the 1970s, Cooper invented the first ever handheld cellular mobile phone. Thanks to his invention, new companies like Apple began to upgrade Cooper's invention. The cellular phone revolutionized communication and made so many things not just easier to do, but possible to do.  Thanks to Martin Cooper, we can use our tiny phones to call someone, look for directions, find a recipe, or search for knowledge anytime, anywhere...well, as long as we have internet. Owen Bousum    Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Over the past century, times have drastically changed. In my opinion one person that has changed history is Ben Franklin who invented electricity. I think this is important because today we use electricity for a lot of things. For example, today most things are run through computers. Also if it wasn't for electricity we wouldn't have any lights in our house and would have to use candles. Today we have many conveniences like televisions, radios, phones, and refrigerators. People don't realize how much electricity impacts our lives today. Catie Brennan Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, one person who has changed history more than anyone else is Martin Luther King Jr. who is famous for leading the civil rights movement and fighting against segregation. Many of his accomplishments have affected today's world, including his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. His wish was that someday people, "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character". Other accomplishments of King include leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Birmingham Campaign. In conclusion, Martin Luther King Jr. has used nonviolence to make advancements in civil rights that greatly affected the way people see things. Caris Cullaton Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I think that Thomas Edison changed history more than any other person.  One way that he changed history  was by him fixing the light bulb to run light longer.  Many people say that he invented the lightbulb, but what he did was made it so it can run light longer than the previous time.  Another way that he changed history is by his other inventions, a few of them are the motion picture cameras, and the Electrographic Vote Recorder, Since inventing those items, he was very successful for those inventions and many more to come.  A third way that he changed history is how important those machines work for us today.  The light bulb has been coming out with new styles, but the basic making in the middle has always been used the way Thomas did it.  With the motion picture, that invention became what we know it today as the movies on a Television.  As you can see, Thomas Edison was a very important person that changed history greatly.   Emma Dombroski    Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Martin Luther King Junior had a significant impact on history. Martin Luther King Jr. changed history because he took away segregation. Segregation was a horrible thing.  People would get hurt and get treated differently. There were separate water fountains and bathrooms on for African Americans, and you would have to enter restaurants and other places  through back and side doors. When Dr. King gave his I Have a Dream Speech almost everything changed. His speech inspired many people to make the world a better place .   Martin Luther King changed history for the better. Molly Dombroski Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I think that James Naismith is important because he was the one that started sports such as wrestling and other games.. This is my answer because everyone has to play a sport in their life. What would you do in your free time? You have nothing to do. You can't play any ordinary game. Say you are outside and it is school and you have recess. What would you have to do? You can't play soccer hide and seek jump rope or hopscotch. All of the fun things you just can't do. This person whoever made sports or games helped us not to be bored of anything at anytime. Trevor Fisch Grade 6 East Amwell Township School The person that I think changed history the most was Alexander Hamilton. I think that he changed history because he was one of the many founding fathers of America. He helped helped George Washington come up with ideas of how to defeat the British in battle. Hamilton also aided in the american revolution. Alexander Hamilton's friends are Aaron Burr, George Washington, and Je m'appelle Lafayette. That is why Alexander Hamilton is the most important person in history to me. Colton Hettman Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, Steve Jobs is the best person who changed history because he made the first electronic computer called the Macintosh, or today the Mac.Steve Jobs also made the first smartphone. If he didn't you wouldn't be snapchatting, instagram, and yes there wouldn't be a youtube for phones. Unfortunately, Steve Jobs died on October 5th 2011. Although he has passed away he still has lots of people, engineers and technicians making  plenty of new computers, phones , tablets, and so much more today. It is amazing how far Steve Jobs garage ideas went this far and are so popular. This is why I think Steve Jobs is the most important person in history. Joshua Kasper Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion the person who changed history the most is Martin Luther King Junior. I think this for many reasons. One reason is he was a great speech writer. He was such a great speech writer that he moved America out of the time of segregation. Also, he lead the walk to end segregation. He changed all of the black people's lives forever. Lastly, he was murdered which brought all of america closer together than it had ever been before. Daniel Kellogg Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Albert Einstein was one of the greatest of all physicists. When his most famous work, the General Theory Of Relativity was proven in 1919,  Einstein became a very well known scientist. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics. He helped the country to develop the atomic bomb. He was also a leading anti nuclear campaigner, asking all of the countries to give their nuclear weapons up. Nina McManus Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, I believe that Marie Curie changed history the most. Her work in both physics and science was astonishing. She discovered both radium and polonium two of the elements. Her work with radiation in all further advanced medical sciences and helped them get to what we know today. Without her love and devotion to science we would not be where we are today. Because of her work she was awarded two nobel prizes for physics and science. She was the first woman ever to win a nobel prize. She also changed history because of her being a woman. In her times, the late eighteen hundreds, women usually had minimal education. Marie Curie stood out from most woman at that time from her education. She was a role model for many young girls to aspire to. Marie Curie changed history in so many ways and if it weren't for her, how women are looked at and our knowledge of science. Marie Curie, in my opinion, changed history as we know it, and because of her, our world will never be the same. Taytum Timmerman Grade 6 East Amwell Township School There have been many people that have changed history. The person that I think has changed history the most was Abner Doubleday. I believe that he is the person who changed history the most because he invented the sport of baseball. He invented baseball in Cooperstown, New York in 1839. I believe that Abner Doubleday changed history more than anyone else because baseball is part of the most popular sports in America today, and people from other countries watch and play it. This was a good invention to history because baseball is what makes a lot of people's jobs today as they are professional athletes. Also, baseball is one of the oldest american sports, which means that there have been many players to play in the MLB to have a fun but hard experience. Without baseball, it wouldn't be as much fun in the world but because of Abner Doubleday, it is very fun in the United States and for people around the globe. Baseball also gives people good hand and eye coordination which gives people good motion of the hands leading the eyes, thanks to this same man. As you can see, Abner Doubleday has changed history the most out of anyone because he invented the great sport of baseball. Kyle Yasunas Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Thomas Jefferson was a Founding Father of the United States, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President of the US . Jefferson was a Republican arguing for liberty and democracy. Jefferson also wrote the Statute for Religious Freedom. Jefferson also has amazing knowledge in architecture, gardening, philosophy, literature and education.  When Jefferson was president, he signed a bill to ban the importation of slaves into the US . Scott Anderson Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Throughout history, there have been thousands of people who have changed aspects in our lives. In my opinion, Orville and Wilbur Wright changed how people would travel forever. The brothers started their experiments in 1896 at their bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. When they weren't working in the shop, they were building new mini gliders to test out on a beach in Kitty Hawk. It was December 17th, 1903 and it was a typical windy day in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Orville Wright was positioned on the Wright Brothers motor powered plane, ready to launch. Signaling to Wilbur Wright and his crew, he pulled the release cord and the engine started to run. Gradually, Orville Wright picked up speed as he rolled down the track and suddenly the plane rose into the air and flew. He may have only been airborne for twelve seconds, but those few moments made history and paved the way for the biggest changes in transportation ever known. People no longer needed to take long trips by car or foot across the country. They could now travel high in the skies at a much greater speed with more efficiency than before. The Wright Brothers had many accomplishments. As mentioned above, they made their first flight in 1903. In 1905, they were able to build an airplane that could fly for more than an hour and a half at a time. Then in 1908, Orville Wright made the world's first flight of over one hour at Fort Myer, Virginia. Finally in 1908, Wilbur Wright had made over one-hundred successful flights near Le Mas, France and the longest one was on December 31, and he set a record time of two hours and nineteen minutes. These accomplishments were what lead me to believe that Wilbur and Orville Wright were the two people who changed history the most. Jenna Castellano Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion Sir Isaac Newton changed history more than anyone else because he created the three laws of motion. He is the one who discovered gravity. He discovered gravity when he sitting under a apple tree and an apple fell on his head. He was also the one who realized that all the planets revolved around the sun. This is why I think Sir Isaac Newton was a very influential figure that changed history. Jess Dai Grade 6 East Amwell Township School There are many people who changed history, but I think that Thomas Edison changed history the most.  I think this because he invented the lightbulb.  After about 1,000 fails at the lightbulb, Thomas Edison finally got it to work.  As he said "I have not failed.  I have just found 10,000 ways that won't work." He never gave up. And he also said "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.  The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time."   Thomas Edison is who I think changed history the most. Anna Edwards Grade 6 East Amwell Township School The person who changed history the most was Bill Gates. Bill Gates' company Microsoft, has made computers and computer programing much more effective, helping launch us into the 21st century. In addition, he has donated millions of dollars to charities that aid the less fortunate.  Bill Gates was born in a time when computers were relatively nonexistent. Although the first computer was built around 10 years before his birth, Computers of the time were highly expensive, boxy, and slow. There was very little you could do with them. With the founding of Microsoft, Bill Gates helped create programs and computers that were years ahead of their time. Bill gates has also donated millions to charities worldwide. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation (A charity started by Gates and his Wife) has helped support the homeless and starving, as well as countries in the third world. Without Bill Gates the computer would likely be much less efficient than it is now, setting back worldwide sciences a great distance. Without the funding he has provided to worldwide charities, many hundreds more people would still be begging on the streets, as opposed to having access to soup kitchens and food banks. Colin Gill Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Martin Luther King Jr. is a name remembered throughout the United States. Dr. King impacted history by fighting for African Americans. He helped with the civil rights movement and gave speeches such as  the "I Have a Dream Speech". King helped African American people to have access to equal rights. Many believe that without him, African Americans would still be treated unfairly. Many people disagreed with him but he didn't let them stop him. Even after he received the Nobel Peace Prize, he continued on with the movement and even donated over 50,000 dollars to it. Martin Luther King Jr. has changed history and he should be remembered for his great accomplishments. Isabelle Heide Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In Atlanta, Georgia, on January 15, 1929 Martin Luther King Jr. was born.  Little did any one know that he was going to change history.  Growing up he had a older sister and a younger brother.  He attended segregated public schools and at the age of 15 was admitted to Morehouse College.  In college he studied medicine and law.   He married Coretta Scott in 1953 and lived in Montgomery, Alabama.  They had four children.  One of his most famous speeches was the "I Have A Dream" speech.  That very speech changed history for blacks because it then inspired thousands of blacks to fight for what's right and later changed history.  Now blacks are allowed to do whatever they want, that is under that law of course, all because of Martin Luther King Jr.   Gavin Horne Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, Steve Jobs changed history more than anyone else. He was the inventor of the iPhone, iPod, and iPad. He also worked at Apple. I think Steve Jobs changed history because all these devices are used in our everyday lives. Almost everyone has an iPhone or some kind of device made by apple.  Without Steve Jobs, I have no idea where we would be. There would probably be a lot more talking verbally, and not texting. These are just a few reasons why I think Steve Jobs changed history. Emily Osborne Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion Rosa Parks changed history the most. If it wasn't for her, nothing would have changed. She taught African Americans that they can do whatever they want. Without her nothing would have changed today. People would never have realized how unfair everything was. African Americans had to go different schools, drink out of different water fountains, and eat at different places. The most important was on the bus. If a white person was to come on the bus a African American would have to give up their seat. Rosa Parks refused to move and that's how she changed history. Hailey Payne Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I'm my opinion, the Wright brothers changed history the most. I think this because with the cities and places to travel, plane help us get there. They were the starting point of new vehicles being invented and this led up to have all of the different means of transportation that we have today. There discoveries have had many impacts on our planes today. Without their courage, the plane may have never been invented.  The brothers sparked the idea of transportation throughout the world. Because of them, people began to realize that they could make new transportation ideas or tweak older models. I hope now you can see why I think the Wright brothers changed history. Jeffrey Pursell Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, Steve Jobs changed history the most.  He was the co-founder of the popular company "Apple."  However, in my opinion, Steve Jobs didn't change history in a good way, but rather in a bad manner.  Steve Jobs may have created new technology that the world had never seen before, but what changes history the most is one thing: the iPhone.  With the first ever iPhone being released in 2007, we are now reaching the 10-year plateau of people being glued to their phones.  Many people grab them and can't put them down and are generally wasting lots of time usually doing something pointless.  Also, these phones are causing the world to be less social which is not a good thing.  And by social, I mean verbally talking, not texting or using Snapchat or Instagram.  Even though Steve Jobs unfortunately passed away in October of 2011, his legacy lived on as new generations of the iPhone have been made all the way up to iPhone 7 as of September 16, 2016.  However, new generations of the iPhone have caused more people to use their phone.  That is how Jobs has changed history the most in a bad way.  He created the next generation of technology which caused people to use it for pointless reasons. Ryan Richardson Grade 6 East Amwell Township School James Naismith is probably someone you have never heard of before but a person who has changed history the most. James Naismith is the creator of basketball, which is the World's 9th most popular sport and America's 2nd most popular sport. The creator James Naismith was a college professor who wanted students to have something to do in the winter so he invented game that has been changed so much. Since the sport of basketball has such a huge impact on the world he has changed history more than anyone else. He not only invented the popular sport of basketball, but he came up with the first football helmets and much more. William Foley Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, Marshall Mathers changed history a lot in the music industry. From We Made You to Mockingbird all of his songs show off his comedic side and some can be very relatable. Also known as Eminem, he has been an idol for many teens who "have a dream and a rap magazine". His songs bring joy to many people. He also expresses serious problems through some of them such as his family life and how he struggled with raising his daughter. Eminem's movie 8-Mile expresses some of his emotions and how tough his life was. This led to him creating music for other people to enjoy. The good thing is that he is still alive and well and will hopefully produce more music to meet the needs of some teens who need it. Evan Gambrill Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I think the most important person in history is Franklin D Roosevelt who was the 32nd president of the United States. He is the person that got America through the Great Depression. He was the president that started the Manhattan Project. He was the president that almost won World War II. Franklin D Roosevelt sent help to the British to fight the Nazis. During World War I he was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Franklin D Roosevelt got America through the toughest times and the biggest of wars. Eugene Loughlin     Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I think that Martin Luther King Jr. is a person that has changed the world. Martin Luther King Jr. was a honorable person who believed in peace and justice, who wanted more freedom for black Americans. He specifically believed that African-Americans were disadvantaged. This gave everyone equal rights. He was also known to be in the Civil Rights Movement. Which were goals to end racial segregation. I'm determined to think everyone will not forget what Martin Luther King Jr. did between 1955 and 1968. Francesca Mora Grade 6 East Amwell Township School There have been many heroes in this world that have changed our lives. But the one person I think that had a big impact on this world was Jackie Robinson. He was the first African-American baseball player. Jackie Robinson was born on January 31, 1919. He broke the baseball color line by joining the Brooklyn Dodgers. He was a second baseman. But on April 15,1947 the Dodgers started him at first base in his first game. Since the Dodgers played Jackie Robinson they did get a lot of negative comebacks from other teams and the crowd. With all his hard work and determination he reached the hall of fame in 1962. As we can see now, the move the Dodgers made by playing Jackie Robinson, affected many sports. Because of him we have so many African American legends in MLB such as Jimmy Rollins, Ryan Howard,  Willie Mays, Reggie Jackson, Eddie Murray, Torii Hunter,  and Hank Aaronds. Nek Patel Grade 6 East Amwell Township School I think that Marquis de Lafayette (full name:Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roche Gilbert du Motier Marquis de lafayette) changed history more than anyone else. Marquis de Lafayette was a frenchman who lived during the American Revolution. After his parents and grandfather died, he joined the royal navy. Hearing the struggles of the colonists, he sailed to America to join the fight. During the American revolution, the colonists were not doing very well against the British and the Hessians. Arguably the only reason that the colonists won was that they got some very well timed help from the French. In both the battle of Chesapeake and the battle of Yorktown as well as many other key battles, the French aided the colonists. One of the most important and surely the most famous figure in the French navy was Marquis de Lafayette. He was admired upon from the colonists because  he did not request a pay for his service, and was proud of America as if it was his country. He also made close bonds with General Washington when Marquis de Lafayette got shot in the leg on the battlefield. Washington made sure that the doctors took good care of him. This created a bond that Washington took to his grave. The reason that I think Lafayette changed history so much is because if it were not for him, America would not exist as it does now. If America didn't exist, then many, many crucial inventions would probably not exist. The phone would not exist, the computer would not exist, the whole internet would not exist. For more basic things, microwaves would not exist, chocolate-chip cookies would not exist, even potato chips might not exist! Another important invention, evil as it may be, the nuclear bomb would not exist. This may lead to prolonging of wars, because people would not be scared to start a war with the would-be-non-existent-America. The above reasons are why I think  Marquis de Lafayette changed history (for better or for worse)  more.   Juno Pelczar Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Harriet Tubman was a person who changed history. Harriet Tubman changed history because she helped slaves escape from their slave owners. Harriet Tubman in 1849 is when she freed the slaves using this thing called the underground railroad. The underground railroad is when Harriet Tubman than anyone else. Logan Rzasa      Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Harriet Tubman has been such an inspiration to people in this day in age. Harriet Tubman helped over three hundred slaves escape harsh conditions through the creation of the Underground Railroad. This railroad was not really underground, but safe houses set up so slaves can travel at night and stay in the houses during the night. This brave and confident woman was born as a slave.  We have to give this woman a lot of credit. She has been a big positive impact on today's society. Leah Scialla Grade 6 East Amwell Township School In my opinion, Abraham Lincoln changed history the more than anyone else. Lincoln was the president during the Civil War,helped end slavery, and won the battle.He also won the Battle of Gettysburg. Lincoln was a very good president and improved the United States. As you can see, Abraham Lincoln changed history. Brennan Totten    Grade 6 East Amwell Township School Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton changed history. These women lead the woman's right movement. Anthony focused on the business part while Stanton focused more on the writing. They both edited the women's newspaper, better known as the Revolution. They were the perfect pair for the job, while Anthony was the brains, Stanton was the master of words. They went through many struggles getting to their goal. One challenge was that people were making jokes about their hard work. People would say they thought their goal were as important as George Washington. Although they went through many challenges they still met their goal, that is why women are able to vote and have the same rights as men. Their hard work and determination show you to never give up.

(PTI) The government today said the US-based iPhone maker Apple has indicated plans for introduction of selective manufacturing lines in the country this year. However, no decision has been taken yet on concessions demanded by the US-based company for setting up local manufacturing facility in the country, Commerce and Industry Ministry Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha. “Apple in their communications, indicated their plan for selective introduction of manufacturing lines in Spring 2017,” Sitharaman said in a written reply. Apple has sought concessions such as duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment for smartphone manufacturing and service/repair for a period of 15 years. With sales tapering in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world -- and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does this through contract manufacturers. The company sells products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro. Replying to a separate question, she said that cement demand is expected to increase in the next financial year on account of various flagship programmes of the government such as ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, Smart Cities Mission, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Freight and Industrial Corridors and National Highways Expansion. tags Apple iPhone manufacturing iPhone Make In India Nirmala Sitharaman more from business Hyundai Motor India announces promotions of top officials in management Apr 12, 2017 17:33 IST Postal department deficit widens to Rs 11,000 cr Apr 12, 2017 17:29 IST Worth a Thousand Words- Make Your Smartphone Photography Smarter Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Apple Concentrates Market to Spread a Predictable Worth of US$ 3,707.3 Million by 2026 Persistence Market Research, in its recently published report titled “Global Market Study on Apple Concentrate: Liquid Concentrate Segment Anticipated to Register the Highest CAGR in Terms of Value over the Forecast Period ”, predicts that the global apple concentrate market will witness modest growth during the next decade. In terms of volume, the global apple concentrate market will cross 3 million tonnes by 2026. By revenues, this US$ 2.0 Bn market is likely to see a promising CAGR of 5.6% through 2026. Request to view Table of Content @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/apple-f… Juice Concentrate Sub-segment will Maintain 90%+ Revenue Share Throughout the Forecast Period Demand for liquid apple concentrates will continue to rake in the bulk of market revenues, with the solid apple concentrate segment projected to account for a paltry 11% revenue share of the market. Used widely in juices, vinegar, ciders, bakery, and other products, the juice concentrate sub-segment will maintain 90%+ revenue share throughout the forecast period. By application, beverages will continue to account for the highest demand for apple concentrates, with juices and ciders accounting for the highest consumption. Within the food segment, bakery and confectionary will lead, followed by the dairy and frozen products sub-segment. New Concentrate Products and Non-GMO Apple Varieties will Continue to Enter the Market Launch of new apple concentrate-based products will continue to remain a pervasive trend. Supported by diverse products, the market will also be favored by another strong supply-side driver – competitive production costs. Consumer preference for apple concentrate over apple fruit will persist, as it offers the same nutrient content as apple but with an extended shelf-life suitable for transportation, storage, and usage. Sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5915 Consumer preference for non-GMO products will influence the global apple concentrate market, with demand for non-GMO variants expected to witness a steady uptick during the forecast period. Adoption of non-GMO apple concentrate is steadily growing in the F&B sector, which currently relies heavily on organic apples for its range of ‘health and wellness’ offerings. APEJ to Remain the Most Lucrative Market APEJ will maintain its preeminent position over the next decade, expanding at a robust CAGR of 10.8% in terms of value. China will remain the largest producer of apple concentrate, maintaining over 75% share by production capacity throughout the forecast period. Australia, New Zealand, and India will be the other lucrative markets in APEJ.

In terms of volume, the global apple concentrate market will cross 3 million tonnes by 2026. By revenues, this US$ 2.0 Bn market is likely to see a promising CAGR of 5.6% through 2026. Request to view Table of Content @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/apple-f… Juice Concentrate Sub-segment will Maintain 90%+ Revenue Share Throughout the Forecast Period Demand for liquid apple concentrates will continue to rake in the bulk of market revenues, with the solid apple concentrate segment projected to account for a paltry 11% revenue share of the market. Used widely in juices, vinegar, ciders, bakery, and other products, the juice concentrate sub-segment will maintain 90%+ revenue share throughout the forecast period. By application, beverages will continue to account for the highest demand for apple concentrates, with juices and ciders accounting for the highest consumption. Within the food segment, bakery and confectionary will lead, followed by the dairy and frozen products sub-segment. New Concentrate Products and Non-GMO Apple Varieties will Continue to Enter the Market Launch of new apple concentrate-based products will continue to remain a pervasive trend. Supported by diverse products, the market will also be favored by another strong supply-side driver – competitive production costs. Consumer preference for apple concentrate over apple fruit will persist, as it offers the same nutrient content as apple but with an extended shelf-life suitable for transportation, storage, and usage. Sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5915 Consumer preference for non-GMO products will influence the global apple concentrate market, with demand for non-GMO variants expected to witness a steady uptick during the forecast period. Adoption of non-GMO apple concentrate is steadily growing in the F&B sector, which currently relies heavily on organic apples for its range of ‘health and wellness’ offerings. APEJ to Remain the Most Lucrative Market APEJ will maintain its preeminent position over the next decade, expanding at a robust CAGR of 10.8% in terms of value. China will remain the largest producer of apple concentrate, maintaining over 75% share by production capacity throughout the forecast period. Australia, New Zealand, and India will be the other lucrative markets in APEJ. While APEJ will witness steady growth, markets in North America and Japan are projected to witness sluggish growth over the forecast period. Low production-high demand will shape-up the market in MEA, wherein maximum consumption will be registered by GCC countries.

The government today said the US-based iPhone maker Apple has indicated plans for introduction of selective manufacturing lines in the country this year. However, no decision has been taken yet on concessions demanded by the US-based company for setting up local manufacturing facility in the country, Commerce and Industry Ministry Nirmala Sitharaman informed the Rajya Sabha. "Apple in their communications, indicated their plan for selective introduction of manufacturing lines in Spring 2017," Sitharaman said in a written reply. Apple has sought concessions such as duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment for smartphone manufacturing and service/repair for a period of 15 years. With sales tapering in the US and China, Apple is eyeing India -- the fastest-growing smartphone market in the world -- and looking to set up a local manufacturing unit to cut costs. It, however, does not manufacture devices on its own and rather does this through contract manufacturers. The company sells products through Apple-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others. It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.Replying to a separate question, she said that cement demand is expected to increase in the next financial year on account of various flagship programmes of the government such as 'Housing for All' by 2022, Smart Cities Mission, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Freight and Industrial Corridors and National Highways Expansion. tags #Apple #Business #Companies #iPhone Related news Business Cement market doing well; expect capacity utilisation to be 80-90%: Barak Valley Apr 13, 2017 12:12 PM Business Infosys Q4: With new payout policy, co may be positioning itself as a dividend yield play Apr 13, 2017 12:02 PM Business Have to live with visa issue,local-global talent mix must: Infosys Apr 13, 2017 11:39 AM Business Ceat may set up manufacturing plant &amp; IT backend unit in Punjab Apr 13, 2017 11:35 AM Business IDFC Alternatives eyes First Solar's assets in India for $200 million: Sources Apr 13, 2017 11:30 AM Business India Inc's March M&A deal tally jumps 4-fold to $28 bn Apr 13, 2017 11:24 AM Business EPFO members to get loyalty-cum-life benefit of up to Rs 50,000 Apr 13, 2017 11:21 AM Business Infosys names Ravi Venkatesan as co-Chairman Apr 13, 2017 10:37 AM Business Infosys Q4 2017 results Live: Group attrition healthy at 17%, says Sikka Apr 13, 2017 09:56 AM News Most Popular Top News Maybe it's time for hostile takeovers; govt must back honest risks: Uday Kotak D-Mart bumper listing: Should you buy, book profits or hold shares?

Has Apple stopped innovating? Apple Throughout The Years and the Death of Steve Jobs Apple gained prominence in the “portables” market with the release of a genuine musical marvel, the iPod. It followed this up with several variations ranging from medium to small, screenless to a full screen and it even featured a little device that was perpetually on shuffle. Its computing line wasn’t too shabby either with the iMac, MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air. Admittedly, they weren’t the most cost-effective products, but boy did they do their jobs really well and they were as aesthetically pleasing as a computer could ever be. Their prior innovations with the iPod and the first line of iPhones, coupled with their sophisticated design motifs pretty reinvented how we interacted with our portables. Needless to say, there were a lot of hits. Apple Today However, after the death of Apple’s figurehead Steve Jobs, in seemed like there was nothing new coming from the brand in Cupertino. There were new renditions of familiar products with slight variations in shape, size and weight, the hardware has been improved significantly – which is the case for everyone and there were a couple of small additions like Apple Pay, the Apple Watch and of course the new Touch Bar. A post shared by Steve Jobs  (@stevejobs.official) on Feb 1, 2017 at 1:19am PST It somehow seems like Apple hasn’t been releasing anything groundbreaking, and we’re forced to succumb to staggered updates of our well-loved devices. Regardless if some people think its bad marketing, it seems to be working. Apple is now regarded as an almost luxury brand in many markets, and owning a couple of devices is symbolistic of accumulated wealth. But the people seem to want more. According to the NPR, “But, for now, the iPhone is still a product that a lot of people love. Enough for Apple to still be the most valuable company in the world.” We still have yet to see if Apple releases something revolutionary sometime soon… but let’s give the iPhone 8 a try.

Trending in Apple Opinion: Apple’s rare change of mind is great news for Mac users, pro & non-pro alike Yesterday AAPL: 141.80 0.17 NYU student reports on life as an iPhone factory worker after 6-week undercover mission Ben Lovejoy - Apr. 12th 2017 4:27 am PT @benlovejoy iPhone Pegatron View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You might expect an NYU student to seek out a summer internship doing something more interesting than spending 12 hours a day inserting a single screw into an endless production line of iPhones, but Dejian Zeng did exactly that for his summer project. He wanted to find out what life was like for workers in an iPhone factory, so spent six weeks as a Pegatron worker in a facility on the outskirts of Shanghai. He reported back on everything from the sleeping patterns to the need to download apps to qualify for free Wi-Fi access in the dorms … NordVPN In an interview with Business Insider, Zeng said that the typical working day, including overtime, short breaks and security checks was about 12.5 hours. 30 minutes to clear security to enter the factory 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2 hours of work 50-minute lunch break 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2 hours of work 10-minute break 2.5 hours of overtime The overtime is theoretically voluntary, Zeng says, but not so much in practice. The overtime thing, from my experience, it’s involuntary. You can’t leave easily. And then every time you ask, “Can I leave?” they would just say, “You have to work on the assembly line.” And so you know that every station needs to have somebody doing it. And if you leave, who is going to do it? It’s not easy to ask to not do overtime. It’s involuntary. I would say that’s the issue. Workers don’t have a choice. If I don’t want to work, if I’m really tired today and I don’t want to work, I can’t do that. I think that’s the issue. Even where workers actively seek overtime, he says, that’s due to financial pressure. Sometimes you hear about a worker who demands that “I want to work overtime. I want that money.” But they are being pushed to that path because the base salary is just too low. I can’t make a living without doing overtime, that’s why I “volunteer,” quote unquote, to do that. The factories know it also. The workers, too. They know that when you get into the factory, you need to do overtime to get your payment. Apple told BI that it requires its suppliers to limit working weeks to a maximum of 60 hours, and that audits – including no fewer than 16 at the factory where Zeng worked – showed 99% compliance. In its most recent Supplier Responsibility report, Apple said that compliance across its supply chain was 98%. Zeng says he suspects Pegatron has a way to hack the audits, but he doesn’t know how. I think they have a different standard during busy season and not busy season. I don’t know how the factory gets past the system where workers need to record their working time. Because when you go to work, you swipe your card. And my friend said they do swipe their cards when they work on Sunday. And I think it’s an obvious violation of Apple policy. I don’t know how the factory gets past that. Pegatron was, though, very sensitive when Apple staff were visiting. They tell you. They say, “The client is here.” They call Apple “the client.” Sometimes Apple staff comes to do an audit or something like that. They walk around the assembly line. They were always very serious about it, and we would be told, “The client is here.” Pegatron was serious about safety training, he said, because Apple monitored it carefully. But the company had a simple way to deal with tiredness. When the subfactory’s leader comes, they say, “Listen, are you pregnant? Raise your hand.” And then nobody did. And then he said, “If you think you are going to be too tired standing up, you can come up to me now.” […] And then nobody stood up. The reason […] is that if somebody stood up, they lost their job. He claimed that because Apple monitored worker evaluation of the company’s training, workers were told they had to rate the quality highly. It was a scale where one was the worst and five was the best. They said we could do four or five. And so everybody did four and five, and they submitted it. Zeng also said that opportunities for education and training were in practice limited by the hours people work. In the new report, they said a lot of workers get opportunities for training in some programs — they can develop their careers and stuff like that. But when you are working 12 hours, you are exhausted. And the only thing you want is some rest, and there’s not enough time for that. When it comes to time off, workers have access to Wi-Fi in the dorms where they live eight to a room, but need to either pay for it or download apps to qualify for free access. To access the Wi-Fi, you need to do something. You need to either download some apps for them or click something — comments or something — to earn some virtual coins. You use the coins to get on the Wi-Fi. Twenty-four hours is 20 coins. And then downloading apps sometimes are like 20 to 30 coins or something. So is it you can buy coins — like I remember it’s like 100 coins about 5 yuan, something like that. But a lot of people just keep downloading. It’s like a business. You need to need to do that to get access to Wi-Fi. The obvious suspicion here is that the system is being used to inflate download numbers for apps, presumably in return for payment to Pegatron. The work is repetitive, he said. At first it’s hard to keep up with the speed of the production line even carrying out a simple task, but eventually you can do it with your eyes closed. One of his jobs, he said, was to put a single screw into the speaker on the case. The first couple of days you’re very concentrated because you couldn’t catch up the speed of the assembly line. You need to be very quick to catch up. So you’re very, very focused. It makes you very tired, but it keeps your mind on it. You have no time to think about things. I need to get quicker and quicker. And then, after awhile, you get more familiar to it, and that in the end, I can even do this screw by closing my eyes. Workers are not allowed to bring electronic devices into the factory, so they cannot alleviate the boredom by listening to music or podcasts. He said that production of pre-production iPhones was easier but especially boring because of the slow pace. He worked on a trial production of the iPhone 7. Because one day for 12 hours, you only produce five phones. You sit there and have nothing to do, waiting for two hours. Sometimes they don’t allow you to speak. You just sit there quietly and have nothing to do, and wait until the next phone comes in. You’re trying to assemble it, and then you put it back and you wait for another few hours for the next one to come in. Zeng said that stories of the pay being really high by local standards weren’t true – the role was equivalent to being a security guard or housekeeper – but it is easy work to get. Because you need no skills, you just get into the factories. They don’t even ask you any questions. During the interview, you can just get in that day. And then they take care of your meals and your dorm. Zeng also joined the many people casting doubt on the idea that Apple could bring iPhone production to the USA. Chinese people are getting 2320 yuan, which is about $400 per month. How much are you going to pay for the US workers in terms of base salary? If it really happened, if factories actually really moved to the US, I won’t see it create a lot of jobs. I would see workers getting replaced by a lot of machines, because a lot of the work I see in the factory can actually be done by machine. The only reason why we do it is because the labor is even cheaper than the machine. The whole piece is worth a read.

That's why, each year, we evaluate the top notebook manufacturers and publish our Best and Worst Laptop Brands rankings. For 2017, Lenovo has knocked Apple out of its long-held top position. Asus and Dell take second and third place. To pick the winners, losers and also-rans, we evaluated the 10 biggest laptop brands to determine which offer the best combination of quality products, cutting-edge innovation, helpful support, sleek designs and strong value. Because of its modest review scores, expensive products and lack of ports, Apple fell all the way down to fifth place after receiving top honors every year since the Best and Worst Brands debuted in 2010. Lenovo leaped into first place on the strength of its many highly-rated laptops, groundbreaking technologies and vastly improved customer support. Asus took second, thanks to a deep, value-filled lineup. Dell rounded out the top three on the strength of its superior premium laptops and helpful warranty coverage. See how all the brands fared below, and how we evaluated them.   1. Lenovo (90/100) When 58 percent of your laptops get a rating of 4 stars or better, you're having a great year. Lenovo wowed us with laptops that had epic battery life (three different ThinkPads lasted more than 17 hours on a charge), gorgeous designs like the bezel-free screen on the Yoga 910 and innovative features like the Halo keyboard on the Yoga Book. The company also provided helpful support with no hold times in our tests. Best Lenovo Laptops | See Lenovo's Full Report Card   2. Asus (86/100) If you're looking for the best combination of quality and features for the money, look no further than Asus. The company also does a fantastic job of pushing the innovation envelope with a high-end, water-cooled gaming rig and eye-popping designs, like the royal-blue-and-gold aluminum chassis on the ZenBook 3. Best Asus Laptops | See Asus' Full Report Card   3. Dell (83/100) Dell has an extremely compelling laptop lineup, headlined by the Dell XPS 13, our favorite notebook overall, the XPS 15 and the company's Alienware gaming rigs. The company pushed the boundaries of design and functionality this year by offering an OLED screen on the Alienware 13, and by developing the super-svelte XPS 13 2-in-1. Dell also offers a strong factory warranty with plenty of options to extend your coverage. Best Dell Laptops | See Dell's Full Report Card   4. HP (82/100) HP combines a broad overall lineup with a few great Ultrabooks and strong warranty coverage. Best HP Laptops | See HP's Full Report Card   5. Apple (78/100) The company's MacBooks are slim, powerful and well-built, but you'll need pile of money and a bagful of dongles. The company's support and warranty options are second to none.

However, many of its products got middling ratings. Best Acer Laptops | See Acer's Full Report Card   7. MSI (76/100) MSI has a wide selection of gaming laptops, many with powerful specs and innovative features. However, its tech support is among the worst we tested. Best MSI Laptops | See MSI's Full Report Card   8. Razer (73/100) Included in our Best and Worst Brands ratings for the first time this year, Razer makes a handful of high-quality gaming laptops and Ultrabooks. The company's products are strong, but its support falls short. See Razer's Full Report Card   9. Samsung (68/100) The company makes a couple of innovative Chromebooks, but most of its small selection of laptops got middle-of-the-road ratings. The company's tech support resources are also disappointing. Best Samsung Laptops | See Samsung's Full Report Card   10. Microsoft (66/100) Microsoft ranks lowest, because the company did hardly anything new during our test period. Its only new laptop was the Surface Book with Performance Base, and just the dock was new. Still, the company's handful of premium 2-in-1s are pretty good choices, if you can afford them. See Microsoft's Full Report Card   How We Rate Brands Each company is assigned a score based on a 100-point scale. Points are awarded in six different categories: Design, Reviews, Tech Support, Warranty, Innovation and Value and Selection. Here's what each means. Reviews (35 points):The most important aspect of any brand is the quality of its products. To determine a company's Reviews category score, we used the ratings we gave its laptops between Feb. 1, 2016, and Feb. 28, 2017. We took the average laptop rating for each brand (Laptop Mag rates on 1 to 5 scales), converted that average rating to a 35-point scale, and then added a 0.5-point bonus for each Editors’ Choice award. Design (15 points): We absolutely will judge a notebook by its cover — and its sides, deck, bezel and base. Though no two notebooks look exactly the same, each brand has a design language that cuts across its product lines. Brand Reviews (35) Design (15) Support (20) Innovation (10) Value & Selection (15) Warranty (5) Overall (100) Lenovo 31 14 17 10 14 4 90 ASUS 30 15 14 9 15 3 86 Dell 26 13 15 9 15 5 83 HP 27 14 16 7 14 4 82 Acer 27 12 18 6 13 2 78 Apple 28 13 19 7 6 5 78 MSI 30 10 13 8 11 4 76 Razer 28 11 15 8 8 3 73 Samsung 25 11 13 6 10 3 68 Microsoft 29 9 16 4 5 3 66 Tech Support (20 points): When you buy a laptop, you want to know that the manufacturer is going to stand behind it and help you with technical problems. We base this score on the ratings from our annual Tech Support Showdown, where we go undercover and pose questions to all of the companies, using their phone, web and social channels. To reach our score out of 20 points, we divided the last Tech Support Showdown rating, which is out of 100, by 5. Innovation (10 points): The laptop market is moving fast, and if you stand still, you'll get rolled over. For the Innovation category, we awarded points based on the brand's ability to move the market forward by implementing or developing new technologies, as well as taking risks. Value and Selection (15 points): How many different kinds of shoppers does the manufacturer address, and do the products provide good bang for your buck? For this category, we awarded points for offering a wide range of laptop types (budget, business, gaming, etc.) and for providing aggressive pricing. Warranty (5 points): If something goes wrong with your laptop, how easy will it be to get it serviced? Most companies offer a standard one-year warranty; but some make you pay for shipping when you send in a product for repairs. Companies got credit for selling laptops with longer warranties or free accidental-damage protection and for offering a variety of extended warranty options. They lost some credit for policies that void your warranty for upgrading the RAM or for passing along the shipping costs.   Comings and Goings This year was the first year we included Razer laptops on our list, because we felt that the company has become a large-enough player in the industry to evaluate. By the same token, we removed Toshiba from our list after that company stopped selling consumer laptops in the U.S. market.

Mikael D Says: April 12th, 2017 at 8:31 am Why didn't you test any of System76's laptops? DAStagg Says: April 11th, 2017 at 6:06 pm Very impressive, but the downfall of these laptops is the operating system, Microsoft Windows. In 2009 I threw the complete Windows IT systems out and changed my complete office to Apple. Result, not one minute of downtime, no more blue screens, OS updates possible without the need to reinstall all the programmes. This increased productivity! Since the change I have never looked back. I am not married to Apple but they produce thetop quality products I need for my business. If the top laptops in the said test were equipped with the Mac OS and were as reliable as the MacBooks I have in my office then I might be inclined to consider using one of these but only as a test. JohnF Says: April 11th, 2017 at 12:18 pm DELL - XPS or Inspiron 7000 series. Period. I have owned at least 2 dozen since the 90s and have never been sorry. They work well, easy to repair, the support website is up 24x7, drivers are easy to find and install, you can use Chat to talk to techs for issues, and they last for years. Sure there are haters and horror stories - they exist for every brand. I have worked with all brands for some 30 years now and I ONLY buy Dell. Robert P. Hartle Says: April 10th, 2017 at 10:05 pm I'll take the user experience of a Macbook Pro over any of the others... Testing is subjective at best.. Using them to run a Digital Media Business since 2011... Priceless. Joe Bean Says: April 10th, 2017 at 3:27 pm This is interesting, but it lacks something very important: reliability. This should have a lot of weight. If you buy laptops that breaks after 3-4 years vs lasting 6-8 years, you are paying much more than for a better brand. Asus used to have much more reliable laptops, along with Apple. Where is everybody standing now? It is not fun to buy a premium laptop if you have one chance out of five to have an issue during the first year. Sure, warranty is nice, but it is much better to not have issues in the first place. Aravind Says: April 10th, 2017 at 12:56 pm Totally agreable. Just cant believe the huge variations that have taken place in the list. Ronald Abate Says: April 10th, 2017 at 10:06 am I have been using a Toshiba Chromebook for 3 years. I will NEVER go back to using Apple or Microsoft. Chromebooks are tops for cost and reliability; and they are FAST! Christoph THOMAS Says: April 10th, 2017 at 9:28 am Apple? They should not be in here - they are nice shiny objects to impress people with - but laptops ? What laptops ? Michael Pyae Says: April 10th, 2017 at 1:09 am My really favorite laptop brands are Dell and Apple. Mike Brad Says: April 1st, 2017 at 10:59 pm I've had and continue to enjoy my HP Spectre 14 since 2012. Best laptop I've ever had, best keyboard, definitely a quality built machine. mjburke Says: March 27th, 2017 at 10:55 pm my MacBook pro is 9 years old and zero trouble it has a 2.66 G processor 4 G memory -i am writer so plenty space for me Ive spent $100 total -had it cleaned up as it slowed down over years, i had lot of crap on it, and now its back to great battery last 7-9 hours a bargin Vince Says: March 18th, 2017 at 1:43 pm Bought a ASUS (2016)from Best Buy on their recommendation. Must have gotten the one piece of crap they manufactured that year. Complained to ASUS and they wanted me to send it to them for up to several? weeks without a replacement or substitute, which I couldn't do. So, I'm putting up with multiple, and very frustrating issues, including a cursor that decides to move itself in the middle of typing, which somewhat destroys the text. Other issues equally frustrating. I'd be hard pressed to buy another one, especially because of the poor customer service. brittany spencer Says: March 16th, 2017 at 10:27 pm ahahah what? dell is trash. i tried to buy a dell xps. without warning, the product (that was out for delivery) was marked as "return to sender". The dep't that handles that was closed until Monday. My credit card had been charged. I call Monday. I'm told the dep't I need won't be open for another hour and to call back (after waiting on hold for 20 minutes). I call back. I get disconnected after 15 minutes of waiting. I get a hold of someone who was incredibly rude. He hangs up on me. I get transferred. I'm promised a refund that would happen 5 days later. It's been 10 days and I still haven't been refunded and I've had to file a dispute with my bank. I'm bamboozled by this rating. Joe Smith Says: March 16th, 2017 at 3:55 pm Reviews are worth the most? Yeah, cuz that makes sense since the Apple fan boys could have their house burn down and lose their family due to a laptop explosion and they'd still praise it.. John udo Says: March 13th, 2017 at 8:02 am I want to buy a labtop i this week.who can help me please Can i buy dell or toshiba labtop? Ur advise sbould be with specification .thank you ! Colin Tsang Says: March 12th, 2017 at 4:14 am Tuning in really hard and shity torrie Says: February 23rd, 2017 at 3:17 pm To add to my previous comment... I meant bottom left corner. Other people have been having a similar issue since 2008 and HP has done nothing to fix it but one recall. The two broken laptops have the same issue. They are both HP Envies. Just stating why I hate HP and I'm hoping to help others from potentially wasting their money and the hassle. torrie Says: February 23rd, 2017 at 3:10 pm I used to have a fairly decent experience with HP. My first laptop is an HP I got from Walmart that's still kicking. However, my most recent HP laptop is horrible. There literally is no fix. The issue that I'm having dates back to 2008 and unfortunately stuck with 2 broken laptops and possibly a 3rd one. Do not buy HP. Save yourself the trouble. I took one of my two broken laptops to get repaired and it would cost about $300 to fix plus! It was not a guarantee fix! It could break in the left bottom of the case again even if I got it "repaired". Never again will I buy HP... I hope no one else will have to go through this and waste hundreds of dollars for a computer to work for about a few months to a year... smith Says: February 15th, 2017 at 3:37 pm I want best please recommend the best smart faster leptop Read Square Trade Says: January 27th, 2017 at 7:36 am It all about overall quality that parts keep working together without any hardware problems. HP n' acer have weakest quality compared to asus /toshiba /sony. SquareTrade tells truth. Sriyanjan Says: January 9th, 2017 at 11:00 am Whatever hp envy series is the best Stephen Says: January 6th, 2017 at 9:06 pm I've had the same HP since 2007 and it is still working great. I don't understand why people do not like HP.

Droped it from three feet going on 4 years 3 months ,no issues. Have Acer and the H popped off LOL.(2 months in) William Fankboner Says: December 31st, 2016 at 3:41 pm I notice there's no category for RELIABILITY! How can you recommend laptops that have such abysmal ratings at Amazon? For example: Dell XPS models that more than 50% of the purchasers swear they wouldn't buy again? Srikanth Says: December 25th, 2016 at 8:11 am No way Dell can score so high for Warranty. Read my Reddit thread for more. https://www.reddit.com/r/Dell/comments/54popv/dells_ambiguous_warranty/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit Beherrel Says: December 20th, 2016 at 10:25 am Bought a Lenova laptop last year, three months later the screen died, very poor customer service. Will never buy a Lenova product again.

Glad I switched but I didn't say MSI was bad the reason I switched is I like ASUS' Laptop designs more. Robert Says: December 1st, 2016 at 6:15 pm How can you name Apple the best in warranty? They do not respect their warranty, they do not follow statutory rights. This article is simply paid and bought by apple-fanboys... gross Kevin Says: December 1st, 2016 at 5:17 am Typing this comment in my DELL Studio that I own for 5 years. Still packs a punch! Contrary to what people say with DELL, I have had no problems with it AT ALL. Owned a Toshiba and yes, Agree with it being the bottom on the list.

But Dell is not bed. Dumbphone Says: October 20th, 2016 at 9:21 am I suggest to add the iFixIt score of recent MacBooks (1 on 10) to the list of criteria, that would certainly change the ranking of those machines. Can't understand how Apple come so high with portable computers which lack certains keys (such as "delete" or "hashtag"), have no dedicated numeric keypad, no DVD-reader/burner, no more USB ports... 5 on 5 on software, are you kidding ? The only thing which is correct in your ranking is the 5 on 15 for value : really much too expensive for what you get. Lisa Parker Says: October 11th, 2016 at 1:54 pm I CAN'T BELIEVE HP PRODUCTS EVEN MAKE NUMBER SIXTH ON THE LIST.

Aravind Bharathi Says: October 3rd, 2016 at 5:17 am I agree with Gloverboy6, at the same time i bought the Asus Zenbook UX305 and its absoluteky amazing. Gloverboy6 Says: September 22nd, 2016 at 6:12 pm When will LaptopMag stop being so biased towards Apple? They have the least number of models of any manufacturing and they charge more for them spec for spec than any other manufacturer. Their tech support might be good (I wouldn't know personally), but all in all, you're just paying for them name. Maurits de Boer Says: September 21st, 2016 at 8:53 am Yup, Toshiba is rightfully on the bottom of the list. The toshiba laptop im on right now doesn't have WiFi if it doesn't run on full performance settings, so on settings "Balanced" & "Energy saving" WiFi doesn't work. Other than that... the UTP connection doesn't work, it stops working about every 2 to 4 months after which i have to factory reset it. Bought it at BCC, returned it twice, asked them to do more than just doing a factory reset. After getting it back from Toshiba, i noticed that all they did was reset it... I don't think laptops should be judged on their warranty, because so far, every warranty on Toshiba, HP, Dell and Packard Bell has been shit. The only thing that works is getting it to a local pc fixing company. Caradia Says: September 19th, 2016 at 11:01 am Stay away from Origin! $2500 laptop, completely died before even a year old. High end gaming laptop, wireless card went out in first month, then webcam went out, then the motherboard and hard drive went out. Still trying to get it to work after sending it in for a month of repair. Will probably be fighting them for a refund.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Analyst: Apple may be developing its own power management chips, could be veering away from Dialog Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Wednesday, April 12th, 2017, 05:33 Category: Hardware, iPhone, Processors, Rumor Apple may be developing its own power management chips according to a report from German private bank Bankhaus Lampe. The report, which was released on Tuesday, precipitated a sharp drop in the share price of Dialog Semiconductor, which functions as Apple’s current supplier. Per analyst Karsten Iltgen: “The teams of both companies collaborate very closely and thus, Dialog cannot be replaced by a third-party supplier. However, Apple itself could replace Dialog.” Iltgen’s analysis cited 16 different job openings on Apple’s website for analog/power management engineers for the design center in Munich alone. She also noted that industry sources have apparently spotted manufacturing samples for power management circuitry for Apple within the region. “The timetable seems to point to a potential application of the chips in the iPhone as of 2019,” the report said. The rumor also reflects events transpiring in the U.K., wherein Apple seems to be breaking away from Imagination Technologies Group in lieu of developing its own graphics processing units for forthcoming products. Imagination has questioned Apple’s ability to develop a GPU architecture from the ground up without infringing on the U.K. company’s intellectual property rights. For Apple, the moves could mean greater control over the components of its iPhone and other devices as it gears up for competition from rivals like Samsung Electronics. Xiaomi recently rolled out in February the Mi 5c built around its own Surge S1 processor, while Samsung uses its Exynos processors for some of its smartphones. Apple is said to be assembling an 80-person power management chip team. Diaglo’s team is said to consist of 1,200 engineers, including 900 chip designers, 500 of whom are said to be tasked exclusively to Apple’s needs. The Apple operation has reached a size that is starting to represent a threat for Dialog, according to Iltgen, who believes that a complete shift to Apple’s in-house development is unlikely in the short term. Apple and Dialog did not immediately reply for comment.

 Analysts think Synaptics is the company most at risk of being ditched by Apple next Rob Price Apr. 12, 2017, 7:41 AM 1,262 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook.Reuters/Beck Diefenbach Apple is increasingly ditching its suppliers and moving elements of its production in-house, and analysts have identified the company they think is most at risk of being "insourced" next: Synaptics. The Californian firm builds interface technologies, driver displays, and biometric tech, and is a partner of Apple. But analysts at Credit Suisse took a look at Apple suppliers who could face being insourced in a research note sent to investors on Tuesday, and concluded Synaptics was deemed most likely. It's worth noting that Credit Suisse's analysts don't seem to have any hard evidence that Apple is going to ditch Synaptics (like a leaked contract, say). They're just identifying the company as being, in their view, at particular risk, given certain public information. Why? They identify a few reasons. It would let Apple "optimize power and performance with its internal graphics engine," for one. And it would also "lessen [Apple's] reliance on Samsung for OLED displays." Apple and Samsung are long-time frenemies — the former relies on the latter for hardware components, even as they fight bitterly for dominance of the high-end smartphone market. Credit Suisse's prediction comes after Imagination Technologies, another Apple supplier, announced in early April that Apple was insourcing design of the graphics processing chips it had previously licensed from Imagination. The supplier was reliant on Apple for more than half of its revenue, and the decision saw its stock drop by more than 75% as analysts questioned whether the business was could remain viable without Apple's business. And another Apple supplier, Dialog, recently saw its stock tank 36% over fears it could lose its key contract with Apple. Credit Suisse rated RF Suppliers and Skyworks Solutions at "low" risk of being insourced, while Cirrus Logic was considered "medium to low." But Synaptics was graded as being at "medium to high" risk. Synaptics was a supplier for Apple back in the iPod click wheel era, but Apple subsequently transitioned away, according to The Motley Fool. More recently, Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers, an Apple supplier, for $475 million — making Apple a Synaptics customer once again. Synaptics has a market cap of $1.86 billion, and its stock was largely unchanged in after-hours trading. A spokesperson declined to comment. The NASDAQ-listed firm's stocks were trading at $51.80 (£41.50) at the close on Tuesday: Google Here's what Credit Suisse said about Synaptics (emphasis ours): "Synaptics (SYNA, Sector Weight) Risk: Medium to High. We see moderate to high risk of Apple looking to insource its display driver IC, given (1) as we previously noted, Apple has hired a significant number of former Renesas RSP engineers, and (2) we believe Apple has been developing its own internal OLED DDIC. We believe Samsung will use its own internal DDIC for the OLED iPhone and Synaptics for the next- generation LCD smartphones. Why would it make sense? By optimizing and using its internal solution, Apple could optimize power and performance with its internal graphics engine. Additionally, it would lessen its reliance on Samsung for OLED displays. Conversely, if Apple were to use an internal solution, it would need to invest significant funds in ramping a support infrastructure, which is something Synaptics already has in place today."

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company?

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

I've been using a mac since my family acquired a bondi blue G3 iMac. Which, turns out, wasn't the most capable editing system. Fast forward through another couple of iMacs, an iBook, and a few macbook pros to now. 8K has changed the topography, and it's time to leave the cult of Apple until they build workstations again. Apple is successful because they are a marketing machine first, and a computer company second. They have clear lines. An iMac is an iMac, and always has been, and believe me, I'm cool with that. There are things that get my juices flowing, but lime green water cooling loops and RGB LED strips pulsating in coordination with the color scheme of my RAM sticks are not high on my list. Can someone please think of a catchier name than i7 6850k? Can someone please give me a laymen's explanation as to why the i7 5850EQ is a four core processor, and not a six? The previously mentioned i7 6850k is six. The i7 6900k has 8 cores. Is there an 8, anywhere in the god damn name? "K" is for "clocK"?! Why are there ----> 9 <---- versions of gigabyte's, oh wait, Aorus's motherboards - which thanks to a horrendous mobile implementation - are impossible to actually look at on their website. But that's the world I find myself in. Performance, with the aesthetic sensibilities of a 13 year old boy. Gaming rules the market. There's next to zero up to date information on the internet about building an editing system. I'm probably not looking in the right corners of the internet, but the only voice of authority worth listening to seems to be Puget Systems. Which, as valuable as it is, simply doesn't cover all the bases when it comes to workflow. Reviews and advice mostly cover performance in benchmarks (read: a bunch of teenagers with a measuring tape) and FPS in the latest and most hardware taxing murder simulation. If you do find any useful information for the creative field, it's almost statistically guaranteed to be a guid to building "the best and most beastly 4K editing beast on the planet." Great. 4K what? From your iPhone? Raw cDNG from a 5dmk3? R3d? H.265? Is your beast going to chew 8K, cuz my buddy, who edits a lot, his 5K iMac kills footage from my old scarlet mx, but the new stuff, it's killing him. I'm so tired of searching though non-relivent reviews and graphs and use cases that I don't give a damn about. I want to look at a list of specs, trust that it won't slow my RED based edit down (because some person told me it worked for them), and order all the parts with 1 day shipping. - I'm sure I'm not the only one looking for this kind of information, in this specific niche of a niche of a niche. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So. With a deep breath, let's consider everything above this line a bunch of bullshit. I propose a simple thread. A database of what works, and what doesn't. No asking for recommendations, or asking someone how they would spend your money in your shoes. Just the facts. ---> I have this machine, and it works this well, for this workflow. <--- What are your components? How does it perform? Doing what? Like this: Date: 4/12/17 Computer: Macbook Pro Late 2013 Processor: i7 4850HQ CPU Cooler: My thighs. Motherboard: Aesthetically pleasing. Memory: 16GB Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M System Drive: SSD - 256GB Cache: None. Working/Footage/Project: Depends on project, usually an external thunderbolt 2 OWC 20TB raid 0. 500+/- RW. Export Destination: Sometimes USB 3.0 attached SSD. Usually an external thunderbolt 5 disk Raid 5. 500+/- RW. NLE: Premiere Pro CC 17. External display: First gen Apple LED cinema display. Overall Performance: Exceedingly Lackluster. Like, I actually had problems exporting a PDF the other day. 8K RED workflow: 8K 14:1 + 7:1 - Working with 8K is essentially a non-starter in PP. No surprise here. 1/16th playback is smooth, once it gets going, but is below the threshold of usable clarity. Still, any cut or a switch to a new clip takes many seconds to take effect. Changes in lumetri color take between 5 and 50 seconds, and often do not appear at all. Importing a batch of clips can take much longer than anyone wants it to. Warp stabilizer analyzes at roughly 1 frame per 3 seconds. Media Encoder can take up to 28 hours to transcode a 1.5TB batch of clips to 4K ProRes. Also, 15 of the 218 failed. Turning off the mercury render engine allowed them to complete. Even the basic act of importing 218 clips into media encoder took 2 hours. Proxies are the only option. Had a strange bug in Redcine X - quite possibly user error - where footage looked fast forwarded after rendering. Side note: the same 218 clip batch took 4 days to crunch through in Redcine X. Usable files: 0. Clearly the macbook is nowhere near up to the task. No one's fault. Time to find a new hammer. 4K 6:1 RED workflow: Lame to uninspiring, as long as footage is being played off fast drives. Dropping playback to 1/4th to 1/8th is a must. Everything happens roughly 4 times faster than it does working with 8K. Weird. /s. Short form would be potentially possible. Long form would be a mollasus nightmare. 4K Other Codecs: Performance is fair, to crappy. A7S is terrible. Almost as unusable as 8K. ProRes is much better. Once you toss some color on there things get real choppy. 1080p: Sings like it's 2013. Writing Scripts: Breezy. The "N" key has begun to scratch away. Recommendations/Notes: Time to pass this one on to my mom and build a PC. My ideal set up would be a big quiet box that never slows me down, and a small laptop with a VPN connection to observe and control render cues. On the plus side, things are stable. Hardly a crash. Never a kernel panic. What would I have done differently? I don't think I would do anything differently. I don't really have that option, now do I? Last edited by Camen Hodges; Yesterday at 03:50 AM.

But has the EU commissioner bitten off more than she can chew? By Rowland Manthorpe 1 day ago WIRED By Rowland Manthorpe Wednesday 12 April 2017 Margarethe Vestager doesn't like being told what to do. A liberal in the classic style, she believes in free speech, free assembly, free trade - and choices free from undue influence. “Part of being not only a liberal, but also a human, is to make your own decisions,” she tells me. As European commissioner for competition, Vestager regulates commercial activity across the EU, making her one of the most consequential politicians in Europe. Her drive to self-determination is shaping a confrontation that could change the way technology is used across the world. The powerful men who run the world's biggest technology companies have discovered how hard Vestager, 49, is to sway. On January 21, 2016, Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, arrived in her office to discuss his company's tax arrangements, which the European Commission had been investigating since 2013. Vestager (pronounced Vest-ayer), who is Danish, has a reputation for both niceness and toughness: she prefers cordial discussion, but isn't afraid of confrontation if it comes. Yet, according to people briefed on the meeting, Cook tried to intimidate her, interrupting and even shouting. He lectured her on the correct approach to corporate tax. ADVERTISEMENT Loopholes and luxuries: how Apple, Facebook and Google stay ahead of the tax man Loopholes and luxuries: how Apple, Facebook and Google stay ahead of the tax man Facebook 20 Mar 2017 Seven months later, Vestager announced her verdict. Wearing a sky blue dress and a long silver link chain, she took the stage at the Commission press room, a muffled, sombre auditorium in the bowels of its hulking Berlaymont headquarters. In perennially gossipy Brussels, the delay sparked rumours that Vestager had cold feet. Instead, she calmly dropped a competition bombshell. READ NEXT Roaming charges across the EU will finally be scrapped on June 15 (but the UK could miss out) Roaming charges across the EU will finally be scrapped on June 15 (but the UK could miss out) By James Temperton Declaring that “Apple's tax benefits in Ireland are illegal”, Vestager ruled that the firm had colluded with the Irish Government to pay an effective tax rate of 0.05 per cent – and that it owed Ireland back taxes totalling €13 billion (£11bn), plus interest. In Cupertino, California, Cook was incensed. “It's total political crap,” he fumed, promptly vowing to appeal. No other watchdog has Vestager's powers to prosecute tax avoidance, levy multi-billion-dollar fines or force companies to make wholesale changes to their operations. She is the person Silicon Valley fears. Yet, if she feels the political pressure directed at her, she shows no sign of it. She jokes that she's a loyal Apple customer who just happens to oversee their business dealings. “I'm a law enforcer,” she shrugs. Her advice to Cook? “Play by the European rulebook.” Vestager says her decisions are based not on politics, but on facts alone. In her judgement, the facts show technology firms are abusing their power.

And for commercialising personal space to an unforeseen degree.” The invisible hand of Silicon Valley – the nudging swarm of algorithmically filtered data, pushing everything from travel routes to news stories – appears to her intrusive and dehumanising. “I know what I need. I don't want people to tell me what I need.” Apple is not the only firm facing questions from Vestager and her 900-person team. She is pursuing Amazon (over tax evasion), Qualcomm (for selling chips below cost) and Facebook (over its acquisition of WhatsApp). But the big test will be her antitrust case against Google, which accuses the search giant of using its dominance to stifle competition. Vestager, who began her five-year term as Commissioner in 2014, didn’t initiate the case, but she has taken it on in the most assertive manner. Her ruling is expected in the coming months and she appears unlikely to stay her hand. “What she is doing at the moment, in terms of competition policy, is really quite remarkable,” says Jacquelyn MacLennan, European partner at law firm White & Case. “She has strong powers and she will use them,” says French MEP Sylvie Goulard. “She has the character, she has the guts.” ADVERTISEMENT READ NEXT Amber Rudd and tech firms dodge encryption issue in 'lame' terror meeting Amber Rudd and tech firms dodge encryption issue in 'lame' terror meeting By James Temperton European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager ordered Apple to pay back €13 billion.

Inside the tenth-floor waiting room of the Berlaymont, flickering fluorescent bulbs illuminate a large potted fern and an empty coat rack made from the same drab white metal as the walls. This is where Vestager's visitors are deposited – she likes them to be left here, so she can greet them in person. “I've never met a politician who was so elaborate about her meetings,” says Jens Thomsen, author of a book about Vestager's first 100 days as commissioner. “She's trying to use every meeting to create the impression that she's not only a representative of the commission, but also an individual personality.” And then all of a sudden she is there, stepping briskly into the room, offering a handshake: “Welcome!” Timeline: Google's marathon antitrust case with the EU Timeline: Google's marathon antitrust case with the EU Google 1 day ago In person, Vestager is tall, with short dark hair streaked with grey. At official Commission events, she often stands out as a daub of colour amid a sea of grey. Today she's wearing a muted maroon dress, but in the weak winter sunshine, her office sparkles with colour. There's a Pollock-style group montage bearing the words “Love, revolution, the people,” a wooden stepladder (“If a woman wants to go places she should bring her own ladder”) and a cabinet stacked with family photos. That's the first thing she wants to know: whether or not I have children. Later she tells me, “You really should. That's the meaning of life.” READ NEXT Great Repeal Bill white paper reveals how Brexit will hit our UK laws and basic rights Great Repeal Bill white paper reveals how Brexit will hit our UK laws and basic rights By Liat Clark Born in 1968, Vestager grew up in the small town of Ølgod, on Denmark's windswept west coast. Her parents were both Lutheran rectors. In their busy, open house, she observed the cycle of births, weddings and funerals. “She was used to that – the whole village coming in – and, in a way, being in public all her life,” explains her biographer Elisabet Svane. “We have this community thing in Denmark. And that is very much her way of living.” From village life, Vestager learned the political arts of conflict and compromise. One story tells how, as a child, she was upset to see her father – a local politician in the Social Liberal Party, the Danish equivalent of the Liberal Democracts – arguing with constituents. Gradually, she realised that in politics, the arguments were the point. She joined the Social Liberals in 1989, running for parliament at the age of 21. She lost, but a few years later became its chair, then a minister, before becoming party leader in 2007. “When she started as a political leader, she was a disaster,” says Svane. “At that time she learned to go into conflict. It was a lesson to her: you have to stand up for your views, even though everyone thinks you're an idiot.” Bit by bit, Vestager was able to work towards power - although because her party was small, winning just 17 out of 179 seats in the 2011 election, that meant entering into coalition. A flavour of the negotiations for government were captured in the TV series Borgen, the writers of which credited Vestager as one of their inspirations. Like the main character, she reputedly said, “I'm not sure if I want to do a deal,” until she got the agreement she wanted. By the time she was finished, she was deputy prime minister and, in many estimations, Denmark's true leader. With the country's economy suffering after the financial crisis, she pushed through tough austerity measures, famously responding to accusations of callousness by saying, simply, “That’s the way it is.” Google tracks everything you do: here's how to delete it Google tracks everything you do: here's how to delete it Technology 20 Mar 2017 READ NEXT What Theresa May's Brexit plans could mean for you, your data and your privacy What Theresa May's Brexit plans could mean for you, your data and your privacy By Liat Clark Vestager speaks plainly and practically, framing complex questions of technology and law in everyday terms. Sometimes she plays the out-of-touch parent: “My children, they say, 'Oh Mum, you should stop texting, it makes you an old woman.' I say, 'Yes, but this is my thing.'“ Yet, in other ways she is technologically adventurous. On her phones - she has two, one personal and one for business - she keeps location tracking turned off. On one, she searches with Google. On the other, she uses DuckDuckGo, the search engine that doesn't track users or customise results. She also uses Microsoft's Bing. “Bing?“ I ask, surprised. Vestager looks pleased. “You can touch me,” she says, holding out her hand - as if to say, yes, there are Bing users, we exist. I ask what Bing is like. “It's different,” she replies after a moment. “It is different, because obviously they haven't as much history. And if you don't tell them where you are, you give them much less to work on. And then, of course, I get things that I would otherwise never ever have found.” READ NEXT Twitter's spam tools helped shut down 376,890 terrorist accounts in 6 months Twitter's spam tools helped shut down 376,890 terrorist accounts in 6 months By Liat Clark The question of what can and can't be found on Google runs to the heart of Vestager's toughest case. It dates back to 2005, when a British couple, Shivaun and Adam Raff, left their jobs and launched a price-comparison site at their home in the Berkshire village of Crowthorne. The pair had met as students and spent their careers working in technology. Shivaun, 49, managed software projects for Boots and General Motors. Adam, 50, looked after the European weather-forecasting service's supercomputers. Their site, Foundem, let people compare prices across online retailers - a “vertical“ search, in comparison to Google's “horizontal“ one. The Raffs launched Foundem on June 20, 2006, convinced they were embarking on a momentous journey. But within a few weeks, it was clear something was wrong. Google's search algorithms weren't sending people to their site. Instead, they downgraded it, treating it like spam. “Foundem was effectively disappeared from the internet,” says Shivaun. The Raffs emailed Google to ask for an explanation, but received no reply. Like the other digital platforms that mediate the vast majority of online activity, Google does not reveal its inner workings. But as time wore on and no definitive answer was forthcoming, the Raffs began to feel they were being deliberately put out of business. To Google, confident in its own righteousness, the accusations looked like a conspiracy cooked up by its rival, Microsoft. But whatever the motives - and Shivaun Raff did consult for Microsoft-funded lobbying groups - one thing was clear: Google was pushing people towards its own services. In the precious attentional space at the top of searches, a new box presented results in pre-digested form. To the user, it was a helpful addition - but also a hefty nudge in the direction of Google. Search for a postcode and you'd be shown Google Maps. Search for a pair of shoes and you'd be directed towards Google Shopping. For the Raffs, the moment of decision came at the end of 2009. With pressure mounting, Google suddenly relented, manually “whitelisting” Foundem, which instantly saw traffic from search jump by, in the company’s estimate, “around 10,000 per cent”. Now the Raffs faced a choice: carry on with their lives or carry on with their case? It would be easier by far to let others take up the fight. But to Shivaun and Adam, there was a deeper principle at stake. As Adam put it in a New York Times op-ed: “search engines should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, impartial and based solely on relevance.” READ NEXT Can you 'cure' a terrorist? Inside the controversial scheme hoping to deradicalise ISIS recruits Can you 'cure' a terrorist? Inside the controversial scheme hoping to deradicalise ISIS recruits By Brendan I Koerner As soon as the the Raffs filed a formal complaint to the European Commission, Google leapt into action, funnelling resources into lobbying. The company's efforts seemed to have paid off, when, in January 2014, then-commissioner Joaquín Almunia shook hands on a deal with Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt, at the World Economic Forum in Davos. But Almunia could not get the Commission to agree to the deal. And so, to Google's dismay, the case fell to Vestager. The Raffs met the new commissioner early in 2015. So did the other complainants - who, as Google's reach affected more areas, numbered more than 20, in fields from books to travel to mapping. Vestager met them one by one in her office - “Quite a huge crowd,” she recalls - and they were impressed by their reception. “She was super-interested in our cause,” says Michael Weber, director of German mapping company Hot Maps. “She was really listening, and that was the difference to Almunia, who was just ticking the boxes.” Nervously, the plaintiffs waited for her reply. Google's offer was still on the table. Perhaps she would take the path of least resistance. “It looks like we're going to win this case big time” Michael Weber, director of Hot Maps, one of the plaintiffs in the Google case But when Vestager announced her decision on April 15, 2015, she cast aside years of back-room negotiation, choosing instead the path of legal confrontation. “Dominant companies can't abuse their position to create advantage in related markets,” she said, formally issuing a Statement of Objections - the Brussels equivalent of an indictment. (“It's basically saying, we think you did it,” Vestager explains.) The charge adopted, more or less complete, the Raffs' initial complaint. READ NEXT GCHQ brands claims it spied on Donald Trump as 'utterly ridiculous' and 'nonsense' GCHQ brands claims it spied on Donald Trump as 'utterly ridiculous' and 'nonsense' By Matt Burgess There was more: Vestager also announced a new investigation into whether Google had abused its dominant position with the Android operating system for smartphones. (Later, she added a third antitrust charge against Google's advertising business.) Vestager also suggested that further cases were possible in search. If this first charge in shopping provided a precedent, then the principle could be extended into areas such as images, travel and - as Weber anticipates - maps. “The first five years were frustrating,” he says, “but since the new commissioner is there, the tides have turned. It looks like we are going to win this case big time.” Margrethe Vestager at work in the Berlaymont, which houses the European Commission's Brussels headquarters Olaf Blecker Vestager doesn't have a personal Facebook page. "I have what I think they would call a fan page,” she explains. But in January 2017, she decided to read Facebook's terms and conditions. As soon as she began, she found them hard to stomach. “Just the first paragraph is challenging to your idea of being in control of your data and copyright,” she says. The next four pages made her equally uncomfortable. “Do you realise that you allow Facebook to use any content, pictures or videos? And that it can sublicense them to others? If you terminate your account, you get your licence back - if you haven't shared it, and those with whom you have shared it still has it.” She shakes her head. “Then Facebook can keep on sublicensing your content.” READ NEXT Eight real-world ways Brexit has hit science, technology and design Eight real-world ways Brexit has hit science, technology and design By Matt Burgess Vestager is also investigating Facebook in an official capacity, over its $22 billion (£17.9bn) takeover of WhatsApp in 2014. At the time, Facebook claimed it wouldn't be able to share data between the two services. Then, in August 2016, it rolled out an update that made the procedure - and more personalised advertising - possible. Facebook 'pauses' WhatsApp data sharing in the UK Facebook 'pauses' WhatsApp data sharing in the UK Privacy 07 Nov 2016 In response, Vestager accused Facebook of misleading the Commission, a charge that could carry a fine of one per cent of annual revenue - which, in Facebook's case, is around $200 million. She's also exploring an expansion of competition law so that it can treat data in the same way as goods or money. One case being investigated by the German national competition authority tests this principle directly. It is currently looking into Facebook for an alleged abuse of its dominant position in social life. Does the social network's role as the world's pinboard – the universally accepted place to post details of a football match or invite guests to a party – mean it has been able to undermine people's right to privacy? “That's their hypothesis and they are looking into it,” says Vestager. “And that's very interesting.” Interesting? “They're doing it on behalf of all of us. If they didn't do it, we would have.” READ NEXT Facebook has banned developers from using data for surveillance Facebook has banned developers from using data for surveillance By Liat Clark The German case is still in its early stages, but Vestager makes a point of mentioning it, and it provides a clue as to her thinking. In the digital economy, data is the key resource – the new oil, as it is sometimes called. By tamping down on its storage and flow, European competition authorities may be able protect not only consumers, but also citizens, safeguarding the public realm from exactly the kind of corporate surveillance Vestager is worried about. To US business interests, this looks like little more than an pretext for European protectionism – “high-minded positions“ disguising cynical moves “designed to carve out some of their commercial interests,” as President Obama put it in 2015. But in the wake of the fake news scandal and the election of Donald Trump, many European politicians feel that online platforms have been allowed to invade too much of public life – and the combination of privacy and competition law looks like the way in which these unusual companies might be restricted. “You go back to the heyday of trust-busting and the invention of antitrust doctrines,” says Julie E. Cohen, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. “That is what we need to have happen now. It seems as though the European Union is certainly contemplating moves in that direction.” Vestager delivers her verdict in the Apple tax case Getty Images Vestager has yet to make her decision on Google. The tough talk of the Statement of Objections - the Commission equivalent of a thrown gauntlet - could yet dissolve into an underwhelming settlement. Few believe that it will. “She's decided,” says Thomas Vinje, chairman of the global antitrust group at law firm Clifford Chance and one of the lawyers for the Google complainants. “There's a sort of morality to it. She ain't going to change her mind.” In the EU, the competition commissioner is judge, jury and executioner: complainants can appeal, but the judgement goes into force instantly and the European Court of Justice has a record of backing the commissioner. So, in Brussels conference rooms and Googleplex meeting pods, thoughts are focused on the nature of the judgement. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's head of Android, on EU regulators and security headaches Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's head of Android, on EU regulators and security headaches Google 06 Sep 2016 Among the crystal-ball-gazers, a headline-grabbing fine is taken for granted. So is the fact that, however large it is - and for the search case it could be up to $6 billion - it cannot be large enough to make a difference. When Italian competition commissioner Mario Monti imposed a then-record fine of €497 million on Microsoft in 2004, shares in the company rose slightly, because the sum comprised little more than one per cent of Microsoft's cash reserves of $50 billion. Today, Google's parent company Alphabet sits on a cash pile of $73 billion. “The fine is the least relevant thing,” says Vinje. What matters are the changes Vestager requires Google to make to ensure competition in the marketplace. To outline her approach, Vestager reaches for an old-school example: flight comparison. She likes the way Momondo, Kayak and Skyscanner “let us be our own travel agents“. She wishes she had the same ability on the ground. “I don't necessarily just want to go into the app of one of the taxi companies or an Uber app. I would like to get a broad picture of what could get me from A to B.” In product search, a broad picture might mean a range of price-comparisons: a “Find the best price“ link at the top of the page, perhaps, instead of the current “Shop on Google“. If the case extended to other areas, similar solutions could be found. Search for a postcode and you'd get a range of maps; search for video and you would see Vimeo as well as YouTube. Such a change would leave Google looking very different. The slow grind of court cases would also make it behave differently, says Vinje, who saw the same process while representing Microsoft. “When does Google become a competition compliant company? When does its culture change? Because that's what happened with Microsoft. By the time the Commission is done with them, they don't do that sort of stuff any more.” To see the impact of Commission decisions, one only has to look back to 2009, to a time when Internet Explorer had 55 per cent of the global browser market. In December of that year, the Commission decided that Microsoft had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to push people towards its browser. It made the company introduce Browser Choice, a pop-up asking Windows users which browser they'd prefer. The result? Today, Internet Explorer is used by only 21 per cent of internet browsers. For Google, Microsoft's experience shows what's at stake. For the Commission, it reveals how action in one area begets problems in another: because the biggest beneficiary of its Microsoft decision was Google, whose Chrome browser jumped from six per cent of the market in early 2010 to more than 54 per cent today. Rather than opening up space for innovative local competitors, Vestager's verdicts could simply create opportunities for Google's equally threatening rivals; Amazon, its chief competitor in shopping, could well benefit. Yandex, Russia's biggest internet company, is poised on the European border. “We're ready, we know how to distribute many services, search included,” says Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh. “If there was an access to a distribution platform, equal access, we would come.” With US companies and regulators seemingly convinced of her aggressive intentions, the political consequences of a tough judgement could be equally severe. Vestager describes Trump's behaviour as “so different from everything I stand for“. But she may find herself hastening transatlantic (and, post-Brexit, cross-channel) splits - that, in more pessimistic scenarios, could end the open, global internet. “EU competition policy will play a role in accelerating internet fragmentation,” says Katja Bego, data scientist at think tank Nesta. “Especially as the US continues to see, somewhat misguidedly, the cases against Google, Apple and Facebook as aggressive protectionism.” Bego describes a “splinternet“ - a Balkanised internet, segregated by barriers such as the Great Firewall of China. In this vision, the US and UK embrace the surveillance-friendly corporate web. Meanwhile, the EU protects data, but loses efficiency. Horizons shrink. Prosperity goes unshared. Populism triumphs over openness. Vestager's "Fuck Finger", a gift from a Danish trade union Andrew Diprose / WIRED ADVERTISEMENT Vestager's determination brought her time in Denmark's government to an uncomfortable end. She pushed for a policy restricting unemployment benefit, even though her coalition partners were against it. “She forced her government to support it,” recalls Svane. “She didn't want to change anything, and she had the majority. Her will was so strong it ended up taking the life of the government.” Where does her certainty come from? “That's very difficult for me to answer,” she says, “because I'd have to step aside and look at myself. But let me look at this from another side. I have been a decision-maker for decades in different positions. One of the most important things I've learned is that I'm responsible for decisions, no matter what advice I've been given. No matter how many people tell me this is the way to go. That's very important. It's part of what makes my work meaningful. That it's my responsibility.” Decisions: the key to Vestager's philosophy. Giving people a range of shopping options might help the market - but to her, it is also a moral imperative, a way of forcing people to take a stand on political principles. “It's not a bad thing that you have to make a decision yourself about what you like,” she says. “We have to decide that we want those values that are fundamental in all our constitutions, not just to be words on paper, but to be everyday life. If we don't take that decision and just let things scramble along, slowly but surely, we dismantle the liberal world as we know it.” Before I leave, Vestager guides me round her office. On a coffee table, there is a plaster cast of a hand - a sarcastic gift from a Danish trade union from the period when she was restricting benefits. The hand has an outstretched middle finger. Vestager chuckles. “My husband always says it's not international protocol to have one of these things.” Yet, there it is all the same. Vestager wants to have her way. She knows that, sometimes, that means you have to fight.

And with its main competitor, Apple, not expected to release the next iteration of its iPhone line-up until later this year, it’d be safe to assume that Samsung could keep the spotlight on its new handset for a little while yet. However, according to a new report from TrendForce, hype around the upcoming hotly anticipated iPhone 8 is already negatively affecting pre-orders for Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, which aren’t due to hit shelves until April 21. Apple’s iPhone 8, meanwhile, isn’t expected to even be announced until later this year. The buzz around the iPhone 8 is already hurting sales of rival smartphones – CNBC https://t.co/bzzIAl4rsD pic.twitter.com/5yXmKGuinh — 9wireless (@9wireless) April 12, 2017 “Samsung has also released its flagship device for the year Galaxy S8 this second quarter,” the report reads. “However, the high-end model is expected to make limited sales contribution because the buzz surrounding the next-generation iPhone devices is dampening demand for products from non-Apple vendors.” As a result, TrendForce predicts that Samsung will post flat growth for 2017, drastically falling short of the sales it had hoped for the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Samsung, meanwhile, insists that pre-orders for the two handsets are already outpacing early orders for last year’s Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7+. The company says that their Galaxy S8+ model is proving to be the more popular option amongst consumers in the United States. However, the report from TrendForce suggests that Samsung will be unable to continue their claimed early success with the release of Apple’s next generation smartphone only getting closer.

[Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] “The market demand going into the second quarter is expected to remain relatively weak as consumers are holding off their purchases in anticipation of the 10th anniversary iPhone devices that will arrive in the third quarter,” the report continued. “Smartphone sales will be fairly lackluster until the second half of this year. TrendForce estimates that the global smartphone production volume for this second quarter will register a modest single-digit growth versus the preceding three-month period.” RELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR: Apple’s iPhone 7 Successor: iPhone 8 Release Date, Leaks, Price And Everything We Know Samsung Galaxy S8+ Kills The iPhone 7 In Battery Tests, Here’s How To Make It Last Even Longer Samsung Galaxy S8 Specs Could Be Beaten By OnePlus 5? Popular Chinese Android Smartphone To Launch Soon The iPhone 8 is expected to launch later this year and offer Apple’s most radical overhaul of their iPhone lineup yet. However, according to the Express, delays in production for the new handset may mean that Apple isn’t able to meet its usual release window of September for the new iPhone, and may be forced to release the device later in the year. Why the iPhone 8 is going to be very much like Samsung’s new Galaxy S8. https://t.co/NKNeuDZyIV pic.twitter.com/fPIsTw3hyi — Macworld (@macworld) April 11, 2017 With the release of the upcoming iPhone, Apple is expected to follow in the footsteps of Samsung by packing a larger display into the same form factor by drastically reducing bezels. The screen size for the upcoming handset is expected to be Apple’s biggest yet at 5.8″ and interestingly, the Cappuccino based company has reportedly tapped Samsung to provide 70 million curved OLED panels for their new flagship. Samsung has used a display of this nature in its devices for years, however, this will be the first time Apple takes a similar approach. OLED screens are typically considered to be brighter and more colorful than the panels Apple currently uses on its smartphones. Switching to an OLED panel would allow Apple to achieve the aforementioned edge-to-edge display with the iPhone 8, much like the one found on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. This is one of the best iPhone 8 concepts we've seen this year https://t.co/P2sXznqu6H pic.twitter.com/dWhY5h64qY — Business Insider (@businessinsider) April 6, 2017 The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are available to pre-order now and hit shelves worldwide on April 21.

The move comes four months after the MVNO, running off the O2 network, launched with airtime plans at the start of the year. Called ‘Swap’, Sky is offering handsets from manufacturers Apple, Samsung, LG and Sony. It has direct relationships with Apple, while other hardware is being sourced from various UK distributors (names undisclosed). Swap Much like O2’s ‘Refresh’ tariffs, subscribers can split the airtime and handset bills into two separate payments. A one-year and two-year option is available and customers simply send their phones back to phone to get a new device at no extra cost. All traded-in handsets are processed through Scottish recycling giant Redeem. Refresh has received significant success after the operator revealed two million of 25.5 million subscribers were on the plans. A 32GB iPhone 7 on a two-year plan with 1GB of data, unlimited minutes and unlimited texts cost £33 per month, as opposed to similar plans on EE (£45.99 per month) and O2 (£46 per month). Radical Sky Mobile commercial director Liz Wynn, who previously held several leadership roles at EE for six years before joining the media giant in January 2016, is confident handsets can help the company differentiate from the market. “We think there’s plenty of demand for this and it’ll help us differentiate. “It’s quite radical because we will be offering some of the lowest monthly pricing compared to any of the operators. I can really see this being disruptive. “I’ve been around the industry for a long time and satisfaction across providers isn’t strong because a lot of them are associated with strict rules, regulation and pricing. We wanted to do away with that with Sky Mobile.” TAGS Liz Wynn Sky Mobile Swap SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleRural campaigners warn Chancellor over 5G: don’t run before you can walk Next articleVodafone expands rapid phone replacement service to SMEs Alex Yau RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Doro MD: 6520 to hit heights of our best-selling devices Honor announces plans to consolidate its markets and reduce international focus Vodafone expands rapid phone replacement service to SMEs NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Kimberley Glover - 020 3122 0871 Stephen Watson - 020 3122 0872 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

For the uninitiated, this means that Apple has cut software support for all iPhones launched before iPhone 5S, meaning that device ranging from the first iPhone to iPhone 5/5C will not get Apple’s official software updates anymore. This is the first time that Apple has cut software support for devices in the middle of the previous update, iOS 10’s shelf life. This entails that all users who have the older Apple devices will be stuck on iOS 10.3.1 as the last update for their devices. According to Phone Arena, this includes 43.7 million iPhone owners who still use the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 5C. This isn’t good news for the users of older devices, since the iOS 10.3.1 is basically an incremental update that was issued to fix software issues such as battery drain and Wi-Fi vulnerabilities with iOS 10.3. The software version does not allow jailbreak either.  Jailbreaking an iPhone removes restrictions on the device's software imposed by Apple and allows the user to access features, which are not officially available for the device. Read:   How To Fix iOS 10.3 Battery Drain So, what to do if you have an older Apple device but don’t want to be stuck with the software update? There are only two ways out — either you will need to downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or jailbreak your phone, when the software to perform it is available. Apple has kept the option for users to downgrade to an older, less buggy version open currently, but that's only for a limited period, within which you will have to make a choice whether to downgrade the software or not. Read: How To Downgrade From iOS 10.3 To iOS 10.2.1 The second option being the iOS 10.3 jailbreak. Once you perform the jailbreak, you will have the option to get features such as Apple Clips on the device in the future. While it doesn’t look good, these are the only options available for users of older devices currently. Apple is expected announce its next, 64-bit device only iOS 11 update at the World Wide Developers Conference in June.

Credit: Courtesy of TNS. As Apple plans to release the new iPhone Sept. 16, students have mixed feelings toward the absence of a headphone jack on the new model. On Wednesday, Apple held a press conference that revealed the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which will feature a few new features. The iPhone 7 will have no headphone jack, a revised home button and will be water resistant. Buckeye Bar employee Patrick Burns offered an explanation behind Apple’s decision. While he thinks in the future it is a great idea, right now it may be premature. “Apple wants to beat the curve and have one port for everything,” he said. “No one is ready right now. This is a money making scheme by Apple because their technology is proprietary.” Students were agitated with Apple’s decision to remove their headphone jack. Katie McKitrick, a fifth-year in environmental engineering, said she doesn’t like the idea of being forced to use Apple headphones. “Now I can’t use alternative headphones.This plays a role in choosing my next phone,” McKitrick said. Liz Bateman, a third-year in industrial and systems engineering, also said it will affect her decision in purchasing a new phone “It is frustrating and it will keep me from buying the new one,” she said. Apple’s co-founder Steve Wozniak does not like the idea of wireless headphones, as he told The Australian Financial Review. “I would not use Bluetooth… Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music,” he said. Wozniak helped start Apple with Steve Jobs, but left the company in 1985. However, some like Apple’s idea for innovation. Evan Kozliner, a fourth-year in computer science, applauds Apple’s change in technology. He praised the Bluetooth Low Energy technology, which the iPhone 7 will rely on to support headphones.     “Great idea if it actually stays in your ear,” he said. “If it’s hardware and it’s Apple, it’s gotta be good. BLE is great for the future.” The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will be available for sale Sept. 16. 2016-09-09 Mackenzie Gignac tweet Previous: From farm to fork: Follow the Tomato teaches about food security in Franklinton Next: Visiting filmmaker to screen unconventional series Related Posts Small businesses wary of High Street changes April 12, 2017 Football: Unproven wideouts, Wilson issuing in new offense and more storylines for spring game April 12, 2017 Ohio State Theatre production of ‘Heathers: The Musical’ to debut this weekend April 12, 2017 Student organization to host panel on refugee crisis April 12, 2017 Football: Three offensive players needing breakout spring game April 12, 2017 Art exhibition connects OSU students with homeless youths April 12, 2017 One comment tutu helper April 12, 2017 at 4:49 am i too don’t like the idea of wireless earphones. iPhone 8 would be awesome i think.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. It seem like Apple didn't fixed the major battery drain in 10.3-10.3.1 update. I swear, my battery wasn't behaving like that back in iOS 9! — Ian Kelly (@ianjsays) April 7, 2017 Why i feel like my battery is draining way quicker after updating to ios 10.3.1? 😐 — SΛRΛΠ (@SaranMufc_) April 8, 2017 @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 Sensing that iOS 10.3.1 may have introduced a few Bluetooth reliability issues. Anyone else? — Michael Firth (@TechFirth) April 10, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6, iPhone 5, and the iPad. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about the current version of iOS 10. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can’t Downgrade We’ve got some bad news for those of you dealing with iOS 10.3.1 problems. Apple is no longer signing off on iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1 which means you can no longer downgrade from iOS 10.3.1 in an effort to improve your device’s performance. This is a permanent change and it means those of you who are experiencing iOS 10.3.1 problems are on your own. Apple’s next iOS update is probably a few weeks away. Those of you who haven’t made the move to iOS 10.3.1 yet should take note. Once you upgrade, there’s no going back to whatever version of iOS you’re on. For more on the downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. It’ll help you prepare for next time. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 7 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 11 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 11 8 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!! 04/07/2017 Josh Orlando Reply I’m currently extracting 10.3.1 as I write this comment since my phone crashed while trying to install last night. First time having any issues with any iOS updates, so I will take precaution going forward. Luckily I backed up my phone not too long ago. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply My 7 Plus was stable. My phone advised there was an update so I went forward with it. Now my Bluetooth isn’t working, all my messages have been erased and none of the messages buttons work (like send for example), when I swipe up from the bottom to access my Control Panel is completely locks up my phone, and even a factory reset with backup restore didn’t work. I am trying a complete reset now with setup as a new phone to see if I can resolve my issues. I will update once done. 04/07/2017 Michele Reply Had to do a full factory reset with start as a new phone options. Appears to have fixed the issue but lost a lot of information. No big deal tho. At least the phone is fine. 04/09/2017 Brooke Reply Updated to 10.3.1 last night and less than 12 hours later my 6 plus has died. Will not turn on and can get no response from it. 04/12/2017 Dot parnell Reply Since I downloaded 10.3 my Facebook does work – anyone know what I can do.

The Questor Column: Property firm makes 44% gain on London site – yet the shares are at a 15% discount: The sale by CLS Holdings, the property investor, of its Vauxhall Square development in London to a Chinese developer for a substantial premium to book value reinforces the investment case for the stock and may at the same time soothe post-Brexit worries regarding other real estate investment trusts (REITs). Shares in the FTSE 250 company have advanced nicely since we tipped them in November and the Vauxhall deal is a timely reminder of their ongoing valuation attractions. CLS has exchanged contracts for the unconditional sale of the property for a net consideration of £144 million. The deal is due to go through in early May and the price compares with the asset’s book value on CLS’s balance sheet of £100 million. The £40 million capital gain adds around 70p to the company’s stated net asset value per share and takes it to north of £22, all other things being equal. The shares still therefore trade at a discount of around 15% and come with a 3.1% yield from a dividend that is very nearly twice covered by earnings. CLS was trading at around a 17% discount to its asset value at the time of our tip in November and that gap has closed only to 15% despite the healthy subsequent share price gains, as asset values have continued to rise. Only when the gap closes to 5% or less will the valuation start to look full. Questor says ‘Buy’. Update: Parity: Shares in small-cap consultancy and recruitment specialist Parity are up by more than a fifth since our first look at the shares in February, but last month’s full-year results suggest there could be more to come if the turnaround plan continues to develop apace. Chief Executive Alan Rommel has further strengthened the management team, bringing in John Conoley, former Boss of Psion, as non-Executive Chairman. March’s full-year figures read well in this respect, as the company returned to the black and reduced its net debt to £4.4 million from £7.4 million.

Big Trouble in Little Korea: Qualcomm responds to Apple lawsuit with their own claims Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/11 7:40pm PDTApr 11, 2017 5 Plus 1 on G+ 18 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Legal News Some of you may remember the suit Apple brought against Qualcomm back in January. In it Apple alleged that Qualcomm was withholding around $1 billion from Apple in retaliation for their cooperation with Korean authorities during an anti-trust investigation (another similar suit the US with the FTC is ongoing) in addition to failing to adhere to FRAND licensing (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory). Well, Qualcomm's had some time to think about it. In an entirely unexpected twist Qualcomm has responded to Apple's accusations with their own counter-claims, in which they allege that Apple did not engage in good faith negotiations, that Qualcomm's licensing terms actually are FRAND, that Apple has interfered with their licensing agreements with manufacturers outside of Apple in the latter's supply chain, made false statements (presumably in the recent Korean anti-trust investigation), and finally that they throttled the performance of Qualcomm's modems on the iPhone 7 while also making threats against Qualcomm to not expose this. Apple currently uses Qualcomm's modems for SIM unlocked devices and US CDMA carriers, while Intel handles that in the US GSM models. But, Apple's earlier devices from the 6s to the 4s all used Qualcomm modems. Given the number of devices sold by Apple that easily makes them one of Qualcomm's biggest customers. This little spat between the two of them could also be bad for consumers of future Apple products, as Qualcomm's modems perform better than Intel's. This might just be a fight between Apple and Qualcomm, but for those of us living the sweet life with Android it could spell trouble as well. Qualcomm's had a tight grip on their IP historically, and they've pretty well cornered the smartphone chipset market. If they win the case and their licensing costs are found to be reasonable then Qualcomm might have more leverage on future products and licensing arrangements with Android device manufacturers. Few phone chipset manufacturers choose to pay licensing now for Qualcomm's CDMA and LTE IP, so Qualcomm's functional monopoly may continue in the US (with some notable exceptions). Qualcomm's full statement: Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: QCOM) today filed its Answer and Counterclaims to the January lawsuit brought by Apple against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Qualcomm’s filing details the value of the technologies Qualcomm has invented, contributed and shared with the industry through its licensing program, as well as Apple’s failure to engage in good faith negotiations for a license to Qualcomm’s 3G and 4G standard essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The filing also outlines how Apple: Breached agreements and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm; Interfered with Qualcomm’s long-standing agreements with Qualcomm licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple; Encouraged regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements; Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems; and Threatened Qualcomm in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. Qualcomm seeks, among other things, damages from Apple for reneging on its promises in several agreements and to enjoin Apple from further interference with Qualcomm’s agreements with the companies that manufacture iPhones and iPads for Apple.

Michael Carr All aboard the Pork Chop Express! Powsniffer0110 So.... You WANT us to root for Apple now?!? rattyuk In this one specific case. Qualcomm charge Apple for use of their IP based on the selling price of the device. That's like the cost of your rug being dependent on the price of your house. That's hardly Fair, Reasonable or non-descrimatory. Actually this probably has more to do with Apple building Intel comms chips in some of the markets they released to (I think the U.K. is one, but as they can't reach the speeds on their networks anyway the point is moot.) Fred Carpenter <3 Peter World Citizen Qualcomm is a total shit head. This is a company which has been found by regulators to abuse it FRAND patents. Go Apppleeee! marcusmarcus2 First: Is it really unexpected that Qualcomm responded with a counter-claim? Isn't that what normally when a big company is getting sued by another big company?

C64 Classic movie 👍 Averix "Chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7, misrepresented the performance disparity between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems" So basically Apple neutered the Qualcomm phones so they'd perform the same as Intel phones? LOL Max Johnson I'm interested in this since I have the Qualcomm modem version of the iPhone 7. But I wouldn't mind Apple giving the market to Intel and have more competition in this.

Two in three of the over 1,500 Indian mobile users surveyed by Counterpoint, said they plan to upgrade within the next year. This is a shortening of the average 24 to 30-month upgrade cycle, to just under 20 months, the analyst firm concluded. Indian mobile users' desire for 4G capable phones with more advanced features is driving the trend. One in three respondents were considering phones with a fingerprint sensor and a better front-facing selfie camera. show chapters Will Apple's India push work?    Tuesday, 24 Jan 2017 | 10:44 PM ET | 01:44 The trend is positive in the long-term for the likes of Apple and Samsung, which both offer premium handsets at a high price. But in the near-term neither will see a boost in India, a country seen as a driver of growth in a slowing smartphone market. "All the brands who are successful in sub-$200 segment like Lenovo, Xiaomi and a handful of Indian brands will benefit," Neil Shah, research director of devices and ecosystems at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC by phone. "In the longer term you will have a bigger user base who will want to upgrade to a better phone. Apple will benefit post-2018 with a maturing user base and the 4G network will be available everywhere. People will be using more services. In the next two years it would be a good idea for Apple to roll out their retail footprint and invest in manufacturing." Adam Jeffery | CNBC Tim Cook Apple's cheapest smartphone model is the iPhone SE which retails in India at 27,000 rupees ($420.50). Currently sub-$200 phones are the most popular in India. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has continuously talked up the potential of the Indian market and revealed earlier this year that Apple had "all-time record revenue results" in the country in 2016. Apple is keen to expand and do well in India given cooling sales in China. Cook has visited the country and met with officials. Apple has set up a partnership with Taiwanese manufacturer Wistron which is set to soon start assembling iPhones in India, a move which could bring the cost of the device down. At the same time, Samsung has struggled in India for the past few years, but has a number of lower cost devices that could appeal. But it will also be hoping to find new consumers for its higher priced Galaxy S8 smartphone which was recently released.

The 9.7-inch tablet has the same height and width as its predecessor, the iPad Air 2, as well as the same weight as the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. But it's thicker than both models - at 7.5mm. In other words, any old iPad cases you might have laying around probably won't fit it. So, if you ordered Apple's latest tablet and are needing a new case to protect it, we've rounded up a list of the best iPad cases.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Rumor Apple Making Its Custom Power Management Chip for Future iPhones, According to an Analyst By Omar Sohail Apr 11, 2017 14Shares Share Tweet Submit Developing its own software and hardware means that Apple has greater command over iOS running on its iPhones and iPad devices. However, since the company requires components from different manufacturers, the tech giant still does not have complete control over how its iPhones function, but it looks like all that is going to change in the near future, according to an analyst. One Analyst Claims That Apple May Drop Dialog and Make Its Own Power Management Chips for Future iPhones According to Bankhaus Lampe (via Reuters), Apple is looking to replace the PMIC (Power management integrated circuit) component that is currently being supplied by Dialog with its own custom silicon. The first iPhone and iPad models to sport Apple’s custom-made chip could be rolled out as soon as 2019, thus giving the company further control over its products. One reason why the analyst believes this is happening is because the tech giant has been aggressively hiring engineers from the 3rd-party supplier and already has a significant team of employees working on Apple-designed power management chips. Related Want To Add More Actions And Gestures To Your Apple AirPods? Here’s How To Do It If this story came as a shock, then what about the time when we reported that Apple was going to abandon Imagination Technologies’ PowerVR GPUs for its own custom developed chips? Power management chips manage voltage and charging across the components in a mobile device. To put it this way, with the exception of Apple’s larger iPhone lineup, the 4.7-inch variants have minute screen-on time complaints, and apart from the smaller cell present inside them, it would make sense for the company to replace it with custom chips so it communicates with the other internals more efficiently. Advertisement Related Here’s How To Turn Off Facebook Stories Feature On Your iPhone Still, Apple has a lot of hurdles in its path that it will have to scale first, starting off with the lack of experts it has under its employ. Sources close to the matter have stated that Apple’s 80-man engineer team does not even come close to Dialog’s 1,300 headcount and apart from this, they have critical intellectual property which if Apple uses, it will find its way straight to a court, so this is definitely not going to be easy pickings for the firm. Do you feel that Apple’s custom PMIC and GPU will be found in iPhones and iPad devices starting from 2019? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 April 2017 by Military News Global Apple Concentrate Market : APEJ to Grow at 10.8% CAGR by 2026 Persistence Market Research, in its recently published report titled “Global Market Study on Apple Concentrate: Liquid Concentrate Segment Anticipated to Register the Highest CAGR in Terms of Value over the Forecast Period ”, predicts that the global apple concentrate market will witness modest growth during the next decade. In terms of volume, the global apple concentrate market will cross 3 million tonnes by 2026. By revenues, this US$ 2.0 Bn market is likely to see a promising CAGR of 5.6% through 2026. Demand for liquid apple concentrates will continue to rake in the bulk of market revenues, with the solid apple concentrate segment projected to account for a paltry 11% revenue share of the market. Used widely in juices, vinegar, ciders, bakery, and other products, the juice concentrate sub-segment will maintain 90%+ revenue share throughout the forecast period. By application, beverages will continue to account for the highest demand for apple concentrates, with juices and ciders accounting for the highest consumption. Within the food segment, bakery and confectionary will lead, followed by the dairy and frozen products sub-segment. Launch of new apple concentrate-based products will continue to remain a pervasive trend. Supported by diverse products, the market will also be favored by another strong supply-side driver – competitive production costs. Consumer preference for apple concentrate over apple fruit will persist, as it offers the same nutrient content as apple but with an extended shelf-life suitable for transportation, storage, and usage. Consumer preference for non-GMO products will influence the global apple concentrate market, with demand for non-GMO variants expected to witness a steady uptick during the forecast period. Adoption of non-GMO apple concentrate is steadily growing in the F&B sector, which currently relies heavily on organic apples for its range of ‘health and wellness’ offerings. APEJ will maintain its preeminent position over the next decade, expanding at a robust CAGR of 10.8% in terms of value. China will remain the largest producer of apple concentrate, maintaining over 75% share by production capacity throughout the forecast period. Australia, New Zealand, and India will be the other lucrative markets in APEJ. While APEJ will witness steady growth, markets in North America and Japan are projected to witness sluggish growth over the forecast period. Low production-high demand will shape-up the market in MEA, wherein maximum consumption will be registered by GCC countries. A sample of this report is available upon request @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/5915 Some of the most prominent players governing the competitive landscape of the global apple concentrate market include Agrana Juice, Tree Top, Doehler Group, Shaanxi Hengtong, Huiyuan Juice, Britvic PLC, Welch Foods, Rauch Fruit Juice, Pfanner, and Cobell. Among these, Agrana Juice, Tree Top, and Doehler Group are the top market revenue shareholders. Request to view table of content @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/apple-f… As a differentiating strategy to win over other counterparts, Agrana is focusing on M&A activities and R&D investments. While Doehler is concentrating on production capacity expansion, Tree Top is dedicatedly coveting successful new product launches. On the other side, Britvic has a distinctive strategy for product positioning and sales. Tier 1 players currently account for over US$ 1,000 Mn, whereas tier 2 companies generate collective revenues over US$ 460 Mn.

Photo by AFP The study names the 50 largest U.S. companies including Apple, Microsoft and Wal-Mart. The 50 largest US companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Wal-Mart, are parking about $1.6 trillion in offshore tax havens to reduce their US tax burden, according to a study published Wednesday. Poverty-fighting organization Oxfam America said the sum for 2015 was a $200 billion increase over the prior year. The report cites the companies' own data. While not illegal, the companies "used a secretive network of 1,751 subsidiaries in tax havens to stash" their earnings outside the United States, Oxfam said in the report released ahead of next week's meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington. "Tax avoidance has become standard business practice across the globe. Corporate tax dodgers cheat America out of approximately $135 billion in unpaid tax revenues every year," Oxfam senior advisor Robbie Silverman said. Apple is at the top of the ranking with more than $200 billion in offshore funds, followed closely by Pfizer laboratories ($193.6 billion) and Microsoft's IT group ($124 billion), the report said. U.S. law allows companies to keep profits from foreign operations offshore indefinitely, to avoid corporate taxes that are among the highest in the industrialized world. While the corporate tax rate is nominally 35 percent at the federal level, Oxfam said these 50 companies had an effective rate nearly 10 percentage points lower. During his campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed cutting the rate to 15 percent, and allowing companies to repatriate their cash reserves with a one-time tax of 10 percent. Oxfam criticized both proposals, saying the tax cut would help profitable companies and wealthy shareholders at the expense of important anti-poverty programs. And the drastic reduction in corporate income tax will "feed into a destructive race to the bottom that has seen countries across the globe slashing corporate tax rates in recent years," the report said. Meanwhile, "repatriation holidays reward companies for keeping money offshore and avoiding their taxes" and "incentivizes companies to move their profits to tax havens in expectation that they will eventually benefit from a one-time tax cut." "President Trump promised to fix the rigged political and economic system yet his tax reforms will further enrich powerful corporates at the expense of ordinary people and small businesses," Silverman said. "The President and leaders in Congress must rethink their reforms and build a tax system that works for everyone and not just a fortunate few."
