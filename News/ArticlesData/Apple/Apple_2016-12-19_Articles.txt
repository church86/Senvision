By: Reuters | Brussels | Published:December 20, 2016 2:10 pm Apple filed an appeal against EU ruling, which has imposed a billion tax demand on the company. (Image for representational purpose) Apple Inc appealed on Monday against a $14-billion tax demand as the European Union issued details of its ruling that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from the Irish government which amounted to illegal subsidies. The tech giant’s combative stand — its lead lawyer told Reuters that Apple was a “convenient target” for an EU antitrust chief driven by “headlines” — underlined its anger with the European Commission, which it says ignored evidence from Irish experts before the decision on August 30. The Obama administration also voiced displeasure at what it said was the European Union helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the United States while many in Silicon Valley saw it as further proof that an envious Europe, having lost out on new tech markets, is trying to rig regulations against them. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has rejected those claims and on Monday, while making no new comment on a case which is also being appealed by the Dublin government, the EU executive published an edited text of her judgment. Apple’s Irish tax arrangements have allowed it to pay tax at a rate of 3.8 percent on $200 billion of overseas profits over the past 10 years, according to a Reuters analysis of corporate filings. This is a fraction of the tax rate in the countries where Apple’s products are designed, made and sold. The low rate is achieved by Apple telling US authorities that the profits are earned by Irish units. Meanwhile, Apple and Ireland agree the profits are generated in the United States. Among elements revealed by the Commission’s edited text was a record of a meeting between an Apple tax adviser and the Irish revenue service in 1990 in which they discussed setting an apparently arbitrary ceiling on the profit on which Apple’s Irish unit would be taxed locally. Also read: Ireland says it will appeal EU’s record $14 billion tax order on Apple A year after Apple’s Irish branch had recorded a net profit of $270 million, its tax adviser proposed that no more than $30-40 million a year be taxed in Ireland, since the rest was attributable to technology and marketing businesses elsewhere. “[Apple’s tax adviser] confessed there was no scientific basis for the figure. However the figure was of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen to be a bona-fide proposal,” the excerpt cited in the Commission judgment read. The reference is part of the Commission’s case that Ireland gave Apple special treatment to induce it to base its European operations in the country and channel profits through Ireland. While independent tax experts scanned the documentation for more clues to Vestager’s overall approach, another element that stood out was its concern about the way Dublin did not set time limits on its rulings on how Apple’s income would be taxed. That could signal trouble for other multinationals facing Brussels’ ire, not just in Ireland but in several other EU countries. US TAX REFORM Apple lodged its appeal at the EU’s General Court, setting up a legal battle that has strained Transatlantic relations and could remain a factor after celebrity businessman Donald Trump succeeds Obama in the White House next month. The US Treasury Department said in a statement it continued to believe that “the Commission is retroactively applying a sweeping new state aid theory that is contrary to well-established legal principles, calls into question the tax rules of individual countries, and threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe. Moreover, it threatens to erode America’s corporate tax base.” Read more: Apple iPhone 8 to come with curved, plastic OLED panel: Report The Irish government, which faces anger at home among opposition politicians that it is trying to turn down a huge tax windfall, separately published its legal arguments against the Commission’s case on Monday, saying Brussels had exceeded its powers and stepped on EU states’ sovereignty. Lawyers have previously said it was impossible to predict how EU courts will rule in an area that has not been tested before. Ireland’s tax treatments, now amended, have allowed Apple to avoid tax on tens of billions of dollars of non-US profit. The Commission says the Irish units conducted key functions for developing the Apple brand and that Dublin underestimated their importance when determining their taxable profit. Apple says all the research and development takes place in the United States, which is also where key decisions about its products are made, meaning taxes should be paid there. Under US tax law, however, companies pay tax on global profits but only when they are repatriated to the United States. The incoming Trump administration could change this.

Earlier this year, the company refreshed its MacBook and MacBook Pro lineup, while other Mac computers have been left untouched. This has concerned some customers. In the posting, a question was asked regarding whether or not the desktop Mac is strategic for Apple. Cook responds by saying that the company still has an interest in that market. He argues the benefits desktop computers have over notebooks, such as larger screens, more memory and storage, and better I/O. Cook says, “The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world,” Cook writes. What’s even more interesting is that Cook is addressing possible misinformation from the media. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that. He also says that Apple has this “change the world” attitude that he believes set the company apart from other companies. I think it’s that “change the world” attitude and boldness that’s deeply embedded in our culture, that “good isn’t good enough.” All of this is the fuel for everything else that we do. More specifically, Cook talks about its integration with software, hardware, and services. He says, “That’s our secret sauce.” And of course, in typical Apple fashion, Cook talks about the future of its products without going into detail. We’ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can’t talk about, but that I’m incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by.

Earlier today, Apple updated its website to announce that they are offering free next-day shipping for all orders. This means that all orders placed by 2:00 PM on Friday, December 23rd, can be eligible for the free next-day shipping. Apple reiterates that in most cases, orders placed before the cut off time will make it to their respective shipping addresses just in time for Christmas. However, customers will still need to confirm their delivery time upon checkout of their purchase. Usually, Apple’s free next-day delivery is limited to its iPhone devices. On most of their other products, free two-day shipping is offered. During the holidays, Apple takes this as an opportunity to offer upgraded shipping. Apart from offering faster shipping times, they have an online gift guide where they give gift ideas to their customers highlighting their iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other accessories. For customers who reside near an Apple Store, it’s also possible to pick up an item in-store; especially if they’re looking for last minute gifts. Today’s announcement on Apple’s shipping policy comes at a time when they have started to ship out AirPods to customers. However, the accessory is no longer available online as they are sold out until January. The best way to get one is to visit a store near you.

People have issues downloading iOS updates, they run into interface glitches, and discover odd bugs with the way Apple’s apps and utilities work with the new operating system. Just check out our list of iOS 10 problems for a recent example of the kinds of things that can go wrong. But some iOS updates have been worse than others. A few have brought major errors and flaws, and others have unintentionally introduced serious security vulnerabilities into Apple’s mobile operating system. Read on to check out some of the most infamous iOS updates that Apple has released, and look back on the numerous bugs and issues that plagued unsuspecting iPhone owners. 1. iOS 9.3.1: See contacts and photos on a locked phone This update compromised security of personal privacy | Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/Getty Images iOS 9.3.1 brought a pretty serious security flaw with it. An exploit enabled anyone with access to a locked iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus running iOS 9.3.1 the ability to view the phone’s contact list and photo albums, says The Daily Dot. You could activate Siri, ask Siri to search Twitter, and when Siri asks what to search for, say “@gmail.com” or the second half of any other email address. When Siri produces a list of results, choose a tweet with a full email address in it. Then, you’d need to click the tweet and, using the 3D Touch feature of the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, firm-press the email address to get a pop-up window. Tap “Add new contact,” and then you’d be able to click the photo box to view all the photos on the device. Or tap “Add to existing contact” to browse the other contacts saved on the device.  2. iOS 9.3: Safari crashes and bricked iPhones This update caused Safari to crash on iPhones | iStock.com/AdrianHancu iOS 9.3 was hailed as one of Apple’s worst updates thanks to major problems with Safari, The Register states. The upgrade caused many iPhones’ browsers to crash. Many iPhone owners complained that their devices were no longer able to open links in Safari, or even in Mail, without the browser freezing up. Word of the Safari issues came after Apple released an update to address another iOS 9.3 flaw, which left some owners of the iPhone 5s and older iPads with bricked devices which were unable to connect with Apple’s activation servers. However, despite the update’s much-publicized problems, iOS 9.3 did show a lower crash rate than all other active iOS builds at the time. 3. iOS 9.0.2: A ton of bugs Users who downloaded this update were unhappy with the major bugs | Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images iOS 9.0.2 came with a surprising variety of problems, Forbes mentions. Despite Apple’s repeated release of bug fixes, those patches not only failed to fix the issues, but introduced new ones as well. All told, users who downloaded iOS 9.0.2 struggled with broken notifications, major issues receiving emails, iMessage failures, touchscreen failures on both iPhones and iPads, Game Center issues, and broken app installs. The array of issues was particularly disappointing given Apple’s marketing of iOS 9 as a release that would focus on optimizing iOS’s speed and reliability.  4. iOS 8.0.1: Touch ID disabled This update disabled Touch ID for some iPhone 6 users | Kena Betancur/Getty Images There have been plenty of flawed iOS updates, but few have been so bad that Apple pulled them after their release. iOS 8.0.1 was intended to fix various bugs, but users encountered major problems with the release, says The New York Times. The issues seemed to primarily affect users of the latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and users reported that the update disabled Touch ID capability on their devices. Apple withdrew the update and made it possible for users to revert to the previous version of iOS by connecting their phone to a computer.  5. iOS 7: Malicious apps able to track user inputs iOS 7 was a disaster for iPhone users | Kena Betancur/Getty Images Minor bugs are common in the first build of a new iOS release. But iOS 7 had a more serious flaw — it could enable a malicious app to monitor and track a user’s touch and button inputs while said app is running in the background, says ReadWrite. The flaw was associated with the multitasking functionality in iOS, and it would automatically transmit all user inputs to a remote server. According to the researchers who discovered the flaw, the only way for users to fix the issue before Apple issued an update was to manually remove open apps from the multitasking bar. According to Wired, the cause of the flaw was “embarrassingly simple,” and resulted from “a single spurious ‘goto’ in one part of Apple’s authentication code that accidentally bypasses the rest of it.”  6. iOS 6.0.1: Download woes and a bypass for the lock This update allowed anyone to unlock an iPhone without a passcode | Bryan Thomas/Getty Images Mashable notes that iOS 6 had its share of “teething troubles” at the start of its availability, including a notable login Wi-Fi bug that Apple quickly resolved, plus issues accessing music. iOS 6’s problems began with the process of downloading the update itself, since the release weighed in at 2.5GB and took as long as five hours to download. Later, however, it came to light that iOS 6.0.1 had a more serious flaw: a bug that let anyone unlock an iPhone without a passcode. The trick involved opening the emergency call window, pressing a few digits, then quickly ending the call. Then, the user would have to go to the lock screen, hold down the power button, and tap the emergency call before the slider appeared. The bug would then place the user inside the Phone app, where they could make calls, send messages, and see contact information. 7. iOS 5: Battery life shortened iOS 5 drained the battery life of some iPhones | Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images Most people expect an iOS update to make their iPhone’s operating system more stable and more efficient. But some iPhone owners who downloaded iOS 5 were disappointed to find that the release caused battery life to take a hit, AllThingsD reports. Reduced battery life is among the least desirable side effects to be associated with an operating system update. After complaints about battery life issues began to surface, Apple announced that it was working on an update to address the problem. The battery life issues appeared to vary based on what network a user was on, their usage patterns, and other factors. 2016-12-31 11:12:00 Get Gadgets Newsletters Daily Cheat Sheet Gear & Style Autos Gadgets Sports NFL Entertainment Culture Money & Career Food & Drink Health & Fitness Friday Cheat Sheet © & ® 2015 The Cheat Sheet, All Rights Reserved.

Home Industry Technology Made in India Apple iPhones, iPads & Macs coming soon: report Made in India Apple iPhones, iPads & Macs coming soon: report With an aim to penetrate into the South Asian market, Apple reportedly is discussing the plausibility of making the iPhones and iPads in India with the central government. By: FE Online | Updated: December 20, 2016 6:24 PM Even though Apple CEO Tim Cook had earlier informed that the company does not plan to set up factories in India, but the government had said that there were discussions with PM Narendra Modi. (Source: AP) With an aim to penetrate into the South Asian market, Apple reportedly is discussing the plausibility of making the iPhones and iPads in India with the central government. The Wall Street Journal reported that according to two senior government officials this plan may soon be successful. Even though Apple CEO Tim Cook had earlier informed that the company does not plan to set up factories in India, but the government had said that there were discussions with PM Narendra Modi. According to a PTI report, recently there was a meeting between officials from Apple and Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Ramesh Abhishek where matters of Foreign Direct Investment were discussed. The Wall Street Journal said that sources have informed that there was a letter given by Apple to the Indian government and later senior trade ministry authorities had a meeting with the company officials. WSJ quoted a government official as saying, that Apple wants financial incentives to manufacture products in the country However, Apple has not spoken anything about this yet. It is likely that Apple might open its stores in the country after it starts making its products here. According to a report by IDC, India in 2017 will become the second biggest smartphone market after China, and the US will go to the third spot. This will give a big boost in the sales of its devices, especially iPhones which still have not made much of a mark in a big smartphone market like India. The company had also in January reportedly sought permission from the government to open its stores. In June, PM Modi-led government eased the FDI restrictions in many sectors, where according to WSJ, it said that single brand retailers like Apple are allowed to open stores but they have to purchase a minimum of 30 percent of manufacturing materials from vendors in India after a period of three years which can be difficult of Apple as there are not many manufacturers in India. Also see:  Tim Cook considers India a big market and visited India in May 2016 when he met PM Narendra Modi, and other celebrities. Cook had said that there was a rise in revenues in India. The Cupertino giant currently sells its devices through Indian distribution companies and retailers, WSJ said. The assembling of these devices is done mainly by Foxconn Tech Group in China. However, other big rivals like Samsung and even China’s Xiaomi have been assembling in India for some time. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Mr Morrison said the budget update, which showed the federal deficit would grow by an extra $10.4 billion, soft wages growth and real GDP forecasts revised down, underscored the need for company tax cuts to grow the economy - at least for businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million.

Vision courtesy ABC News 24. More videos ScoMo's budget battle The Treasurer has set a target for the first half of 2017 to get the budget back in the black as he continues to warn of economic challenges ahead. "We have to continue to grow the economy and drive investment. And to drive investment, we believe it's necessary for businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses – at least up to $10 million in turnover a year – [to have] headroom so they can give people more hours," he said, in a sign the Treasurer is sharpening his focus on the needs of small business. "You've got to grow the economy and you don't grow the economy by taxing it more." Related Content Mid-year budget update: $10.4b hit to Morrison's bottom line In May, the government announced a $50 billion plan to cut company taxes to 25 per cent over 10 years for all business that would, according to Treasury, deliver an additional 1 per cent of GDP growth over 20 years. The company tax-cut plan will top of the government's agenda in 2017 when Parliament returns. Advertisement But NXT Senate leader Nick Xenophon, who commands three votes in the upper house, said the mid-year budget update had not changed his mind and he would not - at this stage - back a cut for businesses with a turnover of more than $10 million. " Right now this [negotiations with the government] is like a big Rubik's cube and the pieces are nowhere near lining up," he said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Independent senator Nick Xenophon says he has not changed his mind on company tax cuts since the MYEFO release. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen "It's what MYEFO [the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook] didn't say or do that is important. The hidden story is there is no plan B for the auto sector in this country and the tens of thousands of jobs at risk with the exit of Holden and Ford.  MYEFO made the case for an industry policy that works and makes sense. " Before we can even talk about company tax cuts, I need to see what evidence there is of an industry policy that will boost horticulture, advanced manufacturing, food processing across the whole country." Fellow crossbench senator Derryn Hinch acknowledged the tax cut was a government election promise "but let's see the actual legislation". "Let's see how far [US President-elect Donald] Trump [who has promised a 15 per cent tax rate] goes and Britain . . . any cuts have to be coupled with crackdown on offshore rorts." A spokesman for Pauline Hanson's One Nation said the party's leader had not changed her position of backing tax cuts for business with a turnover of up to $50 million following MYEFO. Without the support of the Greens and Labor, who oppose cutting taxes for businesses with a turnover above $2 million, the government will have to win the support of the Xenophon and Hanson teams, as well as a handful of the independent crossbenchers in the Senate. Ratings agency Moody's, meanwhile, released a note on Tuesday that predicted budget deficits would "remain wider for longer than the government projects". However, the agency said that Australia's debt burden remained moderate, praised the decision to revise down growth forecasts and the "fiscally prudent" decision to assume commodity prices would fall from recent highs, which will further reduce government revenue over the next four years. "We expect that budget deficits will be somewhat wider for longer than the government currently projects. We forecast gross general government debt to rise to 41.9 per cent of GDP in 2018, remaining broadly in line with the median for AAA-rated sovereigns," the agency said. Moody's, along with Standard & Poors and Fitch, re-affirmed Australia's AAA rating on Monday, though with warnings to government that it must continue to reduce the federal deficit.

Most of the breaches are harmless, things such as including a copy of an email in the reply to an email. But the commission says that laws that are routinely flouted are bad laws, bringing themselves into disrepute.

Vision courtesy ABC News 24. More videos Sweeping copyright reforms proposed Existing copyright laws are holding Australia back, according to the Productivity Commission. Peter Martin explains what the commission is proposing. In place of the labyrinthine system of complicated rules governing what can or can't be copied, the report released on Tuesday recommends the US system of fair use, under which the use of copyrighted material is legal so long as it is fair, taking into account the purpose of the use, the nature of the work, the amount copied and the effect on the potential market value of the work. A study released with the report finds that Singapore had fewer copyright disputes after adopting fair use, suggesting the change made copyright easier to understand. Related Content Our copyright laws are holding us back, and there's a way out We must pay our creative people their due The commission says the change would put beyond doubt the ability of universities to use innovative technologies such as data mining and other technologies that haven't yet been invented, allowing Australia to innovate as quickly as competitors in Israel, South Korea and the United States. It wants universities, schools, cloud computing services and other suppliers of internet services to be granted the same "safe harbour" status as internet service providers, meaning they cannot be held liable for the actions of their users. Advertisement In order to discourage piracy, it wants the government to legislate to guarantee the right of Australians to circumvent so-called geoblocks that prevent Australians accessing music, ebooks and software when it is available overseas at overseas prices. It says Australians subject to geoblocks are typically charged an 'Australia tax' of 13 per cent. Its survey of 1000 books found that parallel import restrictions, which can prevent retailers sourcing books from overseas, typically add 20 per cent to the US or British price. It wants the remaining restrictions removed by 2018, saving readers up to $25 million per year. The commission has asked the government to urgently remove the anomaly, which grants perpetual copyright to the 13 million unpublished documents and letters held in cultural institutions, meaning they can't be digitised unless the heirs of the authors can be tracked down. It also wants to make it to be easier to make use of "orphan works" for whom the copyright owners cannot be found. It says the National Film and Sound Archive has told it that 20 per cent of its holdings are in a legal "no man's land", meaning it can't use them to celebrate Australia's heritage without tracking down owners who can't be found. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The Productivity Commission says copyright laws that are routinely flouted are bad laws, bringing themselves into disrepute. Photo: Phil Carrick The report recommends a separate small claims list in the Federal Court that would allow self-represented litigants who felt their work had been used unfairly to get redress at low cost. It is especially critical of the role of collection agencies, including the Copyright Agency chaired by former News Corporation chief Kim Williams, which it says are not open about what they do with the funds they collect on behalf of different classes of rights holders. It wants them to hand to the government the funds they collect for the use of orphan works rather than distribute them to other rights holders, as happens at present. It wants the Competition and Consumer Commission to review their governance and rules. The Copyright Agency struck back, saying in a statement the commission's recommendations seemed "to be straight out of the US Big Tech playbook" and would wreak havoc on Australia's creative community. Author Richard Flanagan said the commission was like "a deranged hairdresser insisting their client wears a mullet wig". Universities Australia welcomed the report, saying the US had had fair use since 1976 and its creative industries were flourishing. The Digital Alliance representing libraries and other users of copyright material said the changes would ensure the everyday behaviour of millions of Australians was no longer illegal. Minister Greg Hunt asked for comments on the report by February 14. The government will respond in the middle of the year. What the Productivity Commission recommends Legislation to enshrine the right of  consumers to circumvent geoblocks Repealing remaining import restrictions on books from 2018 Allowing "fair use" of copyrighted material as in the US Freeing up access to orphan works for whom no owner can be found Extending "safe harbour" protection to all providers of online services Subjecting copyright collecting agencies to a governance review by ACCC Raising the inventive standard needed to gain a patent Restructuring patent fees so that they climb over time Providing open access to publicly funded research Introducing a low-cost federal court list for hearing IP claims Source: Report of the Productivity Commission inquiry into intellectual property arrangements Peter Martin is economics editor of The Age.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Apple and Adobe to Have More Software Vulnerabilities than Microsoft in 2017 GO Trend Micro forecasts more flaws in Adobe and Apple products Dec 20, 2016 08:18 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Security company Trend Micro expects the number of vulnerabilities in Adobe and Apple products to increase in 2017 and overtake Microsoft’s, as this year already brought a substantial boost for the two companies. Trend Micro says the Zero-Day Initiative, also known as ZDI, reported a total of 135 vulnerabilities in Adobe products and 76 in Microsoft’s, which once again shows that Adobe still has a lot of work to do in order to make its products more secure. A worrying trend was also reported in the case of Apple, whose number of vulnerabilities doubled from 25 to 50 as of November. “We predict that more software flaws will be discovered in Adobe and Apple products in addition to Microsoft’s,” Trend Micro said in its security forecast. “Apart from the fact that Microsoft’s PC shipments have been declining in recent years as more users opt for smartphones and professional-level tablets instead, the vendor’s security mitigations and improvements will also make it more difficult for attackers to find more vulnerabilities in its OS.” Keep an eye on Apple and Adobe vulnerabilities Next year, the security firm explains, Apple software is very likely to become a more popular target for attackers, mostly because more users are switching to Macs. At the same time, iPhones will also be targeted more often, and devices such as the iPhone 4S, which is no longer supported by the Cupertino-based company, will see more exploits for vulnerabilities that are left unpatched. “In addition to Microsoft’s security improvements, this gain will further drive cybercriminals’ attention to non-Microsoft alternatives,” Trend Micro explained when looking at Apple’s growth. More exploit kits are thus expected to see daylight next year, and a big part would no longer be aimed at Microsoft users exclusively. Apple and Adobe products will continue to require particular attention because of these vulnerabilities, and Trend Micro says that vulnerability shielding should become a priority for more customers due to the expected growth of zero-days. #Microsoft#Apple#Adobe#security#vulnerabilities subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Says It Won’t Leave Microsoft Alone on the Desktop, Promises Future iMacs It’s Not Just Windows: Lenovo Bets Big on Chrome OS and Android Microsoft, Apple Working on Foldable OLED Displays for Future Phone Models After Google and Apple, Microsoft Disables Flash Player by Default as Well New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    The number of flaws in Adobe and Apple products is growing Related Apps OpenStego: An easy-to-use software tool that enables you to hide messages within your images, password-protect them, as well as compress the files KeePass Password Safe: Create databases for storing password information by relying on this lightweight application that comes with multiple configuration options Deletor: Delete every file in a desired folder using a custom filter pack where you can select processing options or attribute, time and size filters Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues DNS Firewall: DNS communication monitoring application with options to filter and block unwanted domain names, all within a simple, portable package TrustPort Tools Sphere: Encrypt sensitive data, clean temporary files, permanently delete activity traces, and create secure archives of your documents with this software suite Geo Firewall: Restrict access to user-selected countries and geographical territories in order to enhance your Internet security with this simple application Reader comments This Is Huge: Qualcomm Announces Snapdragon Chip Running Full Windows 10 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

In a series of answers posted on Apple's internal employee information service Apple Web, Cook defended his decision to be a part of the round table of technology leaders who met with Trump. In the internal communication, he stressed that it was "very important" for Apple to engage with governments. Here's CEO Cook's posting on Apple Web regarding his meeting with Trump as it appeared on Tech Crunch (along with the question asked). Last week you joined other tech leaders to meet President-elect Donald Trump. How important is it for Apple to engage with governments? It's very important. Governments can affect our ability to do what we do. They can affect it in positive ways and they can affect in not so positive ways. What we do is focus on the policies. Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education. They're on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They're on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy. And of course, creating jobs is a key part of what we do by giving people opportunity not only with people that work directly for Apple, but the large number of people that are in our ecosystem. We're really proud that we've created 2 million jobs, just in this country. A great percentage of those are app developers. This gives everyone the power to sell their work to the world, which is an unbelievable invention in and of itself. We have other things that are more business-centric — like tax reform — and something we've long advocated for: a simple system. And we'd like intellectual property reform to try to stop the people suing when they don't do anything as a company. There's a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage. Personally, I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it's in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it's very important to do that because you don't change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it's a debate of ideas. We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that's a key part of what Apple is about. And we'll continue to do so. 10 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 REWIND 2016 10 BEST CAMERA SMARTPHONES OF 2016 7 'BIG BATTERY' SMARTPHONES OF 2016 RELATED From around the web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia From Around the Web From GADGETSNOW Recommended By Colombia Comments Sort By:Up VotedNewestOldestDiscussedDown Voted Characters Remaining: 3000 OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION Share on FacebookShare on Twitter SIGN IN WITHFacebookGoogleEmail Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

See Offers Business Posted December 20, 2016 Updated December 20, 2016 increase font size Nintendo’s new ‘Super Mario Run’ misses mark Players complain that the mobile game's $10 price tag to continue past the first three levels is too steep. Bloomberg Share Comment Read Article Nintendo Co.’s debut game for smartphones is turning out to be anything but super. Since its release for Apple devices on Thursday, “Super Mario Run” has shot to the top of download charts in more than 100 countries as tens of millions celebrated the iconic video game character’s arrival on iPhones. Yet problems emerged almost immediately, with thousands vigorously complaining that the three levels available with the free download were over too quickly – in less than 10 minutes in most cases – and the $10 price tag to unlock the rest was too steep. It's free to play the first three levels of Nintendo Co.'s new mobile game "Super Mario Run," but after that the game costs $10 – "a huge ask," says one analyst. Bloomberg/Takaaki Iwabu Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → That backlash is now reverberating through its share price, with Nintendo’s stock dropping by 11 percent in the two trading days since the game’s release, wiping out more than $3.5 billion in market value. Investors and analysts are starting to second-guess the company’s decisions and its ability to execute on mobile devices. “A $10 upfront cost to unlock the game is a huge ask and one that flies in the face of current mobile games being free-to-play,” said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst for researcher Niko Partners. “The first three levels are not very long and the payment screen doesn’t seem to make it abundantly clear what the user is getting in return for that $10 purchase.” Those comments mostly echo the reaction online, where more than a hundred thousand users have posted ratings on Apple’s App Stores in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere, ranking the game at two and a half stars out of five. That’s among the lowest for apps at the top of download rankings and below other games such as “Clash Royale,” “Candy Crush Saga” or “Monster Strike.” Besides the high price, reviewers focused on Nintendo’s decision to require an internet connection, with many complaining they couldn’t play during their commutes. Others said the over-simplified game-play removed features that are a staple of “Super Mario” games on consoles, such as fireballs. “The negative reviews aren’t necessarily because it’s a bad game,” said Eliran Sapir, head of Apptopia. “It’s a combination of the high price tag and fans not liking the vehicle.” Sapir said poor word-of-mouth could impact the game’s profitability. While the game has become the highest-grossing game in most countries, it could only reach third place in Japan – the world’s third-largest app market, according to App Annie. That adds to the risk it could fall short of analysts’ expectations. Nomura Holdings has estimated the game will generate 36 billion yen, or about $306 million, by the end of March, while Macquarie Securities sees $200 million in the same period. The negative buzz could particularly hurt sales to the much larger pool of Android users, who won’t get a version until an undetermined time next year. Even among those who paid $10 for the full experience on Apple’s iOS, a common complaint was the lack of incentives to keep playing for longer. The quest to rescue Princess Peach can be completed in about two hours and thereafter the game encourages users to run through already-completed levels on harder difficulties and race against other players. Items they win are ultimately used in Kingdom Builder, a never-ending game mode where players can craft a small village to call their own. The problem, users say, is that kingdom-building is a shallow affair. The small variety of items to buy and limited map size means most villages won’t differ much from player to player. That’s a far cry from other games such as Pokemon Go, where a high number of pocket monsters, each with unique characteristics, made catching them all a highly personalized experience. By comparison, Super Mario Run does little to make items in Kingdom Builder seem anything more than inanimate objects. All of this raises questions about whether Nintendo fundamentally understands what smartphone gamers want, even as it teams with mobile gaming specialist DeNA Co. to bring out titles. Since announcing its expansion into smartphones in March 2015, investors have pushed shares 74 percent higher on the promise the Kyoto-based company can bring its gaming prowess into the hands of the world’s 2.3 billion smartphone users. The decisions that went into Super Mario Run, and the reaction from users, is making some re-assess those convictions. “Right now it is near the top of rankings, but people are foreseeing that it will fall quite quickly,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. For analyst Serkan Toto, the real test is what Nintendo does next. To reverse the souring sentiment, the company should announce additional content to create more depth to the game-play. While a change to the pricing model is also possible, Nintendo has avoided lowering prices on products in the past. “There will be more worlds, more stages and maybe also at some point in time a break away from the business model,” said Toto, founder of consultant Kantan Games Inc. “It’s just the first version of their first actual game.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

See related  iPhone 7 vs 6S: Should you upgrade or wait for iPhone 8? iPhone 8: next iPhone may get curved OLED display Previously, owners of an iPhone 7 could either use a third-party set of Bluetooth wire-free speakers from the likes of Sennheiser or Bose, or a Lightning to 3.5mm audio adapter with Apple's wired EarPods. However, unlike regular wire-free headphones that require a trip into the set-up menu, AirPods allow customers to connect with a single tap in Control Centre. On a single charge, the AirPods can play music continuously for five hours thanks to Apple's W1 processor. For serious users, a small charging case provides an extra 24 hours of power to the earbuds, which are held in place magnetically to minimise the risk of losing them. The new AirPods provide buyers with an all-Apple wireless experience, but should you splash out on a set? Here's what the critics think. Design "They really do look like EarPods" without the cord attached, says TechRadar because they retain the long plastic stem, which "looks odd". However, the stems house microphones, which "point toward your cheek" for Siri to detect when you're speaking. Most wire-free earbuds provide "differently-sized silicone eartips" that can be moulded to suit the user, but the all-plastic body of the AirPods means "you can't exactly customise them", TechRadar adds. Connecting the AirPods is as simple as placing the case and earbuds close to another Apple device, says Pocket-lint. After making an initial connection, the AirPods will be "available via iCloud" and can be easily transferred from iPhone to MacBook. The W1 processor allows the earbuds to change from stereo to mono when one is removed, Pocket-lint continues, and the music pauses when both are taken out. Sound Quality "Do they sound great? Not really," says Wired, pointing out that many sets of cheaper headphones will almost certainly "sound better than AirPods". That they "sound fine" compared to the significantly cheaper EarPods is one plus, but there are "better-sounding wireless headphones" available. Where the AirPods excel is they are "ridiculously convenient", Wired adds. The easy interaction the user has with Siri means the AirPods have a "seriously bright future", although at present they are somewhat "awkward" to use. Price Apple is selling the AirPods for £159, some £130 more than the wired EarPods with Lightning adapter.

Yet problems emerged almost immediately, with thousands vigorously complaining that the three levels available with the free download were over too quickly - in less than 10 minutes in most cases - and the $10 (Rs. 620) price tag to unlock the rest was too steep. (Also see: Super Mario Run Downloads Said to Break All Day One Records) That backlash is now reverberating through its share price, with Nintendo's stock dropping by 11 percent in the two trading days since the game's release, wiping out more than $3.5 billion (roughly Rs.23,757 crores) in market value. Investors and analysts are starting to second-guess the company's decisions and its ability to execute on mobile devices."A $10 upfront cost to unlock the game is a huge ask and one that flies in the face of current mobile games being free-to-play," said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst for researcher Niko Partners. "The first three levels are not very long and the payment screen doesn't seem to make it abundantly clear what the user is getting in return for that $10 purchase." (Also see: Super Mario Run Review) Those comments mostly echo the reaction online, where more than a hundred thousand users have posted ratings on Apple's App Stores in the US, Japan and elsewhere, ranking the game at two and a half stars out of five. That's among the lowest for apps at the top of download rankings, and below other games such as Clash Royale, Candy Crush Saga or Monster Strike. Besides the high price, reviewers focused on Nintendo's decision to require an Internet connection, with many complaining they couldn't play during their commutes. Others said the over-simplified game-play removed features that are a staple of Super Mario games on consoles, such as fireballs. (Also see: Nintendo Has No Plans for New Super Mario Run Content: Report) "The negative reviews aren't necessarily because it's a bad game," said Eliran Sapir, head of Apptopia. "It's a combination of the high price tag and fans not liking the vehicle." Sapir said poor word-of-mouth could impact the game's profitability. While the game has become the highest-grossing game in most countries, it could only reach third place in Japan - the world's third-largest app market, according to App Annie. That adds to the risk it could fall short of analysts' expectations. Nomura Holdings has estimated the game will generate JPY 36 billion ($306 million or roughly Rs. 2,077 crores) by the end of March, while Macquarie Securities sees $200 million in the same period. The negative buzz could particularly hurt sales to the much larger pool of Android users, who won't get a version until an undetermined time next year. Even among those who paid $10 for the full experience on Apple's iOS, a common complaint was the lack of incentives to keep playing for longer. The quest to rescue Princess Peach can be completed in about two hours and thereafter the game encourages users to run through already-completed levels on harder difficulties and race against other players. Items they win are ultimately used in Kingdom Builder, a never-ending game mode where players can craft a small village to call their own. The problem, users say, is that kingdom-building is a shallow affair. The small variety of items to buy and limited map size means most villages won't differ much from player to player. That's a far cry from other games such as Pokemon Go, where a high number of pocket monsters, each with unique characteristics, made catching them all a highly personalized experience. By comparison, Super Mario Run does little to make items in Kingdom Builder seem anything more than inanimate objects. All of this raises questions about whether Nintendo fundamentally understands what smartphone gamers want, even as it teams with mobile gaming specialist DeNA Co. to bring out titles. Since announcing its expansion into smartphones in March 2015, investors have pushed shares 74 percent higher on the promise the Kyoto-based company can bring its gaming prowess into the hands of the world's 2.3 billion smartphone users. The decisions that went into Super Mario Run, and the reaction from users, is making some re-assess those convictions. "Right now it is near the top of rankings, but people are foreseeing that it will fall quite quickly," said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. For analyst Serkan Toto, the real test is what Nintendo does next. To reverse the souring sentiment, the company should announce additional content to create more depth to the game-play. While a change to the pricing model is also possible, Nintendo has avoided lowering prices on products in the past. "There will be more worlds, more stages and maybe also at some point in time a break away from the business model," said Toto, founder of consultant Kantan Games Inc. "It's just the first version of their first actual game." © 2016 Bloomberg L.P.

The post has since been taken down, but initially included the caption: “How did I end up in the studio with Dr Dre ON THE night his deal went public that he did with Apple 3.2 BILLION!!!!! The BEATS HEADPHONES JUST CHANGED HIP HOP!!!!!!” WATCH: The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Financial Times reported the story Thursday citing sources briefed on the talks. Beats by Dre headphones‘ annual sales revenues have reportedly gone up to $1.5 billion since the company was founded with music executive Jimmy Iovine began selling headphones in 2008. The deal would include the new Beats Music streaming service, which Apple is likely acquiring to compete with streaming services like Pandora and Spotify after the company’s iTunes Radio failed to impress the industry. Apple’s revenue growth has declined sharply in recent years, and the company only entered the broadly popular streaming market last year — late because of former CEO Steve Jobs’ reported unfavorable opinion of music subscription services. The company continues to be the largest seller of music downloads, but is losing market share to companies like Amazon. Purchasing Beats would mark Apple’s largest acquisition ever. The headphones retail between about $169.95 to $449.95, depending on model and features, and despite many music and sound industry experts describing their quality as “extraordinarily bad,” the brand has become enormously popular as a fashion item among a younger consumer base, and the popular alternative to standard earbuds models. Beats’ success is due in large part to its wide profit margins – despite the steep prices of the popular bass-heavy headphone models, each individual unit reportedly only costs around $14 to produce. Private equity firm Carlyle Group invested $500 million in Beats last year, and valued the company at more than $1 billion. Neither Apple nor Beats would comment on the deal in the original reports, and the briefed sources said they were still in the negotiation stage. Though the companies have yet to consummate the agreement, and it could still fall through, if things go as planned the official announcement could be made as early as next week.

Apple Requesting Financial Incentives to Build iPhones in India GO Cupertino discussing its plans with Indian government Dec 20, 2016 09:27 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple has asked the Indian government to provide financial incentives that would allow the company to manufacture products such as the iPhone in the country, a new report reveals. Apple has been looking into ways to expand its operations in India for more than a year, but due to local laws that require foreign companies to manufacture products in domestic plants, Cupertino’s efforts came to no conclusion. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that Apple officials are discussing with the Indian government plans to begin production in the country, after the company originally sent a letter to detail these efforts last month. Citing two government sources, the WSJ writes that Senior Trade Ministry authorities have already met in the last few weeks to discuss Apple’s plans for Indian production facilities, but a decision is yet to be announced. “Apple wants to emulate its China model in India. The company wants financial incentives, which the concerned government departments are looking into,” officials who wanted to remain anonymous were quoted as saying. Slow iPhone sales in one of the largest markets India is indeed close to becoming the world’s second-largest mobile market after China, with analysts expecting the country to overtake the United States as soon as next year. Apple obviously wants to benefit from this boom and is struggling to open stores in the country that would guarantee bigger sales. At this point, iPhone sales account for less than 5 percent of the total smartphone sales in India. While Apple’s CEO Tim Cook previously said that the company wasn’t planning to open a production plant in India, government officials said the company already discussed such plans with Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year. Under India’s laws, companies selling products in the country need to use domestic production plants, and according to changes that were announced in June, to source at least 30 percent of their components from local manufacturers. Companies like Samsung are already building phones in India. Apple plans to open two official stores in India should its plan go forward, but the company declined to provide any specifics. At the moment, iPhones are available in India through third-party retailers. #Apple#India#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Samsung to Become Exclusive Supplier of OLED Displays for the iPhone 8 iPhone 8 Could Copy Samsung Galaxy Note’s Signature Feature iPhone 6s Bursts Into Flames Just like a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Report Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad Now Available for Download New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Apple looking into ways to start production in India New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

 WSJ: Apple is in talks with India to manufacture locally Reuters Dec. 20, 2016, 4:02 AM 2,821 facebook linkedin twitter email print A salesman checks a customer's iPhone at a mobile phone store in New Delhi, India, July 27, 2016. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi MUMBAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc is in talks with India's government to explore making products locally, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, as the U.S. firm aims to make deeper inroads in the world's second-largest mobile phone market by users. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to boost technology manufacturing in the country through his 'Make in India' initiative. His government in June exempted foreign retailers for three years from a requirement to locally source 30 percent of goods sold in their stores. The Journal said Apple, in a letter to the federal government in November, outlined manufacturing plans and asked for financial incentives. Government representatives were not available to comment while an Apple spokesman in India did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. Local manufacturing would help Apple open retail stores in the country where its iPhones account for less than 2 percent of Indian smartphones sales. Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), which makes Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads, has a manufacturing facility in southern India.

Time Apple CEO Tim Cook listens as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) SAN FRANCISCO — Apple CEO Tim Cook said he felt it was necessary to "engage" when President-elect Donald Trump — who has railed against Apple and other tech companies — invited him and about a dozen tech executives to attend a summit in New York last week. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,” Cook told employees on its internal employee information service. “The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. "And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.” The comments were first reported by news site TechCrunch. Cook and some of tech's biggest names — Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, among them — met with Trump to discuss jobs, immigration policy, China, cybersecurity and corporate tax rates. USA TODAY Trump tells tech leaders 'There’s nobody like you in the world' "Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education," Cook said. "They’re on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They’re on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100% renewable energy.” Trump, who dinged Apple over security and jobs and Amazon on corporate taxes, told the assembled execs at Trump Tower, "I want to add that I’m here to help you folks do well." Trump called the meeting productive, but many in Silicon Valley questioned the participation of the execs, most of whom supported Hillary Clinton. Cook offered a reason his CEO brethren probably agree with — better to participate than pass. “We very much stand up for what we believe in," Apple's CEO concluded. "We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so."

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Apple is in talks to start manufacturing in India, says report Apple is in talks to start manufacturing in India, says report Apple has outlined manufacturing plans in India, according to a report, and also asked for financial incentives. By: Tech Desk | Mumbai | Updated: December 20, 2016 3:49 pm Apple, in a letter to the federal government in November, outlined manufacturing plans and asked for financial incentives. Apple is in talks with India’s government to explore making products locally, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, as the US firm aims to make deeper inroads in the world’s second-largest mobile phone market by users. The report quotes senior government officials with knowledge of the matter. According to the Wall Street Journal report, one of the senior officials said, “Apple wants to emulate its China model in India,” and is seeking financial incentives. It adds that the government is looking into the proposals. The report does not mention which products Apple is looking into manufacturing in India. The Journal said Apple, in a letter to the federal government in November, outlined manufacturing plans and asked for financial incentives. Interestingly if one goes according to the latest reports, Apple is also considering about manufacturing in  US. A recent report said Apple asked Foxconn to prepare a plan on how cost effective it would be to move manufacturing to the US. President-elect Donald Trump had promised his voters in the election that he would get Apple to build their computers in the US. Apple has not yet commented on any of these reports. In India too, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to boost technology manufacturing in the country through his ‘Make in India’ initiative. His government in June exempted foreign retailers for three years from a requirement to locally source 30 percent of goods sold in their stores. Government representatives were not available to comment, while an Apple spokesman in India did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. Local manufacturing would help Apple open retail stores in the country where its iPhones account for less than 2 percent of Indian smartphones sales. Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn), which makes Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads, has a manufacturing facility in southern India, but Apple’s products are wholly manufactured in China. Currently, Apple does not have a wholly-owned store in India and sells its products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro. The Cupertino-giant manufactures in six countries including Korea, Japan and the US. In May, the Finance Ministry had rejected relaxing the 30 per cent domestic sourcing norms. Apple sought for relaxation as a pre-condition for bringing in FDI to set up single-brand retail stores in the country.

Alexander | Last Updated: Tuesday, December 20, 2016 - 18:19 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Whatsapp  Comment Follow @ZeeNews Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook was one of the prominent tech leaders that met with US President-elect Donald Trump last week. The meeting on December 14 at the Trump Tower included some of the most prominent executives from the tech industry such as Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Larry Page of Google, Satya Nadella of Microsoft among others. In a series of questions posted in Apple's internal employee information service Apple Web, the CEO has defended his decision to join the meeting and explains as to why he was part of the meet. In the reply, Cook says it was very important and that the government could effect 'our ability' in both a positive and not so positive ways. Here is the full text of the reply, an explanation of the employees of Apple Inc as to why he was part of the meet. Last week you joined other tech leaders to meet President-elect Donald Trump. How important is it for Apple to engage with governments? It's very important. Governments can affect our ability to do what we do. They can affect it in positive ways and they can affect in not so positive ways. What we do is focus on the policies. Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education. They're on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They're on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy. And of course, creating jobs is a key part of what we do by giving people opportunity not only with people that work directly for Apple, but the large number of people that are in our ecosystem. We're really proud that we've created 2 million jobs, just in this country. A great percentage of those are app developers. This gives everyone the power to sell their work to the world, which is an unbelievable invention in and of itself. We have other things that are more business-centric — like tax reform — and something we've long advocated for: a simple system. And we'd like intellectual property reform to try to stop the people suing when they don't do anything as a company. There's a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage. Personally, I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it's in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it's very important to do that because you don't change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it's a debate of ideas. We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that's a key part of what Apple is about. And we'll continue to do so.   Earlier in November, Cook had also written to his employees about Trump's victory in the US Presidential Elections calling on each individual to move forward regardless of their sentiments for the candidates. "...the only way to move forward is to move forward together," he had said.

His own personal boycott lasted a matter of days, but it’s fair to say the feeling was mutual. Tim Cook was busy hosting a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton and pulling out of supporting the Republican convention in the build-up to the election. So how do they build a working relationship? Previously, we've only heard from Trump on the issue, who gave his very one-sided account of a phone conversation with Apple’s CEO. The next thing we know, Cook – along with other influential tech bigwigs worth a cumulative $3 trillion – were sitting around a table listening to Trump butter them up. So why was Cook there, and how did he feel about the encounter? We have some idea of this now, thanks to a leaked internal memo to employees obtained by TechCrunch. In short, it’s down to the things Cook says Apple cares about: things such as renewable energy, tax reform and intellectual property reform. "There’s a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage,” Cook wrote. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. “I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.” As a small point of order, it’s worth pointing out that Trump himself has managed to change quite a lot just by yelling, but the broader point remains a good one. See related  This is what Donald Trump said to Tim Cook in their first chat since election day Donald Trump meets $3 trillion worth of Silicon Valley royalty Silicon Valley wants California to leave the USA after Trump win “We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so,” Cook wrote, concluding the memo. It’s fair to say that while he and the president-elect are unlikely to ever be firm friends, they can both see that they have to find a mutual respect to make the next four years even remotely tolerable. Both men seem prepared to make that leap, no matter what was said in the heat of campaigning. You can read the full memo on TechCrunch.

Comments Submitted by Herojig on Wed, 2016-12-21 01:02. What? An article about Trump and no comments? Perhaps his media gold is beginning to loose it's shine. But when an American President-elect calls a meeting of tech leaders, and you are one, you go. Enough said. I don't see why anyone has to explain anything.

Keeping the current slow upgrade cycles of the MacBook Pro (which recently got an upgrade), and the even slower upgrade cycle of Apple’s Mac lineup, it kind of became obvious that Apple is simply not interested in building more desktops. With the newly upgraded MacBook Pro’s lineup now out and available, Apple killed the MacBook Air with the new MacBook, leaving the outdated Mac and the Mac Pro systems to be the only ones that haven’t seen an upgrade for years. Tim Cook addressed this in his recent memo in which he also mentioned the reason as to why he chose to attend the Trump tech summit. First reported by TechCrunch, the memo reveals Tim Cook’s concerns with the buzz around Apple’s Mac desktops. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook wrote. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” Soon after, Cook also mentioned the reason why they are important and in some cases critical to people. His reasoning behind the same is that a laptop no matter how portable or powerful, simply cannot match the performance of desktop computers. Performance aside, large display sizes, memory and storage capacities and I/O ports (Things that are not offered on the MacBook Pro for professionals. Ahem!) are the reasons people end up with desktops. But that’s not the important bit about the post. Talking about what makes Apple products so special, Cook gave emphasis to Apple employees and explained how their focus on the journey and not the end goal that results in products like ResearchKit and CareKit which came from the Watch. Whether you choose to believe Cook or not, we at least now know that some killer Mac desktop designs are headed our way. This can also be attributed to the fact that Apple this year got new competition in the form of Microsoft’s Surface Studio.

 Apple is working on some 'great desktops,' CEO Tim Cook promises Rob Price Dec. 20, 2016, 5:35 AM 3,167 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.Thomson Reuters Hoping for a new desktop Mac? You may finally be in luck. Apple has got some "great desktops" planned, CEO Tim Cook told employees in an internal memo leaked to TechCrunch. With Apple's business ever-more dependant on the iPhone, its commitment to its desktop products — once its bread-and-butter — is questionable. Upgrade cycles have slowed to a crawl, analysis by MacRumors shows: The iMac hasn't had an upgrade for more than 430 days, a big jump on the 147-day wait for an upgrade before that. The state of the Mac Pro is even more dire — its latest release was in December 2013, more than 1,000 days ago.  In a question-and-answer posted on an internal message board, Cook acknowledges this— suggesting there may be concerns inside Apple about the company's commitment to desktop computers as well.  "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops," the CEO wrote. "If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." An Apple spokesperson declined to elaborate on Apple's future plans for the desktop. In another part of the leaked memo, Tim Cook defended his attendance at a meeting of tech industry leaders hosted by President-elect Donald Trump. "There’s a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage. Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree," he wrote. "I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best." Here's the full question-and-answer on Apple's desktop plans: We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in the spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us? The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world.  Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.

Cook also answered employee questions about the perception that Apple has abandoned its Mac line of desktop computers, and about what he thinks most differentiates the company from its competitors. Although unsurprisingly deferential in tone, the questions nonetheless provide the clearest insight yet into Cook’s thinking about the election of Trump, who openly and repeatedly railed against Apple in his campaign for the company’s lack of US manufacturing jobs, offshoring of capital, and refusal to aid the FBI in hacking into an iPhone once used by a dead terrorist. “Last week you joined other tech leaders to meet President-elect Donald Trump,” the questioner said. “How important is it for Apple to engage with governments?” Cook replied: “It’s very important. Governments can affect our ability to do what we do. They can affect it in positive ways and they can affect in not so positive ways. What we do is focus on the policies. Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education. They’re on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They’re on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest (L-R) Amazon’s chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President elect Mike Pence, President-elect Donald Trump, Peter Thiel, co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, Tim Cook of Apple and Safra Catz of Oracle attend a meeting at Trump Tower.

Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas. “We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so.” The question and answer, which TechCrunch verified as legitimate, were followed by a less politically-charged query about Apple’s dedication to desktop computers. “We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in the spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?”, Cook was asked. His response was that to confirm that yes, “the desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” Cook was also asked what he considered Apple’s “biggest differentiator, and what can employees do to foster and advance those efforts?” He argued that the company’s commitment to projects with no clear return on investment was hugely important. “With so many things that we’ve done, we don’t do it because there’s an return on investment. We don’t do it because we know exactly how we’re going to use it. We do it because it’s clear it’s interesting and it might lead somewhere. A lot of the time it doesn’t, but many times it leads us somewhere where we had no idea in the beginning.” Apple declined to comment for this story.

And while I was a bit frustrated with the initial launch of them. (The initial promise, delay, and the setback for anyone who wasn’t up at 6AM pacific.) While mine weren’t set to ship until January 12, I headed to my local Apple Store, in 30 degree, raining weather, at around 8:15AM this morning and was able to get my hands on a pair. So how do I like them? Presentation Before even trying them on, I like how the charging case looks, simple as that. It’s simple and elegant, though there is a metal hinge on the back to open the lid up top. Otherwise, it’s white plastic all over with a cutout for the lightning port at the bottom. Once you open up the lid you are presented with the actual AirPods sitting in the case, charging. The AirPods sit magnetically to the case so if you flip the case over they won’t fall out. There’s also an LED indicator in between the two cutouts for the AirPods which indicate whether they’re charging, on, or are in pairing mode. Green indicating that they’re in use, pulsating green indicating they’re fully charged and are ready to be used, orange indicating that they’re charging, and pulsating white indicating that they’re in pairing mode and can be paired with non-Apple devices. The only downer to the presentation of the AirPods is that they come with a Lightning to standard USB cable in the box and not a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box, just like the iPhone 7. Design These look identical to the EarPods minus the cable if you look from afar. Look a little closer, and you’ll notice that they have proximity sensors to detect whether or not they’re in your ear. There’s also a cutout for what may possibly be a microphone on each of the AirPods which I presume is used to cancel out noise on the outside. As well as a microphone on the bottom of them, obviously. They’re a bit larger than the EarPods but not by much. So if you have smaller ears, these may be a no go for you. Like I’ve mentioned earlier, the box feels sturdy and looks clean. There’s nothing that’s there that doesn’t have to be there. While white isn’t the ideal color for something that’s likely to be in a pocket the majority of the time. Though, choosing hard, shiny, plastic was the right move as lint and dust can easily be removed. One fatal flaw with these is the lack of native Apple TV support out of the box. With the latest generation Apple TV, it’s clear that the Apple TV still is a hobby for Apple. This is further proven with the AirPods. Unlike the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, you’ll have to press and hold the pair button on the back of the AirPods charging case and put them into pairing mode. You’ll have to then navigate to your Apple TV, go to Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth and pair them that way. Luckily, you don’t get an ugly “verify this four digit code” screen, but this can and should be improved. Function There’s not much to say about them. They’re earbuds at the very core with some neat tricks up its sleeve. If you live in the Apple ecosystem, the W1 chip inside these things should interest you. With W1, the AirPods are able to pair with your iPhone by simply opening the AirPods charging case lid and pressing an on-screen “connect” button that appears on your iPhone. A few seconds later, they’re connected. With the aforementioned proximity sensor in the AirPods, they’re able to detect when its in your ear and when its not. This means that if you take one off, audio will pause automatically, and when you put them back in they’ll resume. This also means that you can have only one in your ear and switch between both and they’ll just play both channels through the one AirPod. I’ve found this to work every single time. There is a small delay sometimes when taking them out but it’s not enough for it to be bothersome. The AirPods have a total of 5 hours total in terms of battery life but I can’t attest to this just yet as I’ve yet to have them for over 24 hours. They do go in a low power state when they’re not in your ear but not in the charging case either. I presume they use Bluetooth LE in those situations. The charging case, obviously charges the AirPods when not in use. Apple claims you’re able to recharge the AirPods for up to 24 hours of additional playback. Again, I’d need to test this. Unfortunately, the AirPods ship with a Lightning to USB-A cable. This means that you’ll need an adapter if you own one of the new MacBook Pros or a 12-inch MacBook. And to add insult to injury, these don’t come with a power adapter either which means you’ll need to buy one if you plan on charging these from a wall outlet. You can also double tap either bud and bring up Siri (this can be changed to activate play/pause instead in the settings). I’ve found that this is pretty useful and works most of the time though it’s something that I’ll definitely have to get used to. You have to do a pretty hard press on them to activate. Unfortunately the AirPods don’t have support for Hey Siri. But if your iPhone is in range and hears the command, it will route the audio through to your AirPods if you have them on. It will also use the built-in mic on the AirPods to listen as well. That brings me to my next point. The microphones on these things are pretty incredible. I was walking outside with heavy traffic on the road while on a phone call and the person on the other end was able to hear me even under those conditions. My iPhone 7 Plus or any previous iPhone wouldn’t have been able to achieve this as the person on the other line typically says they can’t hear me using the built-in microphone on the iPhone. Sound quality I’ll try to keep this short and simple. They sound much better than the EarPods, but don’t go throwing out your audiophile-grade headphones for these. There’s an emphasis on bass, and it does sometimes overtake the mids and trebles creating a muddy sound in some occasions, but they’re bearable. To put it simply, I wouldn’t mind using these if they were the only thing I could afford. Soundstage is obviously not that great because they’re earbuds but that’s to be expected. But don’t let that discourage you, I love the AirPods and they have a sound that will be amazing for the general consumer. I’m not a general consumer when it comes to headphones so keep that in mind. Conclusion I’ve been blown away and the AirPods have exceeded my expectations. This may be a first impression, but it’s left a really good impression on me. All of the convenience features plus the exceptional audio quality has gained my seal of approval. Though, I’d appreciate it if Apple started shipping Lightning to USB-C cables for their devices. Right now, that count is 0. Tags: AirPods About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand.

By Ben Davis @ Econsultancy 1 comment Customer journey mapping, AI, VR and design; how do our experts see UX changing in 2017? Here's what they had to say... (Don't forget, you can learn more about UX by downloading User Experience and Interaction Design for Mobile and Web.) Customer journey mapping Phil Williams, senior UX designer, PRWD: With the rise of AI over the next 12 months, it will be interesting to see how brands can be consistent throughout a journey. For example, I can order an Uber from Alexa (Amazon’s AI) on my Amazon Echo, get a notification on my Apple watch when it arrives and split the fare with my friend on messenger. How will Uber ensure their brand values are met with so many different interfaces? What was once a slick looking app now turns into a disjointed journey lost in a web of ‘human’ interactions. This will be a problem for lots of business, but in reality it’s nothing new, just a little more complex. Entire Customer journey mapping is something every business must think about if they want to stay ahead of the curve. Artificial Intelligence Will Grant & Steffan Aquarone, authors of User Experience and Interaction Design for Mobile and Web: AI is advancing rapidly and so-called ‘deep learning’ systems are beginning to become ever more useful. Google and Apple want their phones to predict how to help you before you realise it and 2017 will see an increased rate of change in this area.  Your iPhone already reminds you to leave on time to make a meeting - factoring in travel and traffic - as the systems pull more and more data in we can expect to see these ‘predictive’ interactions become more commonplace - and more useful.  Josh Payton, VP UX, Huge: In 2017 and beyond I foresee a massive amount of investment and progress in AI, but I expect the only winners in the space are going to be the serious software companies with the technical sophistication to do it well. At some point we will probably get a white-label AI framework that brands can leverage to create conversational experiences. Until then I wouldn’t recommend that Acme Soap Co start building a Facebook bot to help you fight dandruff. Machine learning for conversion optimisation Phil Williams: Machine learning is really taking centre stage in 2017 and it will be taking a lot of leg work out of small design tweaks, traffic allocation and data analysis. In the past, it would be down to one designer to iterate on colour, copy, images, size, positioning, one strategist to manage traffic allocation and visitors and a data analyst to figure out what part of journey users are struggling with. In the coming months, we should see more intelligent algorithms that will test the best combinations of a page design. Currently, we will run a test, iterate if it fails, run another test, iterate on the copy, run another test, iterate on the layout and so on and so forth. The problem with this process  - though it does often have a positive impact on key metrics - is that it can be time consuming (depending on website traffic).  Machine learning will test these iterations in one go; think of it like MVT testing on steroids. You feed the ‘machine’ your research-informed variants and data and it will then produce dozens (if not hundreds) of iterations of the same page. Then, using dynamic traffic allocation, we can see these tests conclude quicker. This process will ultimately save weeks of testing time (the build etc.) and free up UX Designers’ time so they can think about even bigger and better ideas; something the machines will never be able to do as well as us! "I lost my job to a machine." Josh Payton: As we look to 2017, my expectation, and my big worry, is that we'll begin to see the first shocks of widespread unemployment driven by autonomous technology. Self driving trucks will be on the road in Ohio in a matter of months. Uber has self driving cars on the road in Pittsburg. Amazon has a store with no employees. As this trend takes hold everything changes. The price of all goods is driven mostly by transport; ships, planes, trains and automobiles. As transportation and service jobs are replaced, the cost of goods and transport begins to drop significantly. The entire value chain is going to need to be rethought. I think the big question we’re going to start grappling with in 2017 is, “What happens to all of us when industry gets 'smart?’”  We will not all adopt VR Will Grant & Steffan Aquarone: Instead it’ll just get better, and faster. But it’s still waaay too rubbish for most people to want to prefer the world of a VR headset to that of reality. Impressive as the latest experiences are, a serious technological leap is needed before designing experiences for VR becomes a mainstream part of most organisations’ product strategies. Before we give over a big chunk of our spinal or optical nervous bandwidth to Google, we’ll develop better, more human interfaces with the machine. Or no interfaces at all (predictive AI). The merging of disciplines (research, design, psychology) Paul Rouke, founder & CEO, PRWD: Typically seen as very different roles within a digital team, people who are passionate about user research, design and psychology will see that they are in high demand. This is because their skills are inherently interlinked. Those who specialise in [just one of] user research, design or psychology, but have no interest in the other areas (or don’t collaborate with other people who have these complementary skills and experiences) will be seen as a waste of potentially valuable resource.  The world is not flat Will Grant & Steffan Aquarone: We hope that the ‘make everything flat’ trend has come to an end and we can start building some proper visual affordances into user interfaces so that non-UX people can actually use them again. The evolution from being product-led to customer-led  Will Grant & Steffan Aquarone: User experience will develop into more of a mindset than solely a product-related craft. Lots of organisations have sat pretty for a long time - they’ve dominated sectors, enjoyed monopolies and created big management structures that have taken decision makers ever further away from their customers. UX people have to battle against this sort of corporate inertia every day as they try to make things people want, not the stuff companies want them to use. But they’re starting to show the value of the approach and we expect to see more evidence of these principles being applied to the design of organisations, not just products. Imagine what your company would look like if it was designed around how your customers found it easiest to interact with! Paul Rouke: As more businesses invest in A/B testing built upon research and the understanding of user behaviour, they will begin to evolve from being what they have always been (product-led), to becoming a more customer-led business. In early 2016 in my article Five digital realities every CEO and MD must face, reality four was “You will need to become customer-centric at some stage”. 2017 is no different, this requirement isn’t going to go away. Brands rethinking their next “big redesign” Paul Rouke: In 2017, more brands will take a different approach when it comes to  redesigning their online experience. Instead of user research, conversion-centered design and behavioural psychology being either ‘nice to have’ (or not being budgeted for at all), they will begin to form the foundation for user experience redesigns. Website redesigns will be less about creating ‘best in class’, beautiful looking user experiences and more about addressing what your users are looking for and how you can differentiate your brand from your competitors. There isn’t such a thing as ‘brand loyalty’ anymore. Prior to moving into a redesign, brands will begin to utilise informed A/B testing to trial major user experience changes, significantly reducing the chance of a negative result.

By MarketWatch Getty Images Slide 1 of 11 1. Subscription boxes ‘surprises’ There seems to be a subscription box service for everything these days, from a “salami of the month” club to beauty products to toys for a pet. Signing up for such a service seems fun until you get a surprise you weren’t expecting: A shockingly low bank-account balance. Americans made about 21.4 million visits to subscription box retailers’ websites in January 2016, up from only 722,000 visits in January 2015, according to the e-commerce and consumer analytics company Connexity’s Hitwise division, in a report for the research firm Euromonitor International. Although several subscription services have more than a million subscribers, such as Birchbox and Ipsy, two cosmetics services, most Americans probably shouldn’t be stocking up, some experts have said. (Birchbox and Ipsy did not respond to requests for comment on this article.) “We’re spending before we even save and then never look back,” said Brandon Hayes, a financial planner and vice president at oXYGen Financial, a financial services firm based in Georgia. “With a cashless society, it’s tough to appreciate a dollar when you never see one.” Don’t miss: 10 things you should never buy again Most Americans have barely enough savings to even cover their household necessities, let alone sign up to receive a recurring monthly gift. Nearly half of U.S. adults couldn’t cover an emergency expense of $400 without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve. There may be a place in the budget for some subscription services that replenish household items people already need, like Dollar Shave Club, which sells inexpensive razors, experts have said. Yet for the most part, many consumers would benefit from putting their credit cards away and just saying “No” to items they don’t need, said Rachel Podnos, an attorney and financial planner based in Washington, D.C. Particularly for people with lower incomes, “you really need to live within your means and cut expenses wherever you can,” she said. You may be saving yourself a future headache: many subscriptions can be pretty hard to cancel, too. —Maria LaMagna Read: What NOT to buy in 2016 AFP/Getty Images Disposable wardrobes are becoming increasingly common. Slide 2 of 11 2. Fast fashion clothing Consumer spending on clothing continues to grow in the U.S., reaching $266.8 billion in 2015, up from $240.1 billion in 2010, according to the research firm Euromonitor International. “Fast fashion” companies are known for quickly manufacturing clothing and getting it into stores, have driven much of that growth. Consumers going through tough economic times after the U.S. economic recession often turned to these retailers to keep up to date with trends on a budget, Euromonitor found. (Zara’s parent company Inditex SA is the world’s biggest fashion retailer by sales.) And yet while the fashions themselves may be inexpensive, the overall cost of producing them can be high. Reports have shown that several retailers have used factories to produce clothing, often subcontracted the manufacturing to third party companies in developing countries, resulting in fatal accidents including this factory fire in Bangladesh in 2013. (Zara did not respond to requests for comment.) And a huge amount of clothing that Americans buy gets thrown away. The U.S. generates an average of 25 billion pounds of textiles a year, or roughly 82 pounds per U.S. resident, including clothing, footwear, accessories, towels, bedding and drapery, according to the nonprofit organization Council for Textile Recycling. About 15% of the amount produced gets donated or recycled, but 85% goes to landfills. The amount of waste is only expected to grow, from 25 billion pounds in 2009 to 35.4 billion pounds in 2019, the organization added. Environmental organizations have long been raising alarm about clothing waste and dangerous manufacturing practices, but “the level of consumption, especially with the continued popularity among consumers of fast fashion, is raising the environmental impact of our clothing unlike anything we have seen before,” said Kirsten Brodde, the campaign leader for the “Detox My Fashion” campaign at environmental organization Greenpeace, in an email. Some retailers have started to help with the clothing waste problem. H&M has started its own recycling program, in which consumers can drop off unwanted clothes (H&M clothes, or not) at their stores year-round. Once H&M collects the clothes, it sends them to sorting plants which determine how they can be used or recycled. And “fast fashion” companies have made clothing affordable for many who may not be able to buy higher-end, more durable items. For those who struggle to pay for clothing, there are alternatives, said Courtney Jespersen, a retail and shopping expert at the personal finance company NerdWallet. She suggested keeping track of how many times one actually wears an item when deciding if that shopping strategy. Investing in fewer, more basic items may be a better choice financially.Consumers should also consider secondhand or thrift stores, she added. There are also apps including Poshmark that let people not only buy secondhand clothing, but sell their own. —Maria LaMagna Shutterstock.com Paradise lost and found, year after year after... Slide 3 of 11 3. Timeshares Timeshares are on the rise again, having made a full comeback since the housing crisis, with more reports from disgruntled vacationers about resorts putting pressure on them in the U.S. and U.K. to buy a piece of paradise that they can use a few weeks a year. And people are buying. Timeshare vacation plans have been around in the U.S. since 1969 — the first opened in Kauai, Hawaii — and they generated $8.6 billion in annual sales in 2015, up 9% from a year before, according to the American Resort Development Association, or ARDA, which represents many timeshare developments. Timeshare apartments and villas in sunny locales are associated with high-pressure sales tactics that get mocked relentlessly in pop culture and they’re often sold at a loss when it comes time to unload one. Plus, they come with annual maintenance fees that can easily top several thousand dollars and which often increase each year whether you use the timeshare or not. On the plus side, the U.S timeshare industry contributed an estimated $79.5 billion in consumer and business spending to the U.S. economy in 2015, according to a study conducted by accounting firm Ernst & Young for the ARDA. This not only includes jobs on the resorts themselves, but sales and marketing offices, corporate operations, construction of new resorts, renovation of existing resorts, and vacation spending. Timeshares can guarantee you vacation time since they often come with fixed annual dates for right-of-use, at least for people who like to go to the same place year after year and, experts say, are typically larger than an average hotel room. But as this writer to MarketWatch’s advice columnist, the Moneyologist, discovered, sometimes the only way to offload them is to die. Resorts and locales come in and out of fashion, and owners are often stuck with rising maintenance fees. And many people use these timeshares to exchange with other timeshare owners (they may never even visit their own timeshare), and enjoy the bartering and excitement of going to a different location every year. However, this is usually done via a timeshare exchange company, which has its own set of fees. —Daniel Goldstein and Quentin Fottrell TriStar Pictures/Everett Collection Recalled toys can be dangerous. Slide 4 of 11 4. Recalled toys online When it comes to buying anything for a child this holiday season, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. That may mean forgoing online purchases of recalled toys, even if their manufacturers have fixed the issues. Sometimes, as seen in a recent research report from nonprofit U.S. Public Interest Research Groups Education Fund, toys recalled for excessive lead, choking hazards or overheating make it back onto the market. In some scary situations, the wrong toy could end up on your doorstep after you purchase it online, the report showed. Companies will fix problems with the toys and put them back on the market — third-party retailers may (or may not) do the same. Luckily, there have been less recalls in the last few years: there were 24 toy recalls this fiscal year, down from 172 in 2008, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the federal agency that manages recalls. Still, it’s always best to be proactive. The first step should always be to analyze the toy and its potential hazards, and ensure the toy wasn’t recalled, which can be done by searching the CPSC’s database. If you do end up buying the toy, go a step farther before giving it to the child by cross-checking item numbers of the product with those that were recalled. This is especially important with third-party sellers, which may still be selling the original recalled product. You can always call the company to make sure, too. —Alessandra Malito Shutterstock They look so nice when they’re not all tangled. Slide 5 of 11 5. Ear bud headphones with wires For many iPhone users, trashing those classic ear buds with wires might not have been a choice. Apple’s AAPL, -0.78% latest version of the iPhone doesn’t include a headphone jack and is intended to be paired with the company’s $159 wireless “AirPods” instead. (Customers who purchased the iPhone 7 before the new headphones were released this year received an adapter so they could continue to use their ear buds). Of course, wireless headphones, which are available from companies other than Apple, don’t solve all these problems and they create some issues of their own. They last just five hours and need to be charged or housed in a separate carrying case to increase the battery life. But even if Apple hadn’t tried to force our hands (and ears) this year, it would be worth reconsidering our affinity for those little buds with the long cord. For one, they may be hurting our hearing. More than 1 billion young people are at risk of hearing loss from listening to their personal audio devices through headphones, particularly earbuds. What’s more, they’re constantly tangled. So give your ears and your sanity a break this year and buy some over the ear headphones — or simply listen to the world around you. —Jillian Berman Shutterstock.com Smart kitchens could be vulnerable to hacking. Slide 6 of 11 6. Smart fridges In January, the smart refrigerator was the breakout product of the 2016 CES trade show, which showcases the upcoming consumer electronics trends. These pricey home devices created a big buzz in 2016, but consumers would be wise to opt for an old school fridge in the coming year. Although these smart models seem like the fridges of the future, the steep costs and security risks may outweigh any convenience offered by the built-in apps and high-tech features. The Samsung Family Hub, for example, retails at $3,800. The connected fridge comes with a touch screen on the front door from which users can order groceries online and control other utilities in the home. It is also equipped with built-in cameras that “allow you to see what’s inside the fridge without wasting energy.” Like, you know, opening the door. A similar model from Whirpool WHR, -0.78% retails for $3,800 and can be controlled by an app on your phone. Even if you think these features are worth the extra money (a standard LG 066570, +3.29% refrigerator sells for around $1,000, for comparison), security risks are probably not. Most connected devices, including fridges, are easily hacked. While you might not care if a stranger on the internet can peek at your groceries (you should), these breaches can affect security on an international scale when devices are harnessed for major attacks. In October, a number of hacked smart devices were used to carry out a distributed denial of service attack on internet provider Dyn, flooding it with traffic and causing websites like Twitter and Spotify to crash. Some security experts said consumers with devices that were hacked and provided a gateway to their internet still used the default passwords they had when they bought the equipment. Although smart device manufacturers are increasingly taking security into account, American consumers might want to keep our kitchens off the grid, at least for now. (Samsung and Whirlpool did not respond to requests for comment.) —Kari Paul Shutterstock.com Choose fresh lettuce and vegetables over smoothies and grain-filled wraps. Slide 7 of 11 7. These foods that are touted as healthy When it comes to healthy eating, a quip by the comedian Kevin Hart comes to mind: “Everybody wants to be famous, but nobody wants to do the work.” Vegetables, fruits and whole grains make up the day-to-day drudgery of health. And research shows that losing weight is even harder than most people think, since metabolism slows as dieters make progress, and sometimes even more than scientists expected. So it’s no wonder people go instead for the seeming workarounds, which are flashier and more fun: snack foods masquerading under a health halo, fad diets, and their ilk. “Name a trendy diet that has been proposed by pop culture at any time that panned out to be true and worked. Atkins, juicing, the Zone diet, carbo-loading, you name it,” Timothy Caulfield, a professor of health law and science policy at the University of Alberta, Canada, said. Wraps are one example of this. People tend to think they’re better for you, but they are often made of stripped white grains and paired with fried foods or bacon, Cleveland Clinic nutritionist Kristin Kirkpatrick told MarketWatch. So in 2017, let’s swap hype-ensconced, sugar-packed green juices for a cheaper and more filling protein source — actual vegetables, say both Kirkpatrick and Caulfield. Don’t focus on the “spinach” or “sun-dried tomato” labeling on wrap sandwiches and ignore their fried fillings. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is, Caulfield said. Healthy living is work. Do the work. And try to avoid eating too much food that doesn’t masquerade as healthy, like candy. —Emma Court Getty Images Actor and composer Lin-Manuel Miranda has joined the fight against ticket scalpers. Slide 8 of 11 8. Event tickets from resale sites Buying tickets can be extra expensive when you buy from ticket resellers. Sometimes they’re coming from sellers who can’t attend an event and need to get those tickets off their hands. Increasingly, however, it’s from bots who mark up the price substantially and can’t be trusted. Consumers have complained in the past that some tickets being sold on these online marketplaces don’t even exist. Regulators can’t easily target bad actors, either, since all states have different ways of handling ticket “scalping.” New York Senator Chuck Schumer announced proposed legislation earlier this year that would ban ticket bots, a fight Lin-Manuel Miranda, former star of Broadway’s Hamilton, has joined. Though a few ticket selling websites, such as StubHub and Ticketmaster, provide a 100% price guarantee that the seats are verified or your money back, having to go through the vetting process to ensure the authenticity of tickets or, worse, finding out the tickets are fake after buying them, can be a hassle. And there is sometimes little other alternative: some concerts sell out in minutes, while certain sporting events are sold out months in advance. “StubHub is firmly against any technology or activity that makes it harder for regular fans to purchase tickets,” a spokesman for the company says. “We believe in a secure, fair and open marketplace, and we will strongly combat any unfair and deceptive practices that make it harder for fans to buy and use event tickets in an open market.” To be fair, some resellers are unloading tickets at a reasonable cost. But sometimes, like in the case of this year’s World Series featuring an historic face-off between the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians, re-sales aren’t always worth a nearly $20,000 ticket price. The New York Yankees changed their digital ticketing policy earlier this year, making it more difficult for season ticket holders to sell some of their tickets. —Alessandra Malito Shutterstock.com The government has recommended flossing since 1979, but does it work? Slide 9 of 11 9. Dental Floss There was a moment of relief in 2016 for Americans who are scared to go to the dentist for fear they’d be admonished for their failure to floss. An investigation (yes, there was an investigation into flossing) by the Associated Press revealed that the effectiveness of the practice had never been rigorously researched, even though the government has been recommending we floss since 1979. It turns out most of the evidence that the combination of flossing and brushing is more effective than brushing alone is pretty weak, the AP found. The government stopped including flossing in its dietary recommendations this year as a result. Dentists will tell you that it’s a mistake to use the findings as an excuse to abandon flossing. And we grudgingly admit that they’re probably right. As an essay in the New York Times pointed out last month, the so-called weak evidence supporting flossing was the absence of a study using randomized controlled trials that definitively proves flossing is beneficial to your health. But there’s evidence, clinical and otherwise, that indicates flossing is good for you. And there’s no indication that flossing is actually bad for you.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « TechCrunch Reports on Some of Tim Cook's Commentary on Meeting with Trump with a Touch of Fake News | Main | Apple Granted 44 Patents Today Covering the MacBook, a Messaging Display for a Future Apple Watch Band & More » December 20, 2016 Apple Granted a Patent for 3D Mapping and Photography   In Late November Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Working with LG Innotek to bring 3D Photography to their 2017 iPhone Plus." An Asian report had claimed that LG Innotek was working with Apple to develop a smartphone camera module which would enable 3D photography. The camera which uses LG Innotek's dual camera would likely be applied to at least one iPhone model starting in late 2017. Today the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a newly granted patent of Apple's relating to 3D photography.   Granted Patent: Time-of-Flight Depth Mapping with Flexible Scan Pattern   Apple's newly granted patent covers their invention relating to methods and devices for projection and capture of optical radiation, and particularly to optical 3D mapping.   According to Apple, the UI #60 interacts with user input and output devices, which can enable a user of the apparatus to designate objects for 3D mapping. This sort of interactive object designation may operate in concert with the automated, image-based techniques for selection of the scan area for 3D mapping by scanning engine #22. In the pictured example, the user interface displays the images acquired by the camera #24 on a touchscreen #64 of an input device #65, which enables the user to designate object #30 by making suitable gestures with the fingers of a hand on the touchscreen, which are sensed by the UI. Image signal processor #56 locates object #30 in the images based on this user input. The depth processor #54 outputs the 3D map of object #30 to host processor #26, which presents the 3D information on a screen and/or uses the 3D information as an input to other software applications.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted above is is a block diagram that schematically illustrates imaging apparatus 20, which performs both 2D and 3D imaging.   Apple's granted patent 9,525,863 was originally filed in Q2 2015 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any Granted Patent should be read in its entirety for full details.

Apple Working on Improved Sound Solutions for Portable Devices, Patent Shows GO The patent is for high quality sound in thin enclosures Dec 20, 2016 11:15 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Today, Apple was granted two patents for enhancing space in portable devices. One of the patents was for outing high-quality sound from a panel acoustic system in thin enclosures, while the other was for woven displays on Apple Watch devices. The two patents were awarded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as Apple Insider found. The first patent application is for an audio solution that can create high-quality sound using vibration of sub-panels in a flat arrangement. The system would be able to create waves of pressure that result in sounds. The detailed system includes conical diaphragms, together with a voice coil wire which would create magnetic field when electric current is applied. The coil would interact with the magnet and push and pull the diaphragm. The motion is then interpreted by built-in audio conversion components which create sound. The new audio system was designed for thin devices Apple currently uses micro speakers in some of its devices and they operate approximately in the same way as the system in this patent. However, the new system would allow for maximized volume and minimized distortion of sound. The new system is comprised of divided sub-panels, which actually give different resonant frequency to each of them. Apple’s new system is focused on improved sound output in thin enclosures, which would make it suitable for the iPad and MacBook. The patent application was first filed in November 2014 and it remains to be seen if and when Apple will actually incorporate the new technology in upcoming devices. For the iPhone 5, Apple went with the award-winning portable speakers from JBL and had a different approach for the latest model, the iPhone 7. The phone released this year comes with stereo speakers at the bottom of the device and an improved speaker at the top, which provides clearer and louder sound.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Apple#iPhone 7#iPhone 5#Patent#Speakers subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news iPhone 8 Could Copy Samsung Galaxy Note’s Signature Feature iPhone 6s Bursts Into Flames Just like a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 - Report Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Apple’s CEO Tim Cook Is Boring and Incompetent, Internet Guru Says New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" 2 photos    Patent application for Apple acoustic system new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

A report on The Wall Street Journal states that Apple is currently in discussions with the government on the possibility of manufacturing in India. While the products may not actually be manufactured as such, they are likely to be assembled here. The company is reportedly seeking financial incentives for the same. Apple iPhone prices in India are ludicrous and possibly the highest in the world. Currently, most models sell for anywhere between 20 and 40 percent more than US prices. Apple’s iPhone sales have stagnated globally and the company sees great potential for growth in the relatively untapped markets of China and India. The Chinese market hasn’t paid off as well as Apple hoped, and costs are too high in the Indian market. The company did seek permission for selling refurbished iPhones in the Indian market, but the Indian government did not grant that permission. It’s not known whether this make/assembled in India initiative will extend to Apple’s other products, including the iMac and the MacBook lineup.

After recent confusion regarding Apple going for iPhone 7s instead of iPhone 8, the rumours about the latter has made a comeback with the latest one being regarding the OLED display. As per the report from Korea Herald (South Korea's biggest English newspaper, all the OLED displays Apple ordered from Samsung are of plastic OLED only. The newspaper stated - "The OLED version of the new iPhone will all be curved as Apple ordered all plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display. Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." If you are not aware, plastic OLED displays are generally used for creating curved displays, the most famous example being the Galaxy S7 Edge. We don't really know whether Apple is planning to go for a Dual-curved OLED display or a Quad-curved (curved on all sides) display. Either way, Apple will not be the first one as Huawei under its sub-brand Honor, just launched Honor Magic which comes with all sided curved AMOLED display. This is in contrary to the earlier reports where Sharp was rumoured to make the OLED displays for the next iPhone. For those who are not aware, OLED displays are said to be sharper, more vibrant and pleasing to the human eye and a lot of handset manufacturers such as HTC, LG and especially Samsung have been introducing OLED displays in their smartphones. Samsung is known to include Super AMOLED displays on almost all of its mid-range to flagship devices. Interestingly, Apple too introduced OLED displays in its Apple Watch last year. Further, it is rumoured that only the 5.5-inch variant is expected to come with OLED panel. However, there is some disadvantages which comes along with plastic OLED display i.e. its vulnerability to scratches and other trace marks but is very sturdy when it comes to durability. Whereas, glass OLED panels though easy to shatter are highly scratch resistant. It will be interesting to see, how Apple deals with this dilemma.

Jon Fingas, @jonfingas 12.19.16 in Personal Computing Comments 991 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If you've been following the Mac lineup in recent years, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Apple had largely given up on desktops. The current-generation iMac is over a year old, the Mac mini hasn't been updated since 2014 and the Mac Pro hasn't been touched since it was redesigned in 2013. Does the company care about people who need more power than a laptop? Yes, if you ask Tim Cook. In an internal forum post, the CEO explains that desktops remain "really important" and that there are "great desktops in our roadmap." The reasons why won't shock you. Simply put, you can "pack a lot more performance" in a computer that isn't constrained by portability -- bigger displays, extra ports and just more raw power. Sometimes that difference is "critical" to users, Cook adds. There weren't signs that Apple was about to axe desktops, and to some extent it's at the mercy of Intel. Remember, Intel's 7th-generation Core processors won't be available in desktop form until January at the earliest -- Apple can't really update the iMac's processors until then. It doesn't have as much justification for the Mac mini or Mac Pro, but customers might not be happy if it slapped older chips into those systems at this point. Cook's statement still leaves a lot of uncertainty, though. Just which desktops still have a life left at Apple? And more importantly, will future revisions address criticisms? Mac Pro customers, for example, have complained both about neglect (a modern 5K iMac is more powerful in some respects) and a design that's at once overkill and doesn't go far enough. Pros don't always want dual processors and dual graphics cards, but they sometimes want more expansion than the current Mac Pro can offer. Although Apple may still care about desktops, there's a lingering concern it either treats them as a low priority or doesn't understand what desktop buyers really want.

The negotiations come as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to boost his 'Make in India' initiative, with Apple eager to make deeper inroads into the world's second largest mobile market. In June, Modi ordered his government to exempt foreign retailers for three years from a requirement to locally source 30 percent of goods solid in their stores. According to The Journal, Apple sent a letter to India's federal government last month, outlining manufacturing plans and asking for financial incentives. Apple and Indian state representatives have yet to comment on the matter. In September 2015, Apple CEO Tim Cook sat down with Prime Minister Modi to discuss various matters and Cook reportedly responded positively to Modi's invitation to open a manufacturing base in India. Foxconn was previously reported to be looking at the possibility of an expansion into India to produce iPhones and iPads, but Cook's outspoken interest in the possibility was Apple's first public interest in the expansion. Apple has partnered with e-commerce giant Flipkart to sell the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in India, where the phones launched in October. Apple does not yet have a license to sell products directly to consumers in India, which has led to buyers going through third-party retail stores to get hold of the company's flagship phones. Apple's iPhones currently account for less than 2 percent of Indian smartphone sales.

We’ve been treated to the iPhone 7 and TouchBar-equipped MacBook Pro, new iPads and most recently the completely wireless AirPods headphones. What’s been missing from the company’s 2016 efforts, however, has been a serious refresh of its iMac and Mac Pro desktop machines. This lack of updates has caused some in the industry to question Apple’s focus on its form bread winner, desktop computers. Don’t worry though, Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has waded into the debate reassuring not just you, but his own employees that not only are desktop machines firmly part of Apple’s future plans, but that the company is working on something special. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook reportedly wrote on an Apple employee message board. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” While these fighting words are enough to get any Mac fanatic excited, sadly there’s no current word on what these ‘great desktops’ have in store, or indeed when they might drop. That said, previous rumours have pegged the iMac for a major redesign in 2017, with a radical new look being joined by all the usual specs boosts. Related: 5K iMac review Although Cook’s Mac comments are the headline grabbers, his message board comments also extended to more generalised company chat. According to TechCrunch, discussing what makes Apple so different to its rivals, he stated: “With so many things that we’ve done, we don’t do it because there’s a return on investment. We don’t do it because we know exactly how we’re going to use it. “We do it because it’s clear it’s interesting and it might lead somewhere. A lot of the time it doesn’t, but many times it leads us somewhere where we had no idea in the beginning.” WATCH: Macbook Pro 13 2016 Touch Bar Tips & Tricks What would you like to see in a 2017 iMac?

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Apple’s Tim Cook says "great desktops" are coming December 20, 2016 - 12:53 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company’s commitment to desktop Mac computers remains strong, despite a glaring omission of the product line in a slate of recent MacBook announcements, The Verge reports. Here’s what Cook had to say in response to a question about whether Mac desktops were strategic for Apple: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." It’s unclear if Cook is referencing just the company’s iMac all-in-one line, or if he also intended his statement to include the Mac mini and the Mac Pro. But the lack of updates to all three is a genuine concern for fans of Apple’s desktop computers. The Mac mini was updated nearly every year from 2007 to 2012, and then once in 2014. Meanwhile, the Mac Pro was updated nearly every year from 2006 to 2013. That machine hasn’t received an upgrade in more than three years, when Apple first revealed its overhauled cylindrical design. The star of the desktop line — the iMac — is more up to date. Its current iteration has been upgraded annually for the last five years, with the 2015 model getting a 5K retina option. It too was left out in this fall’s MacBook refresh. Related links: The Verge.

The patent covers Apple's work relating to fabric displays that could be used in a future smart Apple Watch band as noted in our cover graphic. The fabric could be made of magnetic and/or conducting fibers and incorporate light pipe fibers that act as light guides to visually display indications or messages to a user right on their Apple Watch band and beyond.   For more details on this invention, see our original report here. Apple's granted patent 9,521,885 was originally filed in Q2 2014.   Granted Patent: Teleprompter Tool   On February 10, 2012, Patently Apple posted a patent application report titled "Apple to Add Teleprompter Tools to iMovie and Final Cut Pro." Sometime in the future you'll be able to both film yourself on an iPad while reading your very own script like the pros. This is Apple's second patent relating to future iReporter tools for iOS devices. Apple's patent technically provides a method for a media editing application that creates a composite presentation from several different media clips. The method provides a set of editing tools for editing the composite presentation. The method provides a voice-over tool for receiving text for a voice-over that includes a transcript for a voice-over audio clip to be recorded by the media editing application as a clip of the composite presentation. The method provides a display area for scrolling the text when recording the voice-over audio clip. The display area in some embodiments is a preview display area that scrolls the text while displaying a preview of the composite presentation when recording the voice-over audio clip.   For more details, see our original report here. Apple's granted patent 9,524,753 was originally filed in Q3 2010.   Another granted patent of mild interest is patent 9,525,943 titled "Mechanically actuated panel acoustic system." The invention relates to an electronically controlled sound production system for use in a consumer electronics device, such as a desktop computer.   This isn't to be confused with Apple's quad speaker patent for the iPad which we covered back in March in a report titled "Apple's Quad Speaker iPad Pro Invention Comes to Light."   Apple Granted a MacBook Design Patent   Apple was granted design patent D774,505 today for the MacBook as noted below in patent FIGS. 11 and 12.   The Remaining Patents granted to Apple Today   Note: In order to see a clearer image of the list above, simply click on the image above to enlarge it.

Normal service will resume on January 3. Season’s greetings. Sign up to receive FirstFT by email here German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was “shocked, shaken and deeply saddened” by the attack on a crowded Berlin Christmas market that killed at least 12 people on Monday evening. Speaking at the chancellery on Tuesday morning an ashen-faced Ms Merkel told reporters that it would be “particularly sickening” if it turned out the attacker was an asylum seeker who sought refuge in Germany. The driver of the truck was a 23-year-old Pakistani man named by German media as “Naved B”. He was arrested after fleeing the scene and was on Tuesday being questioned by police, who described the incident as a “probable terrorist attack”. Also on Monday evening, Russia’s ambassador to Turkey was shot dead at a public appearance in Ankara, Turkey, by a man who the city’s mayor described as a policeman. A photographer who was attending an exhibition and captured the chaotic scene with his camera. Before firing, the man shouted about Aleppo, the Syrian city retaken last week in a bloody siege by regime forces backed by Russian air power. Russia and Turkey said their rapprochement would not be blown off course by the assassination of Moscow’s ambassador to Ankara as they seek to overcome the aftershocks of a murder that has tested an often tense and volatile relationship. (FT, NYT, AP) In the news IMF backs Lagarde The International Monetary Fund has stood by managing director Christine Lagarde, who was found guilty of negligence in public office by a special Paris court on Monday. The French tribunal chose not to sentence Ms Lagarde and the IMF board decided to retain her as chief. The last thing the IMF needs now is a leadership vacuum, writes the FT in an editorial. (FT) Smog red alert The number of cars on roads is being limited and factories temporarily shut in some northern Chinese cities to reduce pollution during a national smog red alert. On Tuesday authorities cancelled flights and closed some highways in emergency measures to cut down on air pollution. (Guardian, AP) Wanda wins international soccer tournament for China Property developer Dalian Wanda, led by China’s richest man Wang Jianlin, is to run China’s first international soccer tournament, with backing from Fifa, the sport’s global governing body, in January 2017. Four countries, Chile, Croatia, Iceland and China, will take part. (NAR) Israeli billionaire detained Beny Steinmetz, the Israeli billionaire at the centre of an international investigation into alleged bribery to win African mining rights, was arrested on Monday on suspicion of bribing a foreign official, Israeli police and his family’s mining business said. Police said their investigation was part of a case co-ordinated between themselves and their US and Swiss counterparts. Listen to the FT’s podcast series: The Steinmetz affair. Transgender rights flashpoint The North Carolina legislature plans to hold a special session on Wednesday to consider fully repealing a contentious law curbing legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The move comes after the Charlotte City Council rescinded a local anti-discrimination ordinance that had prompted passage of the statewide law in March. The law had led to boycotts by sports teams, businesses and entertainers, as public bathrooms become a flashpoint in the battle over transgender rights in the US. (NYT, BBC) Trump makes it official Donald Trump has won enough electoral votes to become president, despite pressure on electors across the country to reject him. But at least seven electors defied the will of the voters in their states — a number not seen in roughly a century and a half. (WSJ) It’s a big day for Bank of Japan The central bank kept monetary policy on hold and turned optimistic on the growth outlook as a slide in the yen sharply improves the outlook for 2017. Japan’s economy is “likely to turn to a moderate expansion” with rising domestic demand, large-scale fiscal stimulus and growing exports, the BoJ said. Its comments highlight the dramatic turnround from September, when despairing analysts said the BoJ was out of options to stimulate the economy. (FT) Food for thought Train-crash Brexit So which is it to be: “hard” or “soft” Brexit? Maybe neither. The FT’s Gideon Rachman suggests a third possibility that is little discussed but increasingly likely: the “train-crash Brexit”. (FT) Question marks over drones Amazon Prime Air, the company’s drones programme, could solve the “last mile” challenge in the delivery chain, believes founder Jeff Bezos. The critical question is whether we will ever allow the mass use of commercial drones over populated areas. (FT) The chemistry between Sisi and Trump Egypt’s Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has found a kindred spirit in Donald Trump. Six years after the Arab Spring uprisings began, the Arab world’s most populous nation is back under the authoritarian grip of Mr Sisi, who was the first leader to congratulate Mr Trump on his victory and shares with the president-elect a populist worldview, disdain for political Islam, and benign view of Russia. (FT) Do women make better doctors? Female physicians earn less than male doctors, but may deliver better healthcare for patients, according to a study in JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers from Harvard University found that elderly Medicare patients treated by women had a 4 per cent lower risk of dying prematurely and a 5 per cent lower risk of being readmitted to a hospital within 30 days compared with the patients cared for by male doctors. In absolute terms, that means the mortality risk went from 11.5 per cent among the patients of male doctors to about 11.1 per cent among the patients of female doctors.

Image: Bulatnikov/Shutterstock Apple is in talks with India officials to potentially set up a manufacturing base in the third-largest smartphone market in the world, according to reports. In smartphone terms, India is an Android paradise. Figures in 2016 at one stage showed Apple’s market share in the populous country as just 2.4pc. For a company reliant on growth, that’s simply not good enough – but things could soon change. According to reports in The Wall Street Journal, Apple is in talks with Indian officials to build a manufacturing hub in the country. “Financial incentives” are being sought by Apple to press ahead with any plants, according to the report, with the idea of making locally, and therefore selling locally, appealing to the tech giant. Interestingly, one of Apple’s primary manufacturing partners, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, has a manufacturing facility in southern India. During the summer, Google revealed plans to train up to 2m software developers in India on its mobile platform. This came two months after Apple announced 4,000 new jobs in Hyderabad, and also established a new iOS apps development centre in Bengaluru to accelerate the Indian tech start-up ecosystem. In China, where Apple is performing better but still not satisfactorily, efforts have also been made throughout 2016. Earlier in the year, Tim Cook made a departure from Apple’s recent global operations by settling on two facilities in the world’s most populous country. With plans to build a $45m R&D centre secured in September, the company then settled on Shenzhen as a second location one month later. “The Shenzhen centre, along with the Beijing centre, is also aimed at strengthening relationships with local partners and universities, as we work to support talent development across the country,” said the spokesperson. Building up both operations in both countries makes plenty of economic sense, though only time will tell if it has a major impact on smartphone market shares. iPhone.

The group then fled into a wooded area near Route 3.  Police said a store employee started chasing after the group, but tripped and fell. This is the second time the Apple store in the Derby Street Shoppes has been robbed in this manner.   Officers received a report that several people in dark clothing were on Route 3 near the Hingham Industrial Park. There, officers found a teenaged girl in the woods nearby. Eventually, the officers discovered a 2010 Nissan Altima on a dead end street in the industrial park, occupied by a driver and three passengers. After matching their clothing to the Apple surveillance tape, the officers arrested the individuals in the car.  Detectives obtained a search warrant for the car and discovered 20 iPhones in the vehicle.  Police arrested Derrell Williams, 20, of Roxbury, and four juveniles. They are all charged with larceny over $250, conspiracy, disorderly conduct and interfering with a police officer.  Williams was released on $5,000 bail after being arraigned in Hingham District Court last Friday. The juveniles will be arraigned on Tuesday.  Hingham police said that a similar incident occurred on Sept. 5 after a group of 10 people stole 22 iPhones from the same store. Police have not charged anyone in that incident.    MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive Instagram Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

SHARE ARTICLE: FILED IN: Industrial Internet of Things, All Industry 4.0: Evolution or Revolution? It’s some of both—like an explosive chemical reaction that’s evolving so quickly it looks like a revolution. But what really matters is how you will adapt. SHARE ARTICLE: There’s an ongoing debate if Industry 4.0 (or Smart Manufacturing) is a revolution or just an evolution, with conference speakers bringing arguments in favor of one side or the other. Besides the fact that I personally believe the discussion is not very relevant (our world is changing and we need to adapt as fast as possible to survive or excel), it’s somehow interesting to analyze the various components that have revolutionary or evolutionary aspects. First, it’s useful to define the difference between evolution and revolution. In my mind, there are two ways to look at it. One is the ability to create something totally new, unexpected and at the end unrequested. To give you a well-known example, let’s consider Microsoft vs. Apple. In the past decades, Microsoft has been one of the most evolutionary companies in the market—usually starting with an idea and making incremental changes over time. Consider the Office suite, for example, where each tool has been progressively updated since its release. Each new update brings some new features, but the latest Word is fundamentally the same as the first one. Apple’s history, on the other hand, has included the release of several “unexpected” products. Starting with the Macintosh back in the ’80s, Apple has been able to anticipate or sometimes create the consumer need. One of the better examples is the iPod, which dramatically changed the consumer habits and the music industry itself. The second way to differentiate between evolution and revolution takes into consideration the speed at which change happens. In chemistry, an explosion differs from a reaction based on its speed; it is a fast (almost sudden) exothermic reaction that transforms components and generates energy. I believe the transformation we are looking at in the industry is something similar. We are observing a transformation (evolution) that is happening so rapidly that it’s almost a revolution and, in parallel with the chemistry example, is generating a lot of energy in the market. Like the explosion, it needs to be controlled to produce the expected results, or else the damages might exceed the advantages. But the scenario is not so homogeneous, and what we are really looking at is a combination of revolutionary and evolutionary trends. Additive technologies (like 3D printing) are revolutionary. They are disrupting the way things are built and creating new opportunities both in terms of things that can be produced and business models. They are a significant part of the “next-shoring” trend. Personalized production is moving closer to customers, shortening the supply chain, reducing costs and helping to reduce the negative impact on the planet related to long transportation. Co-creation or embedding the customer in the supply chain is revolutionary. It’s dramatically changing the paradigm of how things are invented and designed. It’s not the invention capability of a few people that can create something new, but rather the analysis of usage data that can reveal behavior patterns that bring better or new products to the market. The digital thread is evolutionary. It’s a significant improvement of the entire supply chain management, enabling better efficiency and cost reduction, but it’s not a dramatic change of what was done until now. The increased communication speed and the availability of a common data set along the whole supply chain to orchestrate all the chain components can have a big impact, but doesn’t disrupt production or business models. The usage of robots in inside or outside logistics is evolutionary. Plants in which humans and robots work side by side without the safety barriers of the past are modifying the approach to both production and logistics. Amazon has already flipped the picking principle. It’s not operators that go to the product locations to get what they need to ship; it’s the shelving units that, based on the orders to be shipped, move automatically to the employees. The same sort of principle is being experimented with in operations environments, using information about production plans and component availability to automatically feed products into line stocks. There are many more examples that can be considered to demonstrate that any Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing initiative is at the same time both evolution and revolution. New technological solutions become suddenly available and enable approaches that were not considerable before; others improve much faster than in the past and allow quick modification of how things are done both technologically and business-wise. We are in a precarious situation full of opportunities. This is more important than defining if Industry 4.0 is the fourth industrial revolution or evolution.

At £399, this phone scoops the prize for the best value top-end Android. And it’s even more ludicrously good value at £429 for a 128GB model. Consider that Apple is still flogging last year’s iPhone 6S 128GB for £599, and Apple’s latest weighs in at £699, and you can see a gap between the Android and Apple worlds that’s enormous. The OnePlus 3T uses the same handsome case as the 3 that it supersedes, carved out of one piece of aluminium alloy. But inside, the OnePlus has beefed up the battery to 3400mAh from 3000mAh, upgraded the selfie camera, and kitted it out with the latest Snapdragon 821 chip. It’s now considerably more than the 3’s initial price of £309, of course, but that crept up after the EU referendum and it’s still future-proofed with a very generous 6GB of RAM. More established brands go for some strong distinguishing feature, such as HTC with its digital audio silicon. Samsung tries to tick as many boxes as it can. By contrast, OnePlus has simply made a very good looking "generic" all-rounder, picking the best components on offer in very competitive bazaar. That said, what small distinguishing features as there are I found very welcome. The physical alert slider, for example, and even more so, the capacitive buttons all increased usability. OnePlus has worked hard to bring its own Android up to the features set of the CyanogenMod variant it was required to stop using. OnePlus had to get cracking from a standing start, and it has taken a while, but the customisation we saw in the OnePlus One in 2014 is back. The 3T comes in gold, as well as grey The capacitive buttons alone caused me prefer using the OnePlus to just about any other Android I’ve used this year. Manufacturers removed these in a spasm of penny-pitching a couple of years ago, but they make it vastly easier to operate the phone in the car, I find. Curiously these never light up – but it’s still far easier to hit them without looking than a fiddly onscreen soft toolbar. The OnePlus loads its buttons with a "long press" or "double tap" to add more features, the most useful of which is the ability to return to the previous app. You can turn off the capacitive keys and use onscreen buttons if you prefer. Another nice feature: you can fire up the camera from standby by double-clicking the power button. Most will appreciate the greater battery, although there’s no “feature phone” mode here. Default home screen (left), customising the quick settings (centre), and the Shelf (right). Oxygen OS offers more useful customisation than vanilla Android Drawbacks are few. The biggest is the absence of expandable storage via a microSD card, although the generous built-in storage makes up for that. And the design ensures it can take two nanoSIM slots. The other is that charging is slow when not using OnePlus’ own proprietary Dash charger. With the Dash charger, you can get to 50 per cent in half an hour. (OnePlus claims 60 per cent in 30 minutes, which I didn’t find was too far off.) The software package is pretty much stock Android. OnePlus throws in its own Gallery app, file manager and recorder, and persists with a custom home page it calls the Shelf. This is very close to being very handy indeed, now you can throw widgets into it. But it still lacks customisation, and the widgets don't quite fit or look right. Being a fan of minimalistic setups, I wanted to use it, but ended up disabling it. OnePlus has tweaked this year’s camera to simplify operation. A vertical swipe no longer cycles through filters but rotates between camera and video. A horizontal swipe takes you to the gallery (and back again). The camera can shoot in RAW mode, so you can remove the parallax effect that’s ubiquitous in phone cameras, in Lightroom or another professional imaging program. The camera handles 4K, slow motion and time lapse as you’d expect in this price range. The app turns HDR on automatically by default. Imaging was excellent in decent light, and remarkably free of noise (but correspondingly low on detail) in low light. Colour reproduction is above par, and operation is really zippy throughout. You’ll get better results on a Samsung, but these are very capable indeed. Video uses software OIS but is slightly marred by poorly focused microphones. OIS is better implemented on most other models at the high end. The OnePlus gave me VOLTE calls on the EE network, and picked up a signal well. Like many (if not most) phones, the speaker setup appears to be stereo, but there's only one. The front fingerprint sensor is touted as one of the fastest in the business. No complaints here, and it performed as well as any on the market. During the loan period I got two updates, suggesting OnePlus is busy and attentive with updates. I’d suggest OIS and the audio input need the most work. Conclusion OnePlus owners are consistently amongst the happiest phone owners I meet - and these are not fanbois who queue up all day to play with one, but real owners. This year we’ve seen prices creep up across the industry, not so much because of the fall in sterling - it's still a highly competitive market with phone makers keen to absorb currency fluctuations. But more because insurgent brands like OnePlus and Huawei are no longer newcomers. OnePlus was selling barely above cost to establish its brand, but with wider distribution and a solid product, it doesn’t need to any more. Although it costs more than its predecessors, owners of the 3T should find themselves decently future-proofed for some time. ® Specifications 5.5 inch FHD (1080 x 1920) display Dimensions: 152.7 mm x 74.7 mm x 7.35 mm Weight: 158g Battery 3400mAh - non-removable Dual SIM Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quadcore chip RAM: 6GB Storage: 64GB (Gold and Grey) or 128GB (Grey only), no microSD slot Fingerprint sensor OnePlus 3T Product Page.

Apple is said to be seeking financial incentives in order to proceed. Apple has been trying for some time to open retail stores in India, plans which have been stymied by a government requirement to source 30% of products locally in order to be permitted to open single-brand stores. There have long been contradictory reports that Apple may or may not be granted an exemption. The Indian market holds massive potential for Apple for two simple reasons … First, it’s the second most populous country in the world after China, at 1.3 billion people, with a rapidly-emerging middle-class. Second, Apple currently has only a 5% market share there, leaving enormous scope for growth. It’s likely that India will at some point become a larger market for Apple products that the USA. There have been multiple reports that Foxconn is planning to build a $10B iPhone manufacturing plant in India, but no confirmation from either company. The WSJ report suggests that Apple has drawn up specific plans. In a letter to the government last month, the Cupertino firm outlined its plans and sought financial incentives to move ahead, the officials told The Wall Street Journal. Senior Trade Ministry authorities in recent weeks met to discuss the matter. The Indian government is said to be considering Apple’s request. India isn’t the only country to impose a 30% local investment requirement on Apple, Indonesia doing the same in order to grant permission for the company to sell the iPhone 7. In that case, Apple met the threshold by last week agreeing to invest $44M in an R&D center in the country.

The report also says that in a letter to the government last month, the company outlined its plans and sought financial incentives to move ahead. The report also adds that Apple wants to emulate its China model in India and wants financial incentives from the government, which respective departments are looking into. Earlier this year there was a report that said that Foxconn is close to signing a deal with Indian government to set up a manufacturing plant for iPhones in the country. Apple is close to getting DIPP approval for opening single brand retail stores in India and recently the DIPP panel has recommended to exempt Apple from 30% sourcing condition for retail stores. Back in June the Government of India made key changes to the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy by allowing 100% investment for retail trade and eight other sectors that will benefit Apple who has been striving to open it’s own retail stores in the country for a long time. iPhone sales continue to grow in India. In October, during investor callfor FYQ4 2016 earning report, CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone sales in India are up 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year.

The city of Stuttgart is still without an Apple Store, with the nearest one in Sindelfingen about 12 miles away. Apple has reportedly been searching for a suitable retail home in the city for some time, having rejected various locations in recent years, including a planned move into the Milaneo shopping mall which the company is said to have pulled out of at the last minute. According to German tech site ifun.de, Apple's search for a home in the state capital even led to the company offering a "three-digit million amount" for a series of wartime bunker rooms under the Stuttgarter Market Square in the center of the city. After the Second World War, the bunker system in question was used as a 100-bed hotel from 1945 to 1985. The Bunker Hotel had ventilation shafts instead of windows, and the rooms still exist to this day, but are reportedly dilapidated. An architectural competition to make the bunker a public exhibit was announced in 1995 and the winning design by Neugebauer + Roesch Architect was a 31 meter-long and 14 meter-high glass prism as an entrance pavilion to underground stores, but the design was never realized because of lack of interest from the city administration. The original architectural proposals fit Apple's portfolio of underground store, which typically involve a recognizable glass construction entrance leading to retail rooms below, as seen at the company's flagship 5th Avenue store in New York. However, the city administration are said to be reluctant to have an Apple logo-emblazoned edifice directly opposite the Stuttgart City Hall and have so far rejected Apple's large offer of money to acquire the location. At least for now, Apple's search for a retail home in the the state capital of Baden-Württemberg appears set to continue.

Just setup shop at a nice space. It's nice that they have money to spend but they don't have to be obnoxious about it. I think it's more about continuous marketing.. no other company in the world is more famous for their unique stores than Apple. It's just reminding consumers of the power and superiority of their brand. :) Rating: 4 Votes Deemr 2 weeks ago Sure, the city with the huge Mercedes Logo on top of the roof of the public train station, the huge Bosch Logo at the highway crossing airport car park has problems when a merchants logo appear on a "market" place. The ignore a 3-digit million offer to get a iconic landmark and revitalization of sub terrain buildings. Makes sense to me.

The Economic Times of India reported at the time that a Government official had revealed that in a communication to the Indian government, Apple had asked for incentives to open a plant to key government departments related to Electronics and Information Technology. Today the Wall Street Journal confirms that old news.   The Wall Street Journal report today that "Apple Inc. is discussing with the Indian government the possibility of manufacturing its products in the country, according to two senior government officials, as the company seeks to grow its sales and presence in the South Asian nation.   In a letter to the government last month, the Cupertino, Calif., firm outlined its plans and sought financial incentives to move ahead, the officials told The Wall Street Journal. Senior Trade Ministry authorities in recent weeks met to discuss the matter."   Not much is new in the WSJ report but you could review it here as confirmation of the original story.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

I shouldn’t feel betrayed, but I do I follow and write about technology as a matter of passion. It’s easy for an idealist like me to get sucked in by the effects of new technology and to start attributing some ethical agency on the part of its creators. New tech is inherently democratizing and equalizing; it destroys privilege by turning it into a mass-market commodity; and it generally builds toward a brighter, more optimistic future. With some gentle nudging from the tech industry’s leaders, I’ve fallen into the trap of believing that tech companies are our friends, and that they’re here to help us live better lives. But that meeting with Trump reminds me, and should remind us all, that tech companies are no different from the hated oil or pharmaceutical giants we so readily distrust: duty-bound to pursue profit above all else. I shouldn’t feel betrayed, but I do. For years, Google has led the fight to protect net neutrality, ostensibly to secure a better internet for all of us. Earlier this year, Apple earned my appreciation when it fought doggedly against an FBI demand that wanted it to break user privacy by allowing access to an encrypted iPhone. In both cases, a big US corporation was acting to protect its users’ best interests, and neither company has been shy about accepting credit for its seemingly altruistic work. But, of course, there’s no altruism on Wall Street, and there’s no altruism among companies traded on the stock market. Google wants net neutrality because that protects its web services from being shut out by internet service providers, while Apple considers the privacy of its devices a strong selling point and therefore works hard to preserve it. Where the so-called Trump tech summit enters into this story is by exposing the raw and unvarnished hypocrisy of every tech company in attendance. Donald Trump is not just another president, he doesn’t have a clean slate to work with, and anyone who collaborates with him as if he is or does is essentially erasing history. Trump is a self-documented misogynist, a bigot, a thinly veiled racist, and a climate science denier. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is well known for her work in promoting gender parity in the tech industry — and she reportedly brought the matter up during the meeting with Trump — but she sat only one seat away from Trump in a carefully orchestrated seating arrangement last Wednesday. She, Google co-founder Larry Page, and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos all sat at a Trump table, drinking Trump Natural Spring Water, listening intently and smiling politely at America’s new president-elect. On Trump’s other side, there was Apple CEO Tim Cook, who’s openly gay and supports LGBTQ causes whenever and however he can, and Tesla’s idiosyncratic chief Elon Musk. Both of those men have major, irreconcilable disagreements with Trump, yet both made nice with the future monster-in-chief. If you are a billionaire, wholly safe, and you still can't muster the courage to speak your truths, what hope is there for the rest of us?— Anand Giridharadas (@AnandWrites) December 15, 2016 Cook’s defense for partaking in the meeting, posted to Apple’s internal messaging board, is to say that "the way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. We engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree." But that simple explanation nullifies the extraordinary nature of Trump and his incoming presidency; it treats him as human, regular, normal — just someone you might have disagreements with — instead of as an intemperate and unqualified imposter that poses one of the 10 biggest risks to the global economy, as determined by the Economist Intelligence Unit. Silicon Valley’s elite lined up to (very publicly) pay fealty to Trump’s new power A number of the tech executives that attended the group meeting are also reported to have had one-on-one briefings with president-elect Trump. If they’d limited themselves to those words behind closed doors, I could see some validity to Cook’s reasoning — but they didn’t. They all took part in the contrived parade of paying fealty to Trump’s new power. None peeped even a word of protest against him when asked about their discussions once they were over. Somehow, the greatest titans of the tech industry have shrunk to the size of mute mice in the shadow of the incoming president. Jeff Bezos, who’s been arguably Trump’s most active opponent in Silicon Valley during the election, exemplified the horrific hypocrisy by describing the meeting as "very productive." This coming after Trump publicly rebuked Bezos and threatened to "open up" US libel laws specifically to go after the Bezos-owned Washington Post. "Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster; For when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you" pic.twitter.com/3aVb53WVnR— Vlad Savov (@vladsavov) December 15, 2016 The only person that meeting proved productive for was Trump. He sought a legitimizing photo opp with the leaders of some of the world’s most valuable and highly respected companies, and he got it. Cook looked like he’d swallowed a lemon, Bezos had a thousand-yard stare going on, but they were all there, photographed in their tacit, meek collaboration with an incoming president that most Americans view unfavorably. And this, truly, is my problem and heartache today: the failure to set aside financial interests, even briefly, for the sake of speaking candidly and openly. Every tech company has a lot of monetary interests tied up in keeping the US president happy. They all want visa reforms to allow them to recruit from abroad more easily, they’re tempted by the prospect of sweetheart tax deals for the repatriation of billions of dollars of overseas profit, and in specific cases like Musk’s, they don’t want to be deprived of billions in government subsidies. It’s all very prosaic, but when the numbers grow large enough, it seems, the courage and personalities shrink. For shame.

Apple boss asks staff for calm as 2017 updates promised for ageing Macs Internal note to Apple staff recognises media criticism of ageing Macs, but promises major updates next year. By Alistair Charlton December 20, 2016 12:52 GMT Apple CEO Tim Cook tells staff not to worry, as new Mac desktops are coming in 2017Reuters/Robert Galbraith After a year of no updates to Apple's desktop computer range, and with consumers and critics alike starting to lose hope, chief executive Tim Cook has reassured his staff that "great" updates are coming in 2017. At the time of publication, the iMac has not received an update for 434 days, far longer than the product's average update cycle of 317 days. But things are far worse for the Mac Mini (796 days since an update, almost double the average) and the Mac Pro, which has not been updated for 1,097 days, well beyond the 449-day average, as calculated by Mac Rumors. The major delay in Mac Pro updates are a particular embarrassment for Apple after company executive Phil Schiller declared, at the June 2013 launch of the computer: "Can't innovate anymore, my ass", in response to 18-month gap between this and the previous Mac Pro. Posts on an internal message board between Cook and Apple staff, leaked to TechCrunch, seek to reassure the California workforce that new Macs are coming soon, and they will answer the media's criticism. "The desktop is very strategic for us... there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases crucial, to people," Cook said. The Apple chief executive added: "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our road map. Nobody should worry about that." Although still a hugely successful company thanks to massive iPhone sales, Apple's Mac range needs to restore public confidence in the firm's ability to both innovate and please reliable customers eager to upgrade. The recent MacBook and MacBook Pro launches went down well, but were criticised for high prices (partially a result of Brexit-related currency fluctuations in the UK), and the decision to ditch all ports in favour of USB-C. New and rare among most hardware (for now), USB-C is technologically superior to the ports it has replaced, but at the cost of forcing Mac users to invest in expensive dongles, adapters and new cables to attach their existing hardware to the new MacBooks. Even the new iPhone 7 requires a different cable to plug into the latest Apple laptops. On the note of a lack of port variety, Cook claims in his note that desktop Macs boast "a greater variety of I/O [ports]" than the company's laptops. This would suggest the iMac, Mac Mini and Mac Pro ranges will not go the same way as the MacBooks and replace everything with USB-C. Although perhaps a relief to some buyers, this would surely be branded a backtrack by critics if it were the case.

While rumors about the Galaxy Note 8 are very encouraging, Apple’s upcoming halo device, the iPhone 8, might very well put a damper on Samsung’s plans. With the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers releasing their most formidable flagships ever, 2017 is looking to be a very interesting year for the mobile industry. Rumors about the Note 8’s specs are abounding, and though Samsung has not denied nor confirmed them, speculations about the device point to a powerhouse handset that is capable of going above and beyond what the best devices of 2016 could offer. Rumors point to a 4K display, a possible Snapdragon 830/835 chipset, and around 6GB to 8GB of RAM. These are not all, however, as Samsung’s upcoming flagship is also rumored to sport a number of technologies that debuted in the ill-fated Note 7, such as water resistance and an iris scanner, according to PC Advisor. Of course, a boost in battery life and native storage is also speculated for the upcoming flagship phablet. [Image by I AM NIKOM/Shutterstock] Inasmuch as the Note 8’s specs are rumored to be formidable, however, Apple’s upcoming flagship for 2017 seems to be the perfect foil for Samsung’s powerhouse device. Just like the Note 8, rumors about the iPhone 8 have not been confirmed nor denied by Apple, but speculations about the device point to a massive upgrade over the current model. Among the rumored features of the iPhone 8 are Apple’s A11 processor, enhanced RAM, a wraparound OLED screen, and enhanced AR capabilities. The iPhone 8 is also expected to come with a number of useful features, such as the dual camera setup that debuted in the iPhone 7 Plus, water resistance, and long-range wireless charging. While the two devices seem to be perfectly matched, specs and features-wise, it might be the devices’ accessories that would ultimately tip the scales in Samsung or Apple’s favor. For the longest time, the Galaxy Note line was distinguished by its proprietary S-Pen, which Samsung has refined over the years into what has arguably become the best stylus in the market. Apple, on the other hand, debuted the Apple Pencil with the release of its powerhouse tablet, the iPad Pro. Unsurprisingly, the Cupertino tech giant’s stylus was received warmly by consumers, with many lauding the accessory as a powerful productivity tool. Recently, a Value Walk report stated that Apple CEO Tim Cook was quite optimistic about the premise of having the Apple Pencil be compatible with the iPhone 8. The Apple CEO lauded the Apple Pencil as a formidable accessory device for iPhone and iPads, seemingly teasing that the upcoming flagship smartphone would most likely feature some support for the Apple Pencil. This particular statement is backed up by a recently published patent from the tech giant, which referenced the utilization of a stylus on the iPhone. With this in mind, it seems like Apple is finally exploring the idea of having a stylus for its most powerful handset, thereby encroaching on Samsung’s territory. [Image by Denys Prykhodov/Shutterstock] Apple’s entrance into the world of stylus-equipped smartphones might seem like bad news for Samsung, but previous rumors and patents point to Samsung preparing something special for the Note 8’s stylus as well. Speculations are high that the Note 8’s stylus would be unlike anything that was released before, with a previously published patent stating that Samsung is exploring the idea of the S-Pen being equipped with powerful speakers. Considering that Samsung has recently acquired audio giant Harman in an $8 billion deal, it definitely seems like the South Korean tech giant is preparing something very unique for the upcoming flagship phablet. The Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone 8 are definitely going to be massive hits in 2017. Both handsets are being designed to cater to the most demanding customers, and both devices are rumored to sport daunting specs. What would be interesting to see, of course, is how Samsung and Apple would utilize innovations to make their devices as distinct as possible. Both the iPhone and the Note brand have millions of users and fans worldwide, and considering what is at stake in 2017, Apple and Samsung cannot afford to release a less-than-stellar device. From what could be determined from speculations, however, it seems like Samsung and Apple are definitely up to the task.

By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | December 20, 2016 -- 12:34 GMT (04:34 PST) | Topic: Innovation With billions in the bank, and a product on sale where demand outstrips supply, it wouldn't seem that Apple would have much to complain about. But 2016 has seen Apple move from an apparent position of total invulnerability to one where the future looks uncertain. A rocky start Indications that trouble might be looming came as early as January, when sales data for the Q1 quarter showed that the iPhone might be losing its Midas touch: First, iPhone sales. Yes, strong sales, yes, record sales, but year-on-year unit sales growth is a zero, with revenue growth at 1 percent. Q1 is historically Apple's strongest quarter because that quarter includes both the release of the new iPhone and the holidays. It's a quarter that traditionally shows strong growth. Even adding China to the launch day didn't manage to boost sales beyond the year-ago-quarter. Things also went from bad to alarmingly bad for the iPad: Things are worse for the iPad. Here unit sales have tanked by a staggering 25 percent, with revenue down by 21 percent. This is the second holiday quarter that Apple has seen a huge decline in iPad sales. The MacBook Pro is not the root of all evil Apple's sleeker laptops do not show that Apple has lost its way. They embody the Apple way. Read More Then came the brickings The first was the Error 53 bug, a serious problem where iPhones that had had the Touch ID button replaced by third-party repairers were suddenly turning into bricks. Apple initially claimed that this wasn't a bug, but rather a feature designed to keep users safe. In the end, Apple decided that the bad publicity wasn't worth it and reversed its policy. This was followed by the "1 January 1970" bricking bug. As the name suggested, you set the iPhone to 1 January 1970, and it was then bricked. Fortunately, there was an easy fix for this bug, and Apple issued a patch to prevent it happening. iPhone SE March saw the release of the iPhone SE, a cheaper version of the iPhone for people with smaller pockets (in both senses of the phrase). So why did Apple need the iPhone SE? If the analyst predictions are correct and iPhone sales are going to weaken, Apple not only needs a more compelling piece of hardware to draw in new users, but it needs that device to be as cutting-edge as possible in order to get owners into the habit of using Apple Pay and sending Live Photos to grandma. Why? So that they're hooked and keep on buying iPhones. Then there's the opportunity to sell an upgrade to existing iPhone users running old hardware. According to a research note sent out by IHS, of iPhone models in active use, 29 percent are iPhone 5 models with 4-inch screens, and 23 percent are even older iPhone models with screens sized just 3.5-inches. From a hardware specification perspective the iPhone SE was a total steal for the price, but early adoption seemed subdued compared to earlier iPhones. The end of an era Then in April came a big down for Apple -- the company's 13-year growth streak came to an abrupt end: Apple shipped 51.1 million units, which isn't as bad as was expected (the figure to beat was 50.7 million units). That's a unit drop of 32 percent since the previous quarter, and 16 percent down year-on-year. Notice though how it's a sharper decline between first and second quarter unit sales than Apple has previously seen. The momentum generated by the launch of a new iPhone hasn't carried over as strongly into this quarter as previously, suggesting that it's not as big a hit. If that's not enough doom, it also looks like the iPhone average selling price has dropped dramatically this quarter, from $690 last quarter to around $641, and this is before the launch of the iPhone SE. This suggests that consumers were opting to buy cheaper/lower capacity iPhones over higher priced models. WWDC In June Apple hosted its annual WWDC event, and this year we saw Apple's focus shift to more tightly integrating iOS and macOS, and making the iPhone more attractive to Chinese buyers. Apple also announced that it was going to open up to developers key aspects of iOS that it had previously kept to itself: Siri, Messages, and HomeKit are being opened up to third-party developers, which will allow for a whole raft of new and exciting apps for both iOS and macOS. Rather than having to have more and more features baked into the operating system -- inevitably adding to bloat -- users can instead choose the functionality they want to add by downloading the relevant third-party app. More bad news, and a silver lining The third quarter of 2016 was particularly bad for Apple: Apple narrowly beat Wall Street expectations, but the third quarter was pretty bad for hardware sales. Let's begin with iPhone sales, which at 40.4 million, is the lowest sales Apple has seen since Q4 2014. While not exactly falling off a cliff, it's an indication of just how weak iPhone sales are, and how badly Apple needs the new iPhone to be a hit. More worrying is how far the iPhone's average selling price has dropped dramatically this quarter, from $641 last quarter to around $595, which is lower than the $606 that analysts were expecting. This suggests that consumers have been opting to buy cheaper/lower capacity iPhones over higher-priced models. This is likely to be down to the lower-priced iPhone SE, which Apple is using to entice new users into the iPhone fold (probably in the hopes of selling them a more expensive iPhone down the line). But there are always silver linings, and in this cloud, the silver lining came in the form of "Android switchers": Android users are switching to iPhone. According to Cook, they, along with first-time buyers, represented "the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter." Old and stale By the time August rolled around, it was clear that Apple was suffering from a new problem -- its entire hardware lineup had become old, outdated, and in desperate need of a refresh. I've already looked at how pathetic the Mac and MacBook lineup are. Apart from the MacBook, nothing there is worth buying because it's either old and crusty (5K iMac), or very old and crusty (Mac Pro). Buying any of this stuff means you're paying top dollar for technology that is, by the standards of the fast-moving tech industry -- ancient. But it doesn't stop there. Apart from the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, everything there either needs to be refreshed, or is long overdue a refresh. The iPad Air 2 is almost two years old and yet Apple expects consumers to still pay top dollar for this tablet. The Apple Watch is also more than a year old, and while Apple did shave $50 off the price earlier this year, I'd be hard-pressed to buy one now given that we could see a refresh any minute. It's even a terrible time to buy an iPhone, given that we're a few weeks away from a refresh. The iPhone 7 and Apple's "stupid" and "user-hostile" decisions The tech world awaited an iPhone refresh. And come September the iPhone 7 finally landed (although thanks to copious leaks, we pretty much knew everything that there was to know about the handset). Despite the fact that the iPhone 7 was quite a modest upgrade, it saw record-breaking pre-orders. But the launch was overshadowed by discussion related to Apple's decision to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack, a move that was branded as "stupid" and "user-hostile." But Apple has a pretty long track record of doing things that were seen at the time as "stupid" and "user-hostile": But the thing is that Apple is no stranger to making decisions that, at the time they were made, were labeled by some as "stupid" and "user-hostile." Let's list just a few. - Dropping the floppy drive - Not supporting Blu-ray - Dropping the optical drive - Sticking with FireWire when the rest of the world went with USB - Dropping the smartphone's physical keyboard for an on-screen keyboard - Adopting a proprietary 30-pin connector for the iPod - Coming out with a tablet that didn't have a USB port - Dropping the 30-pin connector in favor of another proprietary connector rather than going with USB like everyone else - Using Thunderbolt for high-speed connectivity rather than USB - Making a MacBook with a single USB-C port that's used for charging and connecting peripherals Ups and downs and getting outsmarted by Microsoft Apple's Q4 earnings in October beat Wall Street expectations, thus making investors happy (but the worries about the future of the iPhone are just as real as ever): Sales of 45.5 million are slightly higher than Wall Street expected, with unit sales up 13 percent compared to the previous quarter, and down 5 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. October was also the month that saw Apple refresh its MacBook Pro lineup (which was, rather unexpectedly, overshadowed by Microsoft's unveiling of the Surface Studio). The big new feature was the Touch Bar: First off, the function keys are gone, replaced with a Touch Bar multi-touch display strip that provides instant access to tools and shortcuts. The shortcuts change depending on what software application is being used, and are also customizable. The Touch Bar also features a Touch ID sensor for logging into the machine and authorizing Apple Pay payments. The Touch ID sensor required Apple to build a new chip, called the T1, to act as a secure enclave for the sensor. Apple also took the opportunity to cull the ports it saw as unnecessary, leaving the new MacBook Pro with four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports and a headphone jack: The Thunderbolt 3 ports support 40-Gbps data transfer rate and can support two 5K displays and function as USB, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI, or VGA ports with the appropriate dongle (so expect a lot of dongles in your future). When working as USB-C ports they offer 10 Gbps of data transfer. It felt like Apple had been outsmarted and outmaneuvered by Microsoft: So, why do I think that Microsoft has outsmarted and outmaneuvered Apple? Because while there's no doubt that Apple knows how to innovate, it feels like the company has lost sight of professionals. The mantra of "thinner, lighter, and fewer ports" fits in with what we've come to expect from Apple, but these are rarely features I hear being requested by professionals. Equally, while the Touch Bar is certainly innovative, and gives Apple a new feature to promote on its website and on the box, it's again not what pros are asking for. Microsoft, on the other hand, has with the Surface Studio taken the PC and tweaked the form factor a little to make it more useful, and then crammed it with high-end hardware aimed at creative types. In fact, many design pros I know will now be able to replace their expensive pen displays -- a 27-inch Cintiq pen display is $2,299, and you still need a computer to drive it -- with a 28-inch Surface Studio, without upgrading every other piece of hardware or peripheral they have. Made in America Which brings us to November, the month that saw President-elect Donald Trump tell Apple Tim Cook that it would be a "real achievement" if Apple were to shift manufacturing to the US, and promising tax breaks. Cook's response was short and cryptic: "I understand that." In reality, shifting the assembly to the US would be a mammoth task: First off, Apple doesn't manufacture iPhones itself. This job is outsourced to Foxconn and Pegatron, and these companies, in turn, manufacture the iPhone at six assembly plants in China and one in Brazil. Over the past four quarters these factories have assembled some 212 million iPhones. But this is only a small part of the story. On top of assembly, there's the supply chain to consider. Apple has more than 750 suppliers in over 20 countries, sourcing and manufacturing the components and minerals needed to build the iPhone. Those suppliers employ some 1.6 million people. And as of June 2016, 69 of those suppliers were US based. And don't forget that these assembly plants and suppliers aren't just involved in building iPhones. Most will have some part to play in pretty much any piece of electronics you can think of. This truly is manufacturing on a global scale. According to Jason Dedrick, a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, shifting the assembly to the US would add $30 to $40 to the overall cost, partly down to increased labor costs, but also because of increased transportation and logistics overheads. What will happen with this remains to be seen in the year -- or possibly years -- ahead. See also: 2016: The year Apple stumbled Apple iPad or Amazon Fire: Which is the best holiday tablet?

The Apple CEO has defended the slower update cycle for desktop versions of the Mac, after the company failed to refresh its desktop lineup this year. The iMac was updated a year ago, while the Mac Mini and Mac Pro haven't been refreshed for more than two years. That's led to some speculation that the iMac and Mac Pro desktops were on the way out in order to focus on portable successes such as the iPad. Such chatter must have been kicking off around the water coolers in Cupertino, as Cook was spurred to respond on a message board for employees. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook wrote on the in-house message board, according to a TechCrunch report. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” He goes on to stress that desktops remain "really important" to users. "The desktop is very strategic for us," he said. "It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people." Cook also added Apple has a clear idea of what's coming next in the market, but realises there's value in exploring new ideas to see where they go - praising Apple employees for being willing to take that journey. "The fantastic thing about Apple employees is they get excited about something, and they want to know how it works. What it will do. What its capabilities are," he wrote. "If they want to know about something in an entirely different industry, they start pulling the string and see where it takes them. They’re focused more on the journey, which enables so many great things to happen." He added: "We’ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can’t talk about, but that I’m incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by." Trump questions Apple employees reportedly also asked about Cook's participation in a tech-industry meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump. Cook said governments are key to a host of policies that are important - and not only to Apple, such as human rights, climate change and education. “There’s a large number of those issues, and the way that you advance them is to engage," he said, according to a Guardian report. "Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best." But he added: “We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so.” See related  Apple Mac Pro review Read more about Desktop PCs Apple View the discussion thread.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Leaked internal Tim Cook memo hints at additional desktops in Apple’s roadmap Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Tuesday, December 20th, 2016, 05:02 Category: Hardware, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, Rumor Sometimes the internal leaked documents offer a pretty interesting look ahead. In an internal post leaked to an employee message board, Apple CEO Tim Cook assured employees that the company is still committed to the Mac and that “great desktops” are coming. Apple’s desktop computers haven’t seen an upgrade in at least 433 days. Within the message, Cook offered the following reassurance: “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” Cook stated that the desktop is “very strategic” to Apple and that the current iMac is the best desktop Apple’s ever made and its 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Cook also argued that “you can rarely see precisely where you want to go from the beginning” and that “pulling strings” to see what’s coming next is one of Apple’s strengths, noting that the creation of Apple Watch led to the creation of ResearchKit, which lead to the creation of CareKit. Cook concludes the post by saying the company doesn’t do things for a return on investment, it explores new things because it’s exciting and might lead somewhere. In spite of all this, Apple’s desktop Macs haven’t seen upgrades in over a year. The iMac’s last update was 433 days ago, the Mac Mini’s last update was 795 days ago and the Mac Pro’s last update was 1,097 days ago. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Chapin • 12/20/16 8:00am Apple wireless AirPods are tested during a media event at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 07, 2016. Josh Edelson/Getty Images) Wearable computing has had a tough couple of years: the Google Glass spawned the anti-“glasshole” movement, Jeb Bush proclaimed that the Apple Watch “requires a lot more work than it needs to” and said “the battery goes out too quick,” and anyone caught wearing Snap’s Spectacles is just an idiot who likes EDM.  While these devices have been getting all of the press, 2016 quietly set the stage for the useful and, well, wearable wearable. The first truly mainstream wearable doesn’t project something over your field of view, put a screen on your wrist, or simply give you another option for capturing video of you toasting your friends over brunch—it speaks to you. A number of developments have devices like Apple’s AirPods poised to be the must-buy gadget of 2017. First, consider that audio consumption is natural. There is no forced behavior change like wearing sunglasses indoors or forcing a millennial who has quite possibly never worn a watch strap one on. An audio piece—especially a light, wireless and attractive one, like Apple’s AirPods—can be worn and spoken to with minimal disruption. An audio-based wearable leverages software that has been in development for years, and has been improving, so there is no lag time between hardware release and the point at which developers catch up with useful software. Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft all have smart assistants that would love to (and can) help with your day-to-day. Siri could gently nudge you about the upcoming event in your calendar, remind you to stand and get a few more steps in, and allow you to handle your iMessage inbox without taking your phone out—all of the basic functions that the Apple Watch promised, but failed to deliver in a smooth and Apple-like experience. For evidence of demand for those features, look no further than the fact that Apple has sold more than 13 million Apple Watches despite negative reviews. After a successful initial launch, demonstrating need for the aforementioned features, sales cratered 72 percent from 2015 to 2016. People were willing to give the product a chance, but ultimately found the execution lacking. If you want proof that this is the direction Apple will be heading, look no further than the omission of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Apple wants users to go wireless because fewer wires mean you might leave your AirPods in. If you leave your AirPods in, Siri can become an integral part of your life. It isn’t just the big players who are ready to whisper sweet nothings all day: the Angel-stage investment climate is white-hot for those working on smart assistants, artificial intelligence and conversational bots. It seems clear that these companies are poised to innovate and that they’re going to give Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft a run for their money. Or, more likely, join them when the space heats up for mergers and acquisitions in a few quarters. After a decade dominated by larger and ever-improving screens, we’ve finally contracted screen fatigue. It’s audio’s turn now. But get ready for your HD retina Air Pods coming to a Christmas tree near you, December 2020. Andrew J. Chapin is a technology entrepreneur in San Francisco and a Boston Red Sox fan.

ADVERTISEMENT Owners of Apple's miniature black box can get their hands on Minecraft now. To make up for it being possibly the last format in the tech world to receive the game, the tvOS release will come with seven pieces of DLC to bolster the core world-building game. Per developer Mojang's blog, buyers of Minecraft: Apple TV Edition will receive the Holiday 2015, Town Folk, and City Folk skin packs, plus the Plastic, Natural, Cartoon, and Festive 2016 mash-ups packs. The DLC is available "for a limited time".

There is one slight downside - the Apple TV Edition currently doesn't support Minecraft Realms or Xbox Live log-ins. However, Mojang says the game will be updated to support both features "in the near future".

Both are now running at version 1.0, with updates available to download now. ADVERTISEMENT The full version brings with it the Ender Update. This expands Minecraft's world with a whole new realm to explore - The End - and the iconic Ender Dragon, the game's major 'boss'. The new area, which can be accessed after players have found, repaired, and re-activated the End Portal, also features unique cities, ships, and locations to explore, along with new enemies. The Ender Update also adds in new items and crafting materials, such as End Stone bricks and Purpur objects. The regular Minecraft world will also see additions and fresh recipes, including igloos and polar bears. While Pocket Edition has been in development in various iterations since 2011, and Windows 10 Edition since 2015, anyone buying the Apple TV Edition gets to jump to the front of the queue - that version launches with the Ender Update already included.

Apple fanatics were devastated to learn Apple Airpods had sold out of shops within minutes. Alamy 4 The AirPods were unveiled in September with the new iPhone 7, amidst fierce backlash And with pre-orders on Apple’s website only shipping in 2017, iPhone lovers are desperate to get their hands on a pair before Christmas. But crafty customers who pre-ordered the earphones – a must for the iPhone 7 – are now selling them for an absolute goldmine. At £159-a-pop they were already pretty pricey. But if you want to nab a pair before Christmas you’ll be paying over £400 – plus postage and packaging. Apple reveal the new intelligent wireless Airpods that intuitively connect eBAY 4 Apple Airpods are selling for over £399 on eBay In one instance, a savvy shopper gleefully posted on eBay: “Happy bidding” as they listed the earphones bid for £399.99. They added: “The long awaited Apple AirPods are here, and now quickly backordered [sic] on the Apple website. “However, you can get these before Christmas and delivered by the 24th December if immediate payment is made.” Related stories HISSY FIT 'Spoiled brat' throws epic strop in shopping mall screaming at grandpa over being late for iPhone appointment APPLE RUMOURS Apple will join forces with arch-enemy Samsung to build iPhone 8, rumours suggest NOT MUSIC TO YOUR EARS This is how much it costs to replace just ONE of Apple's new AirPod earphones MERRY TECH-MAS Gadget guru picks the very best Christmas prezzies for the tech lovers in your life MUSIC TO YOUR EARS Apple shocks the world with release of Airpod wireless headphones just in time for Christmas Apple’s limited stock meant that in some cases, people queuing in line weren’t able to nab a pair this week.

The iMac was updated a year ago, while the Mac mini and Mac Pro haven't been refreshed for more than two years. That's led to some speculation that the iMac and Mac Pro desktops were on the way out in order to focus on portable successes such as the iPad. Such chatter must have been kicking off around the water coolers in Cupertino, as Cook was spurred to respond on a message board for employees, at the same time as he explained his reasons for meeting president-elect Donald Trump.  “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook wrote on the in-house message board, according to a TechCrunch report. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” He goes on to stress that desktops remain "really important" to users. "The desktop is very strategic for us," he said. "It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop – the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people."

"The fantastic thing about Apple employees is they get excited about something, and they want to know how it works. What it will do. What its capabilities are," he wrote. "If they want to know about something in an entirely different industry, they start pulling the string and see where it takes them. They’re focused more on the journey, which enables so many great things to happen." He added: "We’ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can’t talk about, but that I’m incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by."

We had been feeling optimistic about a new Mac Pro appearing before the end of 2016, but it looks like we'll have to wait until March 2017. We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 22 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro? And what new features, specs and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2016? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? Apple's Mac Pro line-up could do with an update. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2016? (Or 2017, or...) There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10 USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. Updated on 22 December 2016 to include comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.)

According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people." "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never mentioned "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been more than a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches  the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre 2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2016-2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

And, following the iPad Air 2's second birthday, is Apple killing off the iPad Air line... or even the entire Air brand, laptops and all? Let's look at the evidence, in our iPad Air 3 release date UK rumour roundup. Latest: reports claim iPad Air 3 will launch in March 2017, and a well-known analyst has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad by David Price | 20 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Poll - How often do you update your iPad? Design Tech specs Price New features wishlist When will the iPad Air 3 come out in the UK? And what design, tech specs, new features and UK price should we expect from Apple's next mid-size (9.7-inch) iPad, whether it's called iPad Air 3, iPad Pro 2, just plain iPad, The New iPad or something else? Finally, is Apple killing off the iPad Air brand - or even the entire Air brand, laptops and all? The most recent mid-size iPad was announced in March 2016, but it wasn't the new iPad Air 3 we had expected; instead, Apple unveiled its 9.7-inch iPad Pro, featuring improved specs, design tweaks and more. Does this mean Apple has finished with the iPad Air line, sticking to Pro branding for both 9.7- and 12.9-inch iPads in future? (And maybe even releasing an iPad Pro mini or iPad Pro 7.9in instead of the iPad mini 5?) Or will it carry on releasing 9.7-inch iPads in both Pro and Air configurations, much as it has done with the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro? Does the iPad Air have a future? In this article we look at rumours about the the iPad Air 3's release date in the UK, and talk about possible new features and design changes to expect. Bookmark this page and check back regularly for the latest information: as rumours circulate and news leaks out, we'll update it with everything you need to know about the new iPad Air 3: design, features, size and specifications, the differences between the next-gen iPad Air 3 and the current iPad Air 2, the iPad Air 3's UK launch date and likely UK pricing, and much, much more. Last updated on 15 December 2016, to talk about predictions of a Westworld-style folding iPad; on 6 Dec, to refresh our wishlist of new iPad features; on 29 Nov, to discuss rumours of a new line of iPads with a 10.9-inch screen; on 15 Nov, to adjust our predictions of the iPad Air 3's UK price based on recent changes for other Apple hardware; and on 1 Nov, to discuss the rumour that the iPad Air 3 will launch in March 2017, and be the last ever Air-branded tablet. iPad buying advice: If you're more interested in the current iPad range, read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review, 9.7-inch iPad Pro review and iPad Air 2 review, and our iPad mini 4 review and iPad mini 2 review. And remember to check our iPad buying guide 2016/2017 and best cheap iPad deals UK. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Release date With no new iPads appearing at either Apple's September iPhone 7 launch or at its October MacBook Pro event, March 2017 looks like the next logical timing for new iPads. Long, long ago - and wrongly - we predicted an October 2015 launch date for the iPad Air 3. This seemed logical: the iPad Air 2 was unveiled on 16 October 2014; the iPad Air 1 on 22 October 2013. This is Apple's traditional iPad release schedule, and the announcement of iOS 9 at WWDC 2015 on 8 June, same as every year, suggested that things were proceeding as usual. But 2015 was a surprising year for iPad announcements. At the September press briefing, where we would traditionally expect to hear about iPhones, iPhones and more iPhones, Apple gave the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus some company, in the form of the giant iPad Pro, and the petite iPad mini 4. But iPad Air 3 came there none, either at the September event or in October 2015. Apple instead refreshed its mid-size iPad range the following March, and called it the iPad Pro 9.7in. iPad Air 3 release date UK: March 2017 launch - but iPad Air 3 'will be last in Air line' Some pundits - reported by NeuroGadget, among others - are predicting that the iPad Air 3 will be unveiled in March 2017... alongside the iPad Pro 2. Perhaps they're right, but this seems off to us, and appears to go against the strategy Apple has been pursuing with its tablets in recent years. Having a brand-new (presumably 9.7-inch) iPad Air alongside new iPad Pros of the same screen size would be confusing for customers, and it's hard to see how Apple would differentiate the two. Would the iPad Pro 2 be faster than the iPad Air 3? How much faster does it need to be, given that the iPad Pro 9.7-inch is already far quicker than is necessary to run any app on the App Store? Would the iPad Air 3 be slower than the iPad Pro 9.7in? Would the iPad Air 3 be thinner than the Pro 2, when the Pro 9.7in is already only 6.1mm thick? There are surely ways round this, but it would present a headache for Apple's marketing department. The differentiation was easier to maintain for the MacBooks, partly because laptop buyers tend to be tech-savvier on average (and are liable to put in more pre-purchase research) than tablet buyers, but also because laptops have more room for difference in terms of specs and the like. Someone who just wants to read their email can settle for a netbook or Chromebook, while a video editor needs a laptop that's vastly more powerful. But the current iPad range is as fast as anyone could possibly want. Releasing a new tier of products on top, aimed at creative professionals, seems redundant. Releasing a new (slower?) tier of products below, aimed at casual and budget users, would be deeply unlike Apple, which always chases the premium market in any given sector. And seems unnecessary too, given that older iPads are still available. Content continues below So we're not exactly convinced by this. Apple may choose to release another iPad Air, but to release it at the same time as a new iPad Pro would a branding challenge, to say the least. Separately, those same reports also predict that the iPad Air 3 will be the last Air-branded tablet Apple release. To wait this long, release one more Air tablet, then pack up the brand for good? Seems... strange. Still, we shall see. iPad Air 3 release date UK: iPad Air 2's second birthday It's been more than two years since the iPad Air 2 was first shown off to the world's media. Back in 2014, Apple used to schedule separate iPhone and iPad launch events in consecutive months in autumn, and the iPad Air 2 (and underwhelming iPad mini 3) were revealed on 16 October, just over a month after the iPhone 6. (What an act to follow!) As we discuss above and below, some pundits think a successor to the iPad Air 2 will be launched before the end of 2016. Perhaps it will. But now that we've passed the two-year anniversary of the Air 2's launch with no word on the iPad Air 3 (and almost no movement on MacBook Air updates), we need to start facing facts: Apple appears to have lost interest in the Air brand. A two-year hiatus is enormous in the world of tablet updates. iPad Air 3 release date UK: The end of the Air brand There are widespread rumours that Apple has finished with the Air line, and will in future focus on the (7.9-inch) mini and (9.7-inch and 12.9-inch) Pro ranges - or even just unite everything under the Pro branding, with the various lines differentiated by size. Our feeling, based on the lack of love shown to the MacBook Air recently, is that Apple is moving towards a twin-brand model for its laptops: a MacBook, and a MacBook Pro. Likewise, we could see a product or line of products called, simply, 'iPad', to sit alongside the Pro models. iPad Air 3 release date UK: Onsale date rumours When will the iPad Air 3 go on sale in the UK? There's usually a delay of about 10 days between the announcement and the devices going on sale. If the Air 3 launches in late-October 2016, for example, then expect it to hit UK shops in early November. There are occasionally shortages when a major Apple product launches, so those who are desperate to get their hands on the Air 3 would be wise to place a pre-order if possible. (Pre-ordering using Apple's own Apple Store app rather than on the website often appears to give you a head start that could make all the difference.)

The iPad Air 3 may arrive in spring 2017, but not every iPad owner will make the upgrade. How often do you buy a new iPad? iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Design Let's look next at the iPad Air 3's physical design. What will the iPad Air 3 look (and feel) like? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Folding iPad Gene Munster - perhaps the most famous Apple analyst out there, albeit mainly for consistently getting it wrong when predicting an Apple television - has predicted that Apple will release a folding iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, is based on Apple's recent patent activity; as we've reported in our iPhone 8 rumour roundup, the firm has taken out a number of 'folding device' patents that seemingly apply to the iPhone, but the larger and less portable iPads actually seem more amenable to such a development. Munster may have been influenced by a popular current TV show, Westworld. In this series, which centres around a Western-themed park where realistic android 'hosts' interact with human 'guests' living out their fantasies, the programmers of the hosts all use neat folding tablets. It's actually one of the most remarked-upon elements of the show's aesthetic, and makes a lot of sense (if you can solve the technical challenges). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Smart Connector for Smart Keyboard... It's an obvious logical progression from the 12.9- and 9.7-inch iPad Pro models, but it seems likely that the iPad Air 3 will have a Smart Connector on the lefthand edge for attaching a Smart Keyboard Cover. Most iPad accessories are dependent on their own battery power - even the Apple Pencil has to be recharged, albeit very quickly, when it runs out of charge - but the Smart Connector allows a connected keyboard cover to draw power from the iPad's battery. In the larger iPad Pro's case, that means a very long usage time, since it has a monster battery; hopefully the iPad Air 3 will be able to offer something impressive in that department too. iPad Air 3 design rumours: ...and Apple Pencil compatibility When Apple launched the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, it was the only tablet that was compatible with the Apple Pencil. That made sense at the time - it was a unique selling point for Apple's most expensive tablet. But plenty of iPad Air owners have told us they would dearly love to be able to use the Pencil, one of the best styluses on the market, with their device, and it would be reasonable to add compatibility to a wider range of devices over the coming year. Apple started that process with the 9.7-inch Pro, and we expect Pencil capabilities to diffuse downwards through the range. iPad Air 3 design rumours: 10.9-inch screen An upgrade mentioned in the new features wishlist later in this article, and which sounds like it may happen: a larger screen. More specifically, a screen that's larger than that of the iPad Air 2, but smaller than the 12.9-inch display on the larger iPad Pro model. Barclays Research has predicted that Apple will unveil three new iPad Pro 2 models in March 2017: new 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models, and a 10.9-inch version that sits in between. The inbetweener will actually have a chassis that's the same size as the iPad Air 2, while achieving the extra screen space by removing the bezel - which may mean the removal of the Home button. Whether Apple will carry over these changes to the Air line as well remains to be seen. iPad Air 3 design rumours: Thinner than iPad Air 2 Physically, it's rumoured that the next iPad Air will be… wait for it… thinner than its predecessor. It's generally a sound prediction to make, given that the iPad Air 1 was thinner than the iPad 4 and the iPad Air 2 was thinner than the iPad Air 1. The iPad Air 2 is already really thin, mind you, and we do sometimes wonder how much thinner tablets need to get before the compromises start to outweigh the benefits. The Air 2 is sturdy and has stood up to more than a year's heavy and frequent use, but we still recall the nervousness with which we handled it in the early days: it's hard to see an even more slender iPad Air 3 inspiring a great deal of confidence in its ability to withstand bending, chucking on a sofa, holding by one edge etc. (Note that the iPad Pro 9.7in, which improves on the iPad Air 2 in most other respects, is the same thickness.) If batteries are getting smaller, couldn't they just keep it the same size and incorporate a higher-capacity battery unit, and give us a few more hours away from the charger? Indeed, one rumour suggests that the Air 3's thinner chassis will actually mean it has a lower-capacity battery unit than the Air, which seems crazy to us. (Even though improvements in battery technology could mean that this lower-capacity unit actually lasts for a comparable length of time in practice, it seems barmy to consciously choose not to improve battery life when simply keeping the same capacity unit would achieve this.) iPad Air 3 design rumours: 7000-series aluminium body We mentioned above our general nervousness that a thinner iPad Air 3 would also be less robust. But one other change to its physical design could help with that. The Tampa Bay Review thinks the iPad Air 3 is likely to be made of 7000-series aluminium, like the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. There's a certain logic to this: spending the extra cash on stronger materials to make the newest iPhones more bend-proof than their predecessors was a popular move after the (possibly overstated) traumas of Bendgate. But it does raise the question of why the iPad Pro (which is more valuable) and the iPad mini 4 (which is more portable, and therefore more likely to get crammed into a pocket) missed out on this upgrade. If the Air 3 is thinner than either of those devices then we have an answer, but that only poses another: what is it about the Air lineup in particular that makes it more deserving of a super-thin body than those other Apple tablets? iPad Air 3 design rumours: Colour options Like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, we'd expect the iPad Air 3 to be available in four colours: silver, gold, Space Grey and Rose Gold. Black and Jet Black, the matt and gloss new colour finishes available for the iPhone 7, are also possibilities. Every year someone suggests that the next iPad will come in the bright primary colours of the iPhone 5c and every year that person is disappointed. We don't expect the iPad Air 3 to be particularly colourful (except for the two fairly muted gold finishes). iPad Air 3 design rumours: Concept showcases everything iPad Air 3 should be Although we've not seen many leaks for the iPad Air 3, the latest concept video to hit the Internet showcases everything that the unannounced tablet should feature - Smart connector, a flush camera and, more importantly, 3D Touch support. Apart from that, the concept tablet looks similar to the iPad Pro 9.7in but with smaller bezels at the sides of the display. Take a look at the concept video below: iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Tech specs It's time to look deeper into the iPad Air 3. What do the latest rumours say about the iPad Air 3's specs? iPad Air 3 specs rumours: Processor and speed The iPad Air 2 got a new processor chip, the A8X - a souped-up version of the iPhone 6's A8. This has three billion transistors and offers (Apple says) 40 percent faster performance than the iPad Air 1's A7 chip in most apps and up to 2.5x graphics performance. Read next: Best iPad games | Best free iPad games It would be a big shock if Apple didn't upgrade the processor again when it launches the iPad Air 3, and it doesn't take a genius to predict that the iPad Air 3's chip will be an A9 or an A9X, and very speedy indeed. The iPad Pro 9.7in has an A9X processor. Read next: Apple rumours & predictions for 2016/2017 | iPad mini 5 rumours iPad Air 3 specs: Rear-facing camera gains LED flash The iPad Pro 9.7in is the first iPad in history to feature a flash. This is attached to the rear-facing camera, but the front-facing camera also gets the Retina Flash feature, whereby the entire screen is induced to light up as a sort of substitute flash. We feel that the iPad Air 3 is likely to get one or both of these upgrades too. The genie is clearly out of the bottle when it comes to iPad photography: as annoying as you find it when someone holds up their iPad to video a concert, the iPad range are being used as cameras, and Apple knows this. Just look at the hyperbole and feature list here. And a flash is a big gap to have in a device's photographic armour. iPad Air 3 specs: No 3D Touch Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most famous Apple pundits out there, predicted that 3D Touch wouldn't make an appearance in the iPad Pro 9.7in, and this proved correct. In a research paper, Kuo predicted that the a new iPad would launch in the first half of 2016 but wouldn't get the marquee feature from the flagship iPhones. In the past, Apple has frequently introduced a new feature on the iPhone line and then dispersed it through other iOS devices - Retina displays, Siri, Touch ID - and plenty of analysts have made the obvious logical leap of assuming that 3D Touch will migrate to iPad at some point. Ming-Chi Kuo was the most authoritative voice to doubt this. It would seem strange to allow this popular (if still fairly niche) feature to appear on the iPad Air 3 if it isn't on the iPad Pro, so we assume 3D Touch on iPad will have to wait for a while longer. Read next: 3D Touch tips iPad Air 3 specs: Screen resolution Back in 2014, we wondered if the iPad Air 2 might get a screen upgrade from the Air 1, possibly gaining the Retina HD designation given to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. But its display is largely the same, with the same resolution and size. (One screen modification Apple did talk about was an anti-reflective coating: a nice - if unglamorous - upgrade.) And this idea has been floated again this year. Back in September 2015 the Chinese-language site MyDrivers (link to translation) made some grand claims about the iPad Air 3's specifications. Most eye-catching among these is the unexpected prediction that Apple will increase the resolution and therefore pixel density of the screen on its next mid-size iPad. MyDrivers reckons the Air 3 will get a bump up to 401 pixels per inch (matching the iPhone 6s Plus), which translates on a 9.7-inch screen into a resolution of 3112 x 2334. (This compares to 2048 x 1536 at 264ppi on both the Air 1 and Air 2.) Pixel density is a measure of how tightly pixels are packed on a screen, and increasing it so much would result in an appreciably sharper screen - even though Apple used to maintain that 264ppi was plenty on devices of this form factor. Moving up to 401ppi on the Air 3 would be a major step forward for Apple, which has previously applied its Retina marketing label to 9.7-inch tablets rated at 264ppi on the basis that they are held further away from the eye than smartphones or even mini tablets (the Retina-rated mini 2 and mini 4 both have a pixel density of 326ppi, matching the non-Plus iPhones). There is a simple reason why we don't think this is likely to happen. As well as smashing past the pixel density of half of Apple's smartphones, including the just-released and Retina HD-rated iPhone 6s (326ppi), all of which would be held far closer to the face than the iPad Air 3, it would also show up the iPad Pro, which has a pixel density of 264ppi. And the iPad Pro is a very expensive top-end device that is clearly positioned as Apple's flagship tablet. It's hard to imagine anyone happily paying top dollar for a 264ppi Pro when there's a 401ppi Air 3 for, presumably, about £200 less. Oh, and we dread to think what such a large bump in resolution would do to battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus got round that because its larger size allowed it to include a bigger battery, but we're hearing that the Air 3 will be thinner than the Air 2. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: Price We expect it to cost pretty much what the iPad Air 2 cost when it launched - and it launched with a base price of £399. These days the iPad Air 2's UK price starts at £379 for the 32GB model in Wi-Fi only, moving up to £469 for 128GB Wi-Fi. The 3G/cellular models cost £120 more at each configuration: £499 for the 32GB model and £589 for 128GB. (These prices have all dropped since the Air 2 was launched - in stark contrast with the prices of most other Apple hardware, which has gone up since the Brexit vote - and the lowest storage capacities have been phased out.) Mind you, a better comparison point might be the iPad Pro 9.7. That device currently starts at an altogether more intimidating £549, and rises to £849 for the 256GB cellular model. With the iPad Air 3 filling in its predecessors' price points, the iPad Air 2 may drop further in price; the iPad Air 1 is likely to be discontinued. Apple usually tries to keep its range simple. iPad Air 3 release date rumours UK: New features wishlist So much for the rumours concerning the iPad Air 3's design changes, specs and new features. But what new features would we add to the device if we were in Jony Ive's shoes? Here's our iPad Air 3 feature wish list. Some are brand-new wishes: perhaps ideas triggered by issues with Apple's latest line of iPads. Others are features we've been asking for since before the iPad Air 2 but weren't included in that device. Let us know what features you want to see in the iPad Air 3 in the comments, or let us know on Twitter. iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Larger screen You can never be too rich, or too thin, or have too much screen space. In fact, there would be plenty of negatives attached to increasing the iPad Air 2's screen size from its current 9.7in diagonal: mainly increasing the bulk of the device (and having to incorporate a bigger and heavier battery to power the screen for as long), thereby reducing its fantastic portability. But a bigger screen would make the iPad Air more adaptable as a work device, and more immersive for entertainment, so who cares about practicalities? In fact, since we wrote this wishlist, Apple has unveiled an iPad with a bigger screen; it just isn't called the iPad Air 3. Go and read our 12.9-inch iPad Pro review for more on that one. We think the iPad Air line will continue to be based around a 9.7in screen. Chances of happening (on the Air line at any rate): low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Faster processor This too is an obvious one, and something that has happened in essentially every iOS device update: a new, faster processor chip. But is it actually something to be wishing for? The iPad Air 2 is fast enough to run every current app with ease, and on most apps you won't notice any different in performance between it and the iPad Air 1 (iPad Air 1 vs iPad Air 2 comparison). The iPad Air is effectively faster than it needs to be, and apps are trying their best to catch up. The iPad Air 3 (or iPad 7) doesn't need to be any faster. It'll probably get a new chip, and there's a good chance it'll be a bit faster, but maybe Apple will go for greater power-efficiency instead?  Yeah, who are we kidding? You've got to be able to boast about processing speeds at the launch announcement. Chances of happening: nailed on iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved camera The last of our recurring requests that crop up every time. Of course an improved camera would be nice, but we wouldn't cite it as an essential, since the iPad is used less for its camera than Apple's smartphones (less, although tablet camera use is growing all the time), and it's got pretty good anyway. A smartphone needs a great camera; a tablet doesn't. Chances of happening: mid to low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Face recognition Ah, something more interesting! What if the iPad Air 3 uses facial recognition to unlock the device? Face-recognition is already available in the Camera app, but that's facial recognition only in the sense of recognising that something is a face, rather than recognising which one it is - which makes this one a long shot. It does also seem a bit unnecessary, given that Apple has the Touch ID technology, and so does the iPad Air 2. If it wants to do convenient, biometric authentication it can use that.  Chances of happening: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Full Apple Pay This one is slightly complicated. The iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 gained Touch ID fingerprint scanners - one of the components required to use the new Apple Pay online/instore payment service, which allows you to pay for things in shops by scanning your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and touching the fingerprint scanner. And indeed both models can use Apple Pay in the US. (Apple Pay hasn't launched in the UK at time of writing, but it will make its UK launch in July.) But they get only a limited, partial version of Apple Pay: one that doesn't work in shops. Instead they use the online and app-based versions of Apple Pay, which use Touch ID but don't require the NFC wireless antenna component used when scanning the iPhone 6 on an instore receiver. A further complication is the discovery of NFC antennae in both devices when they were disassembled; perhaps these could be activated in future and allow for full Apple Pay. Or perhaps they are intended for some other purpose. Either way, we'd like to at least have the option of instore Apple Pay with the next generation of iPads. Admittedly the average customer is a lot less likely to whip out a full-size iPad at the till, but we thought something similar about iPad photography. Chances of happening: fairly high - especially now that Apple Pay has come to the Mac iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Live multitasking "The fact that you cannot use multiple applications at the same time is a little annoying," said Product Reviews when discussing potential new features for the iPad Air 2, "and it would definitely be a great feature if Apple could add it in. For example you could update your Twitter feed in a sidebar whilst watching a video or check your emails whilst reading an article." We didn't get it in the iPad Air 2, and it still makes sense for the iPad Air 3, although you'd probably need a bigger screen to be able to use this practically. And maybe it's more of an iOS 9 thing. Even as a software update it seems very radical indeed for something that (I think) is a niche requirement. How many people check their emails while continuing to read an article or watch a video? Chances of happening: low UPDATE: Scratch that. Chances of happening: definite. Multitasking capabilities arrived with iOS 9: iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Improved stylus support "I'd like to see more attention paid to the display sensor technology that allows for the next generation of fine tip electronic styluses to be used more effectively and accurately," wrote MacObserver ahead of the launch of the iPad Air 2. Since then Apple has launched the Apple Pencil stylus alongside the two iPad Pro models - the only devices that are compatible with it. We wouldn't be surprised if the iPad Air 3 gets Apple Pencil support.  Chances of happening: decent (albeit the Apple Pencil) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Subwoofer and other audio/speaker improvements The iPad's audio output could be improved; this is certainly true. (The iPad Air 2 has stereo speaker units, but they are so close together that their output is effectively mono.) Yet there are limits on the richness of the audio a slim and portable unit can produce; I suspect that the average iPad owner would rather buy a separate wireless speaker than add any noticeable weight to the iPad Air's chassis. A touch more bass output would substantially improve the iPad as a games unit, mind you, and it would be great for film fans.  Chances of happening: decent (the iPad Pro models have quad speakers) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Increase the storage baseline "iPads tend to accumulate a lot of stuff," pointed out MacObserver. "Apps, movies and music that make a 16GB iPad an anachronism. Here's hoping..." In fact, Apple phased out the popular 32GB model instead, leaving the iPad Air 2 (and the iPad mini 3 and iPhone 6 handsets) with an oddly lopsided line-up of 16GB, 64GB and 128GB. Will Apple phase out the 16GB iPad? It's going to happen at some point - remember the 8GB iPad? - but maybe not quite yet. Plenty of users store work documents and photos in the cloud, rarely game and use a small number of lightweight apps.  Chances of happening: nailed on (Apple has bumped up the storage baselines across its iPad and iPhone ranges. All iPads now start at 32GB, and Pro models top out at 256GB. Hooray!) iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Memory card slot We'll say right away: this would be nice in some respects but is highly unlikely. Apple's philosophy embraces the closed box: the complete product experience bought ready-to-use and held apart from user tinkering and upgrades. Without mentioning that this would encourage buyers to go for the lower-capacity iPads and fill the shortfall with removable memory. And it would ruin the iPad's clean lines.  Chances of happening: no way iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Bluetooth mouse support It's been argued that touch is less accurate than mouse (or similar) input, and that Apple's more work-oriented users would enjoy being able to use wireless mice with their iPad Air 3. If we were talking about the Mac OS X-running iPad Pro that some have discussed, this would be a no-brainer, but this would call for a major rethink of how iOS works, and we don't think that's likely.  Chances of appearing: low iPad Air 3 feature wish list: Wireless charging At the moment wireless charging is big let-down, offering only minor convenience rather than the quantum leap it appears to promise. The Air Voltage Qi Chargers are an example of a (comparatively) recent take on the concept: you buy a case for your device, and a separate charging mat. Simply laying the cased iPhone on the mat starts up the charging process - but it has to touch the mat, and the mat itself has to be plugged in.  If Apple incorporated the technology in the chassis of the iPad so that you don't have to bother with a particular case then it would be far more appealing. If you could increase the range of the charge transmission so that, for example, you just need to be sitting with a couple of feet of the charger for the device in your pocket to start charging - then we'd be talking. Chances of appearing: still seems unlikely, although we're hearing more and more rumours about this appearing on the iPhone 8.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/File Photo By Stephen Nellis | SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) new wireless headphones could be a problem for recyclers, according to an electronics firm that took apart the device to review its component parts. Apple has been promoting a more environmentally conscious image for the company after having come under fire in the past for constructing its devices so tightly that their components can be difficult to cost-effectively disassemble for recycling. But Apple's latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products. "They're basically saying this is the future of headphones," said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple's future. "There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years," Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices. The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews. The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed. The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods' construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. "I can't do it by hand. It's cost prohibitive," Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that "there's a relatively high risk of fire".

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: BUSINESS Analysis Why a tax cut for tech companies to bring home overseas cash won’t have much economic impact Chris O'Brien@obrien December 20, 2016 5:19 AM Tags: Alphabet, Apple, Cisco Systems, Google, Microsoft, oracle, politics, top-stories, Trump Image Credit: Rrraum/Shutterstock As Silicon Valley weighs the upsides and the downsides of a Trump presidency, one positive often mentioned is the potential for a tax cut that would encourage tech giants to repatriate the billions of dollars they have stashed overseas. Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut to 10 percent — from the current 35 percent — on foreign-held cash that is brought back to the United States. The five largest holders of cash overseas are tech giants: Microsoft, Apple, Cisco Systems, Oracle, and Alphabet’s Google. But, according to a report from credit-rating agency Moody’s, there is an important twist here that would significantly dampen any hoped-for economic stimulus: This money has been all but spent. Moody points out that Microsoft, Apple, Cisco Systems, and Oracle have “raised significant debt to support dividend payments and share buybacks due to their substantial overseas cash holdings.” With interest rates at historically low levels, these companies have been borrowing like crazy to buy off shareholders while keeping their actual cash made from operations overseas. Should they be allowed to bring that money back, most likely it would be used to pay down their massive debts, rather than going toward things like expansion, research and development, or hiring. Of course, from Moody’s perspective, this would be good news because it would reduce debt and make the balance sheets of these companies much more attractive. “Cash repatriation tax relief would provide a one-time boost to financial flexibility, but more comprehensive tax reform that provides companies improved economic access to their global cash would provide greater flexibility and clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions,” said Rick Lane, a Moody’s senior vice president, in a statement with a report. “It could also prompt companies to raise less debt capital, which would be credit positive.” But in terms of boosting the economy, well, don’t hold your breath. A previous repatriation tax holiday in 2004 was largely seen as a dud. Not only did it not induce may companies to actually bring their cash home, in many cases it was used to do things like pay for dividends and stock buybacks. Good for shareholders, but not much help to the broader economy. Since then, the amount of cash held overseas has exploded. In many cases, that’s because large U.S.-based operations like Apple earn big bucks abroad. However, critics also charge that companies like Apple are playing fast and loose with tax laws to claim they are earning money in jurisdictions with low taxes. Apple is facing a European Union investigation into whether it has an illegal deal with Ireland to cut its tax bill, a case that could cost the company billions in back taxes if it loses. Moody’s says that the five largest cash holders will have $505 billion overseas by the end of 2016, out of $1.2 trillion of all U.S. corporations. But their debt levels have also risen fast. Apple had $3.7 billion in debt in 2012 and now has $94 billion, according to Moody’s data. Microsoft has jumped from $12 billion in debt in 2012 to $81.3 billion. Cisco currently has $28.6 billion in debt, while Oracle has $55 billion. Alphabet’s Google is the only one that has not leveraged itself in recent years. Of course, it’s possible that a bill passed by Congress and backed by Trump would place limitations on how any repatriated cash could be spent. But while legislators might be able to rule out things like share buybacks and dividends, it would be harder to block debt repayments as a use of the funds. Over the long run, Moody’s said it would prefer to see comprehensive tax reform, rather than a one-time holiday. Short of that, it said companies would continue stockpiling income in foreign banks.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: December 20, 2016 1:07 pm Apple CEO Tim Cook reassured staff that the desktop is “very strategic” to the Cupertino-based company. There’s been an impression that Apple has completely ignored its desktop line of computers. Although Apple did update the iMac with 5K and 4K displays in 2015, but it’s been long since the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro got new features or a refresh. Now, Apple CEO Tim Cook reassured employees in an internal memo that the desktop is “very strategic” to the Cupertino-based company. In an internal memo which was shared by TechCrunch, Cook has clarified that Apple won’t stop making desktop computers, despite how things have been presented to the outer world. He says the current generation iMac is the best desktop Apple ever made and its 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that”, Cook posted at Apple employees’ message board. As Cook has addressed concerns about the status of desktops, it’s fair to say that Apple does not want to end making its iMacs and other Mac desktops. This news should bring solace to Apple fans, who have been waiting to upgrade their current desktops. Also read: Microsoft says more people are switching from MacBook Pro to Surface Apple’s share in the worldwide PC market continues to see a steady decline. The Cupertino-based technology giant sold 4.86 million Macs in Q4 2016, down from 5.79 million in Q4 2015. Mac sales are down over year-on-year basis. For Apple, its desktop range once used to enjoy a prominent place in the company’s keynotes; however, it has been overshadowed by the rise of iPhone. Apple’s desktops haven’t seen major upgrades in over an year. The Mac Mini, the entry-level desktop computer, got its last major upgrade in 2014. The Mac Pro, which is targeted at the professional community was last updated in 2013. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

In a 130-page decision from August that was made public on Monday, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, asserted that two Apple units registered in Ireland brought in $130 billion in profit over an 11-year period that should have been taxed at Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate, but instead remained largely untaxed anywhere. Apple said Monday it had joined Ireland in appealing the decision, which ordered Ireland to recoup up to EUR13 billion in back taxes from the company. Ireland says that the EU overstepped its powers by trying to rewrite Irish tax law, while Apple, which said it filed its appeal on Monday, has complained about the fairness of the proceedings. "It's been clear since the start of this case that there was a predetermined outcome," an Apple spokeswoman said, arguing that the EU "took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules" in order to selectively target the California firm. The filing highlights stark legal disagreements between the commission on one side and Ireland and Apple on the other, presaging a long battle in the EU's top courts that will determine the extent of the bloc's powers to rein in alleged tax avoidance by multinational companies doing business in Europe. If the EU prevails, it could call into question tax arrangements by a swath of companies that have relied on tax rulings from authorities in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries. If Ireland prevails, the EU could see a powerful tool, which is aimed at limiting the help governments can give to individual companies, curtailed. The tax bill on Apple is by far the highest that Brussels has so far levied in a series of cases against corporate tax deals, some targeting American firms including McDonald's Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. The commission argues the deals constitute illegal "state aid" under EU law because they give specific firms advantages over rivals in the form of lower tax bills. At issue in the Apple case is whether two Irish tax rulings granted to Apple in 1991 and 2007 gave a form of special treatment to the company, or whether they just reiterated an interpretation of Irish tax law as it was applied more generally. Those rulings allowed two Irish-registered Apple units to attribute only a sliver of their $130 billion in profit to Ireland, based on what Ireland and Apple say is a reasonable split, given that almost all of Apple's intellectual property is developed in the U.S., not Ireland. Over the 11-year period between 2003 and 2014, the units paid a total of about $90 million in taxes, the EU decision says. The EU decision published Monday argues that the rulings gave Apple a selective advantage because Apple and Ireland offered no specific evidence to justify how the profit was allocated, and deviated from the "arm's-length principle," a standard for setting commercial conditions between units of the same company as if they were independent. The EU goes on to say that all of the profit from the two units should be allocated to Ireland, which has a 12.5% corporate income-tax rate. But it adds that the amount could be reduced if Apple paid more tax on that profit in the U.S. or other countries, such as Italy. Ireland has contended that its tax rulings "did not depart from 'normal' taxation" because it followed a portion of Irish tax code that said nonresident companies shouldn't pay income tax on profit that isn't generated in Ireland. But the EU shot back in Monday's document that its examination of other tax rulings based on that law "demonstrates no consistent criteria are applied to determine the allocation of profits to Irish branches" and that, in the absence of objective criteria, "those rulings should be considered to confer a selective advantage" on Apple.

The US company launched its legal challenge overnight, as details of Ireland's appeal - which accused Brussels of exceeding its powers - went public. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Apple has been ordered to pay back €13bn (£10.9bn), over an Irish tax deal, that allowed the tech giant to pay 1% tax on its European profits in 2003 and 0.005% in 2014, which the European Commission said amounted to state aid and breached antitrust law. In a statement, Apple - which is led by Tim Cook - said it was confident the ruling would be reversed. It said: "It's been clear since the start of this case, there was a pre-determined outcome. "The Commission took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on. "If their opinion is allowed to stand, Apple would pay 40% of all the corporate income tax collected in Ireland, which is unprecedented and, far from levelling the playing field, selectively targets Apple. "This has no basis in fact or law and we're confident the ruling will be overturned." Apple stressed that it has paid billions of dollars in taxes and created 1.5 million jobs across the European Union. The company's Irish base alone has been running since 1980 and currently employs 6,000 people. The Department of Finance in Dublin published its own legal arguments on Monday, having also made the decision to appeal against the European Commission's order. It said: "The Commission has exceeded its powers and interfered with national tax sovereignty. "The Commission has no competence, under State aid rules, unilaterally to substitute its own view of the geographic scope and extent of the member state's tax jurisdiction for those of the member state itself. It added: "The Commission never clearly explained its State aid theory during the investigation, and the decision contains factual findings on which Ireland never had the chance to comment. "The Commission breached the duty of good administration by failing to act impartially and in accordance with its duty of care." Ireland has structured its economy around attracting multinationals, with its low corporate tax rate, but left-wing critics have argued accepting the windfall could bring dramatic changes to national coffers during recovery from a recession. Sinn Fein MEP, Matt Carthy, said that the Irish government's appeal "is weak, shows poor political judgment and (is) likely to fail". "Just last week, Oxfam labelled the Irish state as the sixth worst corporate tax haven in the world."

But users have complained that the three free levels go too quickly — often in less than 10 minutes. Mario’s messy smartphone rollout a result of high price, poor gameplay Bloomberg News Dec 20, 2016 (…) BLOOMBERG NEWS Nintendo’s Super Mario Run was released for Apple devices last week and quickly downloaded by millions. But users have complained that the three free levels go too quickly — often in less than 10 minutes. Nintendo Co.’s debut game for smartphones is turning out to be anything but super. Since its release for Apple devices on Thursday, Super Mario Run has shot to the top of download charts in more than 100 countries as tens of millions celebrated the iconic video game character’s arrival on iPhones. Yet problems emerged almost immediately, with thousands vigorously complaining that the three levels available with the free download were over too quickly — in less than 10 minutes in most cases — and the $10 price tag to unlock the rest was too steep. That backlash is now reverberating through its share price, with Nintendo’s stock dropping by 11 percent in the two trading days since the game’s release, wiping out more than $3.5 billion in market value. Investors and analysts are starting to second-guess the company’s decisions and its ability to execute on mobile devices. “A $10 upfront cost to unlock the game is a huge ask and one that flies in the face of current mobile games being free-to-play,” said Daniel Ahmad, an analyst for researcher Niko Partners. “The first three levels are not very long and the payment screen doesn’t seem to make it abundantly clear what the user is getting in return for that $10 purchase.” Those comments mostly echo the reaction online, where more than 100,000 users have posted ratings on Apple’s App Stores in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere, ranking the game at 2½ stars out of five. That’s among the lowest for apps at the top of download rankings, and below other games such as Clash Royale, Candy Crush Saga or Monster Strike. Besides the high price, reviewers focused on Nintendo’s decision to require an Internet connection, with many complaining that they couldn’t play during their commutes. Others said the oversimplified game-play removed features that are a staple of Super Mario games on consoles, such as fireballs. “The negative reviews aren’t necessarily because it’s a bad game,” said Eliran Sapir, head of Apptopia. “It’s a combination of the high price tag and fans not liking the vehicle.” Sapir said poor word-of-mouth could impact the game’s profitability. While the game has become the highest-grossing game in most countries, it could reach only third place in Japan — the world’s third-largest app market, according to App Annie. That adds to the risk it could fall short of analysts’ expectations. Nomura Holdings has estimated that the game will generate $306 million by the end of March, while Macquarie Securities sees $200 million in the same period. The negative buzz could particularly hurt sales to the much larger pool of Android users, who won’t get a version until an undetermined time next year.

Steve Jobs’ Apple stock certificate is going for $195K online Given how Apple creator Steve Jobs was close to deified upon his 2011 passing, it’s hard to envision that during his life, a technology company might not have wanted his input — especially a company he owned. But that was exactly the situation Jobs found himself in during the early days of Pixar, when the groundbreaking animation company was still searching for direction. In a new book, “To Pixar and Beyond” (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt), author Lawrence Levy, whom Jobs hired to help Pixar find its way, tells how both the company and the man overcame long odds to become the icons they’re regarded as today. When Levy, then CFO of a desktop publishing company, heard from Jobs in November 1994, Jobs was already a legend, but one on the downswing. He had left Apple after a nasty power battle in 1985, and the computer company he then formed, NeXT, went nowhere commercially. At the time, Jobs was looking like “yesterday’s news.” Levy assumed Jobs was calling to discuss NeXT, but the topic instead was Pixar, which Levy was unfamiliar with. Jobs had acquired Pixar from George Lucas eight years prior, in the hopes of creating “a high-end imaging computer and accompanying software,” but had little to show for it. At the time, the company and Jobs were thought of so poorly that, Levy says, “When I told friends and colleagues that I was meeting Steve Jobs about Pixar, the most common response was, ‘Why would you want to do that?’ ” The gates to Pixar’s campus in Emeryville, CaliforniaGetty Images When they met, Jobs explained that, having developed this technology, the company was now using it to create its first feature film in a deal with Disney. They had completed only a few minutes of it, but Jobs told Levy, “You’ve never seen anything like it.” He also mentioned his hopes for taking the company public. Visiting the company at Jobs’ request, Levy was impressed with the film, but quickly developed concerns. For one, Jobs had funded the company out of his own pocket via personal checks, almost $50 million worth. Levy also discovered that the company’s dip into animation was initially intended as simply a method for showcasing its imaging technology. Once that collapsed, animation was a leftover that Jobs was unenthusiastic about, agreeing to the film enterprise only because of the Disney deal. “Pixar felt like a company that had meandered from here to there,” Levy writes, mentioning that its financial situation was “dire.” “It had no cash, no reserves, and it depended for its funds on the whim of a person whose reputation for volatility was legendary.” Still, when Levy saw the clip from the film they were working on — “Toy Story” — he was mesmerized, seeing clear potential. Jobs offered him the position of executive vice president and CFO, and he accepted. When Levy began there, however, one of the first things he learned was how little regard Pixar’s employees had for Jobs. A giant model of Luxo Jr., Pixar’s iconic desktop lamp mascot, at its campus in Emeryville, CaliforniaGetty Images “Pixar and Steve have a long history. Not a good one. You don’t know it yet, but Pixar lives in fear of Steve,” a company vice president explained to him. “Steve doesn’t get Pixar . . . [He’s] the guy who owns us, but he’s never been one of us. People worry that if he gets too close, he’ll ruin Pixar and destroy our culture.” Jobs had also angered Pixar employees by reneging on a promise of stock options, which were making Silicon Valley technology workers big money at the time. The animosity was intense — so much so that one employee’s reaction to Levy about Jobs was simply: “Keep that man away from me.” Levy clearly had his work cut out for him. As he refined the company’s strategy, jettisoning several unproductive lines of business, he and Jobs grew close. They would talk on the phone several times a day and anytime day or night. Living five minutes apart, they also chatted on tranquil walks through their Palo Alto, Calif., neighborhood. “For a person who had the means to go anywhere, Steve seemed most content in his own neighborhood,” Levy writes. “We would stop every now and again to admire one of the grand old oak trees or the features of an old house, or Steve might question the style of a new one.” As Jobs began pressuring Levy to devise a plan to take Pixar public as soon as possible, Levy couldn’t see a path to profitability for the company, much less a Nasdaq listing. The odds of finishing “Toy Story” on time were looking long, and Levy realized that neither he nor Jobs understood the entertainment business. ‘Pixar and Steve have a long history. Not a good one. You don’t know it yet, but Pixar lives in fear of Steve.’ Given their inexperience in this area, Jobs could still be star-struck. He and Levy met with Disney President Joe Roth in Roth’s office, and watched him take a call from Robert Redford. After the meeting, business thoughts were out the window, as Levy and Jobs marveled over being in the same room as Redford’s voice. “‘Robert Redford!’ Steve exclaimed. ‘Butch Cassidy! The Sting! I wouldn’t have kept him waiting either. Wow!’ ” But as Levy learned the business, he figured out that the resource-heavy nature of producing computer-generated films meant they would need to average a $180 million box-office take per film for Pixar to succeed. To that point, only two animated films in Disney history had even reached $150 million — “Aladdin” and “The Lion King.” Taking this into account, Levy developed a business plan that relied heavily on a successful IPO — which, in turn, relied on the success of “Toy Story” — that had taken on massive significance for Jobs. “There’s never been anything like it,” said Jobs. “It could be one of the hottest IPOs in the history of Silicon Valley. We’re going to make history — not just in tech but in entertainment.” Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs passed on taking the company public. But Jobs was evangelical, believing that Pixar’s IPO should be larger than Netscape’s, which ended its first day of trading worth $2 billion. As the big investment banks denied them, Jobs remained steadfast in his faith. He was intimately involved with the IPO down to minute details. When they prepared a slide show to introduce the company to investors, Jobs “paid attention to every nuance of the slides, even details that . . . were invisible to the naked eye, like font kerning — which is adjusting the space between letters — and font smoothing to make sure the curves on each font were perfect.” Woody and Buzz in “Toy Story” Everett Collection In time, they found banks to work with, and scheduled the IPO for right after the release of “Toy Story,” with the company’s future depending on the film’s immediate success. (Levy also managed to get Jobs to release stock for the company’s employees.) As the big days approached, the company believed it would go public just over its initially proposed price of $12 to $14 a share. On Saturday, Nov. 25, the day after “Toy Story” opened, they learned that the film would greatly exceed expectations, as it was on track to become the year’s biggest film (which, by year’s end, it was — ultimately earning $191 million at the box office). The IPO succeeded similarly, ending its first day at $39 a share. As trading began, one of the company’s bankers said to Jobs, “Congratulations, Steve. You’re a billionaire.” Jobs was overjoyed. As the stock hit the market, he sneaked into another room and called Larry Ellison, founder and CEO of Oracle, and a friend. All Jobs said was, “Larry, I made it.” The Wall Street Journal confirmed this the next day with the headline “Steve Jobs Is Back in the Saddle Again, Becoming a Billionaire in Pixar IPO.” John LasseterGetty Images To help further the company’s success, Jobs supported the unprecedented decision to give Pixar’s creative team, led by John Lasseter, full creative control of all Pixar projects. He and Levy would have “no input into the content of Pixar’s films, [and] no approvals over the creative process.” Despite his employees’ initial skepticism, Jobs had their backs in the end, and reveled in the success of Pixar’s creative team. After he and Levy renegotiated their deal with Disney to ensure equal billing, whenever the pair passed a Disney Store, they would “run in to examine the [‘Toy Story’] dolls and other merchandise from Pixar films” and “look at the tags so we could see the Disney/Pixar logos equally displayed on the back.” This marked the beginning of a comeback that would soar higher than anyone could have imagined. Jobs sold NeXT to Apple in February 1997 and returned to Apple himself that July, en route to making it one of the world’s most innovative and valuable companies. But for whatever level of greatness Jobs attained, one of Levy’s most satisfying moments was watching how Jobs came to earn the respect of the people at Pixar. Levy tells how they watched a screening of one of Pixar’s films in development, and Lasseter asked Jobs for his opinion at the end. “Looked good to me,” Jobs said. “Though it really doesn’t matter what I think.” “It does matter,” said Lasseter. “No. You guys decide,” Jobs replied. “I trust you.” “‘But we want to know what you think,’ John said emphatically. “It was a small moment, one that I doubt registered with anyone,” Levy writes. “For me, it signaled something that I had never seen before at Pixar. The creative team, the team to whom we had long ago ceded all creative responsibility, cared about what Steve thought. In the world of Pixar, there was no greater accolade.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under animation ,  apple ,  disney ,  pixar ,  steve jobs Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Here's what a 'Shark Tank' investor wants for the holidays Read Next Here's what a 'Shark Tank' investor wants for the holidays Most Popular This Week 1 Science says these are the men who will make you orgasm 2 Mariah Carey closes 2016 with disastrous NYE performance 3 Massive 'anomaly' lurks beneath ice in Antarctica 4 How this home intruder got what he deserved 5 Obama’s ugly bid to snub voters and tie Trump’s hands 6 Debbie Reynolds rushed to the hospital Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 81,910 Thieves steal $6M in jewels while ball drops on New Year's Eve 45,196 A woman live-tweeted a hellish date involving a man who 'doesn't do menus' 35,231 Mark Hamill writes emotional goodbye letter to Carrie Fisher Yule Log Click here for The Post's HD Yule Log from now until the end of the year!

The new ConnectSense Bluetooth Extender enables users to access Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors and devices from outside the home. Without the Extender, a wireless phone or other device is needed to connect to the Internet. The Bluetooth Extender can be configured to work with Apple HomeKit or the ConnectSense Cloud. Utilizing HomeKit, users can securely control all their HomeKit accessories from an iOS device and the new Home app from Apple. Using the Bluetooth Extender as a hub, users can control smart devices from just about anywhere. By connecting to the ConnectSense Cloud, sensor data is saved to the Cloud and notifications are relayed to a smart phone or email. The ConnectSense Bluetooth Extender can be used with the new ConnectSense BLE enabled sensors for temperature/humidity and water detection. The ConnectSense Bluetooth Temperature & Humidity Sensor provides accurate and reliable data for sensitive areas of the home, including wine cellars, collection rooms, greenhouses and more. It works in harmony with HomeKit-enabled thermostats to regulate temperature in areas where a thermostat isn’t present. The ConnectSense Bluetooth Water Sensor detects the presence of water before it causes costly damage. It is perfect for detecting leaks in basements and laundry rooms, as well as monitoring plumbing and refrigeration lines. Both sensors operate using Bluetooth Low Energy and require only two AAA batteries for long periods of operation. In addition, all ConnectSense products integrate with the new Home app included in iOS 10, which makes it easy to set up and control all smart devices in one app. Apple HomeKit allows users to monitor these devices easily and securely using Siri on their iPhone, iPad or iPod touch or Apple Watch. By integrating with the HomeKit ecosystem, users can easily create integrated scenes and rules to automate devices, regardless of manufacturer, with just a few simple steps. For example, users can set rules to automatically turn on lights or other devices when water is found, and users can ask Siri to gather information about the sensors, such as asking about the temperature. ConnectSense also will display its Smart Outlet ($59.95), which enable users to easily control and monitor their everyday plug-in devices, such as lights, fans and televisions. The intuitive design of the Smart Outlet fits over any existing standard North American electrical outlet and features Apple HomeKit technology. After installing the ConnectSense Smart Outlet, users can configure it using the ConnectSense app available in the App Store and easily create integrated scenes and rules for all HomeKit devices. With detailed power monitoring in the app, users have insight into the power consumption of devices plugged into the Smart Outlet, as well as how long devices have been turned on. Unique to the ConnectSense app is the ability to create rules based on power usage. For example, a homeowner can set a rule that says if the television has been on for three hours, turn it off. For safety, rules can be set to turn off hot or potentially dangerous devices, such as flat irons, if they have been left on for an extended period of time. ConnectSense products are available at connectsense.com and on amazon.com. About ConnectSense ConnectSense develops and manufactures home automation products, including the ConnectsSense Smart Outlet and a line of wireless sensors that monitor changes in your environment then notifies you by email or text when something goes awry.

By Mark Gurman. Added by Agency Staff on 20 December 2016. Saved under In-depth, Top Tags: Apple, Jony Ive, Microsoft, Tim Cook Tweet The new MacBook Pro To die-hard fans, Apple’s Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days. Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple’s marquee computer, hasn’t been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees. In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favourable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products. Interviews with people familiar with Apple’s inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company’s software team. They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers. While the Mac generates about 10% of Apple sales, the company can’t afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple’s revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: “This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines.” If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky — opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad. People now have more options. Microsoft, once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet-type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft’s Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac’s audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a “disappointment” and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. However, the company has said the Macintosh remains one of its most important products and denies it takes a back seat to other gadgets. The ultra-thin MacBook introduced in 2015 Four years ago at Apple’s annual developer conference, marketing chief Phil Schiller pledged to keep the computer front and centre in the company’s product arsenal. “Nobody turns over their entire line as quickly and completely as we do at Apple,” Schiller said. “We’re really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so you can get the exact product you need.” Two years later, the company held a 30th birthday party for the Macintosh, a splashy event that featured a OneRepublic concert at Apple’s Cupertino, California headquarters. The company also created a website celebrating the Mac’s history. To be fair, Apple depends on Intel, which still makes key chips for Macs. Like the rest of the PC industry, Apple’s innovation and product cycles are sometimes constrained by when Intel produces new chips — a process that’s getting more difficult. Making a laptop stand out is also harder these days. But when Apple has tried to leapfrog the competition, it has fallen short. Take the company’s attempt to create a longer-lasting battery for the MacBook Pro. Apple engineers wanted to use higher-capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro’s planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The change required roping in engineers from other teams to finish the job, meaning work on other Macs languished, the person said. The new laptop didn’t represent a game-changing leap in battery performance, and a software bug misrepresented hours of power remaining. Apple has since removed the meter from the top right-hand corner of the screen. In the Mac’s heyday, people working on new models could expect a lot of attention from Ive’s team. Once a week his people would meet with Mac engineers to discuss ongoing projects. Mac engineers brought prototypes to Ive’s studio for review, while his lieutenants would visit the Mac labs to look at early concepts. Those visits have become less frequent since the company began focusing more on more-valuable products like the iPhone and iPad, and the change became even more obvious after the design team’s leadership was shuffled last year, according to a person familiar with the situation. In another sign that the company has prioritised the iPhone, Apple re-organised its software engineering department so there’s no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power. That’s part of a broader shift toward making Macs more like iPhones. Apple prioritises features, like thinness and minimal ports, that sell its iPhones and iPads, which generated about 75% of revenue this year. Those are contrary to professional needs, like maximum computing power. Early prototypes of the 12-inch MacBook used the iPhone’s Lightning connector, although this was ditched for a more standard USB-C port. There was even a gold MacBook Pro planned, but this was shelved because the colour didn’t look good on such a large product. The Mac Pro is overdue a refresh to stay current In recent years, Apple managers have also become more likely to float two or more competing ideas, meaning designers and engineers must work on more than one concept at a time. In the past, managers pushed a more singular vision. Engineers are now “asked to develop multiple options in hopes that one of them will be shippable”, a person familiar with the matter said. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. The internal turmoil has taken a toll. More than a dozen engineers and managers working on Mac hardware have left for different Apple teams or other companies in the past year and a half, said people familiar with the situation. Some were looking for a less all-consuming work environment, while others felt the future of Mac hardware was unclear in a world of iPhones and iPads. Tim Cook (image: Mike Deerkoski) In 2013, Apple launched a redesigned Mac Pro, a black cylinder with bright white LED lights. It was a powerful desktop machine created partly to cast a halo over the entire Macintosh line-up. The Mac Pro was also the first Apple computer in years to be assembled in the US. Under pressure from politicians to create manufacturing jobs at home, Apple was looking to score political points. The decision caused production headaches though. The Mac Pro’s glossy exterior and chrome bevelled edges meant Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple’s ability to make enough computers to meet demand. Three years on, the Mac Pro is ripe for an upgrade with its chips and connector ports lagging rival products. Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it’s cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products, according to a person familiar with those internal discussions. The political environment is tougher for such a move now. During his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump hammered Apple for building most of its products overseas and since his election he has pushed other companies to keep some jobs in the US. Still, Apple hasn’t given up on Macs. In a recent company Q&A session, employees asked whether Mac desktop computers remain strategically important. “We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that,” CEO Tim Cook said, according to a transcript of the discussion obtained by Bloomberg News. The latest MacBook Pro has a “Touch Bar”, a thin touchscreen built into the keyboard that lets users quickly access app shortcuts, change system settings, and pick emojis. The laptop also has Touch ID to speed up online purchases and a giant trackpad for easier gesture control. Apple designers are already exploring standalone keyboards with the touch strip and a fingerprint reader for desktops. Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro. Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017, though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new AMD graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage.  — (c) 2016 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Rob Dempster I am typing this while sitting in front of a late-2012 iMac that was recently transformed by swapping the 1 GB hard disk for a 500 MB SSD. Beats me why Apple does not sell the iMac with a ann SSD already installed. Also disappointed that the iMac only gets a mention in the last paragraph of the article.

Apple’s AI if by Air Posted Sep 13, 2016 by Matthew Panzarino (@panzer) 0 SHARES Next Story Review: Apple tees up the future with iPhone 7 Advertisement After only a few days with Apple’s wireless AirPod headphones, it’s clear that there will be a huge platform business based on the reliable, persistent availability of a contextual artificial intelligence that can talk to you and receive commands. That platform will benefit Apple first, but it will then expand — along with Siri — to developers and startup companies. The key bits of that, of course, are “reliable” and “persistent.” It is very similar to the way that the increasing sophistication of push notifications and the Apple Watch are making opening apps more optional than ever. If you know an iPhone user will have AirPods in their ear and can access the services you offer via Siri at any moment, then you’ve got a powerful new conduit to that user. It’s not well known outside of the industry, but a couple of years ago, Apple switched from its voice provider Nuance and fired up its own internal voice team. In a not unconnected event, Siri’s second major revision shipped a few months later, bringing a big jump in reliable recognition of commands. There’s still a lot of room to grow, but it’s improving. Then Apple shipped the first wave of its SiriKit compatibility out to developers earlier this year at its developer conference, allowing a handful of categories of apps to offer up their services to Siri, to be commanded by the user. It was a lot less robust than some had hoped, but it will get iterated on. And there are competitors out there like Viv that are also pushing the power boundaries of these interconnected contextual systems. But before Apple’s AI becomes a true audio platform, it needs hardware that makes it easier to put Siri in your ear — and no real reason to take it out. Enter the AirPods. Apple’s AirPods, announced alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus last week, are two wireless earbuds that look like regular iPhone EarPods with the cables cut off. They snap into a small case that looks like a 22nd-century Tic-Tac package. The AirPods themselves have a battery and a new wireless chip in each pod that Apple is calling the W1. They also have accelerometers and two sensors that detect whether they’re inserted into your ear by touching your tragus and concha. They charge inside the case and the case charges via a lightning port. Before Apple’s AI becomes a true audio platform, it needs hardware that makes it easier to put Siri in your ear. Right off the bat, all of the following should be qualified by the fact that the review set of AirPods I was given are pre-production models. Since they go on sale later in the year, the final batches are not yet rolling off the assembly lines. “Pairing” the AirPods is incredibly easy, thanks to the W1 chip. The method is so easy in fact that Apple does not use the word pairing anywhere in its instruction manual — using the word ‘connect’ instead. It’s marketing, but it’s also a fair differentiation between the baroque drama that is most Bluetooth pairing sessions and the process of connecting AirPods. Specifically, the W1 chip is there to add this kind of drama free connection experience, as well as to regulate power, making the BTLE connection sip and keeping the AirPods working longer. It also does some quality-of-service work in the background. Think of it as a buttress under the Bluetooth’s rainbow bridge of questionable reputation. To connect the AirPods, you bring the case near (a few inches away) to an iPhone and flip the lid open. A connection dialog pops up on your screen and you tap on the connection button on the back of the case. That’s it. Connected. Connecting them to non-Apple devices is pretty standard. You hold the back button down and search for Bluetooth devices and connect like normal. They then work like regular earbuds. In a clever bit of engineering, the same contacts that charge the AirPods make them function as wireless radios for the case itself, which just contains a battery and a button. Apple says the AirPods get five hours of battery life with the case giving an additional 24 hours of charge. If anything, I found that estimate to be conservative. I listened to the AirPods for a couple of hours on the day receiving them, topping them off in the case. Then I listened to them for 4 hours straight on a drive and a bit more when I got home. I have yet to run them dead because you store them in the case, and they’re constantly being charged in their ‘storage’. The sound quality is very solid. Nice thumpy bass and crisp highs produce a very listenable sound, though it’s far from audiophile quality. These are very good and very loud earbuds that produce sound quality right in line with their $160 price. Because the seal (on my ear anyway) is so firm, and there are no cords to tug them around, they cancel outside noise very well (though there is no official noise cancellation functionality). Of course, your mileage may vary because ears are highly variable and they may not fit or stay in your ears. If the standard Apple earbuds do not fit your ears, it is highly unlikely that the AirPods will. However, if the standard earbuds fit, but do not stay in place, falling out while jogging or what have you, I would take a look at the AirPods still. In fact, the AirPods stay put in my ears incredibly well, not slipping while shaking my head or jogging or exercising. The biggest reason for this is they just have very little mass at all. With no cord, and next to no weight, there is nothing to pull them out of the ear. Whatever stress people had about them slipping out of a (compatible) ear, probably shouldn’t be given too much play. Range wise they are fairly standard, cutting out at around 50 feet with minor obstructions. Nice thumpy bass and crisp highs produce a very listenable sound though far from audiophile quality. Interacting with the AirPods is super slick. Inserting them into your ear gives an audio cue that says they’re on and activated (they turn off when out of your ear to conserve battery, with the W1 monitoring the sensors). Taking a single bud out of your ear will pause your audio and re-inserting it will start the audio again. You can just insert one and use that like a phone headset — they work independently of one another. To control them, you double tap, gently (tapping hard will likely lead to a sore tragus) to bring up Siri and then give Siri your commands. Double tapping while a phone is ringing will answer the phone call. That’s it. There are no other controls. Because everything happens via Siri, I was left feeling that the opportunity cost was too high for minor interactions like volume or track advancing. I’ve been forcing myself to use Siri, but I think many people will be reaching in pocket to make those adjustments at first. It’s going to take a big cultural adjustment here. Both to get used to seeing these cordless buds hanging out of people’s ears like a postmodern Ceti eel and for people to get comfortable talking out loud to Siri for their every desire. I did find, however, that speaking commands sotto voce — not whispering, but in a low register — worked just fine. The two beam-forming microphones and the accelerometer that detects when your jaw is moving make this one of the best in ear microphone options I’ve used. I can’t help thinking it’s possible that “AI voice,” speaking lowly to your personal thinking machine, will become a thing as this kind of system becomes more commonplace. apple_017 apple_018 apple_014 apple_012 apple_013  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit The style of the pods themselves, in white, will serve as branding much in the way that the original iPod headphones did — but I foresee them coming in gold, silver and black sooner, rather than later. As real computing devices that are meant to be worn, I’d look to the Apple Watch model with a variety of finishes and partnerships with companies like Nike and fashion houses to pop up. If they’re going to be displayed on our person so prominently, they would definitely benefit from an injection of personal style. Another item on my wish list: the AirPods automatically connect to other iPhones, iPads and Macs signed into the same iCloud account, which works great. But it does not currently work on the Apple TV. I’d love to be able to use them like portable home theater buds to listen to stuff when I don’t want to disturb the household. An edge case, to be sure, but it would be cool. Some AirPod tidbits: Taking an AirPod out to pause can be a little odd, because holding it in your hand and covering the proximity sensors can start playback again. If you want to ‘forget’ the AirPods, to connect them to a new device, make sure they are connected and on, without the lid on the case closed. It took me a while to get them reconnected in this scenario as I was fooling around. You can connect the AirPods to every device on up to 5 iCloud accounts. This means that you can share AirPods between phones signed in to different accounts. Great for sharing with your kids. You can also connect two pairs of AirPods to the same device, though you must switch between them and cannot use them both at the same time. Editor’s note: There is so much interest in the AirPods that we broke this review out from the iPhone 7/7 Plus review.

Tim Cook, Apple CEO has clarified in an internal memo to employees that Apple won’t stop making Macs or desktop computers. The iMac was last refreshed in October 2015 while the Mac Mini and Mac Pro has not seen a successor since 2013. These devices have not been  upgrade in more than three years and it is a welcome news that Apple is looking forward to launching them sometime in the future. Tim Cook said in an internal memo, The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made, and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that. At the moment, there are no details about Apple’s plans regarding desktop. ""Great desktops in our roadmap", says Tim Cook", 4 out of 5 based on 9 ratings.

In fact, Apple’s recently released MacBook Pro with the OLED Touch Bar was the first meaningful Mac refresh we’ve seen in quite some time. All the while, Mac users eagerly anticipating compelling updates to the iMac, the Mac Mini and the Mac Pro remain waiting on the sidelines. Don't Miss: Tesla finally gets serious about improving the Model S and the Model 3 As a result, many seasoned Mac users have lamented the fact that Apple’s laser-like focus on all things iOS has adversely impacted progress on the company’s Mac lineup. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Apple should spin-off its Mac division as a subsidiary, similar to what Google did when it transitioned into Alphabet. While such a solution is hardly a panacea, the fact that it’s even being brought up is indicative of the fact that Mac users are growing incredibly impatient. Alleviating these concerns, Tim Cook recently posted a message on Apple’s internal message board reassuring the Mac faithful that Apple’s desktop Mac roadmap remains strong and there’s no reason to worry. Cook’s message, which was originally posted by TechCrunch, reads in part: The desktop is very strategic for us. It’s unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. … Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.

Personal Pickup for AirPods is currently live in the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, showing availability of February 6-8 in most countries, which is likely a conservative estimate due to limited stock. The tool is not yet available in Belgium, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Turkey, or the United Arab Emirates, countries where Apple also operates retail stores, but it will presumably be expanded soon. AirPods became available for purchase at Apple Stores yesterday, and some lucky customers were able to secure one of the limited number of pairs available. Apple said stores will continue to receive "regular shipments" of AirPods, so customers may have success finding a pair before the early February dates quoted. AirPods became available for purchase on Apple's website last week, but orders placed today are estimated to ship in 6 weeks, or around late January. The first wave of customers who ordered AirPods online began receiving their shipments yesterday in the United States and around the world. Apple Authorized Resellers and carriers also began receiving a limited number of AirPods this week, as seen over the past few days when Best Buy and Verizon have periodically offered AirPods for estimated delivery as early as this week. Tags: AirPods, Apple retail [ 50 comments ] Top Rated Comments (View all) B4U 2 weeks ago Have the courage to get rid of the jack, yet have no courage to ramp up the production to match the demand. Over 4 months AFTER the launch of the phone before the Air Pods are available for pick up in store if anyone missed the first boat. That is a little excessive, isn't it? Rating: 7 Votes Sandy Santra 2 weeks ago NYCers, here's the deal: there is no point to "calling around to check inventory." Been there, done that. You'll get a different story every time, depending on whom you talk to. Shipments are arriving at somewhat random times. The key here is to get there (by intuition, because I can't find a science for this) within FIVE MINUTES after a shipment shows up. I walked into the Grand Central Store today mid-afternoon, and was very lucky because the shipment had JUST arrived 5 mins earlier. "Go over to that table," they said. "Do you have Apple Pay?" they said. "Do you want one or two [pairs]?" they said. You MUST have Apple Pay. You can ONLY buy two pairs (no more). The table I was referred to had a single box of (I think) only 20 pairs in it. It took less than 90 seconds to buy them. It took less than 5 seconds to pair them. Good luck. By the way, they are pretty awesome. Rating: 3 Votes Fusion79 2 weeks ago I was thinking of doing this. When placing an order like this, are you immediately charged or is it when the item is ready for pickup? In the past all they have done is a pre-auth on my card at the time of the order that falls off after a couple of days. Final charge is made at pickup. Rating: 2 Votes dominiongamma 2 weeks ago Might as well wait for Version 2 hoping it comes out with iPhone 8 Rating: 2 Votes BennyMo 2 weeks ago February 8th? Meaning no store will get more inventory until then? Or will there be a steady trickle of them every day? I was hoping to go tomorrow on my day off when the mall opens at 9am, but it looks like that'll be a failed attempt if they aren't getting any more stock in. To quote the person I spoke to in chat this morning, "Actually, there are two different types of inventory. In store pickup that you see on the website is February 8th, but the stores do receive them in random shipments daily. They will definitely get more in, but we aren’t sure of when that will be." Rating: 1 Votes AEdouard 2 weeks ago If one really wants them soon, I think the best bet is to regularly give a call to your nearest Apple Store. I was at mine yesterday (for something else) and they received two shipments of AirPods during the day. Looks like they'll be coming in pretty regularly. Rating: 1 Votes CharlesShaw 2 weeks ago Not any more it isn't! But yes, I saw two Chicago stores had stock just a few minutes ago ... and now nothing. Gotta be fast on that "Buy" button! :) I was fast and got one, yes. Just received email that it's ready. Now I'm just curious if I had bought it for Feb 8 pickup whether or not I'd have gotten an email that it was ready today.

Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Dec 20, 2016 at 9:06AM Image source: Fitbit. Fitness trackers aren't selling well this holiday season, and smartwatches may be faring even worse. Desperation in the wearable-tech niche is making the leaders hungry for one another's business. We saw Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) make a play for the Apple Watch market with the rollout earlier this year of Blaze, Fitbit's first smartwatch. Now we're seeing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gun for the corporate wellness market, where Fitbit was starting to shine, with the consumer market drying up. Apple has rolled out a page on its website promoting Apple Watch as a tool for corporate wellness programs.  "Apple Watch is designed to work seamlessly with your corporate wellness program so employees stay active, healthy, and productive throughout the day," explains Apple's site.  The page points out how Apple Watch works with many existing corporate wellness tools as apps, and there's also an endorsement from the human-resources chief at Aetna, an early adopter in subsidizing wearable tech for its employees to encourage more active lifestyles. It's "game on" in the push to become the top brand in corporate wellness from the two companies selling millions of high-tech wrist-huggers.  Wishing well Fitbit has been able to nab some juicy corporate customers, as companies realize that keeping their employees active lower their health-coverage tabs. Earlier this year, Fitbit singled out a Springbuk study, showing how employees who opted into the Fitbit wellness program incurred $1,300 less per hire in annual healthcare costs.  Last month's earnings call offered plenty of color on Fitbit's efforts paying off, including recent corporate wellness wins at Pitney Bowes and Dr Pepper/Snapple Group. It also pointed out how Virgin Pulse -- a wellness tech platform with 2,200 corporate accounts and one of the three apps singled out in Apple's new corporate marketing pitch -- will endorse Fitbit as its tracker of choice.  There's obviously plenty of room for more than one winner here. Things just feel desperate because of how hungry for growth both companies are these days. Fitbit's targeting just 2% to 5% year-over-year revenue growth for the current quarter. Apple doesn't break out Apple Watch sales, but the "other products" category on its summary page that includes its nascent smartwatch efforts but also its fading iPod line experienced a 22% slide in its latest quarter. Apple's corporate wellness push makes sense, but it will have to deal with its substantially higher price points relative to Fitbit's wares. It's not an insignificant cost or issue for companies trying to maximize the well-being of their workforce. In that sense, Apple's push may actually pay off for Fitbit. Apple can make fitness tracking at the corporate level cool, driving demand for all of the players. Fitbit may fear Apple the conqueror, but it can only benefit from Apple the educator.   Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple and Fitbit. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Fitbit.

You can now add a virtual Touch Bar to your Mac with Duet Display Posted Dec 20, 2016 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Bragi’s The Headphone is shipping to customers slower than expected If you have an iPad, you have a very capable external display for your computer using Duet Display, and now you can also experience Apple’s new Touch Bar without having to pick up a new computer. It’s not the same as having one built in to your computer, but it is a good way to play with Touch Bar functionality and see how it works with your existing workflow in Apple’s native apps and other software that supports it, like Photoshop. The update to Duet Display also adds support for input from an iPad keyboard, which means that if you have a Smart Keyboard or other accessory like the Logitech Create Keyboard for iPad, when you have that attached to your tablet while running Duet Display you can use it for input, on both Mac and PC versions. The Touch Bar is the most noteworthy part of this update, though, and it works incredibly well in use, speaking as someone who also uses the standard MacBook Pro hardware Touch Bar regularly. It contextually updates depending on what app you’re using, just like the real Touch Bar, and it supports long-press actions for controlling brightness and volume, as well as other handy features like typing predictions and the emoji picker. photoshop-touchbar-opacity-7844 photoshop-touchbar-color-slider-7834 photoshop-touchbar-opacity-slider-7817 touchbar-and-keyboard-center-align-7788 touchbar-itunes-7631 keyboard-and-touchbar-text-editing-7597 photoshop-touchbar-opacity-slider-7823  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Duet CEO and founder Rahul Dewan says that his team is also working on making it possible to customize the Touch Bar when using the app with contextual and global shortcuts a user can assign. Expanding availability of Touch Bar to desktops and others who can’t currently access the new feature should help generally boost the appeal to developers in terms of building support for Apple’s latest input device. You can toggle the virtual Touch Bar on and off in the Duet Display menu, and it’s off by default. This feature is also exclusive to Mac, in case that wasn’t obvious. The keyboard support, which is also very handy (it means you can use an iPad as a second display for an iMac – or as a sole display for a Mac mini without another keyboard, for instance), works across platforms. Duet Display is already one of the most useful apps available on iPad, and now it’s the only way to check out Touch Bar outside of the new MacBook Pro. Plus, recent additions like pressure sensitivity for Apple Pencil have made the iPad, using Duet Display, a better external display than most dedicated external displays. If you haven’t yet used the app, this is definitely an update that makes it even more worth checking out. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Duet Display Founded 2014 Overview Duet Display allows you to use your iPad or iPhone as an extra display.

Apple is obviously arguing otherwise, and there is some logic to what it is suggesting but some of the things with these notebooks are going to be deal-breakers for people. Even, I, someone who doesn't really push the limits of the new Macs to their fullest has found some of the design decisions to be limiting. Let me elaborate. 1. The biggest issue is the absence of the standard USB ports. There really is not getting around the fact that at the moment you can't plug in even a pen drive to this laptop leave alone a memory card or an HDMI cable. The only route is a dongle for one thing or the other. If you end up with Apple's dongles, you will pay a lot of money and have ugly dongles hang out of the sides of this beautiful machine. I haven't been able to hook up my camera, nor can I charge my iPhone on this machine. Ironically, the charger of this machine has come in handy in charging my Google Pixel, which is all kinds of strange. 2. The new keyboard is very shallow and people who like clattering the keyboard will find it hard to adapt quickly. Only after 4 days of heavy duty usage, I've become used to this keyboard. I can imagine people who are used long key travel will not like this keyboard. It really is a keyboard that's likely to appeal to touch typists more than anyone else. 3. The battery life isn't as good as the MacBook Air which will be a deal breaker for someone upgrading from an Air. The bigger issue is that it isn't even as good as a 13-inch MacBook Pro from last year. Apple could perhaps make some improvements to the operating system with a software update, but until that happens, I am not getting more than 5 hours with the screen brightness at full and no more than 7.5 with it lowered to usable levels. 4. Apple reportedly made the display assembly so thin that it didn't have any room left to add the backlit Apple logo on the top of the notebook. Instead, like the retina MacBook, the new Pro models get this machined Apple logo, which looks quite nice, but it doesn't exude that level of coolness in the dark as the older MacBooks. 5. The touch bar, so far, it hasn't proven to be life changing. Perhaps, that speaks of the amount of apps that are leveraging it or perhaps it also speaks about a pro user who has had years of training of Mac keyboard shortcuts would probably find it quite pointless. So far, the touch bar seems like something designed for a dummy, but not a pro user, which is the target audience of the MacBook Pro.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish How To Record Your iPhone’s Screen: 5 Best Solutions By Ankush Das on 12/20/2016 06:00 PST You are probably here because you already know that Apple does not allow screen recording apps on the App Store. However, Vdyo (a screen recorder app for iPhone) managed to slip past the App Store’s verification process and went live for a day which let users record their screen. Unfortunately, you are not going to get another screen recorder app anytime soon! So, in this article, we will guide you with alternative methods to record iPhone Screen. Why Apple Does Not Allow Screen Recorder Apps on the App Store? It is a misconception when someone claims that iOS does not support recording of your screen. It does. However, as an additional layer of security and privacy, Apple does not allow screen recorder apps on the App Store. Apple would not bother you of Jailbreaking the device or sideloading an app, but it does pose a threat to your device’s security. In reality, if you allow a screen recorder app to function, the app can monitor your activity and (visually) record things you type. So, it is better not to have them installed even if you do come across an app on the app store that claims to do the work. If Screen Recording Raises Security Concerns, Why Use It? We do realize that screen recorder apps raise privacy concerns, but we also need to record our device’s screen for specific tasks. For instance, if you want to record your iPhone’s screen to show your friends how a game works. If you are a professional tech reviewer, you might find screen recording apps handy to help you make quick tutorials on a newly launched app or game. You can utilize the screen recording capability for such similar works which include both professional and experimental needs. If no app does the work, how would you record your iPhone’s screen? Do you need to Jailbreak your device? Sideload an app? Yes, you can do that. But, we would not recommend doing it that way.

But Apple's latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products. "They're basically saying this is the future of headphones," said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple's future. "There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years," Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices. Read more: Apple's new AirPods won't be arriving on time The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews. The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed. The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods' construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. "I can't do it by hand. It's cost prohibitive," Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that "there's a relatively high risk of fire".

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

 Apple CEO Tim Cook's answer about the future of the Mac was missing one important word Kif Leswing Dec. 20, 2016, 9:02 AM 43,527 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty In a question-and-answer session on Apple's internal employee network on Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked a simple question about the Mac, Apple's line of desktops, according to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch. An Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in the spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" His answer was more revealing for what it left out than for what it said. Cook wrote: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." Cook never says "Mac," the name of Apple's oldest product line. He does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of Apple's desktop software, except for one mention of an existing computer (the Retina iMac, which hasn't been updated with new components in over a year). Basically, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were strategic. In the past, Cook would answer similar questions with quips like "I love the Mac." It's not a big stretch to read between the lines and see that to Cook and Apple, Macs and desktops are no longer synonymous. Parsing Cook's answer more closely, he almost seems to be hinting at a desktop running software different from macOS — perhaps Apple's iPhone software, iOS. 'Can't innovate anymore, my a--' Getty A Tuesday report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman might explain why Cook answered the way he did. Gurman says Apple has reorganized its software engineering so there is no longer a team dedicated solely to the Mac operating system. Instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS, as the Mac has been generally deprioritized in the company, according to the report. Apple's Touch Bar.AP This integration has led to some cool stuff, like the new Touch Bar, a touchscreen integrated into the new MacBook Pro keyboard. The Touch Bar is essentially an iOS device embedded in a Mac. In fact, Mac engineers no longer get as much attention from Apple's industrial design team, which Apple design chief Jony Ive led until last year. The design team now spends more time working on iPhones and iPads, according to the report. This overall deprioritization has led to "more than a dozen" engineers leaving the team for other Apple departments or companies, according to Bloomberg. And Apple has had upgrades to its Mac laptops and desktops that weren't ultimately released, such as a skinny MacBook with a fingerprint sensor and a laptop that uses an iPhone charger. Apple's flagship desktop, the Mac Pro, beloved by software engineers, was launched in 2013, and Apple's head marketer, Phil Schiller, revealed it with the cocky quip "can't innovate anymore, my a--." But in 2016, the Mac Pro hasn't been updated with new chips in three years, meaning Apple's most powerful desktop is firmly out of date, which is a dealbreaker for most people who need power — the Mac Pro's core market. Bloomberg reports that Apple has been considering moving production of the product from Texas to Asia, where the rest of its products are assembled. Still, Cook was clear in his note to his troops: "We have great desktops in our roadmap." He just didn't say anything about whether they would be Macs.

Apple AirPods Can Survive Drops and Full Washing Machine Cycles GO The AirPods were also tested against water submersion Dec 20, 2016 14:16 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple took the world by surprise when it launched the iPhone 7 without a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Cupertino company stated that consumers would use wireless AirPods to listen to music, but they were made available months after the phone’s release. A few days ago, many have started receiving their AirPods and some units are now available at Apple stores. The biggest concern with these wireless headphones is their tiny size which makes them easy to lose. Some are also wondering about their resistance to tear and drops. EverythingApplePro posted a video on its YouTube channel showing the AirPods undergoing various tests. The video shows that AirPods can withstand drops from waist level in their case without breaking, but the case might record some scratches, depending on the surface that it lands on. A drop from head height and ten feet up would make the AirPods pop out of the case, but still remain fully functional, whereas the AirPod Case did have some visible scratches, which would result after extensive use as well. The AirPods are very light, which means that they bounce quite easily when dropped, thus reducing the chances of recording scratches. The AirPods can survive a full wash cycle The second test involved placing the AirPods in the washing machine and undergoing a full wash cycle. This could actually happen in a real-life situation, since the earbuds do fit pockets quite well. The test involved putting detergent and some clothes in the washer for a full cycle. For comparison, regular headphones were also introduced in the washer. After spending 32 minutes in the washer, the LED was glowing and the earbuds functioned just like before, even better than wired headphones. The next test involved submerging the AirPods in a foot of water for five minutes. The case doesn’t float and the power button doesn’t work under water, although they stay connected. The AirPods can actually play audio under water. It seems that water submersion doesn’t affect them at all, but that doesn’t mean that the AirPods are actually waterproof.

Jet Black iPhone 7 Is Available Within A Day by Sam Mitchell • December 20, 2016 December 20, 2016 in Apple Jet Black iPhone 7 Available in 24 Hours Apple iPhones are officially sold out everywhere… or are they? So, Apple has come a long way since the start of the iPhone brand. Apple used to be mainly known for their competition with Microsoft. In this day and age, the battle is between Apple and Samsung (with Microsoft mostly out of the picture). These two titans go head-to-head with each other every year with at least two or three different products. The iPhones have been considerably more conservative in comparison to the Galaxy S series. The iPhone usually plays it safe, giving you a phone with a very similar design to the last one, except with a few minor tweaks here and there. ADVERTISEMENT iPhones used to also come in a very limited range of colors. Some could argue that it is indeed still limited, and you can hardly blame them. The camera has always been a frustrating topic amongst Apple haters. They simply do not innovate in that area and it’s baffling to think they wouldn’t, especially considering the phone’s price point is hundreds of dollars. How You Can Get Your Hands On One So, it’s tough to come across a new iPhone this time of year. They’re mostly sold out and don’t ship for weeks. How do you get one? We may have a solution, but keep it between us, okay? You can buy these phones online, directly from Apple and they arrive in a day! Not just any iPhone, even the Jet Black Ones! (I don’t know why I sound so surprised, you read the title) But you’d better hurry quick, these things are selling like hotcakes. Samsungs are probably sold out, too. Maybe not as much as iPhones, but definitely close. Anyways, Samsung doesn’t have their own outlet where you can buy phones online from them. Apple also has a range of new iOS games that have just been released for the iPhone, one of them being Super Mario Run, and endless runner game starring everybody’s favorite stereotype. The Mario games having around for decades and fans can’t seem to get enough of him, so maybe this will help boost iPhone sales… or will it?

 Apple tested a laptop that used the same charger as the iPhone Kif Leswing Dec. 20, 2016, 8:47 AM 8,159 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Apple's newest line of laptops, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar that was released in October, did not receive a very warm welcome from Mac fans.  Longtime Apple users complained about a lack of power, difficult repairability, and, most loudly, a dongle morass that meant that someone with Apple's latest phone and Apple's latest laptop would have to carry around multiple sets of chargers and adapters.  The MacBook Pro (and the skinny MacBook) uses a USB-C cord to charge, like high-end Android phones do. The iPhone 7 uses a proprietary Lightning port for power and headphones. Wouldn't it be nice if they both used the same charger?  It turns out Apple tested a laptop with exactly that, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.  Early prototypes of Apple's first USB-C equipped computer, the MacBook, used Apple's Lightning port to charge. The benefits are obvious: People could carry the same charger for their laptop and their phone, and now that iPhones use Lightning headphones, those would work on both devices too. But Apple ditched the design, in the midst of what seems like a chaotic development cycle for Apple's laptops.  The iPhone 7 charging port. Apple tested a laptop that used this kind of connector to charge.Thomson Reuters In fact, Apple developed two prototypes for that skinny MacBook, which was supposed to be launched in 2014 but was eventually launched in 2016. In general, the Mac team is now asked to come up with multiple different options in the hope that one of them will be "shippable," according to the report.  Other features that were cut from Apple's laptop lineup include a MacBook with a fingerprint sensor and a second USB port, and a gold version of the MacBook Pro, which was ditched because it apparently didn't look good on a big laptop.  This kind of turmoil has led to several engineers departing the team. Don't expect a big Mac revamp next year — Bloomberg expects Apple to merely give the existing laptops speed bumps and new chips.  SEE ALSO: Apple is working on some 'great desktops,' CEO Tim Cook promises NOW WATCH: The best way to clear out a ton of space on your iPhone superfast Loading video...

The 10.12.2 update focuses entirely on a wide variety of fixes and under-the-hood improvements, but also a couple of new features. The rollout specifically addresses several issues with the 2016 MacBook Pro models, including the graphics and battery life problems. Battery Issue The most visible feature change is the removal of the battery’s “time remaining” display. Before Apple’s MacOS 10.12.2 update, 2016 MacBook Pro users complained of shorter than expected battery life. The users took to Apple’s support communities and internet forums and broader consensus was forming that new laptops could achieve only 3 to 6 hours of battery life. Apple’s solution to the problem is to stop reporting estimated remaining time. The macOS 10.12.2 update removes the indicator showing the hours and minutes left before your battery dies. Besides the removal of time indicator, Apple has introduced some surgical software changes that has lead to greater battery endurance, reports Forbes. Reports indicate longer life on the 2016 Macbook Pro after the installation of battery life. Also Read- iPhone 8 Specs, Features to Include New Touch-Sensitive Glass Technology Graphics Fix Another significant fix in the new update addresses the graphics issues on the 2016 MacBook Pro models. Some users were affected by “flickering, full-screen checkerboard patterns, screen tearing, and other visual artifacts,” in the words of MacRumors. The MacOS 10.12.2 update will fix these graphics issues. Also Read- Samsung Galaxy S8 Specs and Features the Same as the Defunct Galaxy Note 7 – Rumors Fixes Security Flaw In addition, the latest version of Apple’s computer operating system protects your Mac password. A Swedish hacker, Ulf Frisk, shared details of a vulnerability in macOS 10.12.1 and lower, that allows anyone with physical access to a locked Mac to easily obtain the password with a $300 Thunderbolt device. Frisk notified back in August, and Apple confirmed the issue and asked him to withhold details pending a fix. He reports that the vulnerability is no longer present in macOS 10.12.2. Apple’s full list of system notes for the macOS 10.12.1 update include: Improves setup and reliability of Auto Unlock. Allows addition of a Chinese Trackpad Handwriting button to the Touch Bar Control Strip. Adds support for taking screenshots of the Touch Bar using the Grab app or Cmd-Shift-6 shortcut. Fixes an issue that caused the Touch Bar emoji picker to appear on the display. Resolves graphics issues on MacBook Pro (late 2016) computers. Fixes an issue where System Integrity Protection was disabled on some MacBook Pro (late 2016) computers. Improves setup and opt-out experience for iCloud Desktop and Documents. Fixes an issue with the delivery of Optimized Storage alerts. Improves audio quality when using Siri and FaceTime with Bluetooth headphones. Improves the stability of Photos when creating and ordering books. Fixes an issue where incoming Mail messages did not appear when using a Microsoft Exchange account. Fixes an issue that prevented the installation of Safari Extensions downloaded outside the Safari Extensions Gallery. Adds support for new installations of Windows 8 and Windows 7 using Boot Camp on supported Macs.

Chinese Jailbreak team Pangu is said to be waiting for a stable version of the iOS 10.2 before releasing their JB tool. Team Pangu has Cracked iOS 10 Team Pangu has been rather discreet since the demonstration of the iOS 10 jailbreak at the Mobile Security Conference (MOSEC) back in July. That time, the hacker group was only able to jailbreak the first beta version of the iOS 10, while Apple was still developing it. Of course, Apple equipped the follow up versions with security tweaks to prevent jailbreaking. Following Apple’s recent iOS 10.2 update, reports indicate that Team Pangu is finalizing the iOS 10 jailbreak’s public release. The ever reliable group is on the verge of making an iOS 10 jailbreak tool but is waiting for a stable version of the iOS 10.2. Pangu allegedly claims to have a way around the iOS 10 security but is waiting for the Cupertino tech giant to initiate a move.

Todesco has recently been tweeting his followers to downgrade to iOS 10.1.1, which his followers have been doing in anticipation of an upcoming exploit. He’s very clearly mentioned that “there is a high chance I will take up whatever project 0 drops and write a full jailbreak on top of it. stay on 10.1.1, especially on i7.” there is a high chance I will take up whatever project 0 drops and write a full jailbreak on top of it. stay on 10.1.1, especially on i7 — qwertyoruiop (@qwertyoruiopz) December 15, 2016 Todesco further clarified with one of his follower that his JB tool is not just iOS 10.1.1, but all devices running iOS 10.1.1 and below. Reports indicate the jailbreak will essentially use the Google Project Zero exploit from Ian Beer shown on a bug report that he filed back in October. Also Read- Mac OS 10.12.2 Patch News, Updates &amp; More: Battery Issue, Graphics Fix and More Essentially, now it is race between Team Pangu and Todesco as to who releases an iOS 10 Jailbreak tool first.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The WSJ Confirms Old News that Apple asked the Indian Government for Incentives to Open a Plant | Main | Microsoft is Feisty and Showing that they're Hungry to take on Apple and Scratch their Way back to the Top » December 20, 2016 Apple Reporter Mark Gurman Lays out How Mac Loyalists are justified in Feeling Apple has Abandoned them   Mark Gurman, who once was a senior writer for 9to5Mac left to become a writer for Bloomberg. He's now free to be more honest about his views of Apple and it's products and today he doesn't mince his words. Mark begins his new report titled "How Apple Alienated Mac Loyalists," by stating that "To die-hard fans, Apple Inc.'s Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought these days." This is a sentiment that Microsoft is now trying to take advantage of. Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Microsoft's Marketing VP Boasts of Most MacBook Switchers to Surface ever due to Disappointing MacBook for Pros." The press smells that Apple is gradually losing moment while Microsoft is gaining momentum. This change in the nature of tech press coverage of Apple is changing and we covered that back in October in a report titled "The Battle between Microsoft and Apple Events focused on the Pro Market Sets Off a Firestorm."   In today's report, Gurman lays out the issues with Apple and the Mac systematically. Gurman notes that "Mac upgrades, once a frequent ritual, are few and far between. The Mac Pro, Apple's marquee computer, hasn't been refreshed since 2013. The affordable and flexible Mac mini was last upgraded in 2014. And when a new machine does roll out, the results are sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating, to devotees.   In October, after more than 500 days without an update, Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro, with a slimmer design and louder speakers. The laptop garnered mostly favorable reviews from the technology press but grumbles from creative types, a key constituency, who said the device under-performed rival products.   Interviews with people familiar with Apple's inner workings reveal that the Mac is getting far less attention than it once did. They say the Mac team has lost clout with the famed industrial design group led by Jony Ive and the company's software team.   They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key people working on Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the roll-out of new computers.   While the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, the company can't afford to alienate professional designers and other business customers. After all, they helped fuel Apple's revival in the late 1990s. In a stinging critique, Peter Kirn, founder of a website for music and video creators, wrote: "This is a company with no real vision for what its most creative users actually do with their most advanced machines."   If more Mac users switch, the Apple ecosystem will become less sticky—opening the door to people abandoning higher-value products like the iPhone and iPad.   People now have more options. Microsoft Corp., once derided by Mac loyalists for its clunky, buggy software, offers Windows 10, which provides the tablet type functionality Apple pioneered with the iPad. Microsoft's Surface computers offer Apple-esque quality and a well-reviewed creative paint program aimed at the Mac's audience. Sensing an opportunity, Microsoft called the MacBook Pro a "disappointment" and said more users than ever were switching to its Surface laptops.   In another sign that the company has prioritized the iPhone, Apple re-organized its software engineering department so there's no longer a dedicated Mac operating system team. There is now just one team, and most of the engineers are iOS first, giving the people working on the iPhone and iPad more power."   If you have the time, there's a lot more on Mark Gurman's mind and it's definitely worth a read here.   Gurman lastly noted that "Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 with just minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro."   To counter Gurman's report, there was one posted last night by TechCrunch wherein they quote Tim Cook stating that "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops. If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our road map. Nobody should worry about that."   Only time will tell if those desktops that Cook is alluding to will appease Mac Loyalists and Pros alike. Cook did have a lot to say about the Mac in the TechCrunch report and you could read all about it here.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Todd Haselton | December 20, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo If you’re a bit worried that Apple hasn’t updated its Mac Pro or iMac desktops, fear not, CEO Tim Cook promises the larger form-factor computers are still very much on Apple’s radar and are coming down the pipeline. Cook made his comments on an employee message board recently. “Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we’re committed to desktops,” Cook wrote. “If there’s any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.” To be clear, the reason the media has indeed raised that question is because Apple hasn’t updated its desktops with new processors. Indeed, the company hasn’t even mentioned the computers while other firms, like Microsoft, race forward with new next-gen systems like the Surface Studio. According to TechCrunch, which read the message board post, Cook agreed that desktops have a very important place in computing, even if they’re not as important as they might have once been. He acknowledged that they enable users to access much more powerful processors and to interact with larger displays (though, to be fair, laptops can work with those bigger displays just as easily.) “The fantastic thing about Apple employees is they get excited about something, and they want to know how it works. What it will do. What its capabilities are. If they want to know about something in an entirely different industry, they start pulling the string and see where it takes them. They’re focused more on the journey, which enables so many great things to happen,” Cook said. “Just in the past couple years, pulling that string on Watch and fitness led to ResearchKit, and ResearchKit led to CareKit. We’ve got a ton of things on our roadmap that I can’t talk about, but that I’m incredibly excited about, that are the result of pulling that string and not being bound by the box that so many people in life get bound by.” New Apple desktop form factor? Cook doesn’t jump right out and say that he’s building new desktop computers, but he does suggest that Apple is building all sorts of new things, perhaps also desktop computers, that might break the ways with which we think about how they operate. Apple made a pretty big change when it introduced the current version of the Mac Pro. Perhaps the next move will be even more drastic.

It's more about how much, or how little, Apple has thought about its customers. Tech Culture by Chris Matyszczyk December 18, 2016 1:00 PM PST @ChrisMatyszczyk Up Next The robots are coming to CES, and we can't wait to meet them Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image A lot to think about?Photo by Stephen Lam, Getty Images As they drift off for their one- or two-day vacations shortly, will Apple's senior executives be patting themselves on the back? Or will they be slapping themselves on the forehead? Apple's 2016 was garlanded with the usual hype, but not somehow with the usual excitement. Perhaps you're excited by profits. Most real people, however, simply want to witness, feel and enjoy something that, to them, feels both new and exciting. In this, Apple was quite woeful. It began with an iPhone SE and a smaller iPad Pro. Utilitarian? For sure. Exciting? Perhaps not. In March, respected Apple commentator Walt Massberg mused -- or perhaps pleaded: "The iPhone 7 had better be spectacular." A peek at the iPhone's potential under-glass fingerprint scanner tech The AirPods are available for preorder. Don't lose them. A full-glass screen iPhone is closer than you think and the Apple TV gets a Tinder app. We're already swiping left. by Brian Tong 5:16 Close Drag The iPhone 7 turned out to be as spectacular as Hillary Clinton's campaign, but a little more waterproof. The headphone jack was gone and some very strange-looking AirPod headphones were promised and then not delivered until very late. When you looked at Apple's Phil Schiller insisting that removing the headphone jack represented "courage," you thought that the only courage here involved offering that sort of twisted sell. In 2016, Apple was all about the business and not so much about the customer. Odd, for a company that was built on its human instincts and whose products were always intuitively simple to enjoy. Suddenly, it created a sense of wide-eyed disappointment, coupled with an enthusiasm for nickel-and-diming matched only by airlines and rental car companies. You now need dongle upon dongle to connect things to your new MacBook Pro. If you lose just one AirPod -- which is about as likely as you shed at least one strand of hair when your combing, it's $69, thank you very much. And here's how another respected, longtime Apple commentator and former Apple executive Jean-Louis Gassée described the MacBook Pro launch: "Perplexing." This is French for "Have these people lost the plot?" In essence, Apple didn't bother to communicate what possible difficulties a new product might make for the customer and allowed real people to see the product, work out its shortcomings and think anything from "dull" to "why?" to "what's the point of that?" Even the battery life indicator on the new Pro seemed amateurish and was removed. Apple then compounded the irritation by releasing an ad that claimed the MacBook Pro was somehow at the pinnacle of great ideas. Perplexing. With moves and movies such as these, Apple invites criticism because it has historically been very clever about how it launches and presents products. This year, you almost got the sense that Cupertino would have preferred to downplay some of its events, as it knew it really didn't have that much with which to excite people. You can blame a slowdown in technological development generally. You can couch it, as fans of sports teams sometimes do, as a transition year. We're going to lose a few games, but you should see our draft picks. More Technically Incorrect Elon Musk vows to start company that digs tunnels under traffic Watch a politician's musical tie interrupt his speech Trump tweets anger at China, creates new word Indeed, my colleague Shara Tibken persuasively explained that there might be a lot to look forward to from Apple in the coming year. At heart, though, the natives are restless and, perhaps unreasonably, expect far more. All this while Apple is involved in all sorts of political issues and is a company with far more tentacles than it used to have. I'm typing this on my MacBook Air. My iPhone 6 is charging next to it. The thought crosses my mind: "Why haven't I upgraded these things?" And the sad truth is that nothing new feels like much of an upgrade at all. Sometimes, when you're at your richest, you become your poorest and your dullest. Perhaps Apple should be grateful that Microsoft came up with arguably the most exciting piece of hardware this year, the Surface Studio. And what would have happened if Samsung's lovely Galaxy Note 7 had taken off, rather than exploding every time it did take off? Apple might have always had business competition -- big concerns like Microsoft that had a juggernaut quality. Not so often has it had competition for hearts. Is Cupertino up to the challenge? 2017 will offer a clue.

Credit: AppleMust More like this When A.I. whispers in your ear all day Why Apple dropped the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 8 most significant tech gadgets of 2016: Winners and losers Video Google Photos tips and tricks Available now after a few weeks delay, Apple’s AirPods are wireless earbuds that can do much more than any other wireless headphone system, bar those made by Apple. You can use them to listen to audio, ask Siri questions, get directions and more, and when you pair them to your iPhone, you’ll also be able to use them with any other supported Apple product.  What are AirPods? AirPods are Apple’s new wireless headphones. They use the company’s proprietary W1 chip, accelerometers and infrared sensors to detect when they are in your ears. They will automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears. They also host a microphone for calls and that let you ask Siri questions with a double-tap. AirPods are compatible with iPhone 5 or newer, Apple Watch, iPad mini 2 and iPad Air and newer and iPod touch 6. How much do they cost? $159. If you lose one, you can pick up a replacement for $99. What about power? The charging case is also a spare battery for your AirPods. Slide them into the case to charge them, and connect the case using a Lightning cable and USB charger. AirPods get up to five hours ofaudio playback or two hours of talk time on one charge. Apple says: “If you charge your AirPods for 15 minutes in your case, you get up to 3 hours of listening time or over an hour of talk time.” When fully charged the case will power up your AirPods multiple times, enough for 24 hours. You can check the charge status of the AirPods using the Batteries widget on your iPhone or using the volume Menu item on a paired Mac. There is a charging indicator in the AirPod case. When the pods are in the case, the light shows you how much charge they have, and when the pods are removed, it displays the charge present in the case. Green: Charged. Amber: Less than one full charge remains. White: AirPods are ready to set up. How do I set up my AirPods? Setup is easy. You need an iCloud account and a compatible device running the latest iOS. Unlock your iPhone and then open the charging case (with your AirPods inside) and hold it next to the phone (you may need to charge the AirPods first). A setup animation appears on the iPhone. Tap Connect and then Done. If you are logged into your iCloud account, the buds will now work with all your other devices. You can also set AirPods up as “normal” Bluetooth devices in the usual way. AirPod head detection Once paired, AirPods turn on automatically when removed from their case. They will play audio when you put them in your ears (their sensors can tell when this happens). Audio pauses if you remove one from your ear and stops when you remove them both. AirPod users You control AirPods using Siri, which you activate with a double tap on the outside of either bud. (You should tap the center of the widest part of the bud, approximately where its “stalk” meets the speaker). When activated, you can request things like: “Play David Bowie’s Black Star” “Turn up the volume” “How do I get to XXX from here?” “Pause Music” Or even, “How much battery power is left on the AirPods?” How do I make and take calls? Siri can announce calls as they come in. Double-tap to take the call. When taking or making a call, you also double-tap to hang up or switch to another call. You can use Siri to place calls, “Call Mum,” for example. Can I use AirPods with an Android smartphone? You can use AirPods with an Android smartphone, but only as a set of wireless headphones. The most sophisticated features won't work without Apple's advanced smartphone OS. You can also use them with any device that supports Bluetooth audio. To pair them with other devices: Open the lid of the case with the pods inside. On the back of the case, you’ll find a small white button. Press and hold this until the light in the case glows white and begins to blink. You can now pair the earbuds to your other device using standard Bluetooth setup. You do not get the full features supported by these earbuds using any platform other than Apple's. Where can I find the AirPod Settings? You access AirPod Settings in Settings>Bluetooth on a paired iOS device.Tap the ‘I’ beside AirPods in the list of Bluetooth devices to access these. In the next screen you can: Disconnect the AirPods (to use them with another device) Forget This Device (if you want to sell the buds or your iPhone, for example) Name: Tap this section to give the AirPods a name to make them easier to identify. Double Tap on AirPods: Here you can choose what double-tap achieves. By default (as referenced throughout this article), double-tap activates Siri, but this can be changed to just Play/Pause of music playback. Automatic Ear Detection: When enabled (as it is by default), this will automatically figure out when you are wearing these things. Microphone: Left, right or automatic. By default, you can use either AirPods as the mic (automatic), but you can change this if you want or need to. How can I switch devices? Once set up, to use AirPods with a different device you should select them as audio outputs on that device. So long as you are logged into the same iCloud account you should find them listed as alternative audio outputs in Control Center or the audio control on your Mac. What happens when you run out of power in one bud? If you are in the middle of a call and your AirPods begin to run out of power, you can remove one to charge it up in the case while continuing the conversation in the other – they will automatically detect what is happening. After 10 minutes you can swap them over. Can I use them with Apple Watch? Once paired with your iPhone, AirPods will work with your Apple Watch as well – sound switches between the devices, so you can choose what to play using either of them. How tough are they? AirPods appear to be pretty tough. A variety of different tests show they can handle sweat, or even a full washing machine cycle. They can also endure a 10-foot drop. They are tough to recycle, meaning Apple will need to handle them at EOL. What is inside AirPods? To find out what is inside the AirPods take a look at the latest iFixIt teardown. This tells us that components inside these are made by: Apple, Cypress, Maxim, Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, and NXP. What are the critics saying? The reviewers like AirPods, though a small number want to see Siri and Bluetooth audio improvements. Some are calling them the “future of wireless audio,” while TechPinions author and Creative Strategies analyst, Ben Bajarin, states: “Both the Apple Watch and AirPods are key engineering milestones to build on for where I believe Apple is headed in the future.” What is Jonny Evans saying? I believe AirPods are an important step toward the post-smartphone age. I can imagine them becoming a standard element to future mobile user interfaces. Google+?

The AirPods, which were first unveiled back at Apple’s iPhone 7 event in early September, endured a delay, but still managed to ship before the end of the 2016. Our own Benjamin Mayo has already written a hands-on AirPods first impressios post, so I thought I’d put together a post that highlights some of the top features for Apple’s groundbreaking wireless earbuds. Watch our hands-on video walkthrough inside for the full rundown. Truly wireless The most obvious top feature when it comes to the new AirPods is that they are truly wireless. That means that each AirPod is its own separate entity that features no cord or cable to connect. This lends a greater amount of freedom than standard EarPods, and it’s also better than the so-called “wireless” bluetooth earbuds, such as those from Beats’ PowerBeats line.   Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube now for more videos Battery life While five hours of battery life for the AirPods might not seem like much, you have to remember that the unit comes with a rechargeable Charging Case. The Charging Case provides enough extra juice to recharge the AirPods several times over, which greatly extends the overall battery life of the buds while out and about. Unless you plan on keeping the AirPods in your ears for more than five hours straight, the battery life should be more than enough. Charging Case Speaking of the Charging Case, it’s by far one of the best features of the new AirPods. Often mocked in early reviews for looking like a dental floss container, the Charging Case, with its metal contacts that interface with the metal ends of each AirPod, is the secret sauce that makes the long battery life a possibility. Not only does the case provide you with a great way to store your AirPods while not in use, it allows the buds to be small and light since they don’t have to bear the brunt of the battery duties. The AirPods Charging Case provides up to 24 hours of battery life, and can be easily recharged via the Lightning port (Apple includes a Lightning cable inside the box). In just 15 minutes the AirPods can be charged via the Charging Case to provide up to three hours of battery life. This means that, as long as you keep the Charging Case on your person, you’ll rarely be without music while on the go. Small and light Like the EarPods, the AirPods are small and light, which means that wearing them for extended periods of time shouldn’t be an issue. The fact that the units lack a cord makes the whole setup feel even more lightweight while in your ears. They don’t fall out of the ears (as easily) The lack of a wire contributes much to the AirPods’ ability to stay firmly planted in your ears. One of the contributing factors to the EarPods fit conundrums had a lot to do with the weight of the wires tugging at the earbuds in your ears. Now that the wires are long longer there, it’s easier to keep the units in the ear. That’s definitely not to say that some users won’t have problems with the AirPods falling out, because they will. I did a simple jogging-in-place exercise and I noticed the left AirPod beginning to slip out. Sound quality Compared to the stock Lightning EarPods, the AirPods sound slightly better. You shouldn’t expect a massive increase in sound quality, but the AirPods do sound clearer than the EarPods. The difference is subtle, but it’s there. Usually you would expect wireless headphones to feature reduced audio fidelity, but I didn’t find that to be the case when comparing the AirPods to the EarPods. Pairing and switching devices Thanks to Apple’s W1 wireless chip, the AirPods feature the same handy pairing features as the previously released Beats Solo3 headphones. The W1 wireless chip makes pairing simple and easy, all you need to do is place the AirPods in the Charging Case, and place it next to your iPhone. A Pairing sheet will automatically appear, which allows you to pair your AirPods with a single button tap. Best of all, once you pair to your iPhone, your Apple Watch will automatically be able to connect to your AirPods, along with any Mac or iOS devices connected to the same iCloud account. And switching between devices is simple and easy with no Bluetooth-related hoops to jump through. Battery status Apple provides a very impressive battery status details via special popovers that appear on your iPhone’s screen. Users can gain quick access to the battery life of individual AirPod units, and the Charging Case. You’ll also find battery status via the Battery widget within Control Center, or by asking Siri. Auto pause, resume, and mono playback When you take one of the AirPods out of your ear, audio playback will automatically pause. When you place the AirPod back into your ear, the audio playback automatically resumes. A similar thing occurs when listening to music via your iPhone’s speaker. If you remove the AirPods from the Charging Case and place them into your ears, playback will automatically start via the AirPods. It’s also possible to use only one AirPod at a time for both phone calls, Siri control and music playback. And the AirPods are smart enough to pipe mono sound through a single AirPod, and stereo sound through two AirPods. Siri access You can quickly access Siri via a double tap on the area above either AirPod stem. You can then use Siri to playback songs from your Apple Music library, ask for directions, or use Siri for anything else that it’s capable of doing. First impressions The AirPods are just as polarizing in person from a design perspective as they were when they were first revealed at the iPhone 7 event. The bright white casing coupled with the shiny metallic ends makes the AirPods stand out that much more while in your ears, and it almost looks like jewelry or some sort of bizarre-looking earrings. I’m not a fan of the look to be honest, and I’d much prefer if the AirPods came in a darker color. Of course, this is just a personal observation, and looks are highly subjective, so you may not agree with my sentiments. Outside of the looks, I’m largely impressed with the AirPods. They’re extremely well built, and the pairing process couldn’t be easier. The AirPods are the best wireless earbuds that I’ve tried so far, and it’s not even close. Sound quality is also much better than any truly wireless earbuds I’ve tried by a long shot. The thing that really makes the AirPods shine is the Charging Case. The fact that you can have more than 24 hours of battery life by means of a Charging Case that literally fits in the palm of your hand is the AirPods’ killer feature. I also like the way that the AirPods magnetically snap into the case for charging, and how the case’s lid is perfectly weighted to snap closed and flip open on its metallic hinge. Opportunities for improvement Despite the superlatives, the AirPods aren’t perfect. The biggest issue (for some) will revolve around fit. It’s a one-size-should-fit-all product, and as such, some users will still experience issues with the AirPods falling out of their ears. The lack of a wire pulling on the earbuds definitely helps, but it’ll still be an issue for some users. Sound quality, while better than the EarPods, is still limited, primarily by physics. The AirPods sound good, with clear highs and mids, but the low end is obviously limited in such a form factor. If you desire lots of thumping bass, you’re going to need to look elsewhere. I’ve found the W1 chip-enabled Beats Solo3 to be an excellent performer as far as overall sound quality is concerned, and they sound much better than the AirPods, but they are also more expensive, heavier, not very conducive for workouts, and more difficult to travel with. My biggest gripe with the AirPods is the lack of almost any tactile control whatsoever. You have to invoke Siri to do just about anything. You can’t even change volume via the AirPods without invoking Siri, and that’s just plain silly. Apple does allow you to change what happens when you perform a double-tap gesture on the AirPods, but it’s limited to pausing/playing music, using Siri, or having the double-tap gesture disabled altogether. I guess Apple figures that many users will be controlling music playback and volume via an Apple Watch, but the lack of any sort of control on the device itself, outside of Siri or play/pause, makes using the AirPods without an Apple Watch a bit cumbersome. Conclusion Overall, I’m happy with the AirPods. They definitely won’t replace my Beats Solo3 Wireless for at-home listening, but they’re perfect when listening on the go, while traveling, while lying in bed, and for any other activity where it’s better to have lightweight, truly wireless earbuds. Depending on your ear fit, they may not be perfect for exercise and workouts, but that will largely be a case-by-case basis. I’m not yet sold on the look of the AirPods, but I’m hoping that they’ll grow on me over time. But outside of looks, the AirPods are an impressive piece of tech that works seamlessly with the Mac, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. It’ll even work with Android devices, but you don’t get access to Siri, and you don’t get the easy pairing and seamless switching afforded by the W1 wireless chip Are the AirPods worth $159? If you want the best truly wireless earbuds on the market, then I’d say yes. What do you think? Sound off in the comments below with your thoughts and experiences.

If you are desperate to buy AirPods before Christmas, it’s worth refreshing your local pickup options as retail stores are getting new shipments all the time. AirPods are also now being sold on Verizon’s website, which is another place where you might be able to buy some before the end of 2016. They were briefly available with two-day shipping this morning. eBay scalpers continue to sell AirPods with Christmas availability at inflated prices. For UK readers, Carphone Warehouse is now selling AirPods for £159 with free Christmas delivery if you order before the 23rd. In its original announcement about AirPods availability, Apple said that units would be available at Apple Retail, authorized resellers and select carrier stores this week. These retail stores would apparently be receiving regular shipments even though online orders from Apple.com still quote 6 week delivery windows. Resellers like Best Buy are getting surges of AirPods availability, so it’s worth checking their site too if you are hunting for Christmas delivery. One reader even said that an order he made last night was processed with a February back order date, but shipped just a few hours later. Right now, it seems like Verizon is the only US carrier selling the AirPods. We’d expect other major carriers to start stocking them by the end of the month — keep your eyes peeled. If all else fails, you can always resort to eBay where scalpers are happy to sell you some AirPods today, at very inflated prices.

Latest: a source close to Apple predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved plastic OLED screen and may have side-mounted Touch ID; and a noted blogger says the iPhone 8 redesign will be "a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply" by David Price | 20 Dec 16 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date Design New features Specs Macworld poll - What do you want from your future iPhone? When will the new iPhone 8 be released in the UK, and how different will it be from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus? (Or will the next generation of Apple smartphones be called the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus?) And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus? The iPhone 8 rumour mill is heating up, a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7 alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus during a special event on 7 September, but we're already looking ahead to the next generation. In this article we round up all the rumours about the iPhone 8: the iPhone 8's UK release date (and onsale date), iPhone 8 UK price, iPhone 8 specs and new features. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started. For advice on the current iPhone range, read our iPhone buying guide and best cheap iPhone deals UK. Or, if you'd like to look even further into the future (covering tech developments that come perilously close to the realms of science-fiction), read iPhone 9 and beyond: From graphene to motion charging. Updated, 20 December 2016, with reports of plastic screens and 'new sensing technologies' that could move Touch ID to the side of the iPhone 8; on 14 Dec, with predictions of a red iPhone 8; on 7 Dec, with new evidence that suggests Donald Trump might just succeed in getting iPhone 8 manufacture moved to the US; on 29 Nov, to discuss growing evidence for wireless charging; on 22 Nov, with further augmented reality news (including a new Apple patent for augmented reality maps); and on 25 Oct, with a report that predicts the iPhone 8's redesign will be "a big f**king deal" iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Release date Some pundits have predicted that the iPhone 7 will sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes (on a relative scale, of course - it'll still outsell its main rivals many times over). But, they say, everything will change in 2017, when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8, to be released on the iPhone's 10-year anniversary in 2017 (skipping the 'S' generation in recognition of its major updates) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Kulbinder Garcha, one of the company's analysts, was sufficiently confident about the iPhone 8's performance to predict sales of 250 million units in fiscal 2018 (despite launching in the calendar year 2017, the iPhone 8's sales will be reported in 2018), compared to 215 million in 2017. Garcha may be confident, but we're not so sure. Going three years between substantive updates to what remains by far its most profitable line in order to make a big launch match a big anniversary feels like a strange and risky strategy for Apple (we don't subscribe to Nikkei's theory that the company will follow a three-year cycle from now on), and with the Android sector pushing boundaries in a lot of ways this would inevitably result in accusations of stagnation - even more so than now. Read next: Best place to buy an iPhone in the UK iPhone 8 release date rumours: Analysts predict 'decade of uncertainty' after iPhone 8 But what happens after the blockbusting launch of the iPhone 8 (or Tenth Anniversary iPhone)? It might not get pretty, if some researchers are to be believed. Content continues below One analyst, Andrew Uerkwitz, has predicted that the 2017 iPhone refresh will be the company's "last growth hurrah", before spiralling into a "decade-long malaise" as the market turns increasingly to lower-cost and second-hand phones. "The risks to the company have never been greater," Uerkwitz said to MarketWatch. Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak echoed Uerkwitz's sentiments. "Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever," he said. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Apple's release schedule Before we think about new features you should expect in the iPhones of the future, let's talk about the likely release date schedule. Apple's latest batch of smartphones, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, were released in the autumn of 2016. (Read more: iPhone 7 review and iPhone 7 Plus review.) After that point it gets harder to predict. Based on the past few years of Apple launches, the generation after that logically ought to be an S update: the iPhone 7s and the iPhone 7s Plus, launched together in autumn 2017 (with the potential of an iPhone SE 2 in spring of 2017, or moved back to launch with them in the autumn). The iPhone 8 - as well as the iPhone 8 Plus - would then finally be unveiled in September 2018. Sept 2016: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus But it may not be that simple. iPhone 8 release date rumours: The end of the iPhone 'S' convention It's possible that Apple won't continue the S generation strategy for much longer. Many of us have pointed out that this 'tick-tock' system is a risky policy, tacitly acknowledging that iPhone generations alternate between major and minor updates - to be especially harsh, you could say worthwhile and superfluous updates. When the average user hears that the new iPhone hasn't even been considered worthy of a full version number upgrade, they'll be put off from spending money on the new offering. Not to mention that an S update is more confusing for buyers: iPhone 6 followed by iPhone 7 would have been clear and easy to understand; but it's less obvious which out of the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus is the more advanced model. On this principle, therefore, we could see the iPhone 7 in autumn 2016 and the iPhone 8 the year after. At this point, nobody knows - but as soon as we hear more, we'll update this article. And in October 2016 a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory. According to Business Insider, an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". The sourced added that the iPhone 8 would be "different" from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7, and have a better camera - neither of which are particularly out-there predictions. iPhone 8 release date rumours: Can Donald Trump persuade Apple to build iPhones in the US? Donald Trump spent much of his recent presidential campaign complaining about Apple and its offshore manufacturing operations, and promising he would make the company build its iPhones in the US. (The only major Apple product currently made on American shores is the Mac Pro.) Now, as President-Elect Trump, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump claimed to have spoken on the phone with Tim Cook - implying, indeed, that Cook initiated the call - and reached what sounds like a degree of understanding you might not expect from two men with such different temperaments and political leanings. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, of course: labour costs are lower and there is, according to Cook, a shortage of relevant skills in the US. Moving manufacturing to America would lose Apple a lot of money. But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking." What Trump does not claim - and past behaviour suggests he'd be singing it from the rooftops - is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. He may understand where Trump is coming from, and Trump may have given him the hard sell, but it would be a huge step if Apple actually does move any kind of significant proportion of its device manufacture to the US. Foxconn's US expansion There was another twist in this tale when it emerged on 7 December that iPhone manufacturer Foxconn is indeed pondering an expansion of its (currently relatively small-scale) US operations, in a move that is apparently expected to involve $7bn of investment and create 50,000 jobs. Strangely, nobody involved made much of a deal about this. But eagle-eyed journalists spotted that paperwork being shown off to publicise SoftBank's US investment deal (which Donald Trump has made a huge song and dance about) also featured Foxconn's logo, and appeared to suggest that the second figure in each pair of numbers referred to that company. (Picture credit: CNBC) Foxconn has since confirmed that it is in talks about expanding its US operations, although it has declined to comment on the figures given. "While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant US officials," the firm said in a statement, according to Reuters. Now, what new features and tech developments can we expect in the next few generations of Apple smartphone? iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Design iPhones are that lethal combination of expensive and fragile that results in so much consumer heartache. The result is that each iPhone owner has to make their own deal with the devil: either wrapping it in a robust case, thereby masking the handsome design that they paid all that money for in the first place, or risk pavement damage every time they take the thing out of a pocket. But design changes may mean this is not the case in the future. Here are the design changes we expect in the iPhone 8. Read next: How to repair a cracked iPhone screen iPhone 8 design: 10th-anniversary redesign will be 'a big f**king deal' The year 2017 (June the 29th, to be precise) marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and some suggest that Apple will want to come up with a real blockbuster of a redesign to celebrate. Noted tech blogger Robert Scoble has posted an exhaustive list of predictions for next year's iPhone, and he expects big things. "It's the 10th anniversary of the iPhone," he writes. "It's the first product introduction in Apple's new amazing headquarters. It's a big f**king deal and will change this industry deeply." (Those are Scoble's asterisks.) Design-wise, he expects that the iPhone 8 "will be, I am told, a clear piece of glass (er, Gorilla Glass sandwich with other polycarbonates for being pretty shatter resistant if dropped) with a next-generation OLED screen (I have several sources confirming this). You pop it into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it." He also says to expect "battery and antennas to be hidden around the edges of the screen, which explains how Apple will fit in some of the pieces even while most of the chips that make up a phone are in a pack/strip at the bottom of the phone". But the range of features Scoble is expecting is overwhelming. You really need to read the post for yourself. Scoble isn't the only one predicting a big redesign for 2017. French site nowhereelse.fr has shared a leaked image (below), which appears to showcase the exact dimensions of the iPhone 7. These dimensions are identical to the ones found on the iPhone 6s, measuring 67.12mm wide and 138.3mm tall. Through this image, it would appear that there also won't be any change to the camera (there have been rumours about a dual camera system as you'll discover later in this article). The image has the OnLeaks stamp on it, and OnLeaks has been reliable with Apple leaks in the past. iPhone 8 design: Glass front and back, with stainless steel option 9to5Mac has got hold of a report from the ever-quotable and usually reliable Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities - a report that predicts, based on the popularity of the scratch-prone Jet Black iPhone 7, that the iPhone 8 will have a (more scratch-resistant) glass front and back. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests, an all glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design," 9to5mac says. iPhone 8 design: New colour options There have been various rumours about new colour finishes, focusing on two possibilities: dark blue, and red. According to a report from Macotakara, the iPhone 7 will come in Silver, Gold, Rose Gold and a new Deep Blue. This seems entirely possible. Samsung offers blue flagship phones that seem to be among the more popular options, so Apple might decide to follow Samsung's lead. Following the reports from Mac Otakara, designer Martin Hajek has published some gorgeous concept images of the Deep Blue iPhone 7. See more over on Martin's website. (Shortly after the Deep Blue rumours emerged, a second colour rumour came to light on the same blog. Macotakara now said that Space Black would be introduced instead of Deep Blue to replace the current Space Grey option. And while the names were different - black and Jet Black, in fact - Apple did indeed replace Space Grey with black colour options. Does this leave Deep Blue for the next generation?) More recently, Macotakara has been reporting a new colour rumour, predicting that the 2017 iPhones will be available in red. iPhone 8 design: Apple Watch-style Digital Crown Some of the more out-there concept illustrators have considered the idea of Apple giving the iPhone 7 a rotating control, like the Digital Crown on the Apple Watch. But the rest of us thought it was a crazy idea. But it might just be so crazy that it actually happens, if a new Apple patent is anything to go by. The patent, spotted like so many of these things by Patently Apple, is illustrated with images of an iPad but is described in sufficiently broad terms that it could easily apply to an iPhone too. The patent suggests that the rotating control could to adjust volume, resize text and various other functions, and all of this makes a certain sense; but does anyone honestly think it's something Apple would really do with its elegant clean iPhone? Our strong suspicion is that this is one of those patents Apple and other tech companies periodically take out in order to mislead rivals and cover moonshot concepts that are extremely unlikely to lead anywhere. iPhone 8 design: No more bezels above and below screen Apple has been awarded a patent that covers the embedding of light sensors within the layers of a display, leading to speculation that the firm intends to remove the bezels from its next iPhone. Indeed, the patent - US Patent 9,466,653 - specifically describes the tiresome current necessity for bezels in the background section: "In a typical device, a light sensor is laterally displaced from an active display region of the display along a front face of the device. Additional space is therefore provided in common devices at the top, bottom, or side of the active display area to accommodate the light sensor." Instead, the patent proposes to integrate the sensor within the display: "The light sensor is a display-integrated light sensor that is integrated into the layers of the display. The light sensor may [be] interposed between the cover layer and another layer of the display such as the touch-sensitive layer, the light-generating layers, or another display layer." This is Fig. 11 of the patent's illustrations, showing "a display-integrated light sensor attached to a thin-film transistor layer of a bottom emission organic light-emitting diode display". Of course, another hardware element that's currently built into the bezel at the bottom of the iPhone is the Home button. Which leads to our next section...  iPhone 8 design: No more physical home button (and Touch ID built into the display) Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster (a well-known industry pundit, but one who has come in for a fair amount of ribbing after regularly predicting that Apple would launch a television), suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, thanks to the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s. He felt that the new tech provides Apple with a way to eliminate the home button, instead using the additional space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. The issue with Munster's theory is that the Touch ID would need to move, as it is currently situated beneath the home button on Apple's iPhones and iPads. However, as we discuss below, Apple has been investigating ways to build the Touch ID sensor into the screen itself. Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true, but may yet happen on the iPhone 8.  In the continuing march of miniaturisation, one of the elements of the iPhone design that's proved resistant to shrinkage is the bezel below the screen - it can't get much smaller than it already is because it needs to house the Home button. Which is why a recurring theory is that Apple will extend the screen down past the Home button, or even incorporate the Touch ID sensor that lives in the recent iPhones' Home button into the touchscreen. Technology that would facilitate such a development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company called Sonavation. The tech would enable Apple (which is known to use Gorilla Glass in its iPhones, even if the supplier is apparently not permitted to say this publicly) to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that appeared to back up the theory that it's looking into ideas like this. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed by a number of Apple's engineers in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the accompanying illustrations (although you should bear in mind that patent images are almost universally ugly, and shouldn't bear much resemblance to what the finished design would look like): The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept, not to show what it would look like in practice. iPhone 8 design: Touch ID screen patent granted An update to this rumour: Apple has been granted a patent - a different one - that also appears to refer to a Touch ID fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more intriguingly for our purposes, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". iPhone 8 design: Touch ID sensors on the side of the device Korea Herald cites "a source familiar with the matter" when reporting that Apple is exploring "new sensing technologies" that could substantially change the way Touch ID works. "The upcoming iPhone may use new sensing technology," explains the site's source, "which enables the phone to respond when users touch any side of the device. But Apple may not adopt this technology." The source doesn't specify whether the new sensors are connected to Touch ID, but it seems likely: all the talk of removing bezels and physical Home buttons and expanding the screen is going to necessitate finding a new location for the fingerprint scanner. If the iPhone becomes able to sense and analyse fingerprints on any edge, that would even remove the need for a specific Touch ID 'action' - you'd just need to pick the phone up. iPhone 8 design: Changes to Home button Some rumours suggest Apple is working on keeping the Home button and adding more features to it. There are two patents that have sparked these rumours, so they're both something Apple has at least considered. The first is a dynamic home button that is sensitive to gestures: you'd be able to swipe across it, or lean a thumb in one direction to scroll the screen of a game, for example, that way.  The second is pretty far out there. Essentially the concept is this: the Home button on the iPhone would be able to 'pop up' on a little spring and turn into a sort of mini-joystick for playing games. There are plenty of iOS games that would benefit from a hardware controller (this explains the enduring popularity of Bluetooth gaming controller accessories) and this sounds like a lot of fun. But gamers remain only one section of the iPhone's audience, and it seems like a risky idea to potentially compromise the resilience of everyone's iPhone Home button (which has famously been very prone to breakage in the past) for a feature that would benefit only some users. Best iPhone (and iPad) games iPhone 8 design: A larger, longer earpiece While this may not be the most exciting rumour to hit the internet, the latest rumours suggest that the next iPhone is to feature a longer earpiece cutout. The rumour, first covered by Mac Otakara, states that in addition to a longer earpiece cutout, Apple is moving the ambient light sensor from the left-hand side to the right-hand side. The source is apparently manufacturers of LCD protective films on Alibaba.com that are apparently no lonoger receiving orders related to the upcoming iPhone.  While the rumour is unconfirmed and should be taken with a pinch of salt, but if true, it could mean that the iPhone 8 may not be compatible with iPhone 7 cases and screen protectors, even if the design is broadly the same. iPhone 8 design: Curved wraparound screen According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has often correctly predicted upcoming Apple products - the analyst think a forthcoming iPhone could feature a curved 5.8in AMOLED screen. If this rumour is to be true, there would be an understandable shift from Apple to get rid of the headphone jack and produce a smartphone which is immediately distinguishable over its competitors.  We're into the realm of patents here, which we would generally warn readers means we're talking about developments that could easily end up appearing in a shipped product several years down the line or not appearing at all - Apple, like most tech companies, routinely applies for far more patents than it's ever going to use. But this one has actually been granted (it was applied for a few years back) so it could be reasonably close to reality. Patent 9,146,590 refers to an "electronic device with wrap around display". And essentially it describes a curved screen that allows for more screen elements to be displayed without making the device significantly bigger. (Remember that the illustrations rarely represent what the designer has in mind. In theory the display could wrap entirely around the device, or at least extend over one edge like the Note Edge.) While the patent talks about a "flexible display assembly", it's important to note that this isn't a patent for a bendable screen: the flexible portion of the display is attached to the interior surface of the curved transparent housing, which "provides a rigid support structure that prevents deformation". Samsung Display could be set to make flexible OLED displays for the iPhone 8. The rumour stems from claims that Samsung is reaching out to display tech companies in South Korea that they're hoping will lend a hand with building the displays, as the order from Apple will be huge. Samsung may even be intending to invest billions in an new factory in which it'll manufacture the displays. At present, iPhones use LCD displays, but the Apple Watch uses a flexible OLED so it's certainly possible that Apple intends to bring the tech to the iPhone. We're not talking flexible in the same way as the patent above, though. It'll simply mean that the screen could curve around the design of the iPhone 8 more accurately, hinting further at an edge-to-edge display. It'll also likely be used to improve 3D Touch. iPhone 8 design: Plastic screen The Korea Herald report we linked to earlier also discusses the screen, and the site's "source familiar with the matter" predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a display that is curved and OLED - both rumours that we've heard before - and made of plastic, which is a new one to us. "The OLED versions of the new iPhone will all have curved screens as Apple ordered only plastic OLED - not glass - from Samsung Display," reports the source. "Samsung is capable of supplying a little less than 100 million units of curved OLED displays to Apple." iPhone 8 design: Sapphire iPhone screens are already far tougher than your average piece of glass (they're made of a proprietary material called Gorilla Glass), but they do sometimes crack or even shatter when dropped. Sapphire screens would be more resistant still, and Apple is already using sapphire in the display of the Apple Watch: it's possible that the company is now ready to import this material into its smartphone line-up. Rumoured plans to rely on an Apple-backed sapphire plant in Arizona (which had the capacity to manufacture 200 million 5-inch iPhone displays per year) fell through. But more recent reports suggest that long-term Apple supplier Foxconn is gearing up to build its own sapphire plant in Taiwan at a cost of $2.6bn. In August 2016, it was reported by Patently Apple that Apple filed patents for a curved glass iPhone with virtual buttons on the sides. If accurate, this could be somwhat like the rumoured OLED bar on the expected new MacBook Pro, but time will tell. The patent images also show a curved glass screen similar to that which we have now seen made popular by Samsung's Galaxy S6 edge and S7 edge. This has helped to fuel the rumours that Apple is planning a major redesign for the iPhone 8 to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. Either way, it'll have to be signifcantly different to Samsung's efforts to avoid Apple being accused of plagiarism. Then again, most smartphones of the past decade have aped the original iPhone, so we're sure that wouldn't prove problematic for Apple - particularly since these patents show its legal right to product the devices in this way. Read more: What is Sapphire glass, and why is it a good idea for the iPhone? iPhone 8 design: Project Phire Corning, the company that makes Gorilla Glass, responded to the looming threat of sapphire glass in early 2015 with the announcement of an ultra-hardened composite material codenamed Project Phire. James Clappin, president of Corning Glass Technologies, told investors: "We told you last year that sapphire was great for scratch performance but didn't fare well when dropped. So we created a product that offers the same superior damage resistance and drop performance of Gorilla Glass 4 with scratch resistance that approaches sapphire." Apple never discusses the materials it uses for iPhone screens, but it's great news for consumers that suppliers are jousting to provide the best and most durable screen glass. Read more about Project Phire here. iPhone 8 design: Graphene Sapphire glass is already being used on the non-Sport models of the Apple Watch, and Project Phire appears to be in a reasonably advanced state of development, but we're getting closer to the realms of science-fiction. Graphite, the material used in standard pencils, is made up of stacks of sheets of carbon, each one only a single atom thick. This is why it's so good for writing: the layers naturally slide off on to the paper. But graphene is a different matter. Graphene is what you get if you're clever enough to isolate one of the layers in graphite, leaving you with a substance that's effectively two-dimensional. It's the thinnest substance known to man, about a million times thinner than a human hair, and for that matter quite possibly the strongest (it's 100 times stronger than steel) and a phenomenally good electrical conductor - 1,000 times better than copper. Oh, and it's virtually transparent, too. All of which makes graphene an exciting prospect for tech manufacturers. Most obviously, it would make for a tremendously durable coating material for the screen (and would lend itself to bendable displays, too) or indeed any part of the device; but it could really appear in almost any of the sections of this article. Graphene would be a superior replacement for silicon in processor chips, or could be used to make more efficient batteries and solar cells. It's marvellous stuff. We're also pleased to report that graphene is British - sort of. It was discovered by the Soviet-born physicist Andre Geim at the University of Manchester, where it continues to be studied. (Entertainingly, Geim is the only scientist so far to be awarded both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel prize.) If you'd like to read more about graphene, I strongly recommend the New Yorker's article on the subject. iPhone 8 design: Viscoelastic material Let's move on from the screen and talk about new durable materials for the rest of the iPhone. How about a bit of drop-resistance? Based on patent activity, Apple is devising a viscoelastic material that would absorb impacts. The material would cover Apple devices and make them survive drops far better. The patent could make sense in all of Apple's mobile devices and laptops, but the iPhone is the obvious area to begin. iPhone 8 design: Flexible iPhone In January 2015 Apple was awarded a patent that suggests that the company is investigating the idea of a flexible iPhone (and we're not talking about the Bendgate kind). The patent suggests that, by making the iPhone flexible, Apple could unlock a new range of controls: the user could open an app by bending the device in a particular way, for example, or use the flexibility to control a game. It's an intriguing if seemingly far-fetched concept. Additionally, a flexible iPhone flexible ought to be more resistant to impacts and therefore more durable. But we'll discuss a key element in the idea of a flexible iPhone - a screen that can bend without breaking - in the screen tech section. iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: New features That covers design. But what new features should we expect in the iPhone 8? iPhone 8 new features: Smart connector Could the iPhone 8 get a smart connector, like those used on the 9.7in and 12.9in iPad Pro collection? Of course, as with any rumour/leak it's best to take it with a pinch of salt but according to a report from Mac Otakara, a forthcoming iPhone will feature a smart connector. Mac Otakara claims "the possibility is great" that earlier leaked images are "the real thing", and even went on to claim that the next iPhone could be as thin as 6.1mm, although there was no source provided for this information. More recently, Logitech (or Logi?) has launched the Logi Base, the first accessory to utilise the iPad Pro smart connector for charging capabilities. As first reported by AppleInsider, the Base uses magnets to easily line up the iPad Pro with the charger, providing users with something close to wireless charging. It also means that you can pick up the iPad and walk away without needing to unplug it. While it's specific to the iPad Pro, it gives you an idea about what a smart connector on an iPhone could be used for.  iPhone 8 new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but Apple has been offering the feature for some years now in the form of the Apple Watch's inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This was obviously too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus which appeared only two months later, and didn't make it into the iPhone 7 either. But the technology may appear in the iPhone 8 generation. Indeed, Foxconn - one of the large manufacturing firms that builds iPhones for Apple - is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones (it would make a neat point of differentiation for the iPhone 8 Plus) if the tests prove satisfactory. The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in one of his Apple Insight research notes that Apple will bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the Apple Watch. Perhaps the iPhone 8 Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 8 buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers slightly more detail of Ming-Chi Kuo's predictions, clarifying that Pegatron is expected to be "the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger". Wireless charging sounds amazing, but we should stress that at the moment inductive charging has a very short range; so you wouldn't be able to just sit at your desk and have your iPhone (in your pocket) charge from the plug several feet away. (Bloomberg reckons Apple is working on longer-range wireless charging, potentially charging at a distance of about 1 metre using near-field magnetic resonance, but this seems more of a long shot.) Rather, you'd place the device on a wired mat. Convenient, but not quite as space-age as it might have sounded when we talked about 'wireless charging'. If you can't wait until the iPhone 8 to start charging your iPhone wirelessly, read How to wirelessly charge your iPhone. iPhone 8 new features: Face-detection and iris-recognition In December 2014, USPTO awarded Apple a patent relating to a "personal computing device control using face detection and recognition". Current iPhones and iPads can be unlocked using just your fingerprint, thanks to the Touch ID sensor. But with this patent, future iPhones and other devices could be unlocked using facial recognition: effectively, your face becomes your password. More recently, DigiTimes has predicted - citing that old favourite, "industry sources" - that Apple is likely to launch iPhones equipped with iris-recognition technology in 2018, which should line up with the iPhone 8's launch. This rumour was reiterated at the end of August when Digitimes reported that Taiwan-based Xintec is expected to provide iris scanners to Apple for the iPhone launching in 2017, and that this would help boost the company's revenues significantly next year. Once this technology becomes widespread - and you should expect other firms to launch phones with the feature before Apple, with DigiTimes predicting that Samsung for one will get there in the second half of 2016 - you'll be able to unlock your iPhone by scanning your eye. Is that really more convenient than scanning a fingerprint, though? It's more excitingly futuristic, admittedly. iPhone 8 new features: Augmented reality and VR In the Facebook post by Robert Scoble we mentioned earlier, one of the more surprising and detailed predictions concerns augmented reality and VR. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming to a phone, and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts: "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand. Apple's purchase of Metaio is going to prove very key. I won't be shocked to learn that Peter Meier, CTO there, is in charge of the next iPhone strategy and has been for years." Scoble isn't the only pundit predicting that Apple - and the iPhone in particular - are about to plunge into the world of augmented reality. Business Insider claims that the company is already working on ways to integrate AR elements into the iPhone's Camera app. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised, according to Kris Kolo, director of the VR/AR Association and a board member of Flyby Media, an AR startup that was acquired by Apple earlier this year," writes the site. Business Insider further predicts that the iPhone's camera app will be able to recognise "and manipulate" faces in augmented reality. And we've spotted a recent Apple patent application that appears to back up all this speculation. Patent 9,488,488, for 'Augmented reality maps', describes the use of a mobile device to view live video of whatever is in front of the user, and to then superimpose images related to nearby places of interest on top of the video. "A user points a handheld communication device to capture and display a real-time video stream. The handheld communication device detects geographic position, camera direction, and tilt of the image capture device. The user sends a search request to a server for nearby points of interest. ... The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with data related to each point of interest. The user then selects a point of interest to visit. The handheld communication device visually augments the captured video stream with a directional map to a selected point of interest in response to the user input." Read more: Apple VR and augmented reality rumours iPhone 8 release date rumours UK | iPhone 8 specs: Specs It's hard to predict precise specs this far in advance, but it's possible to draw some broad conclusions about where Apple is headed. Let's start with... iPhone 8 specs: Screen A report by the Wall Street Journal prophesies that Apple has big things up its sleeve for the next iPhone's screen, after turning out smartphones with lower resolutions than their rivals for some years. (If you compare the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, you'll see that Apple managed only a 760 x 1334 resolution on its 4.7-inch screen, in comparison to the 1440 x 2560 5.1-inch screen that Samsung had to offer. Comparison possibly isn't the right word to use when the difference is as pronounced as that.) The iPhone 8 will sit in Samsung's shadows no longer, according to the WSJ, which says Apple has asked suppliers to "submit prototype screens with better resolution than ones from Samsung". If this is true - and if the suppliers are able to match Apple's stipulation without pushing up price, weight or dimension, or reducing battery life or fire safety, to a degree that Apple finds unacceptable - then this would imply more than a tripling of the pixel count from one iPhone generation to the next. What's more, word is that screens are getting bigger in 2017. In November 2016, Barclays Research - via MacRumors - released a report predicting that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would have 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens respectively, compared to the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The analysts based the prediction on the testimony of sources within Apple's Asian supply chain. It's still early days, though: the analysts warned that the design "didn't sound 100% locked down", so Apple may yet change its mind. If you're wondering how Apple will fit in that extra screen real estate - will the phones be bulkier than the current handsets? - then fear not. It's understood that the larger screens will fit in bodies with the same dimensions as the current generation of phones, thanks to a bezel-free design. This has been on the cards for a while. On 5 March 2015, indeed, Apple filed a patent that would allow for a bezel-free device. An image render and concept by Marek Weidlich shows us what the iPhone might look like if it were to have no bezels. The conceptual idea looks great and would show that Apple is still innovating in the smartphone space. Similarly, according to a Wall Street Journal source, the iPhone 8 may feature an edgeless display - but what is that, exactly? According to the publication, Apple is to redesign the iPhone for the 10th anniversary and that the changes "could include an edge-to-edge organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen" without a physical Home button. John Gruber also commented on the upcoming redesign, claiming that Apple is to remove the bezels surrounding the display, providing users with an iPhone that looks almost like a sheet of glass. If Apple kills off the bezel, it will need to find a new place to put the Home button. On which topic, it's believed that Apple is investigating including the fingerprint scanner into the display of a smartphone or tablet. In fact, Apple filed a patent describing a Touch ID display back in January 2013.  This technology means that you could place your finger on the display to scan it, instead of the Home Button. We're not sure if this technology was an original variation to the Home Button scanner found on the iPhone 5s, or if it'll be combined with the Haptics & Tactile technology to remove the Home Button on a future iPhone and replace it with a virtual onscreen button. The Barclays Research report we mentioned earlier also predicts that the iPhone 8 will have a curved screen. This broadly fits in with earlier predictions. Some while back Nikkei predicted that autumn 2017 will see a massive triple iPhone launch, and that the flagship model of this trio will feature a curved OLED screen that curves down over the sides. This is something we've already seen on rival devices, such as Samsung's S7 Edge and Note 7; it enables more screen space to be squeezed on to a device without making it any bigger, and you can also have notifications designed to be seen or activated on the edge of the screen. "There will be a 4.7-inch model, another that will be 5.5-inches and a premium handset that will be either 5.5-inches or larger equipped with a screen bent on the two sides," said Nikkei's source, who was said to be "familiar with Apple's plans". A company named Applied Materials, which already works with Apple, has dropped strong hints about ramping display demand from the company heading towards 2017, and this has been taken as evidence for the iPhone 8 incorporating an OLED screen. "Applied Materials reported an almost fourfold leap in orders for equipment to make displays, an early sign producers are retooling their manufacturing to meet Apple's demand for a new kind of organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, screen," reports Bloomberg. This appeared to be confirmed on 29 October 2016 by Tai Jeng-wu, the president of Sharp, which makes smartphone displays for Apple. Tai, who was speaking to students at his old university, said: "The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS [low-temperature poly-silicon] to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity." The OLED iPhone rumour has been knocking around for a while; in December 2015 it was predicted that OLED would come to the iPhone line in 2018 as a result of a partnership between Apple and Japan Display. Talking of Japan Display... that company uses a new technology that it calls "full active LCD", and some pundits believe that only one of the new iPhones next year will get OLED, while the other(s) have screens based on full-active LCD. The technology, which Japan Display describes as using "a new high-density wiring layout and new processing and module assembly technologies" is capable of making the bottom bezel of an iPhone "as narrow as the other three sides". Japan Display aims to start mass production by the end of March, 2017, according to Fool.com - in time for the iPhone 8 launch, then. iPhone 8 specs: Processor As everyone knows, the iPhones contain proprietary processor chips that you won't find in other smartphones: there's an A9 in the iPhone 6s, and we should get an A10 chip in the iPhone 7, for example. But while these are made to Apple's own design and specifications, several other companies are involved: they contain technology licensed from ARM, and are manufactured, at present, by Samsung and TSMC. But that could change by the time 2018 comes around. Intel has declared its intention of expanding its smartphone business, and is hot favourite to displace TSMC from the iPhone contract, according to the Nikkei Asian Review - an aim that may be more feasible thanks to the company's recently announced partnership with ARM. TSMC's ties with ARM have given it a competitive edge when it comes to securing the contract in the past. "Intel is definitely the most formidable challenger for TSMC," said an anonymous chip-industry executive. "There is no rivalry between Apple and Intel so it's really likely that Apple could shift some orders there. The move is also in line with Washington's policy to encourage US companies to make more products at home." iPhone 8 specs: Camera The iPhone is one of the most widely used cameras in the world. What's in store for this vital element of the iPhone of the future? Lucky iPhone owners of the future may get their hands on a feature currently offered only by premium video cameras. In March 2015 Apple was granted a patent for a "digital camera with light splitter". Its project is to create a light splitter system (which for now exists only in high-end video camera) small enough to fit in an iPhone. In essence, a light splitter system consists of a cube that splits received light into three colours: red, green and blue. The cube provides three image sensors, each of which receives one colour component. In recent iPhones, the camera system is such that its pixels capture the three component colours which end up occupying only a single image sensor; this means that they can fill only one third of the image sensor and colours are not as accurate as they could be. The light splitter system would be a big coup for Apple. Its iPhone would be able to capture high-quality pictures with more precise colours, especially at night. Apple seems to be keen to improve the camera capabilities of its iOS devices, and one patent published by USPTO in May 2014 suggests we could soon see iPhones that are able to capture "Super-resolution" photos thanks to optical image stabilisation, which is already a feature of the iPhone 6 Plus. The patent describes a system that takes a series of photographs at slightly different angles and stitches them together to create a 'super resolution' photograph. Apple doesn't suggest a device would capture every photo this way. Instead, the user would have the option to turn super-resolution mode on, much like HDR and Panorama modes. Several rumours suggest that Apple plans to introduce a feature like this with an iPhone in the near future, with reports pointing to a 'DSLR-quality' capability that would represent the biggest camera jump in iPhone upgrade history. iPhone 8 specs: Battery life One rumour holds that Apple will take the battery developments it deployed in the 12-inch MacBook - whereby contoured, layered battery units are stacked inside the chassis in order to take up every possible inch of space - and use these to squeeze more battery volume inside the iPhone. (According to Wired's write-up, Apple actually claims to adjust its battery contours on a machine-by-machine basis, by photographing the inside of the chassis and modifying the battery stack to fit all the tiny imperfections - which, if it's true, is amazing.) Smartphone battery life is one of those things that everyone says is important, and once again Apple will hear many requests for improved battery life in the iPhone 8 - but you do wonder how much of a compromise the average Apple fan would be willing to make in return. What if, in order to achieve a superb battery life, the iPhone 8 was twice the weight, or cost significantly more? What if the screen was less powerful or the processor scaled back? Mirroring these thoughts somewhat, Jony Ive discussed battery life briefly in an interview with the Financial Times' 'How to spend it' supplement recently. And he gave fairly heavy hints that Apple doesn't think battery life is a high enough priority to make compromises in other areas worth it. "Talking of performance, when the issue of the frequent need to recharge the iPhone is raised, [Ive] answers that it's because it's so light and thin that we use it so much and therefore deplete the battery. With a bigger battery it would be heavier, more cumbersome, less 'compelling'." In December 2015 Apple gave its critics an early Christmas present by unveiling a battery pack for the iPhone 6 and 6s that is, without wishing to be unpleasant and apologies for the language, pretty gosh-darn ugly. (To be fair, we've not yet got our hands on a review sample, so we may be won over by its feel, performance, usability and so on.) In a single surprising step the company put its famed sense of taste and design nous in doubt (coming after the suspect decision to put the charge port for the Magic Mouse 2 on its bottom), and simultaneously reminded everyone that iPhone battery life is generally felt to be subpar. Is this a tacit acknowledgement that battery life is a problem for the iPhone range? Can we therefore expect the iPhone 8 to see improvements in this department as Apple looks for a more full-time and less bulky solution to the issue? We might (battery technology is improving all the time), but this probably isn't the mea culpa some iPhone users were looking for. When discussing the new case, Tim Cook emphasised that it wasn't for everyone (at £80 you'd hope not), and that he felt that even those who did need the case would only use it in relatively extreme scenarios when power wouldn't be available for a long time: when hiking, for example. I would agree that Apple is aware that battery life is a concern for a lot of its customers, but it knew that long before it released its battery pack. And battery life remains a question of compromises, such that increasing it always necessitates either making a device thicker, heavier or more expensive, or choosing not to make it thinner, lighter or cheaper when you could have done. I still believe that most people would rather have a thin, relatively cheap iPhone than a fat, more expensive iPhone with an extra two hours of battery life. And now anyone who would be willing to make that compromise now has an officially sanctioned alternative: spend the extra money, make your phone fatter and uglier, and get the battery pack. In a crazy sort of way, the ugliness of the battery pack almost makes sense as a demonstration of what drastically improved battery life actually looks like. "You want twice the battery life? Even if that means your iPhone has a massive lump on the back? Yeah, DIDN'T THINK SO." iPhone 8 specs: LiFi A boring but important rumour about the iPhone 8's specs relates to LiFi, a new wireless standard that boasts 100x faster download speeds than conventional WiFi connections.

Trump gathered some of the nation's top tech CEOs around a conference table at Trump Tower, using the opportunity to rib the execs and tout a stock boom when he said, 'So right now everybody in this room has to like me – at least a little bit.' Trump added: 'But we're going to try and have that bounce continue.' Cook, who in photographs of the event had a serious expression on his face, provided a lengthy explanation of Apple's engagement in an internal company forum. 'You don’t change things by just yelling,' he wrote, in comments reported by TechCrunch. 'You don’t change things by just yelling,' Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote in an internal company forum when asked about his recent meeting with President-elect Donald Trump Cook ran through several of what he said were the company's top issues with government, then added: 'The way that you advance them is to engage.' 'Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena.' He made his comments in response to a query that only hinted at the question of whether to engage with Trump, something that a variety of CEOs in other sectors are grappling with. Cook hosted a campaign fundraiser for Trump's defeated rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, in August, though he also hosted an event for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. 'Last week you joined other tech leaders to meet President-elect Donald Trump. How important is it for Apple to engage with governments?' was the question Cook responded to.  'We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so,' Cook wrote. He then made the case for interfacing with 'governments' generally, using some of the same arguments U.S. officials make for engagement with China despite its spotty human rights record.

Trump has at times called climate change a 'hoax,' and civil libertarians have blasted his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S.  'We have other things that are more business-centric — like tax reform — and something we’ve long advocated for: a simple system. And we’d like intellectual property reform to try to stop the people suing when they don’t do anything as a company.' Trump is also making tax reform a major priority. President Obama also has called for tax reform, though congressional Democrats fear reform legislation will be used to provide cover for major upper bracket tax reductions.  'Right now everybody in this room has to like me - at least a little bit,' Trump said at the tech roundtable 'So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage,' Cook continued. 'And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.' 'We very much stand up for what we believe in. We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so,' Cook concluded. Apple has some fence-mending to do with Trump. The candidate blasted the company in February as the government was trying to gain access to the cell phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters. 'But to think that Apple won’t allow us to get into her cell phone — who do they think they are?” Trump said. Trump said one of his 'real dreams' was to get Apple to establish manufacturing in the U.S. ' "But they make their product in China. And they have offices here but China makes more money with Apple than we do, if you think about it,' he told Business Insider. 'And we have to bring Apple — and other companies like Apple — back to the United States. We have to do it. And that's one of my real dreams for the country, to get ... them back. We have a great capacity in this country,' Trump said. Responding to this line of argument, Cook said in his statement that creating jobs is 'a key part of what we do' at Apple. 'We’re really proud that we’ve created 2 million jobs, just in this country. A great percentage of those are app developers,' he wrote. 'This gives everyone the power to sell their work to the world, which is an unbelievable invention in and of itself.'     Read more: Apple CEO Tim Cook Hosting Fundraiser for Hillary Clinton Tim Cook On Why He Met With President Elect Trump Share or comment on this article e-mail 31 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Spooky!

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Apple AirPods review: wireless that wows, earbuds that don't If wireless is the future, AirPods will only get some of us there by Sean O'Kane@sokane1 Dec 20, 2016, 10:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Wireless is the future." That’s how Apple CEO Tim Cook justified removing the headphone jack from the newest line of iPhones. You won’t need a headphone jack in the future, Cook argued, because wires will be a thing of the past. To back up that vision, Apple announced four pairs of wireless headphones at this year’s iPhone event. Three were Beats-branded headphones. But it was the fourth that drew the most attention: truly wireless versions of Apple’s EarPods that cost $159, known as AirPods. Now, after a few months of delays, the final production version of AirPods is here, and I’ve finally had a chance to test them out. While I found more to like than I expected, AirPods feel very much like a first draft of that wireless future. One of the first criticisms lobbed at AirPods — even on the day they were announced — was how they seemed too easy to lose. So we have to start with the way AirPods fit, or don’t fit, in your ears. I cannot get them to stay in my ears for long periods of time. This isn’t a new problem for me — I’ve always had a hard time keeping AirPods’ wired predecessors, EarPods, in my ears. It was a side effect of Apple electing a one-size-fits-all, somewhat open-air design for EarPods, instead of designing earbuds that insert and form a full seal in your ears. If you’ve had trouble with EarPods staying in your ears, there’s a good chance you’ll also struggle with AirPods. There are slight differences in the shapes, which you can see when you put them side by side — EarPods are a bit more round and AirPods are slightly more contoured, which makes them a bit more comfortable — and Apple says this means AirPods should fit more ears than EarPods. If EarPods don't fit you, there's a good chance you'll struggle with AirPods That doesn’t mean AirPods stay in my ears, though. They don’t. Every time I wear AirPods it’s a constant battle to keep them in. They don’t fall out immediately, and when I first twist them in I can get what feels like a snug fit. But they inevitably slide out, especially in my right ear. When this happens they wind up dangling on the outer cradle of my ear, where sudden or even not so sudden movements knock them loose. Standing up from my desk, turning my head too fast, chewing through a bag of pretzels, touching down on a runway in an airplane — these are all situations where AirPods popped out of one of my ears because I wasn’t constantly readjusting the fit. Apple says that they’ve tested thousands of ear shapes and they think this design is robust enough to please most people. The Verge’s senior editor Lauren Goode has almost no problem with them — she’s even been able to work out with AirPods with no troubles. But I can't bring myself to be happy with AirPods because of this issue, and I've been looking forward to wireless earbuds for a while. Apple is playing a numbers game here. The company is basically saying it thinks number of people who won’t be able to keep AirPods in their ear is small enough that they don’t need to change the design. And it’s a shame, because despite this problem, there is a lot that I like about AirPods — enough that I might have gotten over how strange they look. For one, AirPods actually sound great, even better than EarPods. Apple claims the audio components are virtually the same between the two products, but there are noticeable differences in the output, especially in the low end. I actually gasped the first time I heard the bass drop in Childish Gambino’s "Me and Your Mama" when using AirPods. The same section didn't sound nearly as dynamic on EarPods. AirPods reproduce music clearly for such tiny earbuds, though that’s provided you can get them to stay in your ear canal; the sound quality was harder to enjoy as the earbuds slid toward the outer part of my ear. AirPods actually sound good Apple also deserves enormous credit for solving the two biggest problems with Bluetooth earbuds, and Bluetooth headphones in general: pairing, and providing a robust connection. This is all thanks to the W1 chip that Apple introduced with AirPods and the two other Beats headphones that were announced in September. W1 makes the initial pairing process with AirPods a breeze — the moment you flip the cap up on the carrying case, a screen pops up on your iPhone asking you to connect. From that point you ostensibly never have to look at the main Bluetooth menu again, because AirPods connect every time you take them out of the case. They’re always visible and accessible in iOS’ Control Center. The W1 chip erases another Bluetooth headphone headache, too, which is using them across multiple devices. Once your AirPods are set up, it’s as easy as tapping on them in Control Center on whichever device you want to use them with, like iPhone, Apple Watch, or iPad. They also are automatically paired with macOS Sierra-equipped laptops. The other thing that W1 does really well is it solves a problem unique to wireless earbuds. It’s hard to sync audio to two earbuds when you don’t have a wire running between them. Every other wireless earbud company starts by sending the audio signal to one earbud over Bluetooth. And it’s this first step that trips up most products — Bluetooth is awful at traveling through your body. This is why many wireless earbuds so far suffer from constant, irritating hiccups in the Bluetooth connection. In most pairs, after establishing that initial connection, the first earbud relays the signal to the other one. But playback on that first earbud doesn’t start until the sync is achieved, which means you wind up dealing with latency of about 30–50 milliseconds. That’s fine for audio, but it means wireless earbuds often aren’t good for videos or games. The W1 chip solves some of Bluetooth's biggest problems Apple took a totally different approach with AirPods. Each AirPod is actually receiving its own Bluetooth channel independently at the same time, and it’s the W1 chip that handles the syncing. The result is very low latency and also a very reliable connection. This is an approach that every other wireless earbud company avoided, and yet Apple found a way to make it work very, very well. W1 is Apple at its best — it’s a proprietary technology that solves real problems, helps open up new use cases, and pushes the industry forward. The trade-off is you just have to submit to some ecosystem lock-in. AirPods lose some of their magic if you use them on Android — pairing and device switching involves the traditional slog through Bluetooth menus, for example. (The earbuds do have optical sensors that pause the music when you take them out, and this works on Android, too.) But the W1 chip is still so good that AirPods were one of the best-performing pairs of wireless earbuds that I’ve tested on an Android device. Perhaps the thing I liked the best about Airpods, though, is the case. I’ve tested a lot of wireless earbuds so far and my biggest takeaway is that they’re only as good as the case they come with. You always need somewhere to stash the earbuds, and it helps if that case also charges them, too. The AirPods case is one of the best around. The earbuds magnetically lock in to the point that you can’t even shake them loose, and it offers an extra day or so of battery life. It’s also small, meaning it fits comfortably in almost any pocket, and it’s also white so you won’t lose track of it in a bag. The ability to constantly charge AirPods is comforting, but the battery life of the AirPods themselves is also fantastic. I got every bit of the five hours Apple promises, and that’s not even considering the fact that you’re almost never going to use these for five hours straight. My typical usage went something like: one or two hours of music playback, which would shave about 10 to 20 percent, and then a quick dip back in case before using them again, where they would be fully charged after only 10 or 15 minutes. AirPods' case is fantastic There are a few things about AirPods that I wanted to like but didn’t, such as Siri. Apple’s not the only company trying to bring AI and other smarts right to our ears, but AirPods are one of the first products to actually make it to the market. Accessing Siri is easy — just double tap one of the earbuds and you summon the digital assistant like a genie. And AirPods do a decent job capturing your queries — that’s part of the reason for the long stems in the first place, to keep the microphones as close to your mouth as possible. But Siri’s inherent limitations — like its often unhelpful answers and inability to handle multiple follow-up questions — ruin the experience. The dream (or nightmare) of the tech from Her is on the horizon, but it’s still very much a dream. Phone calls, at least, work just as well as you would hope. For all their internal tech, I do wish there were more ways to interact with AirPods. I’ve come to love having quick access to volume, play / pause, and track skipping on earbuds like Bragi’s. You can assign the double tap to perform play / pause in the iPhone’s settings menu, and it’s the default on Android. But the only way to adjust the volume using AirPods is to ask (and wait for) Siri to do it for you or pull out your phone. Despite great battery life, wireless performance, and good sound, too much of my time with AirPods was spent fighting to keep them in my ears. I couldn’t stare down a bowl of ramen or navigate a puddle of New York City winter slush without worrying that the earbuds would meet their untimely fate. And at $69 a pop to replace a lost unit, it’s not a problem I’d want to deal with. It’s also a problem I’ve never had with any other wireless earbuds I’ve tested — especially because those companies ship an array of tips or rubber fit sleeves with their products. That might not be the case for you, however. In fact, Apple’s betting it won’t be. So if you share Apple’s wireless dream, and EarPods fit you pretty well, there’s a good chance you’ll like AirPods, too. Just make sure you try them on first.

Apple has been promoting a more environmentally conscious image for the company after having come under fire in the past for constructing its devices so tightly that their components can be difficult to cost-effectively disassemble for recycling. But Apple’s latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analysed other Apple products. Apple’s AirPod headphones available for sale after 2-month delay “They’re basically saying this is the future of headphones,” said Wiens. He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds. Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple’s future. “There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years,” Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling. A spokesperson declined to comment further on recycling the devices. The headphones, which Apple released last week after a one-month delay, have garnered positive reviews. The AirPods contain three lithium-ion batteries, one in each pod and one in an accompanying charging case. Recyclers can shred wired headphones and send them to a smelter that will melt them down for the copper inside. But the lithium-ion batteries in AirPods cannot be shredded because they could catch fire while being destroyed. Tim Cook on why AirPods won’t fall out of your ears The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods’ construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. “I can’t do it by hand. It’s cost prohibitive,” Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that “there’s a relatively high risk of fire”.

The US tech giant said on Monday it formally appealed the EU’s August 30 decision to the bloc’s General Court in Luxembourg, as the European Commission and Ireland separately published details of their own arguments in the case. The EU "took unilateral action and retroactively changed the rules, disregarding decades of Irish tax law, US tax law, as well as global consensus on tax policy, that everyone has relied on", Apple said in a statement after filing its court appeal. In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multibillion-euro bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company’s effective corporate tax rate. The US Treasury said the EU was making itself a "supranational tax authority" that could threaten global tax reform efforts. Priority status Apple’s appeal adds to the Irish government’s challenge, already submitted to the EU court, which has given the case priority status. In its own filing on Monday, the Brussels-based commission published details of its two-year probe, attacking the way Irish authorities taxed profits attributed to two of Apple’s Irish units. The EU also took aim at Irish tax practices, saying they were "too inconsistent" to set firm rules for profit allocation. The Apple investigation — and others probing arrangements for Amazon.com and McDonald’s in Luxembourg — are the cornerstone of an EU attack on national practices officials claim help multinational companies avoid tax. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has repeatedly argued that special tax treatment harms companies that don’t get such advantages. But according to the details revealed on Monday, EU regulators shrugged off claims that they weren’t fair to Ireland and Apple during the probe. They argued they always respected their procedural rights and the subject matter of the investigation — profit allocation methods used in tax rulings — never changed. Ireland had "ample opportunity" to express its views and "made use of that opportunity on multiple occasions", the EU said. While Apple only had the right to submit observations, it "was given and has effectively made use of the opportunity to submit" views to regulators on numerous occasions, according to the text of the EU decision.

Ireland accepted the "unsubstantiated assumption" that Apple’s intellectual property licences shouldn’t be allocated to the Irish units, the EU said, adding there’s no evidence that tax authorities analysed a key unit’s access to the IP. The Irish units played important roles in Apple, regulators said. For example, Apple Sales International’s Irish branch was responsible for gathering and analysing regional data to estimate expected demand for Apple products. It was also responsible for operating the AppleCare customer support service in the region, according to the investigators. Exceeded powers Apple argues that the company’s main research operations are in the US and this is where its profits should be taxed. Should the EU’s calculations stand, Apple would pay 40% of all the corporate income tax collected in Ireland "which is unprecedented and, far from levelling the playing field, selectively targets Apple", the company said. Ireland considers that the EU exceeded its powers by ruling on its tax jurisdiction, according to an Irish finance ministry statement on Monday. Ireland also challenges the EU’s determination that Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were "head offices" not subject to tax by virtue of their tax status in Ireland. Apple argues the units, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, were never exempt from tax — and that under the law they are subject to deferred US tax. "These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the US, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE," the Irish finance ministry said. While an EU press release in August said Apple paid only 0.005% effective tax on European profits in 2014, Apple has said the figure is misleading — referring only to tax payments by the ASI unit, ignoring other tax paid by the company in Ireland and elsewhere and measured as a portion of what the EU alleges is taxable income. Making a statement "From my vantage point, Apple availed of a tax structure in Ireland that was available to anyone, they got no special treatment," said Robert Willens, an adjunct professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School in New York. "I believe ultimately Apple and Ireland will prevail. To me, it looks like the EU is trying to make a statement with this case." The EU court appeals filed by Apple and Ireland follow those already pending by Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium concerning tax arrangements the nations granted to units of other multinationals, including Starbucks. Ireland has provided more than 300 tax rulings to EU investigators who are sifting through more than 1,000 such documents on more than 300 companies. Apple and Ireland are still working to determine the exact amount of tax due, which may be paid within weeks. The money will be held in escrow until a final ruling from the EU courts, which may take several years. Bloomberg Please login or register to comment.

Revealed alongside the iPhone 7, the fully-wireless earbuds were intended to salve the pain of losing the headphone jack. Unforeseen delays meant that didn’t quite go to plan, but now the AirPods are finally here, do they really deliver the best wire-free experience on the market? Honestly, I’ve never had success with Apple’s headphones. The original round earbuds, that were supplied up until the iPhone 4S, pretty much fell out of my ears right after I put them in. The EarPods, which promised a more ergonomic design from the iPhone 5 onward, are okay as long as I don’t want to move my head, or walk, or generally do anything but sit motionless while I listen to music. I’m not placing all the blame at Apple’s collective feet, mind: I have issues with most generic earbuds. My solution has been either custom-molds, which are expensive and usually not wireless, or over-the-ear headphones. There, my current go-to set has been Plantronics’ BackBeat Pro 2. All of that is to say, I wasn’t especially hopeful when I tried the AirPods. Happily, I’ve actually had better luck with them than expected. I suspect it’s a combination of the lack of a cord weighing them down, and the overall light weight: each AirPod is 4 grams. They’ve stayed in place while I’ve power-walked through airports, and though more aggressive head-shaking was enough to send one flying, I don’t think that’s any worse than what another wireless in-ear bud would suffer. Apple’s aesthetics are love-it-or-hate-it. The AirPods really do look like EarPods with the cords snipped off, and the result is a strange little L-shape of glossy white plastic that protrudes down an inch or so. Combined with the shiny metal tip – actually the charging contacts for when each AirPod is tucked safely in their case – and they’re fairly noticeable unless you have long hair or a hat to cover them up; one person thought I was wearing earrings at first glance, because of the way they catch the light. Personally, I’d be mighty surprised if Apple wasn’t already thinking about a Jet Black set for 2017. As well as fitting with the iPhone 7‘s color-du-jour, that would be a lot more discrete, too. Either way, expect the charging case – which is similar in size to a floss dispenser – to become a go-to tchotchke when your hands need something to fiddle with, since the snap-open lid is deeply tactile. One of the absolute strengths of Apple’s system – and its custom Apple W1 chip – is the ease of pairing and generally using the AirPods. To connect them to an iPhone, you open the case while it’s nearby: a dialog showing battery status pops up, with a button to connect. From that point on, every device logged into the same Apple ID, barring the Apple TV, should automatically have the AirPods paired too. They reconnect automatically when you open the case and pop one or both AirPods in your ears. A pop-up on iOS shows battery status of each earbud individually, plus that of the battery in the case itself. If you have an Apple Watch, they’ll also connect to that simultaneously, and audio switches between the two automatically. On macOS, meanwhile, you can reconnect to the AirPods from the Bluetooth menu. If you’re an Apple TV user, you’ll have to pair them manually, as with any other non-Apple, Bluetooth-enabled device. That involves pressing the nondescript button on the back of the AirPods case until the LED inside glows white, then searching on whatever device you’re trying to use them with. I like how Apple manages playback and connections, at least on iOS or watchOS. If you have one AirPod in, you get music in mono; add the second, and it switches to stereo. Take an AirPod out, and it’ll pause your music; put it back in, and it’ll resume. For calls, you can just use one AirPod; if the battery runs out, I was able to swap the earbuds over without dropping the call or even interrupting my conversation. It’s worth noting that, currently, macOS doesn’t do the same auto-pausing if you’re listening to music from your MacBook. Anything more complex relies on Siri, and here I started to have a few issues. There are no physical controls; no buttons for volume or play/pause, for instance. Instead, you double-tap either of the AirPods and make your request to Apple’s virtual assistant. Asking to change volume, or skip back and forth through tracks, left me feeling somewhat self-conscious. Yes, it means you don’t need to remember different sequences of taps or swipes as other headsets demand, but without support for a “Hey Siri” trigger phrase it’s not like you can interact entirely hands-free. In the settings there’s the option to switch the double-tap trigger to play/pause and bypass Siri altogether, but then you have to do everything else from your iPhone, Mac, or Apple Watch. On the plus side, Siri did better picking up my instructions than when speaking to my iPhone 7, though functionally it has the same limitations as to what it can do. That means Apple Music has better integration than, say, Spotify. With Apple’s own service, you can ask for a specific artist or track, but third-party apps don’t get the same capabilities. It’s also not especially set up for audio-only use: most of the time, if you ask a question more complex than a simple sum or the time in another country, you’ll be directed to the phone’s screen for the answer. I’d have preferred something more akin to Alexa in my ear. My biggest problem came when I was in airplane mode, though. I usually have my earphones on while flying, but Siri is entirely reliant on a data connection; without that, you get no control over music, volume, or anything else. Apple really needs a pared-back offline mode to handle the basics with local processing. Another software feature I’d like to see added is a “Find my AirPods” alarm. You’re likely to drop them or misplace them at least once; they’re small enough that you could put one down on a coffee shop table and walk away from it without realizing. The ability to trigger a loud noise to relocate them, or get a warning on your iPhone if you’re walking away from them, would seem an obvious improvement. Apple will sell you a replacement for $69. As for audio quality, you shouldn’t expect a noticeable improvement over the regular EarPods that came free with your iPhone. I switched between EarPods and AirPods with a variety of music and found no real difference in sound; bass in particular can be a little lacking, given the absence of a tight seal between ear and bud, though a judicious prod once in a while can improve matters before they gradually shift again over time. In short, the AirPods are not bad, certainly, but if you’re spending $159 in the hope of a boost in how good your music sounds, you’ll probably be better off putting that toward a set of high-end wired headphones instead. Apple quotes more than 24 hours of battery life when listening to music in stereo, or up to 11 hours of talktime. That will require periodic recharging of the individual AirPods in the charging case, mind: each AirPod is rated for up to five hours of listening or up to two hours of talktime. Fifteen minutes back in the case should give them enough juice for a further three hours of music or more than an hour of talking. In practice, I found I could go around 4 hours 20 minutes before I needed to recharge the AirPods. That’s mighty impressive given the size, even if it didn’t quite reach Apple’s own estimate. Going from flat to 100-percent in the case took about half an hour. Unsurprisingly you can’t change the battery yourself; Apple will charge you $49 for each AirPod or the charging case to do that. Range turned out to be solid: I was able to leave my iPhone on the desk and walk into the adjacent room without dropping a call. Though the microphones are positioned right up near the top of your jawline I had no issues with callers being able to hear me; the fancy things Apple is doing with beam-forming work well, and even over the sound of a car engine or in a crowded shopping center, I was audible and clear. Apple’s vision of a wireless ecosystem hasn’t exactly had the smooth roll-out it might have hoped for. After the furore around the iPhone 7 losing a headphone jack, combined with the later-than-expected release of the AirPods, what was always going to be a challenging transition has proved a little more fraught. Even with the AirPods arriving before then end of the year, limited supplies mean many people won’t be unwrapping them this holiday season. Still, I find myself surprised with how much I like them. The fit still isn’t perfect, though your experience there will undoubtedly differ to mine, since no ear is the same. A silicone rubber sleeve on the end would make a huge difference there, as well as to the sound-seal. And even with the frustrations of Siri being so central to the control experience, the fundamentals of Apple’s straightforward pairing, audio management, battery life, and charging clearly show the refinement and attention to detail which the company is notorious for. NOW READ: iPhone 7 Review For the moment, AirPods offer the cleanest and most polished integration with your iPhone of any headphones out there. Whether that will change with the arrival of Bluetooth 5.0 next year remains to be seen. Nonetheless, assuming you can find them in stock, and that you don’t mind talking to Siri rather than tapping buttons, the AirPods deliver on Apple’s promise of effortless use day-to-day.

They were delayed for several weeks before finally being released a few days back. Apple is now selling AirPods in its retail stores as well. If you buy one of these $159 earbuds, keep in mind that you won’t be able to repair them on your own, because the AirPods teardown confirms they are not easy to repair at all. The good folks over at iFixit have performed an AirPods teardown which confirms that taking them apart is not an option should anything go wrong with the earbuds. You will definitely end up destroying this $159 product which isn’t exactly cheap by any stretch of the imagination. There are several tiny components inside the plastic shell of the AirPods and the entire contraption is sealed with “a copious amount of glue,” which means that there’s a good chance you’ll end up damaging something if you try to have your way with the glue that keeps it all tucked in nicely. On a scale of 0 to 10 with the latter being the easiest to repair, the AirPods have been assigned a repairability score of 0. iFixit notes that accessing any component inside the case is “impossible without destroying the outer casing,” so you better not try and fix them on your own should something ever go wrong with your AirPods.

That product didn’t receive glowing reviews over the last year, but when the company announced a less expensive and refined version with The Headphone, it looked like it could be a true competitor to Apple’s wireless AirPods. But the AirPods officially launched last week and are arriving to customers this week, and now Bragi is announcing a delay to its product that was supposed to ship for the earliest pre-order customers in time for Christmas. The product’s estimated shipping date was later pushed back to early January, but it looks like Bragi will miss that date for some pre-orders as well. In an email to customers, the company says it doesn’t have “enough to fulfill all pre-orders.” Hello Bragi friends, Unfortunately, this email is not the Christmas message we wanted to send… The Headphone did start its shipping journey from Asia last week. The first Headphones are on their way, but not enough to fulfill all pre-orders… All of us at Bragi were excited by this milestone, but incredibly disappointed that we couldn’t fulfill all orders. The reason? Bragi is finding manufacturing the products at scale more difficult than it anticipated: “…our production team has been building headphones at a slower speed than expected. Building The Headphone is a precision process with very tight tolerances both physically and electronically. As long as we do not consistently hit those tolerances, the production cadence cannot and should not be increased to maintain the quality.” To make up for the delay, Bragi is offering an extension of 30 days for the sales return warranty for pre-orders made in 2016. As consolation, the company also put together a PDF that you can print out and leave under the tree if you want your friends and family to hate you. In our review, we actually found The Headphone to be a decent cord-free earbud experience and one of the best yet prior to the AirPods launch. It’s harder to recommend them now that AirPods are out at almost the same price point with overall a more solid experience (in-depth comparison coming soon). While Apple finally launched its AirPods last week following delays from a launch originally planned for late October, it also delayed its new BeatsX wireless earphones into February. A specific reason for the delay wasn’t given, but it’s possible it could be related to supplies of the Apple-designed W1 chip for fast pairing, switching, and maintaining a reliable connection that both the BeatsX and AirPods use. As of writing, Bragi’s website still lists “early January” for orders placed as of December 1st, but doesn’t otherwise specify when new orders will be shipped out. The company’s memo to customers says it should be able to fulfill all orders in 6 days once it works out kinks in manufacturing, but it doesn’t estimate how long that might take. blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Apple, which runs its European business out of Ireland, was hit with the order in August after a three-year investigation into the iPhone-maker’s tax dealings in Europe, a decision the company said it would also appeal. The European Commission (EC), the executive branch of the EU, claimed Ireland had given Apple unfair tax advantages as it conducted its business in Europe through two fully-owned companies, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, with most profits allocated to a “head office” with not physical location. The country was charging Apple for its business in Ireland, not profits across Europe, with a 1 percent tax rate in 2003 and later a rate as low as 0.005 percent in 2014, according to the commission. Ireland published arguments Monday saying that the EC was attempting to “rewrite the Irish corporation tax rules” and it would appeal to overturn the decision. The department of finance said “all important decisions” from the Cupertino, California-based company’s two branches were made in the U.S. and any “profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable” to ASI and AOE. “Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple – the full amount of tax was paid in this case and no State aid was provided.  Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers,” said a statement from Ireland’s department of finance.

It was a marketing desire to hit the crucial holiday season that led to a design which compromised battery life in the new MacBook Pro, claimed one source … Apple engineers wanted to use higher capacity battery packs shaped to the insides of the laptop versus the standard square cells found in most machines. The design would have boosted battery life. In the run-up to the MacBook Pro’s planned debut this year, the new battery failed a key test, according to a person familiar with the situation. Rather than delay the launch and risk missing the crucial holiday shopping season, Apple decided to revert to an older design. The same tension between marketing and engineering also led to compromises in the design of the 12-inch MacBook. For a 2016 MacBook update, some Apple engineers wanted to add a Touch ID fingerprint scanner and a second USB-C port (which would have made some power users happy). The update instead included a new rose gold color option alongside a standard speed increase. A less single-minded approach also requires engineers to work on two different approaches to new product designs, diluting their efforts. When the company was developing the first 12-inch MacBook, Apple tested two primary prototypes. One, known internally as Stealth Fighter, was lighter. The second, a slightly less ambitious design known as Stealth Bomber, was heavier. The lighter model prevailed, but with engineers developing and testing two competing concepts, they had less time to figure out how to cram all the electronics into a thin slab of aluminum that would hold together. In the end, Apple shipped the laptop in 2015, months after its 2014 goal. Additionally, political issues have hampered development of the Mac Pro line, the piece suggests. Apple was keen to have the machine be built in the USA, which posed production challenges. Apple had to make its own manufacturing tools and then train people to run those machines in an assembly plant. This slowed production and constrained Apple’s ability to make enough computers to meet demand […] Because of the earlier challenges, some Apple engineers have raised the possibility of moving production back to Asia, where it’s cheaper and manufacturers have the required skills for ambitious products [but] the political environment is tougher for such a move now.  The piece also reports that Apple is at least exploring the possibility of a standalone keyboard with the Touch Bar and Touch ID button currently exclusive to the latest MacBook Pro models. Finally, the piece says we shouldn’t expect too much on the Mac front next year. Mac fans shouldn’t hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro.

Using more of the wired broadband data tier you've paid for? all ;) More seriously: there's some utility here for multi-TV households where the owner doesn't want to lease a box for every TV. Hook up an :apple:TV to those TVs and you can watch some stuff without having a cable box. Rating: 2 Votes Larry The L 2 weeks ago What app?

Also just because you think it is junk does not make it so. I love the new TV app very nice to have all the shows I'm watching show up in one spot across multiple apps. The only thing mine shows is HBO and iTunes store stuff. I think it's pretty crippled if it doesn't support Netflix and the Directv Now, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox apps.

Apple's wireless AirPods have finally arrived but can they make cord-cutting come of age? By James Billington December 20, 2016 16:09 GMT Apple AirPods review: Wireless wonders or same old Apple beat?Apple Apple's first foray into the world of wireless audio has finally arrived months after upsetting the consumer electronics cart by killing off the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Its AirPods were supposed to be the answer to what Apple believes is a future without wires, making the move easier as it attempts to make cord cutting come-of-age. Apple's headphone effort to-date has been an audiophile's teeth-clenching nightmare. The free bundled earphones with iPhones and iPads have been poor-fitting audio lightweights in a market where mobile users are investing heavily in their music. But when the AirPods were unveiled, we were, for the first time, excited to hear what Apple had in store – could this finally be the audio upgrade we've been waiting for? When Apple say wireless, they really mean it. Unlike other "wireless" in ear headphones on the market, the AirPods literally do not have a single cable or dangly bit of cord to tuck around your neck. They are simply a pair of earbuds, no extraneous bits and the simplicity had us falling in love early. Apple AirPod review: How to setup and pair Straight out of the box, the AirPods are hands-down the easiest and quickest set of wireless headphones we've paired. They're an absolute dream. Just flip open the lid of the charging case and our iPhone detected them instantly. Okay, pairing other Bluetooth headsets doesn't take aeons but the AirPod setup was incredibly smooth. We'd recommend being on the latest version of iOS 10, however, as we struggled to get connected when trying to pair with a device running an older version. Setup and pairing was a breezeIBTimes UK If you don't have an iOS device, you're not excluded from the AirPod party as a pairing button on the charging case allows link-up to the likes of Mac computers and Android phones, just as you would via ordinary Bluetooth sets. Read more: The 10 best Bluetooth headphones you can buy The little charging case, which is about the size of a pack of dental floss, neatly holds the AirPods in place magnetically and will give them enough juice for about 4-5 hours of use, approximately two hours talk time, and can be charged again via lightning connection. Pop the AirPods out and they're identical in looks to the EarPods. They're a shade heavier (but barely noticeable) as there's the W1 chip, microphone, accelerometer and optical sensor inside. Pop them in your ears and rather smartly the AirPods will use the optical sensor to know they're lodged in your lugholes, automatically pausing when you pull one out. Another neat trick is the ability to sense if you're only using one AirPod and then channel all stereo sound through it, so you don't lose any audio. It's little touches like this that hold great appeal and set the AirPods apart from rivals. Built-in optical sensors can detect when they're in your ears.IBTimes UK Apple AirPods review: Sound quality Let's cut straight to the chorus: the big question here is do you get a greater audio experience for your £160 considering you get a pair of EarPods bundled with your iPhone? The hard truth is no. You'd be hard-pushed to find any noticeable upgrade in any areas of audio performance. We pumped everything from classical tracks to bass-heavy beats and acapella through both the EarPods and AirPods to test their entire range and found a familiar affair. If you're looking for that much-needed audio upgrade you'll be sadly disappointed. That said the audio they do produce, like the EarPods which most iPhone owners will know, isn't wholly bad. They struggle able to pick out the finest of detail in the high-end especially at low volumes but there's a decent amount of meat on the bones through the mids and a fairly appeasing, if slightly overblown, grumbling bass – yet they could be so much more. Apple AirPods review: Design The problem is it's still coming through a design that fails to provide a plugging fit, like that found on silicone-tipped earphones that block out outside noise and prevents sound leak – a frustrating trait of Apple earphones. Considering the anticipation and price of the AirPods we were hoping the shape would be re-imagined when they were revealed back in September – something the EarPods have been in need of for years. But they still adopt the flawed one-size-fits-all approach, we all don't have the same size ear cavities. Without a proper fit we found loud outside noise, such as traffic and Tube journeys easily ended up drowning out audio. Likewise, without a proper fit we were constantly aware of leak annoying those around us with our (admittedly terrible) tunes. But beyond the audio quality, it's the wireless factor that is going to be the biggest appeal of the AirPods, particularly for doing exercise without being whipped by a wire. We put all this to the test including running, bounding upstairs, leaning over to pick things off the floor (that's exercise, right?) and they didn't give us any wiggle worries. But, when things got more high-tempo and ears sweaty there was nothing to stop the slightest knock sending them flying into the nearest puddle, leaving us constantly nervous because losing one of your AirPods will set you back £65 for a replacement. 1 of 3 No strings on me: Each AirPod can work independently - great for sharing music.IBTimes UK No strings on me: Each AirPod can work independently - great for sharing music.IBTimes UK Microphones at the base are great for hands-free calls, but you'll miss that in-line control. IBTimes UK The case doubles up as a charging station and will provide a 3-hour boost of battery for the AirPods in just 15 minutes.IBTimes UK Another huge downside of going wireless is the loss of the in-line remote to control volume and skip tracks. Users instead have to double-tap the side of either earbud and command Siri, which is far from ideal. We found ourselves reaching into our pockets to control music much more than we did before, to avoid blurting out Siri instructions in public. However, the AirPods are more than just music makers. With a built-in microphone they become a great Bluetooth headset for hands-free calls, coming in particularly handy while driving. With the microphone nearer the mouth our calls were much clearer and with Siri access baked-in we also found ourselves using the oft-forgotten digital assistant a lot more than usual (but in the privacy of our homes). We also found they were great for anyone who likes to share music listening with a friend as you can have an ear each without garotting yourself on a cable. Apple AirPods review: Verdict Our verdict Apple AirPods If you're looking for truly wireless in ear headphone connectivity, nothing holds a flame to the AirPods – theses are the best you can buy. The total banishment of wires completely exposes the shackled experience of a wired connection, they are effortless to use and beautifully presented – something that ticks every Apple fan's mantra. But that's really the only reason you'd want to shell out £160 for them. With no audio upgrade or design change from the EarPods plus a clutch of irritations that arise from losing the in-line controls it's a lot of money for the privilege of going without wires. If, however, you have no problems with the EarPod audio quality and are looking for the best tether-less, faff-free earphones, these will be a smash hit.

Ireland The European Commission exceeded its powers and interfered with national tax sovereignty, Ireland has argued in seeking to overturn a ruling that it must recover up to €13 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple before the EU's General Court.20 Dec 2016 Corporate tax EU and UK competition law EU & Competition Tax State aid Tax Disputes and Investigations International tax UK Europe Germany France However, Heather Self, a tax specialist at Pinsent Masons, the law firm behind Out-Law.com, said apparent deficiencies in the practices deployed by Ireland's tax authority would make it more challenging for the country and the company to win an annulment of the Commission's "bold decision". Ireland and Apple both published their own legal arguments as the Commission published its full decision on the case this week. The Commission said in August that Ireland must recover the unpaid taxes from Apple after it concluded that the country granted undue tax benefits to Apple between 2003 and 2014. "This is illegal under EU state aid rules, because it allowed Apple to pay substantially less tax than other businesses. Ireland must now recover the illegal aid," the Commission said at the time. However, the Irish government said that the Commission has "misunderstood the relevant facts and Irish law". "Ireland did not give favourable tax treatment to Apple - the full amount of tax was paid in this case and no state aid was provided. Ireland does not do deals with taxpayers," it said. Self said: "Overall this is a bold decision by the Commission helped by poor facts and poor practice on the part of both Apple and Ireland." The Commission's decision followed a three year investigation into two rulings issued by Ireland in favour of two Apple group companies: Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE). These companies were both incorporated in Ireland and, although they did not have any taxable presence in the US or any other tax jurisdiction, they were not treated as Irish tax resident because Irish law at the time regarded them as US tax resident. The Irish law has since been amended and Apple has now changed its operating structure. The tax rulings concerned the method of allocation of profit to the Irish branches of these companies. The rulings meant that almost all of the sales profits recorded by the two companies were internally attributed to a head office of ASI that the Commission said, in a statement issued in August, "existed only on paper and could not have generated such profits". The profits allocated to the head office were not subject to tax in any country and as a result, the Commission said Apple only paid an effective tax rate of between 0.005% and 1%. "The Commission is bold in looking beyond Ireland and questioning whether the US head office has any substance," Self said. "Apple was very aggressive in allocating entrepreneurial profit to 'stateless' entities, so the profits were apparently not taxed anywhere." In its full decision published this week, the Commission observed that no profit allocation or transfer pricing report prepared by Apple was available to Irish Revenue when examining the ruling requests. It said that it was only after the Commission adopted its opening decision that Ireland and Apple each produced "ad hoc profit allocation reports to justify the profit allocation methods endorsed by the contested tax rulings" after the event. "Ireland's ruling practice appears to have been extremely relaxed," Self said. "The absence of a formal transfer pricing study is very surprising and does not help Apple or Ireland's arguments." The Commission said that the acceptance by the Irish Revenue authorities of operating expense as a profit level indicator in the profit allocation methods endorsed by the rulings, instead of sales for ASI’s Irish branch and total costs for AOE’s Irish branch, "inappropriately" lowered the annual taxable profit of both companies compared with independent companies operating at arm's length. It therefore constituted a "selective advantage", it said. The Commission said that the tax ruling "appear[ed] to have been arrived at through negotiation and to have depended on employment considerations". It said that if a tax administration had broad discretion to determine the beneficiaries or the conditions under which tax relief was granted on the basis of criteria unrelated to the tax system, such as employment considerations, the exercise of that discretion must be regarded as giving rise to a selective advantage. "No consistent criteria are applied to determine the allocation of profits to Irish branches of non-resident companies" by the Irish Revenue, the decision said. "The Commission has no competence, under state aid rules, unilaterally to substitute its own view of the geographic scope and extent of the member state's tax jurisdiction for those of the member state itself," the Irish government said in a statement. "The purpose of the state aid rules is to tackle state interventions which confer a selective advantage. The state aid rules by their nature cannot remedy mismatches between tax systems on a global level," Ireland said. Apple issued its own statement in which it said that it has been singled out as a "convenient target". "Because our products and services are created, designed and engineered in the US, that's where we pay most of our tax... this case has never been about how much tax Apple pays, it's about where that tax is paid," Apple said. The European Commission does not have direct authority over national direct tax systems. However, under EU rules it is unlawful for any EU country to give financial help to selected companies in a way which would distort fair competition. If a tax ruling contravenes market principles so as to confer a selective advantage, it could be considered to be state aid. In June 2014 the European Commission announced in-depth investigations into whether tax rulings issued to Apple by Ireland, Starbucks by the Netherlands and Fiat Finance and Trade by Luxembourg amounted to "unjustifiable" state aid. In October 2014 a similar investigation was announced into Amazon in Luxembourg and in December 2015 an investigation was launched into 'double non-taxation' of McDonalds in Luxembourg. In October 2015 it decided that the rulings provided to Fiat and Starbucks constituted unlawful state aid and that the countries would have to recover €20-to-€30 million from each company to claw back the benefits of the state aid received. The Amazon and McDonald's investigations are continuing.  More from Out-Law.com Ireland gave illegal state benefits worth up to €13 billion to Apple, says EU 30 Aug 2016 Tweet Latest Corporate tax News & Guides UK interest deduction restrictions on banks not as OECD recommends, says expert 22 Dec 2016 EU court rulings a 'real disappointment' to multinationals in state aid cases, says expert 21 Dec 2016 Commission refers France to CJEU over taxation of dividends 12 Dec 2016 Guide: Patent Box Regime (entrants on or after 1 July 2016) Guide: Common Reporting Standard Join My Out-Law See only the content that matters to you Tailor Out-Law to your exact needs Save the most useful content for later reading Tailor our weekly eNewsletter to your interests Join My Out-Law Already signed up to My Out-Law?

Water dunks? The AirPods seem to be practically indestructible Chris Smith BGR NewsDecember 20, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Apple’s AirPods are already a hit. They sold out almost immediately after Apple started taking preorders last week, and people even lined up in front of Apple retail stores on Monday to buy them. Users seem to be happy with Apple’s first pair of truly wireless headphones, according to various online reviews. But how durable are the AirPods? After all, Apple already has programs in place meant to deal with battery issues and other problems, hinting that you might run into some troubles with your AirPods down the road. Don't Miss: How a smartphone backdoor can be used to spy on absolutely everything you do Unofficial tests performed by users who purchased the new Apple headphones seem to indicate the AirPods are practically indestructible. As 9to5Mac reports, the AirPods have survived everything that’s been thrown at them. The AirPods still work after being dropped from 10 feet, and after being submerged in water. They work even after they’ve gone through a full washing machine cycle. After all, that’s one likely scenario for any pair of headphones, not just the AirPods. It’s YouTube channel EverythingApplePro that performed the all of tests mentioned above, recording everything on video. The AirPods were dropped from various heights, both on their own, and in their protective case, and they’re still able to offer the same sound experience as before the experiments were conducted. Mind you, these are not scientific tests. But what matters is that the AirPods will take quite a beating before failing. This doesn’t mean you should be careless with your AirPods, or that your pair will survive any abuse such as water torture. However, the tests seem to indicate the AirPods won’t break as easily as some people might expect them to. Check out the AirPods drop and water tests in the video below.

Apple has been promoting a more environmentally conscious image for the company after having come under fire in the past for constructing its devices so tightly that their components can be difficult to cost-effectively disassemble for recycling. But Apple's latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products. Apple's latest 4-gram wireless headphones, or AirPods, have glued-in tiny lithium batteries that make recycling difficult, said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, the company which took apart the AirPods and has previously analyzed other Apple products HOW TO GET THEM   Last week, Apple confirmed that the AirPods would hit the shops this week. The $159 (£159) wireless earphones are now available to buy online with Apple vowing to start deliveries. The earphones, which were originally scheduled to go on sale in October, will also land in Apple Stores and other selected retailers at this time. 'They're basically saying this is the future of headphones,' said Wiens.  He estimates Apple has sold 1.4 billion pairs of iPhone and iPod headphones, weighing about 31 million pounds.  Given that the iPhone 7 ships without a traditional headphone jack, AirPods may signal Apple's future. 'There could easily be a billion of these things over the next 10 years,' Wiens said. Apple has said that the $159 AirPods can be returned to the company for recycling.  A spokesman declined to comment further on recycling the devices.

The AirPods carry regulatory markings that say they are not intended to be thrown away in the trash and should be disposed of as electronics waste. Willie Cade, CEO of Chicago-based PC Rebuilders & Recyclers, who was briefed on the AirPods' construction by iFixit, said the labor involved in removing the batteries would make it hard to cost-effectively recover any of the materials from the devices. 'I can't do it by hand. It's cost prohibitive,' Cade said, adding that the AirPods would need to go into a shredder, but that 'there's a relatively high risk of fire'.

Today’s Top Headlines » South Korea Plans Tax Changes To Boost Growth » Switzerland Need Not Hike Taxes Drastically, Says IMF » Taiwan's VAT On Online Retailers Becomes Law » Slower Economic Growth To Dent UK Finances » No Tax On Second Houses In Vietnam In 2017 European Commission Publishes Final Decision In Apple Case by Jason Gorringe, Tax-News.com, London 20 December 2016 The European Commission has published its final decision on two tax rulings granted by Ireland to Apple, in which it explains why it concluded that these measures constituted illegal state aid. The decision concerns two Opinions issued by the Irish Revenue on January 29, 1991, and May 23, 2007, to Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE). The rulings concern the method by which ASI and AOE allocate profit to their respective Irish branches. The 1991 ruling was in force until 2007, when it was replaced by the 2007 ruling. The 2007 ruling was in force until Apple's new corporate structure in Ireland was put into place. According to Article 107(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, any aid granted by a member state or through state resources that distorts or threatens to distort competition is incompatible with the internal market. The Commission explained that for a measure to be categorized as state aid, there must be an intervention by a state or through state resources, which is liable to affect trade between member states and confers a selective advantage on an undertaking, and must distort or threaten to distort competition. In assessing the rulings' compatibility with this criteria, Commission noted that the contested rulings were issued by Irish Revenue and used by ASI and AOE to calculate their yearly corporation tax liability in Ireland. "The contested tax rulings are therefore imputable to Ireland," it said. The Commission also stated that the Court of Justice holds that "a measure by which the public authorities grant certain undertakings a tax exemption which, although not involving a positive transfer of state resources, places the persons to whom it applies in a more favorable financial situation than other taxpayers constitutes state aid." According to the Commission, the contested rulings lowered ASI's and AOE's tax liability in Ireland "by deviating from the tax that those undertakings would otherwise have been obliged to pay under the ordinary rules of taxation of corporate profit in Ireland." The Commission added that, to the extent that the rulings relieved ASI and AOE of a tax liability they would otherwise have been obliged to pay, "the aid granted under those rulings constitutes operating aid," by relieving them from a charge "they would normally have had to bear in their day-to-day management or normal activities." It argued that, in turn, these rulings freed up resources for ASI and AOE to invest in their business operations, thereby distorting competition in the market. The Commission further determined that the rulings had conferred an economic advantage on ASI and AOE by reducing their "annual taxable profits, and thus their taxable bases." EU regulations stipulate that the Commission is obliged to recover unlawful and incompatible aid, and that the member state concerned must take all necessary steps in this process. The power of the Commission to recover aid is subject to a limitation period of 10 years. The Commission said that, in this case, recovery should include aid granted from June 12, 2003, onwards and, since according to Apple the 2014 fiscal year is the last in which the 2007 ruling was applied by ASI and AOE to calculate their taxable profit in Ireland, should continue until September 27, 2014, the date on which their financial year ended. The Commission concluded that all profits from the business activities of ASI and AOE should be allocated to their respective Irish branches for the period June 12, 2003, to September 27, 2014, "for the purposes of calculating ASI's and AOE's corporation tax liability under the ordinary rules of taxation of corporate profit in Ireland." Interest income from property of the Irish branches should also be allocated to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. The Commission said that Apple may claim deductions for certain interest and investment income attributable to ASI's and AOE's head offices, capital allowances under the 1991 ruling, and the profits of AOE's Singapore branch that were subject to taxation in Singapore. It added that the trading profits to be subjected to taxation in Ireland may also be adjusted following "an effective restatement of the statutory accounts or tax returns of ASI and AOE following corresponding payments and adjustments to the statutory accounts of other Apple group companies." The Irish Government this week published the legal grounds on which it has appealed the Commission's decision. It said that the Opinions simply applied Section 25 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, "which in accordance with the territoriality principle, taxes only the profits attributable to the branch, not the non-Irish profits of the company." The Government emphasized that while the Irish branches of ASI and AOE carried out routine functions, all important decisions were made in the US, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches. It also argued that the Opinions did not depart from "normal" taxation, because ASI and AOE did not pay any less tax than was due under Section 25. The US Treasury has responded to the Commission's publication. A spokesperson stated: "Treasury has reviewed the European Commission's decision against Apple. We continue to believe the Commission is retroactively applying a sweeping new state aid theory that is contrary to well-established legal principles, calls into question the tax rules of individual countries, and threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe. Moreover, it threatens to erode America's corporate tax base." "To be clear, we agree that tax avoidance is a serious problem around the world. We are committed to continuing to work with the Commission and other international partners, such as through the OECD, toward our shared objective of preventing the erosion of our corporate tax bases." Commenting on the latest developments, the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland said: "The Chamber is fully supportive of the Irish Government's decision to appeal this ruling and the independence of Ireland's Revenue authority to operate to the highest international standards. The Chamber believes that Ireland, and every other EU member state, should not have its tax policy and administration second guessed retrospectively."

In an article on how Apple has alienated many Mac loyalists, the site predicts only modest updates next year. Mac fans shouldn't hold their breath for radical new designs in 2017 though. Instead, the company is preparing modest updates: USB-C ports and a new Advanced Micro Devices Inc. graphics processor for the iMac, and minor bumps in processing power for the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro. Cue the outrage. Apple's Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013 and the Mac mini hasn't been upgraded since 2014. The company's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticized for not meeting the needs of professional users due to a lack of ports and performance. Notably, one of the key innovations planned for the MacBook Pro didn't work out. Apple wanted to use higher capacity battery packs that were shaped to the insides of the notebook; rather than square cells. This would have boosted battery life; however, sources say the battery failed a key test and so Apple had to quickly revert back to the old design. This required roping in engineers from other teams and delayed work on other Mac devices. Despite this, Apple CEO Tim Cook claims the company is still committed to Mac. ""We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that," said Cook at a recent company Q&A.

The timing follows the official availability of the LG 5K UltraFine display which works with Apple’s new MacBook Pro. This is the new footnote on discounted accessories: * Subject to availability and quantity limits apply. Pricing effective October 27, 2016 – March 31, 2017. The rare discount on certain accessories was announced back in November after significant pushback from new MacBook Pro customers who were complaining about replacing USB-A, Thunderbolt, and other older I/O because of the USB-C-only MacBook Pro. The limited time discount was originally only set for December 31. Now items included in the sale include an end date of March 31, 2017. These accessories are included in the limited time discount: USB-C to USB Adapter ($19 → $9) Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter ($49 → $29) USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter ($69 → $49) USB-C to Lightning (1 m) ($25 → $19) USB-C Charge Cable (2 m) ($19) USB-C to Lightning (2 m) ($35 → $29) 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49) 61W USB-C Power Adapter ($69) 87W USB-C Power Adapter ($79) While charging accessories are not dropping in price, Apple is discounting third-party USB-C accessories sold through its retail channels, including SanDisk’s $49 USB-C SD card reader which drops to $29. Extending the sale beyond the end of the year especially helps with LG UltraFine 5K display customers as the window to take advantage of that discount was originally only a little under two weeks.

While the two devices are largely similar to devices we’ve seen in the past, there are a few tweaks here and there that people have been requesting to get a look at. Members of the press who were in attendance of the event at Apple’s campus in Cupertino had an opportunity to go hands-on with the new iPhone and iPad and videos have been rolling in… Jon Rettinger of TechnoBuffalo went hands-on with the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro at the event in Cupertino, showing off features such as its new True Tone display, the infamous camera bump on the back, noting of the increased price, and more. Furthermore, Rettinger also showed off using the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro 9.7-inch, as well as the new, smaller Smart Keyboard accessory made for the device, as well as the new rose gold color variant that is exclusive to the smaller iPad Pro model. TechnoBuffalo’s video can be seen below: TechnoBuffalo also went hands-on with the iPhone SE, showing off the new rose gold model of the device, as well as the speed and performance, camera capabilities, and more. The Verge and CNET also both went hands-on with the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The outlets showed off the Smart Connector on the side of the device. Dieter Bohn of The Verge noted that the keyboard on the smaller iPad Pro requires some getting used to, but overall is fine. Sascha Segan of PCMag also got to try out the iPad Pro, as did Lance Ulanoff of Mashable. Segan noted of how the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is nearly the same as the iPad Air 2 in terms of size and weight, but the speakers are much more powerful. Moving on to the iPhone SE, Dieter Bohn of The Verge compared Apple’s latest flagship 4-inch device to the iPhone 5s, showing off the few design differences that there are, such as the matte border around the edges. Bohn also showed off the device’s support for Live Photos, but lack of 3D Touch. Segan of PCMag noted of many of the same things, showing off the speed of the device and more.

Apple knows most people will go for the 64GB version. Clever marketing. From Apple lover to Apple “liker”. The presentation itself was what one would expect: a few upgrades, nothing spectacular and the audience (that pays money to attend) clap clap at every 3rd sentence. I can almost see Phil Schiller cringe at trying to get people excited, enthusiastic, when, well, we’ve all been there, done that since the iPhone 5. Although I can imagine its difficult to make radical changes, but at least use the best available hardware (at the time) for the best product, now its more like: “well if we save $0.05 cents on this component, we lose 1 MP in the camera, but we can earn $1.55 overall – lets do that” Whereas in the “old days” it was: “What is the best hardware available that we can cram into it?

That it's a staple of both hip coffee shops and design studios reflects just how elegantly it balances the needs of the aesthete and the power user. But when it comes to sleek, well-designed, powerful laptops, it's no longer the obvious choice. Nearly every laptop maker has a striking machine that'll bring tears to your eyes when your credit card bill arrives. But not all fancy laptops slide cleanly into the basic MacBook Pro's slot. Some, like the flexible HP x360, are half tablet. Others, like the gaming-focused Alienware 13, are all chunk and power. And Microsoft's 15-inch Surface Book is a marvel of design and engineering, but borders on large and cumbersome. We set out to find out if any computers could compete with the most basic model of the new MacBook Pro-the 13-inch, $1500 number without the new gimmicky Touch Bar. Both Dell and Razer have laptops that measure up nearly perfectly, blending speed, quality, and design just right. We pitted similarly configured models against each other to see which is best. For this comparison, our contenders (and the price of the configuration we tested) are The Razer Blade Stealth ($1250), the Dell XPS 13 ($1600), and a new Apple MacBook Pro (without Touch Bar). Our tests ranged from grueling power showdowns to practical everyday web browsing. Some of the tests were downright ridiculous. No matter what you're planning to use your fancy laptop for, we've found the machine for you. For the person who needs power and versatility Image: Nicholas Stango/Gizmodo The new MacBook Pro infuriated nerdy power users when it was revealed it had last year's processor-and perhaps more damningly, unlike the infinitely versatile Pros of the past, it had just three ports: the ubiquitous headphone port, and two Thunderbolt 3-backed USB-C ports. USB-C is a remarkably flexible port style, which is widely considered the future. It has many advantages, including high-speed charging and super-fast data transfer speeds, but the problem is that if you want to plug in your legacy monitor, a hard drive, your camera's SD card, or even your iPhone, you're going to need a dongle adapter. If you've never had to do that before, Apple's minimalism looks more like a chore than a step towards the future. In practice, the MacBook Pro's limited ports aren't so much a dealbreaker as they are a pricey inconvenience. It sucks to buy them. To mimic the additional USB-A ports on both the Blade Stealth and XPS 13, I'd need to drop another $20. Add another $10 if I want to rip my photos directly off my SD card like I can with the XPS 13. And another $10 if I want to send video to my TV via HDMI like I can with the Blade Stealth. Sadly, there's no amount of money I can drop to replicate the Dell's best port-the proprietary power port. Having to hunt for a very particular power cord is irritating, but it also means a precious USB-C port isn't being used to charge the laptop as is the case with the MacBook Pro and Blade Stealth. That's a big deal for a power hungry power user. Almost as big as actual performance. Here are the numbers, for those inclined to inspect them. We'll unpack them below. Image: Gizmodo Image: Gizmodo All three laptops have top-notch processors packed inside. The Razer Blade Stealth and the Dell XPS 13 both boast Intel's latest Kaby Lake i7 7500u processors. The MacBook Pro, meanwhile, runs on last year's higher wattage Skylake-based i5 6360u chip. This means they get through the majority of tasks at similar speeds. Unless you're really crunching numbers you won't notice a major operative difference between the three. All three machines will render GIFs, make quick videos, and process massive spreadsheets at a similar pace. Though the MacBook Pro did outperform the two Windows devices when we batch processed 20 giant RAW photos in Photoshop. It also did better on the WebXPRT benchmark, which replicates day-to-day tasks you perform in your browser, like scrolling through tons of images on Facebook, or loading an adware-heavy website. Where the MacBook Pro suffered, the XPS 13 excelled. It killed the competition on the Geekbench synthetic benchmark, and absolutely slaughtered the MacBook Pro when playing a game of Civilization VI. That's doubly impressive because the the Dell XPS 13 we tested had a higher resolution screen-3200 x 1800 versus the 2560 x 1440 found on both the MacBook Pro and Razer. Winner: Dell XPS 13 For the person who watches tons of video on the go In a constant race to differentiate themselves, Apple, Razer, and Dell seem to have settled on providing dazzling displays to run all the graphics rendered by their powerful computers. But pretty displays mean a major drain on battery life, particularly when coupled with a touchscreen such as that found in the Blade Stealth and the XPS 13 we reviewed (Dell also produces a model without a touchscreen). The Blade Stealth reviewed, with a bright 2560 x 1440 display, never made it past seven hours on a charge. The more expensive 4K variant would fare even worse owing to the additional pixels in need of power. Image: Gizmodo And other versions of the XPS 13 would actually fare better than the one we tested, provided you skip the touchscreen and go with a 1080p display instead of the vivid 3200 x 1800 display we tested. Still, our souped-up XPS 13 did stream movies for nine and a half hours when the brightness was set to just 200 nits, and an average of 10 hours when used as my daily laptop. Yet if you want to watch movies and you want to watch them all day, or on a random 11-hour overseas flight, then the MacBook Pro is the way to go. When the brightness was set to 200-nits (about three quarters of the way) the MacBook Pro lasted over two hours longer than the competition. But across three types of battery tests: streaming movies at a screen brightness of 200 nits, full brightness, and plucking away for an average work day, it was the Dell that did best. While the MacBook Pro is capable of the best battery life under optimal conditions, the Dell was the most consistent. If you dim your screen regularly get a MacBook Pro, if you never know what you're going to be up to, get a XPS 13. Winner: Dell XPS 13 For the person who needs to do work THe new MacBook Pro has a great keyboard and trackpad. A lot of noise was made about the new MacBook Pro keyboard...like, literally, it's noisy. I personally didn't notice an obnoxious click every time I pressed a finger to a key, and I've yet to be flogged by irate coworkers. But when it comes to actual pleasure and speed while typing the MacBook Pro definitely has an advantage. The MacBook Pro handily beat the XPS 13 and Blade Stealth in a typing test. Though the XPS 13 had enough key travel to make each key press feel satisfyingly meaty. The Blade Stealth was a different story. While it the customizable backlit keys are a very neat rarity for a laptop in this price range and size, the mushy feel of each key press was irritating. I was drawn to the MacBook Pro when I needed to edit my work as well. That's because the trackpad on the MacBook Pro is incredibly responsive and intuitive. There were no frustrating accidental highlights or drags across the page with the cursor. The XPS 13 and Blade Stealth were pleasant surprises on the trackpad front, operating nearly as well as the MacBook Pro, but the Razer's trackpad feels a little slick, and the rubber palmrests surrounding the Dell's can be distracting. Winner: Apple MacBook Pro The champion Dell XPS 13 Each of these computers will give you a satisfying computer experience. Nerds will nod approvingly when they see the garish green Razer logo and hipsters will jerk their chins in your general direction when they see that shiny Apple one. But the best 13-inch laptop is an unassuming Dell. The Dell is a consistent machine with great battery life, and powerful guts that deliver when you need them to. It has the ports that matter, and it doesn't ask you to juggle cords just to charge. It starts at $900, a full $100 less than the Razer and $600 less than the MacBook Pro. And it's just a damn fine laptop. When we reviewed the original XPS 13 back in 2015 we called it the Windows laptop to beat. That still stands.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Dec 21, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Apple appeals against US$14bn tax bill SOUR GRAPES?US President Barack Obama’s administration expressed its displeasure at what it said was the EU helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the US Reuters, BRUSSELS Apple Inc on Monday appealed against a US$14 billion tax demand as the EU issued details of its ruling that the iPhone maker won sweetheart tax deals from the Irish government which amounted to illegal subsidies. The tech giant’s combative stand — its lead lawyer told reporters that Apple was a “convenient target” for an EU antitrust chief driven by “headlines” — underlined its anger with the European Commission, which it says ignored evidence from Irish experts before the decision on Aug. 30. US President Barack Obama’s administration also voiced displeasure at what it said was the EU helping itself to cash that should have ended up in the US while many in Silicon Valley saw it as further proof that an envious Europe, having lost out on new tech markets, is trying to rig regulations against them. EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has rejected those claims and on Monday, while making no new comment on a case which is also being appealed by the Dublin government, the EU executive published an edited text of her judgment. Apple’s Irish tax arrangements have allowed it to pay tax at a rate of 3.8 percent on US$200 billion of overseas profits over the past 10 years, according to a Reuters analysis of corporate filings. This is a fraction of the tax rate in the countries where Apple’s products are designed, made and sold. The low rate is achieved by Apple telling US authorities that the profits are earned by Irish units. Meanwhile, Apple and Ireland agree the profits are generated in the US. Among elements revealed by the commission’s edited text was a record of a meeting between an Apple tax adviser and the Irish revenue service in 1990 in which they discussed setting an apparently arbitrary ceiling on the profit on which Apple’s Irish unit would be taxed locally. A year after Apple’s Irish branch had recorded a net profit of US$270 million, its tax adviser proposed that no more than US$30 million to US$40 million a year be taxed in Ireland, since the rest was attributable to technology and marketing businesses elsewhere. “[Apple’s tax adviser] confessed there was no scientific basis for the figure. However the figure was of such magnitude that he hoped it would be seen to be a bona fide proposal,” the excerpt cited in the commission judgment read. The reference is part of the commission’s case that Ireland gave Apple special treatment to induce it to base its European operations in the country and channel profits through Ireland. While independent tax experts scanned the documentation for more clues to Vestager’s overall approach, another element that stood out was its concern about the way Dublin did not set time limits on its rulings on how Apple’s income would be taxed. That could signal trouble for other multinationals facing Brussels’ ire, not just in Ireland but in several other EU countries. This story has been viewed 1765 times. Comments will be moderated.

How Apple Wanted (But Failed) to Boost Battery Life of Its New MacBook GO Report claims Apple gave up on new battery tech at the very last minute due to problems experienced during testing stage Dec 20, 2016 17:00 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  ​Early reviews of the new Apple MacBook’s battery life have been mostly negative, with the majority of people claiming that the new generation offers substantially lower battery performance compared to its predecessor despite Apple’s promises. And according to a report from Bloomberg, there is a very good reason this is happening. It appears that Apple planned to equip the new MacBook with a completely new battery technology, but due to issues experienced during the testing stage, the company decided to give up on it at the very last minute. Lighter battery packs Specifically, Apple wanted to use several lighter battery packs that were shaped to the insides of the laptop, with the company thus trying to kill two birds with one stone: reduce the overall weight of the device and, at the same time, offer longer battery life because of the number of battery packs installed underneath the case. However, the company experienced problems when testing the new technology, so it decided to replace it with an old-style battery pack that features an older design. As a result, the laptop is heavier than Apple originally wanted, while also offering lower than expected battery performance. Apple didn’t want to delay the debut of the new MacBook and continue working on a longer-lasting battery for the laptop because it wanted the device to arrive in time for the holiday season, which typically generates very strong sales for the company. Apple losing the cool factor And the battery wasn’t Apple’s only problem. Several engineers working within the Mac unit decided to leave the company, some of them criticizing the company’s vision and explaining that the MacBook Pro lacks the cool factor, while others keep innovating. Microsoft, which is one of Apple’s biggest rivals, is aggressively investing in the hardware industry with new devices included in the Surface series. The Surface Book, which is Microsoft’s alternative to the Apple MacBook Pro, comes with Windows 10 and features hardware such as a detachable touchscreen and support for pen. Apple has also been strongly criticized by its own staff for sticking with a traditional approach for the MacBook which no longer seems to work. Many believe that the decline of the MacBook could have a bigger impact on Apple, as it can break down the company’s ecosystem and spread across the entire device lineup, including on the iPhone. In the meantime, Apple keeps praising its hardware with every occasion and is now promising further upgrades for the desktop lineup as well. The iMac is expected to be overhauled next year, but with Microsoft investing here as well, it’ll be hard for Apple to stay relevant without dramatic upgrades. #Apple#MacBook#MacBook Pro#Microsoft#Surface Book subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Working on Improved Sound Solutions for Portable Devices, Patent Shows Apple's macOS Sierra 10.12.2 Officially Released with Auto Unlock Improvements Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed - Updated Apple Releases iOS 10.2 Beta 2 to Public Testers, macOS 10.12.2 Beta 2 to Devs New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    The new MacBook Pro has below expectations battery life New Mac Apps Free Download Manager: Download manager and accelerator that can handle HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent protocols, while also being able to download YouTube content CheckMark Payroll 2017: Enables you to do-it-yourself payrolls and is the ideal solution for accountants, small businesses and professional payroll services.

People completely depend on the app for their navigation and transportation. New York Times reported that Google has played a vital role in the fatal accident last year. National Transportation Safety Board ordered to add Rail Crossing Tech giants like Apple and Google have been ordered to add proper rail crossing in their maps. After commending a 2-year long investigation, the National Transportation Safety board called tech companies, Apple and Google to include the exact location of 20,000 rail and grade crossings to their maps. A grade crossing is a place where the rails and the roads are at the same level. This creates a misguidance for the drivers and they weren’t able to figure out where to take the turn. After the fatal accident in California last year, the organization teamed up with Federal Railroad administration to get help from technology companies for adding alerts for the safety of people. Related: Apple iPhone Update: Future iPhone Products Will Sport Foldable OLED Screens In Apple maps, the grade crossings are not marked, which didn’t warn the drivers to stay alert and avoid crossing them haphazardly. The drivers can even turn onto the tracks and get stuck. The organization wanted the tech companies to mark the grade crossing as the blinking lights and the railroad crossing to be marked with X. After the fatal crash happened in California due to Google maps, the company started implementing changes in its mapping data. It stated that it would add audio-visual warnings for grade and rail crossings. Likewise, Apple also agreed to add rail and grade crossing data. Related: Apple iPhone 8 Specs, Update: iPhone 8 to Come with Dual SIM and Stylus Support Fatal Accident Killed 32 lives last year Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, an engineer by profession was following Google maps on his smartphone to drive his Ford truck in California last year. He was confused and thought that the app was telling him to go, but he ended up stuck on the railroad tracks. Before he realized that he had made a terrible mistake, a commuter train hit the Ford truck, killing him along with the 32 others. Marking grade and rail crossing for the safety of the people is the smart move by the tech companies.

The said document for partner companies listed 11 quad-core processors that are expected to to be available in the first quarter of 2017. These processors could be used in a new Mac pro or/and iMac. Apple Mac Pro Processors The document revealed the lineup that includes three Core i7 and seven Core i5 processors. In addition, a single Xeon E3 v6 chip has also made its way into the list. The processors listed above are Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and will surely be superior to the present Skylake processors. However, people who are currently using Skylake or even Haswell processors shouldn’t expect a big boost in performance. Intel processors are known for having a small improvement over their predecessors. Furthermore, the Kaby Lake processors show 200Mhz higher base clock speed across processors that are usually used in Apple Mac Pro and iMac. Related iPhone 8 Specs & Update: iPhone 8 To Get Long-Range Wireless Charging? According to the website AppleInsider, the upcoming processors to be featured in Apple devices are the i5-7500, i5-7600, and the i7-7700K. Turbo clock speeds, as well as the thermal design, are still not known at the present time. Apple Mac Pro Scheduled For March 2017 Release? According to the website MacWorld, March next year is the ideal release date for the Mac Pro, as well as other Apple products. However, the website also specified that it would just be an updated internal components and not a full redesigned device. Related Nokia 150 Specs & Release Date: HMD Global’s Back-to-Basics Mobile Phone Another Apple Mac Pro Release Hint Apparently, a code in OS X El Capitan revealed that a new Mac Pro is really on its way very soon. In fact, there’s a reference to a new device that’s codenamed AAPLJ95,1 found in El Capitan. The present Mac Pro is somehow codenamed similarly with AAPLJ90,1. Hence, it’s safe to say that the code is referring to a new version of Mac Pro that is intended for professional workstation use. In addition, rumors suggest that it is sporting 10 ports of USB 3.0. It is also believed that the Thunderbolt 3 feature is making its way into the new Mac Pro.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple CEO Tim Cook this week sent a letter to employees allaying fears the company’s desktops were dead. Apparently, the Cupertino company has some exciting new updates on the way though Cook didn’t say what. Now, a new Bloomberg report is shedding some light on what to expect—and it doesn’t sound good. According to the report, Apple is preparing “modest updates” to the iMac, which may include new USB-C ports an AMD’s latest graphics processor. The MacBook and MacBook Pro, meanwhile, are allegedly going to get minor bumps in processing power, Bloomberg said. Perhaps the more exciting bit in Bloomberg’s report is the mention of a standalone keyboard with Touch Bar and Touch ID support. “Apple will decide whether to release these based on how well the features do on the MacBook Pro,” Bloomberg said. I can tell you from experience I only found a use for the Touch Bar on rare occasions, but I loved the inclusion of Touch ID. However, the Touch Bar is more tailored toward content creators—for example, video and photo editors—so I’m not necessarily the target audience. It’ll probably be expensive If Apple did release a standalone keyboard with Touch Bar and Touch ID support, it probably won’t come cheap. Apple’s Magic Keyboard is $99; add in the Touch Bar and Touch ID module and you’re probably looking at a $99 premium. With new iMacs apparently on the way, however, the new keyboard could make for a nice companion. If you own a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, have you found it useful? Or is it more of a gimmick? Your opinion could help determine whether or not a standalone keyboard is released.

CST December 19, 2016 Photo:  Andrew Burton/Getty Images CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST SAN FRANCISCO — Apple CEO Tim Cook said he felt it was necessary to "engage" when President-elect Donald Trump — who has railed against Apple and other tech companies — invited him and about a dozen tech executives to attend a summit in New York last week. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,” Cook told employees on its internal employee info service. “The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. "And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.” The comments were first reported by news site TechCrunch. Cook and some of tech's biggest names — Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, among them — met with Trump to discuss jobs, immigration policy, China, cybersecurity and corporate tax rates. "Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education," Cook said. "They’re on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They’re on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy.” Trump, who dinged Apple over security and jobs and Amazon on corporate taxes, told the assembled execs at Trump Tower, "I want to add that I’m here to help you folks do well." Trump called the meeting productive, but many in Silicon Valley questioned the participation of the execs, most of whom supported Hillary Clinton. Cook offered a reason his CEO brethren probably agree with — better to participate than pass. “We very much stand up for what we believe in," Apple's CEO concluded. "We think that’s a key part of what Apple is about. And we’ll continue to do so."

By MarketWatch Published: Dec 22, 2016 8:57 a.m. ET Share Cook wants to be engaged with administration on privacy, security, climate and taxes By MarketWatch Reuters PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, a Facebook board member, looks on along with Apple CEO Tim Cook and Oracle CEO Safra Catz as President-elect Donald Trump speaks at a technology leaders’ meeting last week at Trump Tower. ‘We engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best.’ Tim Cook, Apple Just how aligned are they — Donald Trump, the soon-to-be leader of the world’s largest economy and Apple’s Tim Cook, who leads the planet’s largest company by market value? After all, in the heat of the campaign, Trump called for an Apple boycott when the tech giant dug in on privacy, refusing to help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Apple AAPL, -0.78% employees wanted to know just where the relationship might stand in this preview period of Trump leadership, so they asked Cook, via internal message board. Right there between the product questions, they pushed Cook after watching the CEO huddle with Trump and other tech heavyweights last week. The meeting brought together a C-suite roster that, with some notable exceptions (PayPal founder Peter Thiel, for one) had sparred openly with Trump during the campaign on touchstone issues that included, yes, privacy, but also globalization, immigration’s impact on tech-job recruitment — this one in particular was lobbed at Facebook’s FB, -1.12% Mark Zuckerberg during the campaign — and human rights. Read: Why Trump–Silicon Valley chasm is too wide to bridge And: The tech industry is taking too gloomy a view of the Trump presidency On the Apple message board, Cook, who had scored a place just two seats away from Trump, was asked: “How important is it for Apple to engage with governments?” And he appeared to read between lines. “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,” Cook responded, according to Tech Crunch, which ran the posting in full. “The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it’s a debate of ideas.” He continued: “Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education. They’re on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They’re on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100 percent renewable energy.” Cook further hinted at what could be an intensifying conversation with Washington about tax reform, including the debate over repatriating overseas, tax-shielded assets back home.

Happy New Year firework wallpapers The top stories of the week on iDB How to use AirPods like a pro   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple now offering in-store pickup for AirPods with February 8 availability By Christian Zibreg, Dec 20, 2016 Tweet 14 Comments As first noted by AppleInsider, Apple yesterday began offering the in-store pickup option for its newly launched AirPods wireless earphones. Apple.com online store in the United States indicated at post time that first AirPods ordered with the in-store pickup option would be available on February 8. If you choose to have AirPods shipped to your home, they’re estimated to arrive in six weeks. Note that estimated delivery dates can change depending on stock, demand, manufacturing issues and other conditions. Following their unexpected delay, AirPods finally began shipping to customers just days before Christmas. What limited inventory was available at Apple stores sold out quickly. To check availability of the in-store pickup option for AirPods, visit the AirPods webpage. Click the blue Buy button in the top-right corner, then hit the “Check Availability” link underneath the Pickup heading in the lefthand column. Now select your favorite Apple Store from the list, or type its name in the search filed to check availability. Choose a desired store, then add AirPods to your shopping bag and proceed to checkout. Most of the stores list AirPods as arriving on February 8, 2017 for in-store pickup. You’ll receive a notification email when your order is ready to be picked up. You can pick up the order yourself or have someone else pick it up for you. Did you buy your AirPods yet? If so, do share your first impressions with other readers in the comment section below. If not, tell us why? Source: AppleInsider Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend How about Jet Black AirPods? AirPods manufacturer Inventec is expanding capacity to meet strong demand Cook says AirPods are a runaway success AirPods now available to buy from Apple.com Related Topics Accessories, AirPods, Apple, Earphones, News, Retail nova12 Got mine yesterday. They’re really nice. Just wish you could do Siri AND play/pause at the same time (maybe one bud is Siri and the other is play/pause). Jordan Already got mine yesterday and I absolutely love them! The only thing is I wish they would have put like a ping on the case so you can hit a button like on Apple Watch to ping your iPhone. Bc they are small and can easily be misplaced. Hopefully the second gen they do something like that Tony They could do that with a firmware update. Cause you can see the firmware version of them on the computer. Wouldn’t be hard at all for them to do it. nova12 how, if there’s no speaker built into the case to emit the sound? iBanks I’m hoping that the Lookout app adds this functionality for the AirPods like they do for the iPhone and Apple Watch. They go out of range of one another and I get an alert on both devices. Ds Seems like for being an item so many people were quick to judge, discard as practical, and ultimately shame… they sure did sell out super fast. Rowan09 Always the case nova12 guilty as charged. I didn’t slam them online, but I thought they looked stupid. still ordered two sets the minute iDB posted they were available. I’m a freaking slave to apple marketing. Here’s the thing: the part I thought looked stupid was the little stems but you know what? they are PERFECT when you’re wearing a beanie in cold weather — just long enough that the ends poke out so that the mics are clear. Probably an accidentally upside, but still great. n0ahcruz3 Lol its apple what do you expect people without brand loyalty like myself (although uses only iPhone) will criticize a product especially when it comes to pricing and the usability. I criticized the 5c, the 16gb memory etc. and the decline of the iPad since 5.5 iPhone was introduced. 5c was an expensive POs at $499 16gb. They did however learned from that by releasing SE with a $399 price tag. And they offered 32gb as minimum for the 7/7+. Point is, you have to atleast criticized a company for a “subpar” product in order for them to release a much better and improved and reasonably priced products. FFF84 I canceled my order and arranged an in-store pickup on February 3rd cause the delivery was February 7 (Germany). nathan stout Would you guys recommend refreshing the availability over and over until I can reserve one or should I just go to the Apple Store in the morning? How did you guys get yours? nova12 I ordered mine in the Apple Store app the minute iDB posted that they were available. just happened to open the iDB app as the article was posted. Woz A Nater Wake up. Everyone that sees you wearing these AirPods will think your a dork. Rob I’ve been using them since Monday morning, the case had about 80% charge after unboxing, been using them on and off at work Monday and Tuesday and I only had to put the case on charge Tuesday evening. They sound great, I get loads of positive attention from people that notice me wearing them, they stay in my ears great even when I tried shaking my head violently to test it. I absolutely love these things, best thing apples made in a long time. The only negative I’ve experienced so far is one time I put one in my ear and double tapped to invoke Siri and it didn’t respond, took a few tries to respond so I assumed that it just took a few seconds to re-establish a connection. When you’ve got an Apple Watch too to control phone calls and music etc it all just seamlessly works just like you’d expect, loving being in the ecosystem!   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Apple Chinese New Year promo: free Beats Solo3 headphones with Mac or iPhone Resetting AirPods fixes charging case battery woes for some users Rumor: Apple seeding first iOS 10.3 beta on January 10 with new ‘Theatre’ mode Daily Deals: $70 off Beyerdynamic headphones, 10 iTunes movies for $10, and more Beautiful iPhone 7 photos show New Year’s Eve celebrations around the world   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… CCLowPower adds a Low Power Mode toggle to Control Center ForceInPicture enables Picture in Picture mode on unsupported devices CCRecord: a tweak to quickly and easily record your iPhone screen Customize your iOS 10 Control Center toggle colors with Cream 2 and Creamless iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

The LG UltraFine 5K Display was announced alongside the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar earlier this year as one of the few monitors to support Thunderbolt 3 natively. However, while it appeared – alongside its 4K sibling – on Apple’s online store, it was not actually shipping. That has changed today. Orders for the 27-inch, 5120 x 2880 resolution display are being taken at $974 apiece, though you’ll need to wait a while before you actually receive it. Although the earliest orders should get their new monitors before December is through, Apple is currently reporting a 2-4 week shipping time for new orders. It might well be worth the wait, if you’re ready to go all-in on Thunderbolt 3. As well as its IPS, P3 color compliant panel, built-in camera, and stereo speakers, the UltraFine 5K Display also has a trio of USB Type-C ports which act as a USB 3.1 hub for peripherals. That could mean a keyboard and mouse, or a printer or some other device; they’d be connected via a single cable from display to MacBook Pro, which would also handle video output and 85W of charging power. Meanwhile, Apple has opted to extend the period during which it is offering discounted USB Type-C peripherals. Originally, that promotion was due to end on December 31, 2016. Now, though, it’ll continue until the end of March 2017. It means a significant discount on LG’s 4K and 5K displays, though for most it’ll be the cheaper cables and dongles that are of greatest interest. For instance, one of the most vital adapters is the USB Type-C to USB A convertor, which is available for $9 instead of its regular, $19 price. USB-C to Lightning cables are also discounted, down to as low as $19 (from $25) for the 1m cable. The Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter is still $29, from $49, while the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter remains at $49, rather than its regular $69 price. Finally, the USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter is also $49. It’s a tacit recognition that the switch from traditional ports like USB 3.1 to USB Type-C may take a little longer than some could’ve hoped. Although the port is certainly more flexible – it can handle power, video, and data, and is bi-directional, for instance – there are plenty of legacy devices out there which people still rely upon. Apple’s decision to go all-in on USB-C with the newest MacBook Pro, rather than hedge its bets with a combination of old and new style ports, exacerbated the issue, though arguably it would only have delayed the transition had it included a mixture.

Apple's wireless earphones are selling for three times their retail price on eBay Apple's AirPods went on sale online at the start of last week for the first time As expected, the new earphones sold out within a matter of minutes  Their recommended retail price is $159 in the US and £159 in the UK  On eBay, sellers are pricing the wireless headphones at up to £500 ($620)   By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 12:11 EST, 20 December 2016 | Updated: 13:22 EST, 20 December 2016 e-mail 31 shares 65 View comments After months of anticipation, Apple's AirPod earphones finally went on sale to the public last week.  As expected, the earphones sold out within a matter of minutes, but it seems some savvy shoppers may be selling them on eBay. While the earphones have a retail price of $159 in the US and £159 in the UK, they are being sold for over three times the amount, fetching up to £500 ($620). Scroll down for video While the earphones have a RRP of $159 in the US and £159 in the UK, they are being sold for over three times the amount, fetching up to £500 ($620) WHAT ARE THE AIRPODS?  The AirPods resemble Apple's older white EarPods minus an attached cable were launched alongside the iPhone 7. They connect to the iPhone using a form of Bluetooth technology.  They work to a distance of around 10 metres (32 feet) from the paired device, meaning if the wearer wanders away any further, the connection will drop. To pair them with an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch or Mac running the latest iOS 10, watchOS 3 or macOS Sierra software, the user opens their small magnetic carry case close to the device and waits for a notification asking to connect.  Every time they remove the headphones from the case and put them into the ears, they will connect automatically. The AirPods charge through their case, which in turn is charged by a lightning connector, just like an iPhone. The distinctive wireless earphones created a big buzz among Apple fans when they were unveiled alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in September. However, delays in availability dampened some people's enthusiasm for them. 'We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,' said Apple in October.  The wireless earphones are now available in more than 100 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and Japan. They are also on sale in China, Hong Kong, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Netherlands and the UAE. 'AirPods will be shipping in limited quantities at launch and customers are encouraged to check online for updates on availability and estimated delivery dates' said Apple.   While some users had expressed concern they might lose the AirPods, Apple CEO Tim Cook says he 'never personally had one fall out since using them', which has involved using them on treadmills. The launch of the AirPods coincided with Apple's controversial decision to drop the traditional headphone jack. Owners of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus must now use wireless headphones, or use their traditional headphones with a supplied Lightning adapter.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Children who spend time chatting on social media are less...

Share this article Share 31 shares Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported Apple was having technical problems with getting both earphones to play music at the same time. Citing a 'person familiar with the development of the AirPod,' it claims Apple is struggling to ensure that both AirPods receive a Bluetooth signal simultaneously, something that would help them avoid sudden connection dropouts or out of sync audio. The $159 (£159) wireless AirPods (left) are now available to buy online with Apple vowing to start deliveries next week and will also be landing in store next week. The iPhone recognises when the Airpods are nearby (right) NO MORE HEADPHONE JACK  Owners of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus cannot directly connect any headphones with a traditional 3.5mm plug. If people want to use other wired headphones, they will need to use the Lightning 3.5mm adapter - which is included with the phone. The phone also comes with new Lightning earbuds, which plug into the charging port.  However, this means that users can no longer listen to music while simultaneously charging their phone, unless they use separate charging dock. The wireless AirPods are not included with the phone, and cost $159 (£159). 'Apple must ensure that both earpieces receive audio at the same time to avoid distortion', the person familiar with their development said.  'That person said Apple also must resolve what happens when a user loses one of the earpieces or the battery dies.'  Apple has not given any official explanation for the delay after being contacted for comment.

Even Apple’s own employees appeared to share this concern, with one asking on the company’s internal Apple Web system ‘Are Mac desktops strategic for us?’. Tim Cook was quick to offer reassurance, stating that the desktop market was ‘very strategic’ for Apple, and that the company has ‘great desktops in our roadmap.’ There were, though, a couple of problems with this assurance … First, we noted earlier, Cook made specific reference to the iMac – singing its praises as ‘the best desktop we have ever made’ – while saying nothing at all about the Mac mini or, crucially, the Mac Pro. You would have thought that if you wanted people to feel confident that Apple’s desktop line was alive and well, you might at least assure us that the flagship model has a future. Second, the statement gave no indication whatsoever of any kind of timescale. This is, of course, nothing new. Apple famously reveals little of its plans, not even confirming iPhone launch dates – something we know is coming every September – until shortly beforehand. But it is problematic in the Mac market, especially for professional users. I do, of course, understand Apple’s reasons for secrecy around its products. A large part of the mystique of the brand is built around the idea of surprising and delighting its customers. It works hard to come up with features that cause people to ooh and aah, and it can only really have that kind of impact if it succeeds in keeping features secret until the launch. Steve Jobs was the master of the reveal, with his famous ‘one more thing’ line, and it wouldn’t be much of a reveal if everyone knew all of the new features ahead of time. This is the reason 9to5Mac is not on Apple’s Christmas card list. There’s a second reason, too: Apple doesn’t want to tip its hand to competitors. Again, it reduces the impact of a product launch if everyone else has gotten there first. While the company is best known for taking what other companies do, and doing it better, the ‘how’ can often be as significant as the ‘what.’ Keeping that as secret as it can is entirely understandable. And for consumer products, you can argue there’s no downside. Sure, people might want to know what features the next iPhone will offer, so they can decide whether to upgrade this year or next, but there’s no pressing need to do so. They know there will be a new iPhone next year, and that it will be almost certainly be launched in September. They have, in the past, known that one year will be a new design and the following year new features in the same casing (even if the future of that pattern is now less certain). But it’s a little different in the Mac market – and that’s a particular problem for professionals. In the Mac market, there is no fixed pattern to Apple’s upgrades. For any given year, it’s only once we get close enough for product leaks that we can figure out whether there’s a major upgrade or minor refresh in the works. For tech-savvy consumers, it’s annoying – because if you buy today you have no idea whether next year will see a minor spec bump, where you can take a ‘Meh’ attitude and remain happy with your purchase, or a major new design where you’re going to really, really wish you’d waited. But for businesses, it’s worse than that. Companies need to plan their major purchases in advance. For a one-person business, like say a writer, even a single MacBook Pro can represent a significant purchase. It’s certainly not a sum I want to be spending annually. For larger companies, buying in the hundreds or thousands – or committing to multi-year leases – it’s even more problematic. Most challenging of all is when professionals don’t even know whether a product range has a future. Right now, the 2016 MacBook Pro outperforms the 2013 Mac Pro in some respects. The faster SSD means that drive-intensive operations are faster on the laptop, and you get faster I/O operations on the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Pro than the Thunderbolt 2 ones on the Mac Pro. That’s not necessarily a problem in itself: it’s not entirely surprising that a particularly powerful laptop would challenge a three-year-old desktop. The problem is that, without knowing whether the Mac Pro has a future, it’s really difficult for a pro user in the market today to know what to do. Do they buy a three-year-old machine which, in most respects, is still faster? Do they wait for a possible new Mac Pro model next year? Or do they conclude that the MacBook Pro range is the future of professional-grade Macs and make the switch now? What would be really helpful is for Apple to at least assure customers that the Mac Pro has a future, and to tell us when a major upgrade can be expected. Of course, I understand the counterarguments Apple could make. I can see three main ones. First, if Apple revealed that a major upgrade to a product was coming next year, it would dampen demand in the short-term. Apple is under enormous pressure to keep sales growth going, and anything that reduces demand even temporarily would be seen by the market as a weakness. But I don’t find that argument persuasive. The ‘Apple is doomed’ merchants will ply their wares whatever the company does. Being able to point to a statement about a major upgrade would provide rational, long-term investors – the kind Apple most wants to attract – with a compelling reason for any temporary lull in sales in a particular line. And any sales lost this year would be made up next. There’s also the fact that Apple claims to be a company which does the right thing, and pays little heed to investors in it for the short-term. Only yesterday, Cook reiterated that Apple ‘stands up for what we believe in.’ Surely helping your customers make informed purchase decisions would be doing the right thing? The second, more defensible, argument Apple could make is that it doesn’t operate to a fixed release schedule, but instead releases new products when they are ready. I can definitely see the logic in that when it comes to totally new product categories. Early smartwatches, for example, were pretty unsatisfactory, and it made sense for Apple to do what it always does: figure out why existing products aren’t good enough, and solve the usability problems – waiting for new technology as required. But the argument is less persuasive for existing product categories. Back to iPhones, where Apple has (so far, at least) made no secret of its timetable: you’ll get a new model each September, and they will alternate between new designs and new features. The slower pace of change in computers isn’t going to see that cycle happening for Macs, but I can’t believe that Apple couldn’t commit to a major new release every 3-4 years. I don’t pretend that committing to a fixed timetable wouldn’t be without its challenges. Four years out, it might be impossible to say for sure when something will be feasible from a volume production perspective. The Touch Bar is a good example of a new feature where the company couldn’t say for sure when suppliers might be in a position to meet demand at an acceptable price. But Apple is a company that has, when told that something is impossible to manufacture, designed and built machines for its suppliers to make them possible. It has enough spare cash to throw at suppliers to accelerate their timetables. Sure, it can’t do the impossible, but honestly, things like the Touch Bar fall into the ‘nice to have’ category. What pros needed most was performance – and the 2016 MacBook Pro would have delivered that with or without the Touch Bar. The incredible new display, sexy new case and Touch ID button would have generated enough buzz. The third argument is that there’s one supplier Apple can’t control, and that’s Intel. When it comes to new CPU bumps, Apple is entirely dependent on Intel’s timescale. That’s definitely true today, but perhaps won’t be in future. One reason Apple can reliably plan its annual iPhone launches is, of course, that it designs its own bespoke chips and has them manufactured under contract. As ARM chips grow progressively more powerful, there have been increasing suggestions that Apple will move away from Intel to its own chips for the Mac line, probably starting with the MacBook. If that happens – and it seems more likely than not – Apple will have much more control over the Mac roadmap in years to come. What are your own views? Would a known major release cycle help your purchase decisions, even with Apple keeping new features as secret as ever? Or would it be better for Apple to retain the flexibility to launch as and when it chooses, even if that makes purchase decisions trickier?

While recent rumours said that the plan is cancelled, yesterday on Twitter, Niantic said via the official Pokémon Go account that we should stay tuned as the game is coming soon on the Apple Watch. Earlier a report by 9 to 5 Mac suggested that Niantic was working on an unfinished port of Pokémon Go for the Apple Watch but that idea had been scrapped. However, the latest tweet denies those rumours, although it doesn’t give out any other info or a specific date, but hey, at least we know that the plans have not been cancelled. Pokémon Go for Apple Watch is coming soon. Stay tuned. — Pokémon GO (@PokemonGoApp) December 17, 2016 Pokémon Go on the wearable device will let players see when a Pokémon or a Pokéstop is in their area right on the Apple Watch and interact with them without having to take out their smartphone. It is based on a similar concept as the Pokémon Go Plus wearable accessory, but of course will offer more features and a better experience considering the Apple Watch has a display. So when will we see Pokémon Go on the Apple Watch? Well, Niantic does have a bunch of announcements to make before the year closes. It recently gave players a teaser of second generation Pokémon by launching new baby Pokémon that are now available by hatching eggs. There is news that a special Christmas event is in tow as well as announcement for legendary and rest of second generation Pokémon. Hopefully the upcoming announcements will also have some details about the launch date. Stay tuned for more information soon.

Here's what it could mean for the future of digital privacy. By Alison DeNisco | December 20, 2016, 8:30 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Wachiwit In a move that could impact the future of digital privacy rights in the US, the Florida Court of Appeals recently ruled that the government can force an iPhone user to release their passcode to unlock their phone. In the case, State v. Stahl, Florida resident Aaron Stahl was charged with video voyeurism after allegedly taking pictures up the skirt of a woman in a store with his cell phone. The event was filmed on store surveillance video. More about IT Security Video: 5 things to know about ethical hacking Five ways to maintain your privacy on your smartphone, no downloads required Firms that force you to change your password are clueless says cyber security chief Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter The police obtained a warrant to search Stahl's iPhone 5, which they believed was used to take the pictures. However, the State was unable to view the contents of the phone because it was locked, and Stahl refused to provide the password. The Fifth Amendment states that "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[.]" Producing the password would be self-incriminatory for Stahl, the trial judge originally ruled. SEE: Apple's FBI standoff: Why it's a lot bigger than breaking into one device The State then filed a motion to force Stahl to give up the password, and alleged that there was no Fifth Amendment implication in doing so, since "there was no difference between the court finding probable cause to issue the warrant and compelling Stahl to assist the State in 'opening up' the phone," according to Judge Anthony Black's decision. Black ruled in favor of the State, overturning the trial court's decision and allowing the government to compel Stahl to provide the password. "Unquestionably, the State established, with reasonable particularity, its knowledge of the existence of the passcode, Stahl's control or possession of the passcode, and the self-authenticating nature of the passcode. This is a case of surrender and not testimony," Black's decision stated. In other words, the Fifth Amendment does not protect the defendant from providing his password. "This case is very significant," said Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner Research. "If consumers know they will eventually have to give up their personal phone passwords, they will be afraid to conduct personal activities on their phones that could ultimately expose activities they would rather keep private." As ZDNet reported, this Florida ruling deviates from those in similar cases, including Pennsylvania and Colorado, which concluded that surrendering a password to law enforcement is considered self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. "This ruling of having to disclose personal passwords seems to represent a fundamental violation of privacy that could be exploited by aggressive law enforcement agents in the near future," Litan said. "Unfortunately, these agents don't always have the best motives, so it could lead to unfair arrests that violate the civil rights of US citizens." The case comes on the heels of the controversy between Apple and the FBI, in which Apple refused a court order to unlock the iPhone used by the San Bernardino shooter. The Justice Department eventually dropped its case against Apple, as it unlocked the phone with help from an outside party. In March, the American Civil Liberties Union found the government has 63 confirmed cases and up to 13 additional ones in which the government applied for an order "to compel Apple or Google to provide assistance in accessing data stored on a mobile device" since 2008. These cases primarily involved investigations into drug crimes, the group stated. The technology privacy legislation issues continued in November, when the New York District Attorney released a report asking for legislation that would require smartphone manufacturers to create operating systems that allow them to more easily access user data—therefore making it easier for government organizations to access this data with search warrants, TechRepublic's Conner Forrest reported. One potential area for concern is using these laws to exploit people based on their race, Litan said. "That's one of the dangers in these types of laws. They impose on fundamental privacy rights and civil liberties and can be dangerously abused by people in power," she said. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers The Florida Court of Appeals ruled earlier this month that the Fifth Amendment does not protect a smartphone user from being forced to give up their passcode, which could have major implications for digital privacy rights in the US. Similar cases recently arose in Pennsylvania and Colorado, both of which concluded that surrendering a password to law enforcement is considered self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. With the recent controversy between Apple and the FBI, this ruling could impact the way other courts apply the Fifth Amendment in cases involving mobile devices.

Andrew Cunningham - Dec 20, 2016 5:58 pm UTC Enlarge / The 13-inch MacBook Pro's two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 316 Share this story Further ReadingReview: The $1,499 2016 MacBook Pro is an expensive MacBook Air on the inside Update: As of December 20, Apple has officially extended these discounts on USB-C accessories (including the monitors) to the end of March 2017. All other details about the discounted pricing is the same as before. Original story: Apple is offering an olive branch to new MacBook and MacBook Pro buyers annoyed that their old stuff won't work with their new laptops. The company is discounting most of the USB-C cables, dongles, and accessories it sells in its online and retail stores. The downside? The discounts only last from now until the end of the year, and prices will presumably go back up after that. The USB-C to USB adapter goes from $19 to $9; the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter drops from $49 to $29; the USB-C to Lightning cable goes from $25 to $19 for one-meter cables and from $35 to $29 for two-meter cables; both the HDMI and VGA versions of Apple's multi-port dongles drop from $69 to $49; and SanDisk's Extreme Pro SD card reader drops from $49 to $29. All other third-party USB-C cables and peripherals will be discounted by about 25 percent. The only excluded products are Apple's USB-C power adapters and the USB-C charge cables sold for use with those power adapters. The temporary price cuts won't completely compensate for the annoyance of having to use dongles in the first place, but they'll help. They may also dissuade buyers from hopping on Amazon and buying cheaper but potentially faulty or non-certified cables and accessories (plenty of perfectly good accessories are out there, too, but finding the rose among thorns isn't easy). It would be great to see some of these price cuts become permanent in the new year. Andrew Cunningham Andrew has a B.A. in Classics from Kenyon College and has over five years of experience in IT.

The price cuts were announced at the beginning of November, shortly after the introduction of the MacBook Pro and amid a flurry of complaints from potential buyers about the computer’s lack of commonly used ports. Because it only has USB-C ports, new cables or adaptors are needed to connect pretty much anything a person already owns, tacking on added costs to the computer and potentially requiring more devices to be carried around. While temporarily cutting the price on USB-C cables by no means solves the problem created by the MacBook Pro’s questionable port situation, it does help to address it for existing owners. Apple’s cables are some of the best that you can buy. And with these price cuts, they’re available at what are actually reasonable prices. Here’s the breakdown: USB-C to traditional USB adapter from $19 to $9 Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter from $49 to $29 USB-C to Lightning cable (1 meter) from $25 to $19 USB-C to Lightning cable (2 meters) from $35 to $29 Multiport adapter with HDMI, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 Multiport adapter with VGA, USB, and USB-C from $69 to $49 All third-party USB-C peripherals sold by Apple will receive around a 25 percent price cut. Only Apple’s USB-C charging cables aren’t being discounted. In addition to extending the cable discount, Apple is also beginning to ship LG’s UltraFine 5K Display and extending a sale on it — from $1,299 to $974 — to March 31st. Discussion around the MacBook Pro’s port situation has died down some since November, but another issue has popped up since: the computer’s surprisingly short battery life. Apple recently removed the “time remaining” estimate from all MacBooks as a way to hide resolve the issue (the counter was inconsistent on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, though it’s always seemed to work just fine on other MacBooks), but it didn’t change the actual battery life, nor the fact that buyers continue to experience frustrations with the new Pro.

The program was recently named app of the year by both Google and Apple. Prisma app turned photo into artwork (Photo: Prisma) LOS ANGELES — The young Russians who created the Prisma app had an amazing 2016: both Google and Apple called their tool to turn photos into artwork the app of the year. With 85 million downloads in less than six months, and the top nod from the digital giants, how do you follow that up? By getting more people to use their app, consistently. Prisma is releasing an update Tuesday that brings in community features. Folks can now share their works with other Prisma members on the free app, rather than confining the sharing to the social networks like Instagram and Facebook. “It will make our users come back to the app more often,” says co-founder Aram Airapetyan, 22, who is known online in his LinkedIn and Facebook profiles as Aram Hardy. Before, “we had no feed,” he adds. “You had to make it and share to Instagram or Facebook.” Prisma co-founder Aram Hardy  (Photo: Aram Hardy) Prisma co-founder Aram Airapetyan, via the Prisma app, which uses artificial intelligence to turn a photo into artwork.  (Photo: Aram Airapetyan) With Prisma, you take a photo or video with your Apple or Android smartphone, and then use the app to paint over in the style of the masters, with one of 20-plus filters that range from the looks of a graphic novel to black and white line drawings and watercolor effects. With the update, the finished work goes directly into the Prisma feed, and “the more likes the post gets, the further the post gets, it could cover the whole world,” says Airapetyan, in a Facebook Messenger chat with USA TODAY from his Moscow apartment. The new update also opens up finished photos to a larger aspect ratio. Previously photos were only as square, like the original Instagram images. The last update for Prisma didn’t go as well as Airapetyan had wanted. It brought the ability to put on artistic filters in live videos on Facebook, but Facebook immediately shut it down. “They don’t let third party apps stream to Facebook,” says Airapetyan. “We respect their policy.” He vows to find another platform for the live feed. Apple awarded app of the year status to the Prisma app--as did Google as well.  (Photo: Apple) In giving the award to Prisma, Apple called the app and its use of artificial intelligence “too cool for words.” There have been other apps that turned your photo into artwork, like Pikazo and Malevich, but “they were too slow,” says Airapetyan. “We managed to speed it up — we could repaint a picture in less than a second. That was the breakthrough.” (Videos take considerably longer--up to as much as a minute.) Neural networks are used to extract the information from the photo, and create a new image, in the style of the masters. Meanwhile, from Russia, the recent university graduate says he works through the evening (we did our interview at 3 a.m. Moscow time) so that he can be on the same time zone as the United States, which is a 11-hour time difference with California. The USA, India and Russia are Prisma’s three biggest source of users, he adds.

So this is a big win for the Russian tech community, which hasn't exactly been garnering positive headlines of late here. Instead, they usually concern hackers thought to have meddled with the U.S. presidential campaign on behalf of the Russian government. What does Airapetyan want us to know about the Russian tech scene? “We’re just normal, kind people, just trying to bring some cool features to the tech industry worldwide,” he says. The advantage of starting the firm in Russia vs.  Silicon Valley is that “it’s cheaper,” and “all our friends are here,” who they could tap to work, he said. Airapetyan and co-founder/CEO Alexy Moiseenkov have a team of 15 people working with them, including two staffers in an office in San Francisco, but the co-founders spend most of their time working from their apartments. “The traffic is Moscow is really bad,” says Airapetyan. “I can get more done by staying here.” Follow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham, and listen to the daily #TalkingTech podcast on iTunes and Stitcher.  47 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ibUS9z NEVER MISS OUT Tech Be the earliest adopter.
