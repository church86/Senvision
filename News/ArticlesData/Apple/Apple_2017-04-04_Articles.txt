X Future looks bleak for shrinking Imagination London letter: Unless it can compromise with Apple, it may have to call in the lawyers about an hour ago Fiona Walsh A battle with a company with pockets as deep as Apple’s is a daunting prospect. Phtograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters         A year ago, tech giant Apple was weighing up a takeover of Imagination Technologies, the Hertfordshire-based company behind the graphics in its iPhones, iPads, iPods, TVs and watches. Talks were said to have reached an advanced stage but ultimately came to nothing after Apple decided against making a move. At the time, the cost of buying the British firm would have been about £500 million – small change to the biggest company in the world. Now Apple has gone from would-be suitor to grim executioner, dealing what looks to be a death blow to the British firm, which relies on the US group for more than half its revenues. Shares in Imagination crashed by more than 60 per cent on Monday as the company revealed that its largest customer will soon no longer require its services. Instead, Apple plans to develop its own graphics chips and will be withdrawing its business from Imagination over the next couple of years. Failed talks The news shocked the market. One analyst, Neil Campling at Northern Trust, described it as a “black swan” moment for Imagination. “There is no way they could have seen that coming,” he said. But perhaps Imagination – and the market – should have seen it coming. After the failed takeover talks last year, Apple started picking off key staff and is thought to have poached at least two dozen of Imagination’s senior executives and engineers, including its long-serving chief operating officer, John Metcalfe. Imagination last year dismissed reports of a “brain-drain” from its business, saying it was simply part of the normal staff interchange between tech firms. But at the time it was already widely rumoured in the industry that Apple wanted to build its own in-house graphics team. Now the rumour has become fact, the future looks bleak for Imagination. Once Apple ceases to use its intellectual property, the company will lose the right to royalty payments – more than half its annual revenue of about £120 million (€139 million). It does not intend to go down without a fight, however, and unless the two companies can thrash out some sort of compromise, it looks as though the matter will end up in the hands of the lawyers. A battle with a company with pockets as deep as Apple’s is a daunting prospect indeed. Intellectual property While Imagination was relatively restrained in its choice of words, the company made clear its doubts that Apple will be able to go ahead with its own operation without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. It would, Imagination said, be “extremely challenging” to design new graphics from basics without doing so. It has requested evidence from Apple to prove otherwise, but that has not been forthcoming. No doubt the lawyers will be repeating that request in the weeks ahead. In the meantime, the prospect of a costly legal battle with the most powerful tech company in the world simply adds to Imagination’s woes. After their calamitous plunge on Monday, Imagination’s shares bounced back by more than 10 per cent on Tuesday on speculation that the business may now be broken up or attract the attentions of a bargain-hunting bidder, possibly from China. There were even suggestions that Apple might be plotting to renew its own takeover ambitions at the new, knockdown price. After all, it is one of the British company’s largest shareholders, having built up a stake of more than 8 per cent some years ago. Even in the ruthless world of big business, that seems an unlikely – and certainly unwise – scenario. Having caused the share price collapse in the first place, what Apple might save financially by such a move would be more than outweighed by a torrent of bad publicity on bully-boy tactics. Grocery prices A big jump in the price of staple grocery products such as tea, butter and fish has persuaded more UK shoppers to switch to discount chains Aldi and Lidl in recent months. The average household shopping bill increased by £21.31 in the first quarter of the year, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, as prices rose by 2.3 per cent over the period. The return to food-price inflation follows a lengthy period of deflation, fuelled by intense price-cutting and promotional activity by the supermarket chains. This has now tailed off significantly, data from another research firm, Nielsen, showed promotional activity down to its lowest level in more than a decade. Kantar puts the combined market share of Aldi and Lidl at a record 11.7 per cent. As both companies continued their ambitious store-opening programmes, they brought in an extra 1.1 million shoppers over the three months.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone.

Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music.

Forget about specs, there was also a rumor saying that iPhone 8 will cost more than $1000 at retail. The reasons behind this ultra-high cost are it's new OLED display and also 3D sensors equipped in it. Now, a report by UBS analyst Steven Milunovich breaks the previously rumored price tag. It says this phone will cost less than $1000. So, this rumor can be considered as a good news for eagerly awaiting iPhone buyers. Though the price is not tagged over $1000, it will surely be costlier compared to the previous iPhone's in a market. This may not be a surprise since everyone was expecting the same. Also Read: Apple iPhone 8 to feature Liquid Metal Glass Back According to Milunovich, the factory cost of iPhone 8 with the 64GB variant will be higher by $70 to $90 than the previous model 32GB iPhone 7s Plus. So, the price may vary from $850 to $900 when it reaches the market. Since iPhone 7 Plus of 32GB variant is offered at $769, the price of iPhone 8 may not make a huge difference for the consumers. So, we can expect a large number of buyers this time. He noted,"Apple customers seem fine with paying more for products they feel are differentiated." Also Read: Apple rolls out iOS 10.3.1 with bug fixes and security patches According to him, the OLED iPhone 8 is said to account for 45 percent of shipments in 2018. He also made a comparison with it's rival Samsung by saying, "Apple's top model will be at a display size disadvantage to Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus. We still think Apple will choose to price its top model relative to Samsung's top model but remain cautious on how much higher Apple could ultimately go on price given a smaller display".

The design was uniquely Apple and was done quite impressively. A few years later, the Cupertino company improved on the older iMac and made it even sexier by giving it a tapered edge. That being said, given that the iMac is what it is right now, not a lot can be done at all in terms of aesthetics. Nevertheless, it would seem that Apple has something in mind that will make iMac users very happy indeed. A recent patent filing from Apple revealed that it is now considering, what appears to be, a Touch Bar version of the Magic Keyboard. Not only that, the patent also includes support for the TouchID just like the 2016 MacBook Pro. For those who do not remember, this particular feature for the Magic Keyboard has been speculated the moment the Touch Bar was featured on the 2016 MacBook Pro. In fact, a number of third-party renderings surfaced online showing what it could possibly look like. Touch Bar patent document (via patentlyapple.com) Unfortunately, the patent in question is rather new. According to Patently Apple, the USPTO released the document just last Thursday. However, since Apple has already used the technology on the MacBook Pro, it is only a matter of time before it ends up on a standalone keyboard like the Magic Keyboard. It should be noted that the TouchID and Touch Bar features on the Magic Keyboard is still an idea at this time. At the moment, it is still uncertain whether or not Apple will act upon this patent and have it as an official product. However, knowing Apple and its reluctance to include touch screen support for the iMac, this feature is a pretty good compromise. Consumers can only hope that Apple will include the Touch Bar on the next iteration of the iMac. That said, the company already announced that it will release an iMac upgrade later this year. Whether or not the Touch Bar-enabled Magic Keyboard will be include, could be anyone’s guess. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

While the design is indeed quite revolutionary, it still lagged behind in terms of performance. Furthermore, the Mac Pro is also steeply priced compared to a system with the same specifications. The only good thing that can be taken out of this is that Apple is aware that it failed to deliver on the Mac Pro. In fact, it apologized for it in a recent roundtable discussion with a number of journalists. According to Daring Fireball, Apple is very aware that the 2013 Mac Pro is somewhat lacking. In fact, a lot of Macintosh buyers from the previous years opted for the 5K Retina iMac rather than the Mac Pro. Because of this, Apple has dedicated a good portion of its design team for the said computer. Mac Pro (via apple.com) Right now, Apple is diligently redesigning the entirety of its high-end workstation. In the same article from Daring Fireball, Apple wants to design the new Mac Pro so it can be easily upgraded regularly. This means that the upcoming hardware will feature a modular design as well as a separate display specially made for it. Unfortunately, this redesign means that Apple will need far more than a year to get its acts sorted. The best case scenario will be that Apple will release the new and improved hardware sometime next year. In the interim, fans of the high-end workstation would have to wait a little bit longer before they get their hands on a newer and better system. Nevertheless, to make things a bit more palatable, Apple introduced a few minor upgrades on the current Mac Pro lineup. The entry level $2,999 will now have a six-core Xeon processor instead of four cores. As well as dual AMD G500 GPUs instead of AMD G300. The mid-level version will be upgraded from six cores to eight core and a dual AMD D800 GPU instead of D500. Fore more updates on the Mac Pro, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews iPhone iPhone Pro Is Not Real: Here’s All You Need To Know About The iPhone 8 In Pricing, Specs & Release By Necta Casiple on April 5, 2017 12:53 PM Apple remains tight-lipped about its next iPhone from its specs to its official name. While rumors are all in agreement on what the iPhone 2017 will have to offer, not all of them agree on what the product will be commercially called. If you follow the reports, you should know that the top pick right now is ‘iPhone 8,’ although there are other names in the lineup as well like ‘iPhone Edition’ and ‘iPhone X.’ Yet, none of those actually make sense. Enter “iPhone Pro,” the “most logical” moniker for the 10th-anniversary smartphone of the Cupertino-based company. Claims of such stems from apparent hints the company dropped in the past. The Mythical iPhone Pro We can recall that Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the company has extensive plans for its Pro line. “The Pro area is very important to us,” he said during a Q&A session on February’s shareholder meeting. “The creative area is very important to us in particular.” Indeed, Apple made significant changes to its Pro line recently. For starters, Apple discontinued the MacBook Air line this year, leaving MacBook and MacBook Pro the only laptop choices. Sure, there still might be MacBook Air models available in the market today, but Mac Rumors expect the company not to update the machines anymore. Same applies to iPad Air, so patrons can only shop for iPad or iPad Pro at this point. Although the iPad Mini is still available in the Apple Store. Using the same logic, many believe the company might be getting rid of the iPhone numbers this year. Thus, the next iPhone will simply be called the iPhone Pro. If you think about it, it kind of makes sense. The BitBag even wrote an iPhone Pro story in jest last April 1st, and we were surprised at the interest it produced, so we know that the concept is worth some serious thought. Nonetheless, the so-called iPhone Pro remains a myth today. Even its existence alone is yet to be confirmed. Patrons shouldn’t expect to hear anything from Apple, though. If there’s one thing we know about the company, it’s that it does not address any claim until the product launch. This means everything about the iPhone 8 will remain a speculation until then. In the meantime, here’s everything we know about the device: Specs Since Apple is celebrating its 10-year anniversary, we can expect a major iPhone redesign planned for 2017. Rumors are rife that it will specifically sport an edge-to-edge display that gets rid of the top and bottom bezels where features like the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the front-facing camera are originally housed. Instead, Apple could build those directly into the display. As for the body, Apple could be ditching the aluminum used in the iPhone 5, 5s, 6, 6s, 7, and SE, and re-adopting iPhone 4’s body instead. The glass will be built around an aluminum or stainless steel frame. There were talks that the device will feature a size similar to the 5.8-inch Samsung Galaxy S8, but a recent forecast from UBS indicate it’ll come slightly smaller at 5.2-inches. The display will be OLED rather than an LCD for less power consumption and better screen display. Whether or not the edges will be curved remains unclear at this point. Camera-wise, the iPhone will feature image stabilization and 3D sensing capabilities. Other rumored features likely coming to the iPhone include a 10-nanometer A11 chip, wireless charging, and biometric additions like iris, facial, or gesture recognition. Apple is expected to retain the predecessor’s water resistance too, although it may have an improved IP68 water resistance rating. Here’s an iPhone 8 concept based on the rumors: Pricing Multiple rumors claim that the iPhone 8 will cost over $1,000 due to the aforementioned high-end specs. However, UBS said in a note recently that it doesn’t expect its cost to hit four figures this year. Analyst Steven Milunovich believes that a $1000 price tag would hamper purchase volumes, noting that the tech giant sells its devices “quite competitively” in markets it enters. He estimates that the next iPhone will only have a $70 to $90 increase in construction over its predecessor, the iPhone 7 Plus (presumably the 32GB model). That should come in at a sticker price of between $850 and $900 for consumers. Accordingly, a 256GB variant will be available between $950 and $1,000. Release The iPhone 8 is believed to commence mass production with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company this month. Apple may seem ahead of its schedule, but there are claims that it will release the iPhone 8 in limited quantities this September. A wider roll-out of the phone is said to come much later in the year. Apart from iPhone 8, there are two more iPhones rumored to arrive this year. According to Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, these will be the update of the current iteration, the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus. But again, nothing is confirmed yet.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News New Ford Ranger and Everest Special Editions Coming in May Wednesday, 5 April 2017, 4:58 pm Press Release: Ford New Zealand Black is the new Black; New Ford Ranger and Everest Special Editions Coming in May • Ford New Zealand Launches New Ranger FX4 and Everest FX2, the First Special Editions based on the Award-Winning Ranger XLT and Rugged yet Refined Ford Everest SUV • Arriving in dealerships in May, the Ranger FX4 and Everest FX2, both in Shadow Black, feature tough new looks and are loaded with unique updates • Featuring SYNC®3, Ford’s latest infotainment platform, ensures the limited editions have the smarts to match its looks AUCKLAND, New Zealand 5 April 2017 – Ford New Zealand is introducing two special edition vehicles. Available from May 1, the Ford Ranger FX4 and the Ford Everest FX2 will offer customers a unique look and a bit more attitude from New Zealand’s top-selling ute and one of the most capable large SUVs on the market. In recognition of the upcoming Lions tour, the Ranger FX4 and Everest FX2 are available exclusively Shadow Black. The Ranger FX4 is limited to 200 vehicles available in New Zealand and the Everest FX2 is limited to just 50 vehicles. New Ranger FX4 The Ranger FX4 arrives as the Ford Ranger’s popularity continues to grow. In 2016, 8476 Ford Rangers sold in New Zealand – a growth rate of more than 20 per cent over 2015 sales. The Ranger has been the best-selling new vehicle in the country for the last two years. And in 2017, the Ford Ranger has already taken an early lead as the country’s number one new vehicle with an astounding 810 Ford Rangers sold in March alone. Jeremy Nash, Ford New Zealand Marketing Manager for Light Commercial and SUVs, says it is a tough ask taking a vehicle that is already a winning combination of capability and design and making it even better. “The Ranger FX4 makes a great ute even more extraordinary with its unique style and boldness, and that’s a difficult thing to do with a vehicle that already looks great and has won so many awards including the NZAA and Motoring Writers’ Guild’s Best in Class five years in a row,” said Jeremy Nash. “The designers have risen to the challenge though and done a great job with this one. We don’t expect the limited numbers to last long.” The Ranger FX4 adds the following features to the standard Ranger XLT: • Larger, Stark Grey Alloy Wheels (18-inch) with New Unique Design • Black Roof Rails • Black Bonnet and Tailgate Decal Wraps • Side Decals with ‘FX4’ Branding • Black Sports Bar, Rear Bumper, Side Steps and Door Handles • Black Grille (with Unique Design), Fog Lamp Bezels, Exterior Mirrors and Fender Features • Leather Accented ‘FX4’ Branded Seats • Front and Rear Carpet Mats • Black Interior Highlights The Ranger FX4 has an RRP of $65,390*. *Recommended Retail Price only. Price shown includes GST but excludes On Road Costs. The selling price of any vehicle is at the discretion of the selling Dealer. New Everest FX2 Based on the Everest Trend, the new Everest FX2 not only arrives as a special edition with a similar treatment as the Ranger FX4 but it is also the introduction of a RWD Everest to the range. The FX2, also on sale from 1 May, is limited to only 50 vehicles and features a number of unique enhancements including: • Rear Wheel Drive • Leather Seat trim with ‘FX2’ logo • New 18″ Alloy Wheels – Semi Gloss ‘Depth Graphite’ • Front Grille – Painted Black • Tinted Windows • Black Roof Rails • Rear & Front Guard badges – Painted Black The Ford Everest FX2 RWD has an RSP of $69,990*. *Recommended Special Price only. Price shown includes GST but excludes On Road Costs. The selling price of any vehicle is at the discretion of the selling Dealer. Beauty and Brains: SYNC3 Ranger FX4 and the Everest FX2 have the looks and, thanks to SYNC®31, the brains to match. SYNC®3 is Ford’s latest in-vehicle communications and entertainment platform that features Apple CarPlay3, Android Auto3, faster performance, more conversational voice recognition, intuitive smartphone-like touchscreen and an improved graphic user interface. SYNC3 highlights: • New ‘Home’ screen with clearer layout and large icons for quicker access to functions including audio system, climate control, smartphone (including compatible apps) and satellite navigation. • New 8.0-inch touchscreen with capacitive touch technology allows ‘pinch and swipe’ capability on select features (similar to a smartphone or tablet). • Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration includes ability to access Apple Siri4 and Google Now5 (with compatible device). • Compatible apps include Spotify6, Pandora7 and Google Maps8. • More customisable and easier-to-navigate settings and user preferences. # # # # 1 Not all SYNC® 3 features are compatible with all phones.

NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES WIN NEWSLETTER PHOTO AWARDS Search for: Your favourite iOS apps and games are about to disappear. Here’s why – and how to save them 32-bit apps and games will soon stop working on iOS, but you can keep the classics indefinitely 05 April 2017 by Stuff Staff Time was, you could trust in the permanence of your tech. Vinyl wasn’t going anywhere. Tapes felt pretty solid. Not any more: apps and games vanish from app stores on a daily basis – and we’ll soon see a far more radical upheaval, with iOS blocking access to thousands of titles. Warning signs first appeared in iOS 10 betas. When some older apps were launched, a dialogue noted they weren’t optimised for iOS 10, stating this “may affect overall system performance”. By 10.2, the wording shifted to note such an app may slow down your device, and the language in iOS 10.3 is starker still. The latest dialogue says a guilty app “will not work with future versions of iOS”. It ends: “The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility”. IT COULD BE APPAGEDDON The inference is that Apple will at some point flick a switch and remove support for 32-bit apps from 64-bit devices. There’s no way of knowing when this will happen, just that it will. We suspect the most likely moment will be the release of iOS 11 later this year. In iOS 10.3, you can at least list affected apps, by opening Settings and navigating to General > About > Applications. Those listed under ‘no updates available’ won’t work unless updated before iOS 11 arrives. For its part, Apple at least provided notice. Back in December 2014, developers were told iOS apps had to include 64-bit support. The cut-off date regarding new App Store submissions was February 1, 2015, and for updates June 1. This means any app released during the past two years or updated after June 2015 should be safe – bar other incompatibility issues. For anything else, developers must issue updates. But things aren’t quite that simple. Artist and games creator Zach Gage recently revamped his hit word game SpellTower, but tells Stuff many of his other games will “just disappear”. This is because “many no longer compile and would take loads of work to get running”, which cannot be justified, given how little they earn. NO EASY FIX Gage adds that the process of updating apps can be more complex than people realise: you’re not just prodding a button to compile a new, compliant build. “When you compile an app, you’re taking a bunch of source code you write and connecting it to APIs and libraries written by Apple and others,” he explains. “As technology changes, APIs and libraries do as well, and your code may no longer connect correctly. Fixing the connections can be a lot of work, because they can be anywhere.” Gage adds that although he recognises Apple’s decision is likely about improving the user experience through improved battery management and optimisation, the side effect is many apps being lost. “Since there’s no iOS emulation scene, we stand to lose a lot of App Store history. I’d rather Apple allowed users to turn on a 32-bit emulation mode or similar.” HOW TO KEEP THE CLASSICS Find incompatible apps Open Settings and go to General > About > Applications. Update those titles for which updates exist. For the rest, make plans to keep them safe using the steps outlined below. Save your favourites There’s no suggestion yet that Apple will remove 32-bit apps when they stop working on modern devices, but developers might do so. It therefore pays to secure copies yourself before it’s too late. Fire up iTunes and download favourite old apps and games manually. You needn’t necessarily keep them in iTunes, either: you can always back up the IPA files in your iTunes Library to an external hard drive. Source a second iDevice – and don’t update Should you later want to install such apps and games, do so through a standard iTunes sync. Naturally, this won’t be any good on a device running iOS 11 – so if you’re a big iOS gamer who can’t stand the thought of losing old classics, you’ll need to repurpose an old device (or buy one second-hand) specifically for this task, and have it run a version of iOS 10 (at the latest). It will bug you daily to update to iOS 11; avoid doing so. Stay offline Also avoid using such a device to go online, given that it won’t get security updates. Instead, make it a dedicated old-school iOS gaming device. Alternatively, embrace the present and prepare to abruptly wave goodbye to a huge chunk of iOS gaming’s past – because a slew of titles, from indie hit Bit Pilot to relative giant Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse, are now on borrowed time.

Vishal Mathur The last time Mac Pro was refreshed was in 2013, when the gorgeous black cylinder form factor made people sit up and take notice. The Mac Pro, which was Apple’s marquee computing machine at one point, had been feeling neglected off late. The last time it was refreshed was in 2013, when the gorgeous black cylinder form factor made people sit up and take notice. Now, after languishing for a while in the shadows, the Mac Pro has returned to the top of Apple’s priority list. Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, confirmed that there is a new Mac Pro in the pipeline, during a briefing at the company’s Machine Shop hardware prototyping lab. Also Read: Review | New MacBook Pro: slimmer and lighter Apple’s rethinking of the Mac Pro could revolve around a modular design that will be able to pack in top-end processors for ultimate performance, the most powerful graphics chips and the ability to install and upgrade new components along the way. In fact, the last Mac Pro refresh in 2013, despite its beautiful design, restricted the ability to install upgrades, something that was a limitation for power users. Chances are that Apple will also be working on Pro displays to go with Mac Pro. Since then, perhaps swept by the wave of a general perception that convertibles and portables will become powerful enough, Apple shifted focus from Mac Pros to the MacBook (the new Pro Retina and even the smaller 12-inch MacBook have been launched since) and making the iPad (iPad Pro 12.9 and the iPad Pro 9.7) creative productivity-centric devices. Also read: Review: Apple iPad Pro Times have also changed since the last time Apple refreshed the Mac Pro. At that time, parallel graphics chips used to be the norm for desktop computing devices, something that the industry has moved away from now. Also, professional apps are now better equipped to utilize powerful graphics solutions better, and are also designed for higher resolution displays—which necessitates the latter too. Apple will also have to ensure the new Mac Pros are capable of handling virtual reality (VR) and high-end gaming, because if it must be the benchmark computing device, that will indeed be essential. However, the new Mac Pro isn’t coming anytime soon. Apple says that the earliest we will see a new Pro will be next year. But the iMac line-ups will get the annual refresh this year, and will pack in even more powerful hardware that would also appeal to professionals and creative users.

The company will refresh the Mac Pro with powerful specs and a modular design.  Phil Schiller, Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing told BuzzFeed. We are completely rethinking the Mac Pro. And it won’t just be the computer. Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now. The new Mac Pro system will come with a separate pro display however, the fully redesigned model is not expected to be released this year. Schiller acknowledged that the current Mac Pro “was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it”. He said the company was sorry to disappoint customers. Meanwhile, Apple is refreshing its current Mac Pro models. The baseline $2,999 Mac Pro is being upgraded from a quad-core Intel Xeon E5 chip, dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics processing units (GPUs), and 12GB of RAM to a six-core Xeon chip, two AMD D500s, and 16GB of RAM; the $3,999 version is going from a 6-core Xeon E5 chip with two D500s to an octa-core Xeon chip and two D700. In addition to Mac Pros, Apple is also working on new iMacs in the that are slated for release this year. These models will feature configurations specifically targeted at large segments of the pro market.

Apple Orders Millions of Bendable Screens from Samsung By Shin Dong-heun Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory April 05, 2017 13:45 Apple has ordered 70 million bendable OLED displays from Samsung Display for use in the new iPhone 8, reports said Monday. Given that some 200 million iPhones are sold each year, about 30 percent are expected to have bendable screens. So far Apple has only used LCD panels in iPhones. Samsung is the only producer of bendable OLED panels for smartphones in the world. There have been constant rumors about the new iPhone showcasing a curved screen similar to Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 flagship phone, as the iPhone approaches its 10th anniversary. Nikkei quoted a tech analyst as saying, "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations." Samsung has shut down one LCD production line in Asan, South Chungcheong Province and replaced it with an OLED production line to meet rising demand.

Problem Solving | 03 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (3) PDF Problems Continue in 10.12.4, but Primarily Affect Developers by Adam C. Engst Numerous readers have asked me if last week’s macOS 10.12.4 update resolved more of the PDF problems we outlined in “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2” (2 January 2017). The previous 10.12.3 update addressed the most serious bug, which caused a PDF edited in Preview to lose its OCR text layer (see “Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1,” 23 January 2017). Last week, I polled the developers who had commented on the topic for my first article. The consensus was that Apple’s rewritten-for-Sierra PDFKit framework continues to improve, while simultaneously introducing new bugs. Christian Grunenberg of DEVONtechnologies said, “Since January I have added several new workarounds and improved old workarounds. The 10.12.4 release makes only one workaround obsolete and introduces a new bug.” He followed that up a few days later by saying, “In the last 24 hours I received various bug reports related to 10.12.4. In one case a PDF document freezes both DEVONthink and Preview; in another case pages are rendered white (in DEVONthink but also sometimes in Preview and both DEVONthink’s and Preview’s sidebar aren’t rendered at all); and in the last case PDF documents are rendered fuzzy.” Michael Tsai of C-Command Software initially outlined four bugs that Apple fixed in 10.12.4 and four that remain open, and a day later said that one of his customers had reported another crash that’s new in 10.12.4. The story for users is somewhat better because developers are either working around the bugs they find or quietly removing functionality until PDFKit works correctly. Michael Tsai also said that there’s a middle ground of display and scrolling glitches that can’t be worked around or avoided. Nonetheless, users continue to have problems, particularly with large or encrypted PDFs in Preview and other apps that rely on PDFKit for their PDF-related functionality. Nothing seems to be as severe as the OCR text layer deletion bug that 10.12.3 fixed, but if you experience trouble with Preview, try a different app. For merely viewing a PDF, use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. If you need to manipulate a PDF, turn to Smile’s $74.95 PDFpen, which doesn’t use PDFKit and is thus immune from these issues. Similarly unaffected is Adobe Acrobat DC, which requires a subscription that costs either $24.99 per month if billed monthly or $14.99 per month billed annually (that’s $179.88 per year). Acrobat DC is also included in the full $49.99 per month Creative Cloud subscription. To answer those who have asked if they can now upgrade to Sierra, I’d have to say that if you rely heavily on apps built on top of PDFKit for viewing and manipulating non-trivial PDFs, it’s probably worth continuing to hold off. If you mostly just read PDFs in Preview, you likely won’t hit any stumbling blocks unless you work with large or encrypted PDFs. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Take Control of PDFpen 8 Polish your PDFs with Smile's PDFpen, for a fraction of what Adobe Acrobat costs! Michael E. Cohen explains how you can create, combine, edit, annotate, and protect PDFs. Also learn how to perform and edit OCR, fill out forms, sign forms digitally, make interactive forms, and much more. Covers Mac and iOS versions! Take Control of Preview Apple’s Preview app is bundled with every Mac and yet many Mac users have only a shallow understanding of what it’s capable of. Mac experts Adam Engst and Josh Centers have plumbed Preview’s depths to create a cheerful, colorful book that explains dozens of techniques for importing, viewing, editing, and converting images in Preview. It also puts you in control of reading, annotating, manipulating, and encrypting PDFs.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Rex  2017-04-03 17:56 I am running 10.12.4 and received a 16 page PDF from my car insurance company. On page 16 are the cards that I print out to provide proof of coverage and keep in the glove box.. These show up basically as a black page or a page that you are looking through a filter and does not print correctly. I tried Acrobat Reader DC and was able to print them. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-04-04 08:04 This is reminiscent of the networking issues that were introduced in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, which also involved new technology developed by Apple. Whether this is a pattern, and what the pattern reveals about Apple's development expertise is, I'm sure, a matter of opinion. I think it's safe to say, though, that neither of these developments is a positive for the company. In the case of Yosemite, Apple was eventually obliged to revert to the old networking technologies that had been working perfectly well in OS X for years, while Yosemite never did develop into a reliable version of OS X. Nor were the problems with the new networking tech ever resolved so that it might be reintroduced. It's anybody's guess whether Apple will scrap this new version of PDFKit. If you're waiting for them to fix the bugs therein, I don't recommend holding your breath. Their track record with this sort of thing is hardly encouraging. In the meantime, spending $75 for software to work around Apple's mistakes seems to me to be a less than optimal solution, however necessary in some cases. OS X 10.11 El Capitan is a stable and supported version of OS X. If you rely on PDFs in your workflow even occasionally Sierra seems like a risky gamble. Which raises serious questions about the pending changes to the Apple file system, which have the potential to bring about problems on an unprecedented scale. If they mess this up they will stop macOS development cold and turn the whole platform into a pathetic joke. There's nothing more fundamental and essential to any OS than the file system. The longer they wait to introduce APFS the better in my opinion. They cannot spend too much time proofing their work. Apple seems to have forgotten, if they ever knew, the carpenter's maxim, measure twice, cut once. These days they don't even seem to be measuring once. That's not to say the macOS file system isn't in need of an overhaul. The issue is whether Apple is competent to implement such an overhaul. This latest boondoggle with PDFKit isn't a good sign. My gloom and doom may seem excessive; no one would be more pleased than I if Apple stopped this self-destructive cycle of behavior and gave me reason to change my toon. I don't know about you, but I'm not encouraged by this latest failure in Apple's quality control procedures. Clearly they just won't learn from their mistakes. Which means they will continue to make more of them—and we will continue to pay the price for their neglect of the fundamentals of good business. Reply barefootguru   2017-04-04 17:08 'The longer they wait to introduce APFS': Apple's busy converting some billions of iPhones & iPads, Watches and TVs to APFS as they're upgraded to iOS 10.3, tvOS 10.2, and watchOS 3.2.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !ft186c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day...

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

In an intriguing briefing with the press, Apple has done two things. Firstly, senior VP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller basically told a group of journalists that Apple was sorry for not doing anything with the Mac Pro. The second is their response. Apple will be releasing a new Mac Pro with a modular design that will accommodate the latest generation of GPUs, CPUs a touch more modern than the 22nm Intel Xeon E5-1680 V2 that shipped in 2013, and a new external display. None of these parts will arrive until 2018, although Apple confirmed that it would be updating the Mac Pro's configurations later this year. The external display won't be a touch screen, which will be of interest to those who were intrigued by Microsoft's Surface Studio. The redesigned Mac Pro will also be walking away from a dual GPU design, which Apple's VP of hardware engineering John Ternus said was limiting for users. "I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will," Techcrunch, one of the publications invited to the briefing, quoted Ternus as saying. "We designed a system that we thought with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture… that that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialise to fit that as broadly as we hoped." One of the pitches made for the Mac Pro was development for heavy 3D applications, virtual reality and GPU-intensive workloads, something the current iteration of the Mac Pro doesn't do well. Daring Fireball noted an Apple executive saying that software developers could be the largest "pro" audience (pro users being those who use a "pro" level application, like software editing, video creation and so forth at least a few times a month), although the Pro was the third most popular device among that audience. On top of that, the split between Mac laptops and Mac desktops was around 80/20, which is a decent figure given the marketing weight and brand loyalty of the Macbook line. For developers, designers and studios in need of workstations on the level of the Mac Pro, it's good news. Whether the final product will be worthwhile we'll know next year, especially when Australian pricing becomes known. (Here's hoping it at least comes with a keyboard and mouse this time.)

Reply 5 Be My Guest Apr 5, 2017, 1:46pm Now now, I have been "toiling away" with the same machine since mid-2011; it happens! Haven't updated it at all either... :/ Well apart from having the display card and the hard drive replaced, when both have screwed themselves once each... Wow, it's kind of crazy to think I've had the same desktop for six years now (an iMac) and it still runs just as well as it did then :/. I haven't installed Sierra on it though, still on Yosemite Reply 0 WiseHacker @wisehacker Apr 5, 2017, 1:49pm The external display won't be a touch screen, which will be of interest to those who were intrigued by Microsoft's Surface Studio. The redesigned Mac Pro will also be walking away from a dual GPU design, which Apple's VP of hardware engineering John Ternus said was limiting for users. And who's fault was that? Apple seems to be trying bury how they themselves put the limit there. Here's the breakdown; the Mac Pro may have had two ATi GPUs but OSX and its drivers were coded to use one for the display and the other for processing via OpenCL. It was not possible to do X-Fire (?) because it was not supported in the operating system itself. Install Windows with BootCamp though and X-Fire was possible. So, sorry Apple. We users don't see it as limited; you simply limited access to hardware a user purchased unless said users buy your competitor's OS. Reply 0 darren @darren Apr 5, 2017, 2:15pm We had a handful of macs and were able to get 3 screens going on them. Our contact at the store was super stoked when my boss told him we found some software that would do it as he was facing the same issue. His face dropped when he heard what it was. Windows. Reply 0 WiseHacker @wisehacker Apr 5, 2017, 2:21pm By handful of Macs, you mean the MacBooks and iMac, right? If these are Mac Pros, I envy your pocket book. Regardless, OSX (I refuse to call it macOS) used to be a great operating system. The API was feature rich yet light weight that making it possible to stretch the limited hardware further. Now, it is slowly devolving into a re-skinned version of iOS when the two should have been separate system with the ability to augment for a greater experience. Not, as we have now, where everything is being dumbed down to fit the iPad. Not to get too far off topic but it is the reason I don't use the newer versions of the iWork applications. The newer versions are lacking features because there was no way to make them work on an iPad. Reply 0 kolreth @kolreth Apr 5, 2017, 1:53pm A friend of mine asked me what to get in a mac pro for photoshop/illustrator for his wife's design business last year. My head asploded when I saw what shit specs they come with. A similarly priced windows PC would have gotten them a system with an 8 core I7, top end quadro card and 5 SSD scratch drives. Reply 0 ferret @ferret Apr 5, 2017, 2:28pm Any studio worth their salt has moved on from macpros a while ago now. They've completely lost a market they had cornered.

For Android users who felt that the app was lacking, not to worry as an update has arrived. This is a pretty major update because Apple has basically revamped the entire design of the Apple Music app for Android, ultimately bringing it in line with what Apple Music looks like on iOS devices. It is admittedly a bit slow especially since Apple Music’s redesign was announced at WWDC last year, but better late than never, right? The updated Apple Music will bring more or less the same features as the iOS version, where users can read lyrics to songs as they listen to music, improved navigation within the music library where you can find your downloaded songs much easier. There will be a new “For You” section, a browse section, and radio where users can tune into Beats 1 or listen to stations based on their preferences. The update is already available via Google Play so if you haven’t downloaded the app yet, you probably should if you want to take advantage of all these new features. Filed in Apple >Audio.

District Attorney John Morganelli says he's confident Palmer AutoZone shooting death will be solved quickly. Daryl NerlSpecial to The Morning Call Board to vote on providing iPads for all Easton High students The Easton Area School District is moving toward issuing every high school student and teacher an Apple iPad for academic use beginning with the 2017-18 school year . "We want [students] to have real-life experience that will prepare them for the workforce and for college and everything else," said Lisa Manzo, supervisor of education technology at Easton Area High School, who made a presentation to the school board on the proposed initiative Tuesday night. If the school board approves a contract with Apple at its next meeting on April 18, Easton would become the latest in an increasing number of school districts in the region to have a 1:1 device-to-student program. A lease-to-own contract with Apple that would provide 3,050 32-GB devices, software, staff training and cases would cost a little more than $1 million over four years. However, the net increase over what the district currently spends on technology would be negligible, Manzo said. However, parents would be expected to pay an annual $25 technology fee to the district as insurance to cover loss, theft or accidental damage to the devices. Students who get free lunches would not be expected to pay. Manzo told the board she does not expect loss to be a significant issue. She said other school districts, including New York City's, have not experienced significant problems. The district currently leases Apple AirBooks, which are provided to students on carts that are available at a 1:3 ratio while in class at the high school. The district would stop using those devices and numerous others in favor of having iPads issued to every student. Some desktop and other computers would remain, such as those in the music lab, the engineering and design lab and business lab, out of necessity for those programs, Manzo said. Manzo told the board she chose iPads over other devices, such as the Microsoft-based Chromebook, because it allows for greater student creativity, enabling them to, for example, create their own iBooks, podcasts and videos. "I know there will be some people who say, 'We don't need something like that because we didn't learn like that,'" Assistant Superintendent Alyssa Emili said. "Kids today are learning in an environment where information is at their fingertips all the time," she said, adding that teaching students to remember facts is not sufficient. "It is our responsibility now to teach our students how to take that information and apply something to that." In addition to using the devices in the classroom, students will be encouraged to take the iPads home to do homework assignments and other class projects. Parents will be expected to monitor use of the devices, though the district will install filters to prevent students from surfing the web for material unsuitable for minors, Manzo said. In classrooms, teachers will be able to block use of any student's iPad if it is being used inappropriately during lessons. The devices will be equipped with numerous apps that will allow students to complete certain assignments at home whether or not they have access to a wifi network there, Manzo said. School board Vice President Billie Weiss said she had gone through Apple training in New York to learn about using iPads. "This is a good opportunity for our students," she said. xx Daryl Nerl is a freelance writer.

Version 2.0 of the Cupertino giant’s music app is — just like what its version code suggests —a more superior or advanced version of its old self.  On Tuesday, Apple released Apple Music 2.0 on the Google Play Store. The new version, which requires Android 4.3 and up to run, comes with an all-new design that melds clarity and simplicity together. The clean look makes Apple Music easier to navigate. The large, bold headers do not only enhance the interface stylistically, they also help in ensuring that the app provides users with a simplified experience.  The update also adds lyrics to the Now Playing page. When users play a song, they’ll see the Lyrics header and the Show button at the bottom of the screen. Tapping Show will display the lyrics on the screen, while the Show button changes to Hide in case users want to remove the lyrics from their view and just focus on the Now Playing page.  The Playlists section has been added to the Library, which now includes Downloaded Music or the section where users can view the tracks they have downloaded for offline jamming. Another change that the update brings is the relocation of the New section under Browse. Now the only sidebar options in the app are Library, Browse, For You, Radio and Settings.  The For You section presents users with recommendations for playlists, albums and more based on the songs they’ve been listening to. On the other hand, Browse is for when users try to look for new music and playlists for the first time. Meanwhile, Radio gives access to Beats 1 shows and other stations for any genre.  While Apple Music 2.0 is a new version to Android devices, the update is already old news to iOS devices. Mobile Syrup reports the update was first launched to Apple users back in September 2016 alongside the launch of iOS 10.  The Apple Music app for Android has been updated to version 2.0.

Huawei kicked off sales of its flagship smartphone, the P10, in China on Saturday. The P10 is the successor to the mega-hit P9, whose sales reached a whopping 10 million units last year. The high-end smartphone is equipped with a camera developed jointly with Germany-based Leica Camera. Apple also plans to release a special edition of the iPhone 7, exclusively in red. The device reportedly gathered 270,000 preorders on the first day. Gold and red devices are normally popular in China, industry watchers said. Samsung, which showcased the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus last month, is set to hold a separate launch event in mid-April in China. The devices both adopted a double-edge display, along with a top-notch voice assistance program, named Bixby. Industry watchers, however, said Samsung is expected to face hurdles in promoting sales of the new flagship series as some Chinese consumers remain hostile against South Korean products amid the Seoul-Beijing tension over the deployment of a US missile defence system. "China is the world's biggest smartphone market and takes up a large portion of (Samsung's) global sales," an industry watcher said. "Samsung is expected to come up with aggressive marketing strategies." -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories India Keen To Buy MiG-29 Aircraft From Malaysia Najib Views India Visit As Very Successful Malaysia Offers 5% Of Places For Medical, Dentistry, Pharmacy Courses At IPTA To Foreign Students Other News Headlines Penang UMNO Hopes PAS Will Not Become Enemy Of BN- politic Pos Malaysia, Tigers Sign Pact To Offer Cross-Border E-Fulfilment Business Solutions- business Several M-League Players Under Macc Radar - Azam Baki- sports Wayang Kulit Prodigy Shadowing Parents- features Colombia Starts To Bury 273 Landslide Victims, Search Continues- world Most Read News 1.59 Million Civil Servants As Of Jan 1 - Devamany More Than 1,000 Teachers, Pupils Affected By Floods In Pitas And Beluran Running Down Country Is Not Patriotism - Salleh Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2017 BERNAMA.

The strategy, analysts say, has already reduced Apple’s dependence on critical outside suppliers like ARM Holdings Plc, now owned by SoftBank Group Corp. Apple once relied heavily on ARM to design the main processor for the iPhone, but it now licences only the basic ARM architecture and designs most of the chip itself. More recently, when Apple bought the headphone company Beats Electronics, part of a US$3 billion (RM13.3 billion) deal in 2014, it ripped out the existing, off-the-shelf communications chips and replaced them with its own custom-designed W1 Bluetooth chip. “Apple clearly got rid of all the conventional suppliers and replaced about five chips with one,” said Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside electronics devices. “Today we do much more in-house development of fundamental technologies than we used to,” Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said at a February conference. “Think of the work we do on processors or sensors. We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality.” Most vendors of consumer electronics products rely on outside suppliers for chip design and development, primarily because it is extremely expensive. That has created huge opportunities for companies like ARM, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, which have developed core technologies for processing, communications and graphics that are used by scores of vendors. Now, though, Apple is so big that it can economically create its own designs, or licence small pieces of others’ work and build on it. As with ARM and Qualcomm, the actual manufacturing of the chips is still contracted out to a semiconductor foundry, such as those run by Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. Move fast, save money Bringing more of the design work in-house cuts complexity, people familiar with the processes say. Instead of managing one or more design teams and then a fabricator, Apple has only to manage the fabricator. It may also help the company move faster — and save money — as it focuses on new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality. Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple plans to integrate augmented reality into its products, which makes 3-D sensors and graphics chips like Imagination’s especially important. Even before formally cutting off Imagination, Apple had given hints that it was preparing to design its own graphics processors. Specifically, it introduced a piece of its own code called Metal for app developers. App developers use Metal to make their apps talk to the graphics chip on the iPhone. By putting a piece of Apple-designed code between app developers and the phone’s chip, Apple has made it possible to swap out the chip without interrupting how the developers work. That could also make it easier to bridge the gap for developers between the graphics chips on Apple’s phones and its desktop computers, which currently require some separate coding. “By promoting Metal instead of relying on other existing standards, Apple is not only able to control what graphics chip functionality is exposed at its own pace, but also blur the line for developers between coding for desktop and mobile GPUs,” said Pius Uzamere, the founder of a virtual reality startup called Ether. Taking control of the iPhone’s chips can also help Apple keep costs down, which is especially important as it gears up for a feature-laden new iPhone this fall. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co said in a research note that he thinks the curved screens expected on the new phone could add as much as US$50 in cost, for example. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimates that the average price of an iPhone increased only 1 per cent to US$695 last quarter, while costs increased 8 per cent to US$420, resulting in an iPhone gross margin of 39.6 per cent. That is down from the 44 per cent average gross margin for iPhones in 2015, according to Seyrafi’s estimates. Apple spends only US$75 million a year on licencing fees for Imagination’s chips. But licencing fees to chip designers, taken together, are a significant cost for the iPhone. Apple recently sued Qualcomm for US$1 billion over licensing terms for its communications chips — which Apple would have trouble designing in-house because of patent issues. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens higher against US dollar China becomes US’ biggest oil buyer as exports hit record Kim Dotcom announces new Bitcoin venture for content uploaders to earn money Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Australia PM, Musk discuss offer to fix power woes Deutsche Bank board to meet Sunday to discuss capital hike Selangor Zakat Board targets RM700m tithe collection in 2017 Activist targets GM share structure, board Second Australia miner declares force majeure in wake of Cyclone Debbie Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Suspek guna ‘gajet senyap,’ dua iPhone dalam kereta lesap Australia to bar banks from bargaining collectively with Apple over payments Apple, Wal-Mart stick with climate pledge after Trump pivot iPhone returns to Indonesia after a year’s absence Apple plans two more Chinese research hubs as iPhone sales slow (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

He helped create the soundtrack to rap. On the sidelines of a Twitch SXSW event, the hip-hop forebear raises his eyebrows at trading turntables for a Touch Bar. Tech Culture by Joan E. Solsman April 1, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @joan_e Design by Aaron Robinson/CNET To Grandmaster Flash, technology is a gift and a curse. The hip-hop icon loves no longer paying a fortune in power bills to fuel a roomful of mixing gear. But when a DJ steps onto stage only to twiddle with a MacBook Pro's Touch Bar instead of putting fingers to vinyl, he has stern advice about swapping showmanship for tech simplicity: "Go try another profession." "The Touch Bar ... you're not really doing that. The technology that's in the operating system is really doing that," he said. "So, what are you doing?" (Apple didn't offer a rebuttal.) Enlarge Image Grandmaster Flash DJs a SXSW event hosted by Twitch and Reddit. SPF Studios Flash, born Joseph Saddler, is one of hip-hop's "holy trinity" of forefathers, three DJs in the 1970s Bronx in New York City who made an art out of mixing records on turntables that an MC could rap over. By committing a cardinal sin of vinyl LPs -- scratching records backward -- Flash perfected turning 10-second musical breaks into 10 minutes of beats and helped invent a genre that is now a multibillion-dollar industry. Speaking on the sidelines of SXSW before a Twitch event, Flash discussed technology, the showmanship of DJing and a resurgence of interest in hip-hop's founding through things like Netflix's original series "The Get-Down." The following is an edited Q&A. Something I always wonder, when a company like Apple unveils a new laptop, and it brings a DJ up on stage to to mix on a little Touch Bar: If Grandmaster Flash were watching this right now, what would he say? Grandmaster Flash: Mixing with the laptop? "Scratching" with your fingers on a Touch Bar. Flash: [Long pause] I would say technology has come a long way. [Long pause] And I would watch him for a few minutes. [Long pause] And I would ask him, "Out of all the apparatuses and hardware that you could do it, why are you doing it that way?" Enlarge Image Flash said the best platform for DJ showmanship "will always be ... turntables." SPF Studios The audience wants to see you perform. And as a DJ, the best platform will always be turntables. Especially if you play multiple genres of music, the [beats per minute] fluctuate on all songs, you're constantly trying to lock it in so that one beat connects on time to the next one. People want to see the constant battle going on. It's something for them to look at, as opposed to [having] something that does it for you. I won't say that it's right or wrong, left or right, black or white. But why? Is that the question you ask yourself, as technology has changed so much over the course of your career? Why should I choose this tech versus that? Flash: I look at 2017 as the year of cyclical. Everything comes in cycles. There has never been this much awareness for yesterday, of what was taking place in the '70s. So many people are trying to replicate what was. And in the age of the DJ, anybody that's choosing a piece of hardware, a true test is turntables. DJs are like performers. Why does the operating system have to do it for you? If you have to go in your room and practice it for 100 hours, so then you have to do it, it's worth it to your fans. Have you stuck with a process for mixing or have you changed as technology has evolved? Flash: OK, I used to have a room full of all the hardware. Two things happened: The room is increasingly hot -- your power bill is out the window, it's a mortgage. And it breaks down quite a bit. So, the scientist that I am, I went on a tear in the early '90s when a lot of technology companies were making software versions of, like, a base module. Once I bought the app version, I took the hardware version and put it away. Slowly but surely, I put all my stuff away, because the wonder about technology is you can carry it with you. That's a gift in it. So went SXSW At SXSW, bots will play amid the political fray Apple Beats 1 chief wants to rekindle the record-store romance At SXSW, VR hits a new rhythm The curse is when it's doing the work for you. I find that to be an insult to the audience. If you ain't really mixing, then go try another profession. Don't cheat the audience like that. When I'm mixing sometimes, I make a mistake. They want to see you pick the arm up by accident and it gets quiet in the room. It almost gives you a chance to see me vulnerable. You could talk about that 20 years from now: "I watched somebody that the world loves, he made a mistake and I was standing there." That's something to talk about. It's in love, but it just shows we have flaws. But if you've got a computer doing it for you, then why do it? The audience deserves that, to say the least. This being the year of the cyclical -- vinyl's part of that. When streaming can put conceivably any kind of music at your fingertips, what do you think about vinyl's growing popularity? Flash: That is the ultimate litmus test of DJs. I don't know why [it's gaining popularity], but I know for a fact it's a good thing for a lot of the new up-and-coming DJs to respect the art of what this is. Enlarge Image Grandmaster Flash photographed in roughly 1983. Images Press/Getty Images For me to pull off an incredible set, I would have to bring minimum 16 milk crates of records. For an upcoming DJ, use MP3s but then switch it to analog and put two pieces of vinyl on of the same song. It's a drastic difference, and it actually makes you sharper when you go back to digital. If the internet existed during the birth of hip hop, what would have been different? Flash: We were taking so many chances, but we didn't realize we were taking chances. When we went looking for the perfect break beat inside of a song, we didn't just stay with one genre of music. We went to the pop bin and to the rock bin and to the jazz bin and to the blues bin. We didn't too much care about what people were thinking. We were just trying to find that amazing drum beat. If the internet existed back then, I don't think I cared. It doesn't matter because I was in the moment, trying to find the next break. That's pretty much the scientist, the mad geek in me. You were an associate producer on Netflix's "The Get Down," what do you think of it? I love it. Baz [Luhrmann, "The Get Down" creator] said to me, "I want to intertwine some of your history along with our story, and we're going to let it be lived through these five kids." I was good with it. He cracked a vault open that I've been trying to crack open for 15 years. Because before "The Get Down," I would sit down with people like yourself and I would explain to you what it was that we did back then, and you all would look at me like I had a third eye on my forehead. He opened a whole line of questioning for the Bronx, about people like Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaataa and myself. Wonderful, super wonderful. Special Reports: CNET's in-depth features in one place.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

The new Mac Pro and display won't launch for at least another year, and the iMacs are coming later this year, although that's as specific as Apple would get. But there's a lot of history behind the decision to break with tradition and pre-announce a bunch of new stuff that isn't even finished yet, and it comes after a series of missteps that gave the impression the company was ignoring some of its most important customers. Over the years, Apple has earned a reputation for abandoning professional users, the graphic artists, video producers, and programmers that rely on top-notch hardware to get work done. Although they're a relatively niche group today, it wasn't that long ago that professionals like these were the core of Apple's fan base. But Apple essentially ignored its pro hardware and put its engineering prowess behind more consumer-friendly products like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.© Provided by Business Insider Inc Mac Pro The current Mac Pro desktop was introduced about three and a half years ago. The Mac Mini, a sort of in-between device for "prosumers," hasn't been updated in about two and a half years. The new MacBook Pro, which launched last fall, rubbed a lot of professionals the wrong way due to its lack of common ports (meaning you needed to buy dongles to use many accessories), poor battery life, and not enough options to upgrade the memory. Meanwhile, competitors like Microsoft have swooped in to attract the pro market Apple left behind. Microsoft's new all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio, features a gorgeous touch screen display and accepts stylus input and a new method of control with the Surface Dial, which is perfect for artists and designers. And the Surface Book is a powerful Windows laptop with a touchscreen and all the ports professionals love.© Provided by Business Insider Inc microsoft surface studio Apple appears to have realized it's losing the high ground in the pro market, so it invited a small handful of journalists to its headquarters this week to chat with two top executives about its future plans to reassure one of its most dedicated fan bases that it's finally going to turn things around. In that meeting, Apple's SVP of marketing Phil Schiller and SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi revealed just enough details on their upcoming Mac Pro to whet the appetites of users who have been waiting for something new, especially a new GPU that'll help the computer push out better graphics and an Apple-made display to replace the Cinema Display that died last year. In the meantime, Apple is throwing pros a bone: The current Mac Pro was updated Tuesday with some faster chips, and those new iMacs launching later this year will get an internal boost too. But there were other curious aspects to this soft product announcement, especially the company's cagey reply when asked about the Mac Mini in the Mac lineup. Schiller said there aren't any immediate plans to update the Mac Mini, even though it's been over 900 days since its last update. Unfortunately, he didn't elaborate. The execs also reiterated that they don't want to add touchscreens to Macs, something pros have grown to love on Windows machines. It is refreshing to see Apple admit it has fallen behind. Schiller even said he was "sorry" for the slow movement in the company's pro lineup. But until Apple is able to start shipping products, there's a huge opportunity and plenty of time for its biggest competitors to capture the pro market Apple abandoned.

This could revolutionise its use. The advantage of a smartwatch with a 4G SIM card is that it is totally autonomous and does not need to have a smartphone nearby. The SIM card obviously makes it possible to communicate (phoning and sending SMS/MMS) as well as connecting to the internet via 3G or 4G. The next Apple Watch could well incorporate the new eSIM technology, meaning a SIM card built into the watch. If Apple makes this move, it will be following a general trend. The latest version of Android Wear, which is the operating system used in most of the devices that rival Apple Watch, now handles autonomous apps which can be installed directly on the watch and no longer need a smartphone to operate. This has prompted a string of manufacturers to offer smartwatches with a SIM card and 4G connectivity. Some of the more high-end examples of this include the LG Watch Sport, LG Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2. The Samsung Gear S3 is another example, using Samsung’s own Tizen operating system. The increasingly availability of smartwatches with 4G is one of the reasons why Apple cannot launch a new generation of the Apple Watch which is not standalone. It would therefore be possible to communicate, listen to music, and share on social media without the need for an iPhone nearby. ― AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Samsung’s foldable smartphone could land in 2017 Next Apple Watch could have standalone mobile connectivity Microscopic molecular cars to race in France Spotify to boost premium pay service with Universal Music deal YouTube unveils India mobile app for spotty Internet signals Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Swiss smartwatches multiply as makers hunt millennial buyers Is the MyKronoz ZeTime the future of smartwatch design?

At one time, these machines were Apple’s bread and butter. But with the explosive success of Apple’s mobile devices, many have speculated that Apple has unofficially changed its focus towards phones and tablets, leaving new development of full-fledged computers to flounder. Sure, there’s been some activity on the laptop side of things. And there have been some notable refreshes of the iMac desktop line of computers. But what about Apple’s entry-level desktop, the Mac Mini? What about the other end of the spectrum with the once cutting-edge Mac Pro? These lines have seemingly been relegated to Cupertino’s back burner, having no major updates in years. But two articles recently published by separate websites suggest that Apple hasn’t given up on either the Mini or the Pro. But there haven’t been any definitive announcements on what may come for either type of Mac. Comments made by Apple’s Phil Schiller to AppleInsider on the Mini: “On that I’ll say the Mac mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use,” Schiller said during a Tuesday press gathering revealing new iMacs and Mac Pros, attended by outfits like Daring Fireball. “The Mac mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today.” The comments could imply that Apple is finally planning to refresh the Mac mini, which was last updated in 2014 and yet still starts at $499. It’s nevertheless the cheapest Mac, and has found a niche as a server and/or a media set-top. BuzzFeed News has some information on the latest for the Mac Pro: …there is officially a new Mac Pro in the pipeline, but it’s going to be a while before it arrives. “We are completely rethinking the Mac Pro,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing said during a recent roundtable with a handful of reporters at the company’s Machine Shop hardware prototyping lab. And it won’t just be the computer. “Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now.” While any news about Apple desktops is good news these days, it’s still discouraging that Apple doesn’t have anything concrete to announce about upcoming upgrades to these computer lines.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. It's not the latest and the greatest, but iPad (5th generation) is the least expensive full-sized iPad ever — and, for some, that's the feature that matters most. This won't be an easy review for me. I'm all about bleeding-edge tech. If Apple had introduced a new iPad Pro in March, I'd have snapped it up in a heartbeat and then immediately started dreaming about what might come next. But this isn't about me. Nor does every product Apple makes in its increasing mainstream lineup have to be for me. Perspective taking is always hard and it's taken me a while to wrap my head around this new normal, but it's become increasingly important to review products in the context for which they're offered. Would I buy the iPad (5th Generation) — henceforth iPad 5 for efficiency — or recommend it to anyone like me? Not unless there was an urgent need for an extra, cheap tablet to keep in a camper or for car trips. But would I recommend it for parents, grandparents, kids, or non-tech nerds who just want an inexpensive internet or app device with a big enough screen, easy enough interface, to buy for the first time or upgrade after a long time? That's the question that needs answering, especially for people who still haven't gotten into computing or online, or have held onto previous generation iPads long enough that they're starting to need a replacement. For anyone who wants to ditch or diminish their PC, iPad Pro is there — at a price. For anyone who wants a new, full-sized iPad and doesn't want to pay a lot for it, though, is iPad 5 now the best option? See at Apple iPad 5 in brief For people who want: A less-expensive iPad High-res Retina display Access to the web and App Store Not for people who want: A Pro iPad Laminated wide-gamut display Apple Pencil and Smart Connector In brief It's not iPad Air 3. It's certainly not iPad Pro 2. Apple calls it iPad (5th Generation) but it's not a sequel to the 2012 iPad 4 either. Instead, the new 9.7-inch iPad is more an amalgam of everything that's come before. It's got the form-factor of the original Air but almost as much power as the Pro. It doesn't have Apple Pencil or Smart Connector, but it's got the lowest price tag of any full-sized iPad, ever. If you want a Pro, get a Pro. If you want an inexpensive tablet to access the web and the App Store, and a solid upgrade from iPad 2 all the way through iPad Air, get the new iPad (5th Generation). Buy now from Apple Previously, on iPad... iPad 5 combines elements of iPad Air 2, iPad Air 2, and iPad Pro 9.7. Rather than repeat review material here, please see my previous reviews. 9.7-inch iPad Pro review iPad mini 4 review iPad Air 2 review iPad Air review iPad 5 Price I don't typically begin reviews talking about price. I typically end them that way. With iPad 5, though, everything begins and ends with the price. Before the original iPad launched there was a rumor that it would cost $1000. During the iPad introduction event, Steve Jobs revealed the actual price to an "unbelievable" $499. Newer versions of the 9.7-inch iPad, from iPad 2 to iPad Air 2, all kept the same price point, even as older versions hang around at $399. The 9.7-inch iPad Pro raised the cost of entry to $599. iPad 5? $329 You're not getting a next generation iPad for that price, of course. You're not even getting last year's iPad – there wasn't one, aside from the Pro. What you are getting is an amalgam of several previous generation iPads with a jolt of new internals. It's an updated version of the screen from iPad Air 1, camera system from iPad Air 2, and chipset from iPhone 6s (the non-X version of the chipset in iPad Pro). At $329. iPad 5 Design iPad 5 is built off the iPad Air platform. Outwardly, it looks like something of a cross between the original iPad Air and iPad Air 2, with a little 9.7-inch iPad Pro thrown in. It's almost like an iPad Air 1.5 but with the missing or minimized plastic RF windows of the Pro. It's 9.4 inches (240 mm) tall, 6.6 inches (169.5 mm) wide, 0.29 inches (7.5 mm) "thin", and weighs in at 1.03 pounds (469 grams) for the Wi-Fi version and 1.05 pounds (478 grams) for the cellular version. That's the same "thinness" and weight as the original iPad Air, and 0.05 inches (1.4 mm) thicker and 0.07 pounds (9 grams) heavier than the iPad Air 2 or 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It's one of the most apparent ways in which iPad 5 is more of an iPad Air SE than an iPad Air 3. I can notice the difference when I'm holding iPad 5 and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and trying to weight them out, but just barely. The visual difference between the two casings is far more apparent. Ultimately, lightness is a boon for usability — you can hold it longer, read longer, watch longer, work longer, etc. iPad 5 is far from a back-breaker, though, which means it's likely not a deal-breaker either. Color options include silver, space gray, and gold. There's no rose gold, which remains exclusive to the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. (And there's no (matte black), jet black, or (Product) RED either, all of which remain exclusive to iPhone 7.) The lack of rose gold is irksome for those of us who like to match all our gear. In 2016, I had rose gold for just about everything. Now I have more of an eclectic mix. Maybe some colors simply don't sell as well, or Apple wants to keep some colors exclusive for premium products. Either way, I miss the options. There are no speaker grills on the top of iPad 5 because it lacks the four-speaker system of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That leaves just the dual, stereo speaker grills on the bottom, like iPad Air and iPad Air 2. There's also no mute/rotation lock switch, which Apple offered on iPad Air but eliminated on iPad Air 2 and subsequent iPads. There's also no camera bump like on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro because iPad 5 doesn't have the newer, larger camera system but rather the older, smaller 12.9-inch iPad Pro system. So, iPad 5 looks like... an iPad. It's part of the same design language that dates all the way back to the 2012 iPad mini. Rumor has it Apple is working on a new, more edge-to-edge design language for iPad. But that would be for the next-generation, not for iPad 5. iPad accessories Thanks to iPad 5 sharing the same dimensions as the original iPad Air, it's largely compatible with existing iPad Air accessories. That doesn't just include the obvious accessories that connect over Lightning cable or Bluetooth, but covers and cases as well. Best cases for iPad Best stylus pens for iPad iPad 5 Display The iPad 5 display has the same "retina" density as previous-generation 9.7-inch iPads going back to 2012 — 2048x1536 pixels at 264 pixels-per-inch (ppi). If you've used any iPad since iPad 3, then you already know how that looks. If not, from a normal viewing distance, the grid of dots disappears and all you see is the text and images on the screen. It's sRGB, same as all the other iPads up to and including the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which means no DCI-P3 wide color gamut or True Tone ambient light matching like the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. So, no deep reds, vibrant greens, or white that looks less blue or yellow and more like paper. Unless you've been using a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, though, you probably won't notice. (And if you have, you're probably not buying an iPad 5 to replace it.) For anyone on an iPad 2, the screen will be a terrific, Retina-level upgrade. For anyone using iPad 3 to iPad Air, it'll be slightly better — and considerably lighter for all but the Air. For anyone on iPad Air 2, though, it'll be a diagonal step back. That's because iPad 5 lacks the anti-glare, laminated display, introduced on iPad Air 2. It does have the far more advanced individual calibration methods Apple has implemented in recent years, which balances at the sub-pixel level. But images don't look as though they're trapped inside the glass they way they do on iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro. They look like they're painted beneath it. iPad Pro (tablet on the left) vs. iPad 5 (tablet on the right) from two angles. So, you'll experience more glare on iPad 5 than other recent iPads. If you mostly use your iPad inside you won't have a problem. If you like to take it to the park and sit beneath the midday sun, you'll need to find a spot of shade or angle yourself to minimize it. iPad 5 Cameras We live in an age of 12 megapixels, 4K mobile cameras, with optical and cinematic image stabilization, that shoot in wide-gamut and can apply depth-of-field effects on the fly. In an age of 5-megapixel, 1080p, Retina Flash selfies and boomerang videos. The iPad 5 camera system, though, is of a previous age. iPad 5 optics are more in line with the 12-inch iPad Pro — which is to say an iPhone 6 or iPad Air 2 camera system with an iPhone 6s Image Signal Processor (ISP). That means 8 megapixels, 1080p video out back and 1.2 megapixels, 720p video up front. Yeah. If this were a new Pro, it would be show-stopper-level outdated. For a low-cost iPad, it'll be an improvement over everything from iPad 2 to iPad Air, and an ever-so-slight improvement over iPad Air 2. It does have Live Photos, though. You can both record and playback Apple's moment-captures on iPad 5, which is great. Daylight, macro, and low-light on iPad Pro (left) and iPad 5 (right). iPad photography has never been taken as seriously as iPhone, despite how powerful a large viewfinder can be for novices and professionals alike. I think that's beginning to change, though. At least I hope it is. For now, iPad 5 will work for taking everyday photos or videos in relatively well-lit situations, "scanning" papers to digitize, making fun solo or family projects, taking FaceTime or video calls, and similar tasks. iPad 5 Internals Inside every iPad 5 is an Apple A9 system-on-a-chip (SoC) with integrated M9 motion co-processor and 2 GB of RAM. It's not the A10 Fusion found in iPhone 7 or even the A9X found in the iPads Pro, but it's the exact same SoC that powers iPhone 6s. The "Fusion" in A10 involves two dual-core processors, one a high-powered set for performance, the other a lower-powered set for battery efficiency, and it enables features like simulated depth-of-field photography. The X in A9X references double the graphics cores — 12 instead of 6 — and more memory to compute more pixels and push them around faster, for truly pro-level apps like intensive 3D modelers. A9, though, is still plenty powerful for a 2048x1356 consumer-grade iPad. It's been driving the (internal resolution) 2208x1242 pixels of iPhone 6 Plus for over a year-and-a-half without any processor-level problems. Here are the Geekbench scores, by way of comparison (higher numbers are better): Chipset Single-core Multi-core iPad 5 Apple A9 2400 4400 iPhone 7 Apple A10 3306 .5426 iPad Pro Apple A9X 3200 5500 iPad Air 2 Apple A8X 1810 4530 MacBook 2016 Intel Core M 3271 6447 MacBook Air 2015 Intel Core i7 3522 6700 So, iPad 5 isn't the leap over the iPad Air 2 that iPad Pro was, especially for multi-threaded operations. But for single-threaded operations, which includes most user interactions, it's a respectable hop. Realistically, very little outside high-end graphics apps, extremely intensive photo filters, or bleeding-edge games will peg an Apple A9 chipset. If you're coming from anything other than an iPad Air 2, things will be hockey-stick-graph better. Even coming from an iPad Air 2, the single thread improvement is enough to make everything seem snappier and more responsive. iPad 5 also rated for the same 10-hours of battery life Apple's been promising for iPad going all the way back to the original. I've only had time to put it through a couple cycles, and I'm not using it as a primary computer or drawing canvas the way I do iPad Pro, but so far it's meeting if not exceeding my expectations. I'll update after I've had some more time with it, though. 2GB of RAM means iPad 5, like iPad Air 2 and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, can run two full-on apps, side-by-side, at the same time. You can browse the web and take notes at the same time or keep your messages open while working on your presentation. You can also watch picture-in-picture video, so you don't miss the movie while looking up the cast and tweeting about it at the same time. iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro have been able to do this since the feature became available but for anyone on an older iPad, it'll mean a huge boost in productivity or just plain convenience. Storage options include 32 GB, if you want a light, thin client to watch movies and work with online, or 128 GB if you want to store a lot of photos, videos, games, and documents. Wi-Fi is dual-band 802.11ac MIMO and Bluetooth is 4.2. Same as all other modern iPads. That means you can connect to everything from hotspots to AirPods quickly and efficiently. The cellular model also supports 21 bands of LTE. That's two less than the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but one more than the 12.9-inch model and iPad Air 2. If you have pro needs, you should absolutely get the pro iPad with A9X — or better, wait for Apple to drop an update pro iPad with A10/X. Otherwise, iPad 5 will be just fine for everyday apps and games. iOS 10 + Apps iPad is more than just hardware. It's iOS and the App Store that brings the hardware to life. Currently on version 10.3, iOS includes a variety of built-in apps for everything from web browsing to mail, photography to ebooks, maps to movie-making. It also gives you access to to the thousands upon thousands of tablet-optimized apps in the App Store that help you do — pretty much everything else. Nothing else offers this much high-quality, tablet-optimized software and it all runs just fine on iPad 5. iPad buyers guide iOS 10 getting started guides Our favorite apps and games iPad 5 Conclusion When iPad 2 launched, the line-up outside the Apple Store was... different. Some of my high school teachers were there. So were the fathers and mothers of my friends, uncles and aunts, even their grandparents. And there were kids. Lots of kids. There was something about iPad 2 that appealed to the mainstream in a way traditional PCs never had. They were simpler, more approachable, more friendly. So, they got iPad 2, and they held on to it. Because it worked and it kept on working. Retina didn't compel many of them to upgrade, nor did the advent of Air. But that was six years ago. This is now. And in that time, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, and even iPad Air, capable and sturdy as they may be, have aged. They can't all run all of the apps any more or use new features like split view. And so the people who bought them and held on to them are starting to look for what's next. Again, it's tough to review a product that's not meant for me. I look at the specs and features and... nope, nope, nope. Everything from the display to the camera to the chipset to the accessories are better on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. And it's hard not to just recommend that for everyone. But it's not for everyone. It's not for anyone who doesn't want to spend $599 just to get in the door. Which is why iPad 5 exists and starts at just $329. At $329, a lot of those nope, nope, nope, nopes... don't disappear, but become well, well, well, wells... It's not an iPad Pro 2 or an iPad Air 3 and it's not meant to be. Those would cost premium iPad dollars. iPad 5 is more like an iPad Air SE, and it costs less than ever. Just $329. My mom upgraded from an original iPad Air to an iPad Pro last year but she's an artist and Apple had her at Pencil. Several other members of my extended family are still on older iPads and aren't able to run newer versions of iOS or use newer features like split-view. They're starting to think about an upgrade but they don't want to pay Pro prices for it. For them, iPad 5 moves beyond even a well and becomes well-qualified yes.

I'm getting one and will keep it for years. I'm getting one for a family member too. I think a lot of other friends and family members will be getting them too. I need writing (in portrait!), photo editing, multitasking, Touch ID, and Bluetooth. I don't need an Apple Pencil. I don't want a landscape writing Smart Connector keyboard. I want the laminated display, but I don't need it. If I had an iPad Air 2, I would keep it. I'm used to an iPad mini 2, which means I won't notice what I'm missing. Apple needs better Pro features on the iPad Pro. A bigger "goldie locks" screen would be such a feature. The laminated display is another. (True Tone I would turn off.) Being able to used a second iPad as a second screen would be another great feature. (Apple has set up for that pretty well: combine a 10.5 and a 7.9 or a 12.9 and a 9.7 for a nice even match.) 0 1 day ago Reply lvavila As an owner of the iPad1 I shake my head while holding it in hand. At the same time two iPad2's still provide a valued service (for my mom and my 6 year old). Processing is not the problem, it's storage (16gb). I love and respect Apply products but from any vendor, all features can be considered as a borderline gimmick. Look at latest offering of MS Office365. Many of us still only use about 2-4% of its capability since 2000. Today Office 2003 still works for me. I think many poeple chase bling and features while there is a huge market for products that offer great "base" functionality at an affordable price. With that said I too am looking at the iPad 5 to maybe replace my 2's. Funny as those iPad 2s (for now) will be velcroed in the house to function as Sonos keypads, continuing to provide months (if not years) of service). 1 1 day ago Reply melgross I agree about reuse. I bought every iPad except the 4 and the pro 9.7. I still have most here, except that we gave some away, as after my daughter stops using hers, it's given to a friend who can't afford it. Otherwise, my wife refuses to let me buy a new one for her, so she takes my last year's model. Some of the older ones we still have are reused for less demanding tasks as you have done. I have two in my shops. The only one that's not still used is the original model. 0 1 day ago Reply taife32 I'm also very keen on this iPad.

The tablet market is nothing like that of the smartphone. Majority of the people who buy iPads want it for consumption of media and to games to keep their kids occupied. This is why up until recently the iPad 2 was still being sold. Now there is a much lower barrier of entry for those looking for an iPad 1 1 day ago Reply kfoster79 Not sure why this comment was given a thumbs down as its 100% correct. (Okay it may not have been a thumbs down once I looked again) Come the holidays you will find the iPad 5 on sale for 250ish and maybe even a gift card thrown in around black Friday. Apple needs to get more, and newer, iPads in the hands of people. This is why Amazon is selling disposable fire tables as portals to the ecosystem and consumption devices. A majority of people with tablets just want to be able to surf the internet, facebook, twitter etc., and watch videos. The Pro, and pro spec devices, are niche markets as Rene tried to point out, but honestly it came off more as bagging on what might be the best tablet for the money. Anyone reading this review who was just looking for an opinion on the iPad 5 may read this has "well its good enough" when in reality it's the best buy for most people looking for a new tablet. 0 15 hours ago Reply jblank I get visibly uncomfortable when I see you put iPad's and iPhone's face down on bricks or other types of masonry. I'll never understand why you guys do that, but thanks for the excellent review. 0 1 day ago Reply m4mario Because the screens are more scratch resistant than the back. 0 1 day ago Reply jblank Doesn't matter, it's masonry, very rough. 0 17 hours ago Reply melgross Sheesh! Ok, we get it, it's not for you. You don't have to keep pointing out how much more serious you are, as though we won't know that unless you keep telling us. I also use the iPad Pro 12.9". But I've tried this one out, and quite frankly, for most everything, the performance matches it. It's actually faster with some games, as the lower screen resolution enables faster rendering and display. I don't have a Pro 9.7 to compare it to, but it's also faster than my old Air 2. The screen is about the same, though Apple is correct about it being brighter than the one in the iPad Air 2, which I compared it too. Truthfully, you really need to concentrate to feel the difference in weight between the 5 and the Air 2. A lot will depend on which hand either is being held by, as one will always be stronger. Switch back and forth. But it's just a third of an ounce in 16 ounces, so it's minuscule. Overall, this is a great tablet. 0 1 day ago Reply cuttheredwire While I feel the same way, I also empathize with Rene. He loves to see what Apple will come up with next. This feels like last years iPad, which is fine for me and most others, but he wants the "real" 2017 iPad. This is anticlimactic for any iPad Air 2 or Pro owner that wants to upgrade. Point being that his sentiment is common throughout the customer base. (By the way, the screen is supposed to be worse: it's not lamented.) I'm sure they'll announce new Pro models with new innovative features this year. (And then Samsung will copy it later.) 0 1 day ago Reply taife32 Samsung has not copied Apple on the tablet for a while now. Samsung came with the small tablet first, and they have had the pencil as S Pen from 2011 when Apple was still laughing at the Stylus.

But it *is* the latest, isn't it? 0 21 hours ago Reply ggore While my iPad is getting a little long in the tooth and I would like to replace it at some point in the not too distant future, I have put off the upgrade for a while, simply due to their going backwards with the screen in this new iPad model. Downgrading from the laminated screen that has been on iPads for several years now, to the old design, which makes the iPad thicker the the previous model is a stupid decision and is evidently purely a move to get people to go for the much more expensive iPad Pro model. 0 20 hours ago Reply Glaurung-quena "is evidently purely a move to get people to go for the much more expensive iPad Pro model." No, it's a move to enable them to lower the price. Laminated screens are expensive. Taking that out was probably the single biggest thing that let them lower the price so far. 0 13 hours ago Reply Decodering Even though I would have loved to replace my iPad Air (first gen) with an iPad Pro, I ended up opting for the new iPad. The Air is a great machine, even three+ years on. But there were a few things that made me want to upgrade, especially the Touch ID, faster processor, and updated Bluetooth. I found that I couldn't really justify the price of the Pro for my usage, but the new Air offers the upgrades that I wanted at a price I wanted to pay. So while I wish I had the display benefits of the Pro and the smart connector for an attachable keyboard, in my actual usage the new Air is a really fantastic choice and price. 0 20 hours ago Reply rens51 THE disappointing thing is that Apple charges in Europe 409 Euro ( = ± 438 USD) iso 329 USD, this 33% up can not be explained by sales tax! 0 19 hours ago Reply johnathanblade I feel like you are underselling the significance of Apple promoting a product that is actually aimed at regular consumers, value-wise. The iPhone SE doesn't count IMO, as you are taking a hit in functionality b/c of the reduced screensize. For the iPad though, you get a full sized, sufficiently powerful iPad that people can actually justify buying. Trying to market the Pro as a PC replacement is a iffy proposition, IMO. Quality easy computing for the masses? That's the ticket! 0 14 hours ago Reply Glaurung-quena In 2010 when the very first Ipad came out, it cost about as much as a generic consumer laptop.

By Lory Gil Monday, Apr 3, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 8 Comments Is Night Shift any different than f.lux? Will one bork the other if I have both installed? f.lux is a software program that puts a warm filter across your computer screen in the evening to reduce the unnatural blue hue that can affect your sleep cycle. It's been around for years, and I've had it installed on all of my Mac computers for as long as I can remember. Apple launched Night Shift for Mac with macOS 10.12.4, which also puts a warm filter across your screen in the evening to reduce the unnatural blue hue that can affect your sleep cycle. It automatically appears in Notification Center on your Mac when you update. There are subtle difference between the two that go beyond just customization features. Some have also been wondering what happens when you have both f.lux and Night Shift enabled on Mac. What does f.lux have that Night Shift Doesn't? Night Shift gives you some adjustability of start and end times for when it changes your screen hue and has a color temperature slider so you can increase or decrease the level of effect, but that's about it. Night Shift is great to set-it-and-forget-it. You don't have many customization features, but you also don't have to think about it. You might even forget it's working after a while. f.lux, on the other hand, has four preset templates based on different circumstances (like "Working late" and "Recommended colors"). It also has three different effect settings — Daytime (no effect), Sunset (light effect), and bedtime (heavy effect). You can adjust the level of effect for each setting. It also has a variety of options for when the effect takes place, like "Sleep in on Weekends" and "Expanded daytime settings," which sets the screen warmer throughout your work day. Additionally, f.lux has three unique color effects for certain occasions — Darkroom, Theater Mode, and OS X Dark Theme at Sunset. What about the color differences? f.lux has been available since 2009. The team that developed the program has been researching the circadian rhythm and tweaking its software to fit the different needs of everyone. That's why there are so many customization features and so many different lighting effects and options. But, customization isn't the only thing that flux has been working on. The color range that f.lux offers goes a little bit deeper than simply adding a warm filter to your screen. Apple did a fantastic job creating a feature that will help reduce the blue hue your eyes see when looking at your computer screen, and it's great for most people, but f.lux has more benefits for people that stare at their computer screen late at night and subsequently have trouble falling asleep. The f.lux development team explains in its forums: Every person has individual needs, and those needs are different based on your sensitivity to light, your own chronobiology (imagine early birds and night owls), your own schedule, and other factors too. Those needs change across seasons, and over your lifetime. Today our approach is different: we are working every day to understand how light affects human biology, not strictly sleep, and we are constantly applying what we learn to updates and new features for f.lux. Night Shift default mode at bedtime f.lux default mode at bedtime Why is Night Shift so subtle, then? Apple has a broad spectrum of consumers to please. You may recall when Night Shift first came out on iOS, critiques blasted the feature as ruining the look of the screen. It makes sense that Apple would roll out a base-level Night Shift mode that is helpful, but not intrusive. I believe that most people that have experienced issues with sleeping due to too much blue light screen time have already found a program like f.lux, and have been using it to dim and warm their screens for years. For the rest, there's Night Shift. It warms the screen without causing much disruption to a person's computing activities. You can set it and forget it and won't be irritated when it triggers while you're reading something at night. Can I use both? Sort of. You can have both f.lux and macOS 10.12.4 installed on your Mac. You can have both f.lux and Night Shift enabled. The problem is that the effect is doubled when both programs are active. When you turn on Night Shift and set one of f.lux's settings, both happen, making the effect a little more intense. Night Shift gets a little more orange (or vice-versa). So, while you can have both programs installed and enabled, it doesn't really do you any good. It actually disrupts your preferred customization settings. You don't really want to use both. If you don't usually look at your Mac's screen right before bedtime and you don't really have trouble getting to sleep at night, you'll be just fine using Night Shift. If you are looking for something that will benefit you a little more — darken your screen and remove more blue light right before bedtime — you might want to stick with f.lux. What do you think? Are you using f.lux? Is Night Shift more your speed? Tell us about your experience in the comments section.

The best way to switch to a night mode is to invert some values from white to black, many backgrounds are white and that bothers at night (too bright). Like FaceTime as example, works great on that configuration. iMessage should be that way too. 1 1 day ago Reply Garden of Earthly Delights For those with older Macs, f.lux is the only option. 0 1 day ago Reply Emeroid You can use a 'safe' hack. Look for Piker Alphas blog. 0 1 day ago Reply matus201 I actually wonder: how does f.lux or nightshift work? Do they modify default colour profiles? They do not just draw a shade; that would turn blacks into orange (this is what happens with Android f.lux apps that do not require root: they simply display a transparent orange square everywhere, resulting in blacks that are no longer black. Fortunately Android N fixes this omission..). 0 1 day ago Reply moooooooo flux has a great feature which Nightshift doesn't - you can disable it on a per app basis so for example if i am in Safari, i click on the flux icon, then Disable and i have the options of: for an hour - for everything until sunrise - for everything for Safari - which disables flux only when i am using Safari. If i switch to another app, flux takes over again and adjusts the colour balance depending on the time of day. Very handy. That third option changes depending on what app you're in. If i'm in Chrome it will say "for Chrome". 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK That's not the idea of Night Shift though, it's supposed to work regardless of what app you're using otherwise it defeats the purpose. You use it at night so that it's less strain on your eyes and helps you sleep better, what good is it if it keeps turning on and off depending on the app you're using? That's like having a "Dark mode" where half your apps are still white 0 19 hours ago Reply moooooooo Danny, i get what you're saying, but there are times when you have that, say English Premier League game between Manchester United and Manchester City that because i now live in NZ the timezone puts flux into where i would normally want it to be but i want it to be normal colour and so the video streaming app i have to always have flux disabled when i open it is good. That is to say - if i open that video streaming app, flux is disabled and i get full colour. That is my choice. Bear in mind though, i am happy to watch a lot of things with flux managing the colour saturation as the night moves on. The above is an exception. Yes i could manually override Nightshift... but the few and far between times i use certain apps i like that flux knows that i don't want any timeshift of screen colours at all, but when i close said app, it goes back to normal. It's a personal preference and i'd rather use an app that can be tailored/configured than use a "big brother" approach to all and sundry...ie everything. 0 18 hours ago Reply DannyJJK It's definitely nice to have the choice, although if Apple was to take everyone's request, we'd essentially have a thousand different settings for Night Shift. I'm sure, given that this is on macOS, that there's a way to script it such that it disables upon opening an app and enables again when closing it, it just won't happen through Apple's defined settings 0 15 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security The Best Analysis How To Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Many other handsets also use Broadcom's naff chipset, and, as a result, we expect – and hope – a lot of other phone and tablet makers push out patches: any gadget using Broadcom's vulnerable tech is at risk to over-the-air hijacking, not just Apple's iThings. Here's a summary of the work by Google Project Zero's Gal Beniamini: the firmware running on Broadcom's wireless system-on-chip (SoC) can be tricked into overrunning its stack buffers. He was able to send carefully crafted wireless frames, with abnormal values in the metadata, to the Wi-Fi controller to overflow the firmware's stack, and combine this with the chipset's frequent timer firings to gradually overwrite specific chunks of device RAM until arbitrary code is executed. In other words, an attacker simply needs to be within Wi-Fi range to silently take over an at-risk Apple or Android device. Beniamini today detailed his research in this epic 8,500-word blog post. What he found is that Broadcom's "firmware implementation ... lags behind in terms of security. Specifically, it lacks all basic exploit mitigations – including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection." Android devices that use Broadcom's crappy SoC software include the Nexus 5, 6 and 6P, most Samsung flagship devices, plus all iPhones since the iPhone 4 and newer iPods and iPads: these will all need patching as soon as updates are available. The Android April 2017 security update should include the necessary fixes, so keep an eye out for it. The proof-of-concept exploit detailed in the blog post was successfully performed on a Nexus 6P running Android 7.1.1 version NUF26K, which was the latest available at the time of testing in February. Project Zero didn't go to work as a hit job on Broadcom, Beniamini says. Rather, most vulnerability research focuses on application processors. Peripherals like Broadcom's Wi-Fi SoC don't get the same degree of scrutiny, and Broadcom is the nine-hundred-pound gorilla in the business. Only the beginning: the Wi-Fi SoC is just one attack surface in a smartphone After a lot of work to extract and analyse the chip's firmware – the blog post thanks various peeps for their assistance – and identify the Wi-Fi handling code in the binary image, Beniamini settled on Broadcom's implementation of tunneled direct link setup (TDLS). Published as a standard in 2011 and given Wi-Fi Alliance certification in 2012, TDLS lets devices exchange data as peers, without passing data through an access point, as long as they're both associated with the same access point – for example, to send video from a phone to a Chromecast without clogging up the rest of the network. TDLS has two characteristics that make it an attractive attack vector: It's an automatic process that doesn't demand user interaction. Because it's a peer-to-peer process, an attacker doesn't have to route packets through an access point to get to the victim. It turned out that TDLS frames had fields that could cause the firmware to overrun its buffers. "Putting it all together we can now hijack a code chunk to store our shellcode, then hijack a timer to point it at our stored shellcode. Once the timer expires, our code will be executed on the firmware," Beniamini explained. Beniamini has promised a followup post explaining how to escalate the injected code from running on the SoC to running on the main application processor. Broadcom said its latest firmware now uses the Wi-Fi SoC's ARM Cortex R4 core's builtin memory protection mechanisms to prevent code running from the stack. These mechanisms were effectively disabled on the versions probed by Beniamini, and all memory was marked as readable, writeable and executable, rendering exploitation easy peasy. Broadcom added that it is "considering implementing exploit mitigations in future firmware versions." ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Apple accused of counter-revolutionary pricing in Russia Tovarishch Cook accused of sending retailers to gulag unless they follow price list 5 Comments Silver Lake and Broadcom bid $18bn for Tosh memory biz US memory-buying partnership arrives out of the blue Dormant Linux kernel vulnerability finally slayed Just, er, eight years later 42 Comments WhatsApp blind-sided by booby-trapped photo vulnerability Same issue in Telegram, says researcher 14 Comments Brocade's sales growth outpaced by costs, ahead of Broadcom buyout Wi-Fi, routing up; SANs down Russia to convicted criminal hackers: 'Work with us or jail?'

The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement.

Apple has used the same core design for the last three mainline iPhone models, with last autumn's iPhone 7 delivering the ultimate version to date. LG hasn't followed quite the same approach. The LG G5 scrapped the G4's more traditional design for one with modular, snap-on accessories, but while there were good ideas in the mix, it didn't catch on – and the G5 wasn't better than the top competition on either the Android or iOS side of things. Luckily, the LG G6 is a much stronger effort. Ditching the modular trend, the G6 is just a straight-up slab of wonderphone, with a big and bold (and extra-tall) screen, appealing design, and plenty of power within. The LG G6 is a strong contender against even the stunning Samsung Galaxy S8 that's releasing soon, but how does it stack up compared to the iPhone 7? Here's what we think. DESIGN: FRESH VS FAMILIAR The iPhone 7 implements some nice tweaks to the existing iPhone 6/6s design, whether it's making the antenna likes less obvious, changing up the home button, or adding some appealing black colour options (and now red, too). But at a glance, it's the very same phone that Apple has peddled for three editions now. At least water resistance is a great benefit this time around. On the other hand, LG has emerged from its modular phase with a really attractive and fresh-feeling device, highlighted by that screen-dominated front. Contrast that to the still-bezel-loaded iPhone design, which is fine but also pretty unexciting at this point. The LG G6 is heavy on glass and metal, plus it looks and feels super premium and plenty luxurious. The curvy Galaxy S8 can't help but overshadow the G6 a bit, but this battle against the iPhone 7 is much more easily won. Winner: LG G6 SCREEN: NOT VERY CLOSE As Android flagships have embraced pixel-packed Quad HD displays over the last couple years, Apple has held tight to its lower-resolution screens. The iPhone 7 screen (4.7in) is still only a 750p panel, although the iPhone 7 Plus (5.5in) thankfully hits the 1080p benchmark, at least. That said, the iPhone 7 has a pretty clear little screen, and packed with colour and sharp contrast while delivering reliably strong brightness. LG takes this category handily, however. The 5.7in display sounds massive, but thanks to the minimal bezel, the phone doesn't feel as large as it seems. It's a super-sharp Quad HD display, like the G5's was, but this time it uses a taller 18:9 aspect ratio. Why? Hard to say for sure: just something different and more eye-catching, we suppose. But at least LG has built-in modes that can re-render content to fit the screen without obvious stretching. Better yet, LG's screen has HDR (high dynamic range) support – yes, on a smartphone. It'll run both Dolby Vision and HDR10 content right in your hand, delivering the incredible contrast and stunning colours that HDR promises. Expect Netflix and other apps to start offering on-the-go HDR content soon via updates. Winner: LG G6 POWER: FANTASTIC FUSION Apple actually has a leg up in this category, at least when it comes to measurable computing power. The A10 Fusion chip introduced in the iPhone 7 was smashing benchmark tests left and right last autumn, blowing past anything else on the smartphone market at the time. You might think that LG could put up something more powerful after a few months now, but instead, the company is using the existing Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 seen in the Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T. It's a super-fast processor, and the G6 has double the RAM to play with (4GB vs 2GB on the iPhone 7) – but if we're talking raw power, Apple seems to have slightly more of it. In everyday use, however, there's no night and day difference here. True, Android and iOS are different operating systems. Apple's iOS 10 tends to feel fast and fluid with its own chips, while pure Android 7.0 Nougat on a top-tier phone is also plenty speedy. LG has a small amount of skinning seen on the G6, but it's not extensive or overbearing here. In short, you're sure to have more than enough power for all of your apps, games, media, and other daily purposes, no matter which of these devices you use. But since we're dealing with specs here, we'll give Apple the small nod. Winner: Apple iPhone 7 CAMERA: CAN'T MISS The iPhone 7's single back camera isn't quite as spectacular as the iPhone 7 Plus' double array, but it's still one of the top phone cameras for everyday snaps – as the iPhone has long been – especially with speedier focusing in the latest model. The 12-megapixel sensor typically grabs reliably clear shots, whether you plan to print them or post to Instagram. It's a winner. The LG G6 is a strong challenger to both iPhones, however, and like the iPhone 7 Plus, it has two back cameras. Here they serve different purposes, though: one is a 71° standard lens and the other goes wide at 125° degrees. Last year's G5 did something similar with widely disparate megapixel counts for each (16MP for the standard and 8MP for the wide angle), but now they're evened out at 13 megapixels apiece – so you won't sacrifice quality to fit more into the frame. In our review testing, the LG G6 impressed in both standard and wide angle shooting, and it's quick to focus as well. You'll get brilliant shots with ample lighting, although the lack of optical image stabilisation (found on the iPhone 7) means that low-light images suffer a bit. Both are among the best phone cameras you can chuck into your pocket today, but we're not so strongly swayed towards either when everything is considered. You can't go wrong here, so we're calling it about even. Winner: Draw PERKS: MIXED BAG When it comes to hardware perks, the LG G6 scores a big win over the iPhone 7 with storage options. The G6 launches with 32GB of internal storage, but then you can pop in a microSD card with up to 2TB (once that size is available) of extra space to load it up. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 is predictably limited to whatever amount of storage you pay for from the outset, whether it's 32GB, 128GB or 256GB. And there's another big hardware perk for the LG G6: an actual headphone port. Yeah, we said it. Honestly, the iPhone's obvious omission hasn't been that big of a deal, but we're still happy to see LG stick with the classic 3.5mm port. When it comes to battery life, the LG G6 packs a hearty 3,300mAh pack with fast charging available, while the iPhone 7 has just a 1,960mAh cell. Granted, the iPhone 7 surely uses much less battery power for its lower-resolution display, but there's still a significant difference here. With steady, but not heavy daily usage, the iPhone 7 can typically last 'til evening - although if you start busting out the games or stream a lot of video, you'll likely need an early top-off. And admittedly, the LG G6 didn't go quite as long as we'd hoped, considering that large battery pack, although we'd call it a slightly stronger all-day performer. You probably won't get a day and a half, however. We don't need to dig into the great iOS vs Android debate again, and both mobile operating systems have their advantages and perks – but ultimately, both are super useful, loaded with features, and similar in a lot of ways. If it's a big deal to you, then you've probably already made your decision in this particular battle. But when it comes to apps and games, it's tough to argue with Apple's advantage. The App Store not only gets more high-profile app and game releases, but it also often gets those bigger releases before Android. The Play Store certainly isn't barren, and almost anything worth a damn on iOS will eventually hit Android – but not everything, and it can be a long wait. We'd give LG the hardware win here, but there's something to be said for the iOS app and game ecosystem. Maybe this category is too wide-ranging, but ultimately, we see benefits on both ends. It's a draw. Winner: Draw OVERALL: A FANTASTIC FIGHT When it's all added up, it's no surprise: the LG G6 landed very high on our list of the best smartphones in the world right now. It returns to strong, core fundamentals of flagship construction and ditches last year's modular additions, and packs in a brilliant display, alluring design, plenty of power, and little obvious reason to complain. And it placed above the iPhone 7 on that list, when the dust finally settled on our latest update. These are pretty different handsets, to be fair. The iPhone 7, while Apple's best edition of the standard model to date, feels like the company's last gasp at revising (and reusing) a proven design before hopefully wowing us with something new. In that respect, it's not all that exciting. It's great in nearly every way, but also highly familiar throughout. The LG G6, while maybe not blisteringly innovative, at least has a lot more momentum and excitement, especially as a rebound from the LG G5 and also one of the first big flagships out of the gates in 2017. It doesn't top the extra-premium iPhone 7 Plus in our book, but it's close - and we'd say it's the better pick right now when the standard iPhone 7 is being compared. Maybe wait for our Samsung Galaxy S8 review if you're planning on buying a flagship phone this spring, however. Just to be safe.

However could it be that in the future Apple could eventually support the technology in terms of both hardware and software? Recent comments have suggested that this might be the case. In a report from TechCrunch, they quoted Apple software chief Craig Federighi as saying, “There are heavy 3D graphics [applications] or graphics and compute mixed loads. Those can be in VR, those can be in certain kinds of high-end cinema production tasks where most of the software out there that’s been written to target those doesn’t know how to balance itself well across multiple GPUs but can scale across a single large GPU.” Federighi’s comments were made with regards to questions regarding the GPUs in the Mac Pro. For those who might have missed the news earlier, Apple announced that they would be rethinking the Mac Pro lineup, and it is possible that the future iteration of the Mac Pro could come with specs powerful enough to support VR platforms. As it stands, neither the HTC Vive nor the Oculus Rift support Apple’s platform. In fact earlier this year the company confirmed that there would not be Mac support anytime soon, although last year the company did state that they were waiting for the “right machine” to come along first, which for all we know could be Apple’s future Mac Pros. None of this is a guarantee, by the way, so take it with a grain of salt, but for Mac users looking forward to VR support, this could offer up the slightest glimmer of hope.

You'll Love These 3 Stocks Cirrus Logic, Analog Devices, and Skyworks Solutions all offer indirect ways to invest in Apple’s growth. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Apr 4, 2017 at 7:26PM Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 30% rally over the past 12 months surprised many investors, who likely assumed that waning interest in iPhones would limit its upside potential. Yet robust demand for the iPhone 7 helped Apple beat both top and bottom line expectations for three straight quarters. Its sales are now expected to rise 6% this year, compared to an 8% decline in 2016. If you think that Apple still has room to run, you should also check out three of its top suppliers -- Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) -- which could all be lifted by the tech giant's rally. Image source: Apple. Cirrus Logic Cirrus Logic makes audio chips for Apple devices. Two-thirds of its revenue came from Apple in fiscal 2016, making it a top supply chain bet on the iPhone 7 and the upcoming iPhone 8. Sales rose 28% to $1.2 billion in 2016, and analysts anticipate another 31% growth this year. Cirrus' heavy exposure to Apple is certainly risky, but it's gradually diversified away from its top customer -- which generated 80% of its sales back in 2014. One growing customer is Samsung, which accounted for 15% of its 2016 sales. Looking further ahead, digital headsets, MEMS mics, voice biometrics, and growth among China OEMs could all boost its content share and diversify its top line beyond those two top smartphone makers. Cirrus' non-GAAP earnings dipped 10% in 2016 due to the impact of a patent deal. But looking ahead, its earnings are expected to rise a whopping 82% this year. Cirrus already rallied more than 60% over the past 12 months on Apple's strength, but it still trades at just 17 times earnings -- which is well below its industry average of 75. Analog Devices Analog Devices sells the sensor controllers which power Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure is applied to a touchscreen or trackpad. The feature is used on new iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches. The company's "largest single customer" (widely assumed to be Apple) accounted for 12% of its sales in 2016. The Apple Watch. Image source: Apple. That lower percentage makes Analog a more diversified play than Cirrus. It also provides other analog chips, amplifiers, digital signal processing products, and software to a wide variety of companies across the industrial, communications, and automotive markets. Nonetheless, analysts expect Apple's growth to help lift its sales by 44% this year, compared to nearly flat growth in 2016. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise 30%. Analog also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, which is comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 57%. It's hiked that dividend annually ever since its IPO in 2012. The stock's P/E of 28 is admittedly higher than its industry average of 22, but that premium can likely be justified by its above-average growth rates. Skyworks Solutions Skyworks Solutions provides radio-frequency (RF) chips for the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, smart home, industrial, and military markets. However, Apple is widely believed to be its biggest customer, accounting for 40% of its sales in fiscal 2016. Teardowns of the iPhone 7 reveal four Skyworks components inside, compared to two components in the iPhone 6s. That's why Skyworks' revenue is expected to rise 9% this year, compared to less than 1% growth last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to grow 11% this year. Skyworks pays a seemingly low forward dividend of 1.1%, but its low payout ratio of 23% indicate that there's plenty of room for annual hikes -- which it has done for two straight years. Skyworks is gradually reducing its dependence on Apple by expanding into adjacent markets like connected cars, smart homes, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It's also scoring more design wins with Android OEMs. Skyworks currently trades at 21 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 22. But beware the fate of Imagination Technologies... If I had to buy just one of these stocks, I'd pick Analog Devices for its diversified business and solid dividend. Cirrus and Skyworks are still great Apple plays, but investors should realize that Apple could switch suppliers at anytime or develop its own first-party components to replace third-party parts. If that happens -- just as it recently did to GPU chip designer Imagination Technologies -- their shares could be crushed. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh those risks and rewards before investing in these top Apple suppliers. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

MacRumors reported that Apple sent out emails to some customers alerting them about the problem. Specifically, the update might “inadvertently reenable” some iCloud services that were disabled. I’ll show you how to check, below. Apple’s iCloud Team Note in Full We discovered a bug in the recent iOS 10.3 software update that impacted a small number of iCloud users. This may have inadvertently reenabled some iCloud services that you had previously disabled on your device. We suggest you go to iCloud settings on your iOS device to make sure that only the services you’d like to use are enabled. Learn more about how to manage your iCloud settings or contact AppleCare with any questions. The iCloud team Check Your iCloud Settings Not everyone got this letter, and it appears likely that Apple was able to identify affected users. However, you may want to check, and doing so is easy. Go to Settings > Apple ID > iCloud. Note that Apple ID is the new section at the very top of your Settings app in iOS 10.3.x. Settings App Apple ID iCloud Settings Apple lists all of its iCloud services on the iCloud screen, making it easy to decide which do and don’t want running. iOS 10.3.1 This issue was fixed in iOS 10.3.1. If you were still waiting to update to iOS 10.3, you won’t be affected by this issue at all. Also, congratulations for letting us find things out the hard way.

Apple’s Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus briefed five technical journalists on plans to develop a new Mac Pro, likely to be delivered in 2018. The details start with Jeff Gamet’s summary. That points to John Gruber’s report, and that, in turn points to the other stories by Matthew Panzarino, Lance Ulanoff, Ina Fried, John Paczkowski at their respective publications.

As author Gruber notes, the word “mistake” wasn’t used. However, a lot of the discussion centered on why the 2013 Mac Pro failed to meet the needs of many prospective customers and what Apple would do to remedy that. Apple SVP Phil Schiller: As we’ve said, we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough so that we need to take another path. One of the good things, hopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isn’t quite what we wanted it do be, didn’t live up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer. Yes. What We Said. I surmise that Apple has gotten an earful over the years since 2013 from its pro users about just what kind of Mac they really needed. That particular kind of pro design can often demand things that have been alien to Apple’s way of thinking: a relentless passion for moving to the future. Moreover, it seemed, Apple was unwilling to acknowledge that certain pro users need to attach their own, special displays. The professionals have practical needs, and existing equipment in the here and now, that they use for their mission critical work. That’s why the 2013 Mac Pro, cool as it was for many (I am writing this article on one), didn’t meet the needs of most of its pro customers. In order to do that, the new design will have to be state-of-the-art, but practical, upgradable, flexible, and have a mind towards the long-term. In other words, “modular.” Again, Apple’s Schiller emphasizes this in his comments. It’s no accident that he uses the word “modular” twice for unmistakable emphasis. As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a Pro display as well. Now you won’t see any of those products this year; we’re in the process of that. We think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that’ll take longer than this year to do. A New Hope There is every indication in this dialog, presented by the five vistors to Cupertino, that Apple has learned an important lesson. Dictating to its pro users an iconic but limited design was a mistake. The result was that the 2013 Mac Pro was a single digit percent of Mac sales. I’ve seen numbers that approach one percent. That is, perhaps 200,000 units sold per year. I think Apple executives sat down one day in a meeting, reviewed the pleas from technical and creative professionals, sized up the explicit desire by HP and Microsoft to steal the pro market from Apple, and concluded that the company wasn’t ready to abandon that market. A re-imagined 2018 Mac Pro would have to be a glorious, advanced, modular computer that could be configured to meet the needs of many different kinds of users throughout their own growth phases. An early 2013 Mac Pro concept by Peter ZIgich, Before what we knew what Apple had in mind. This time, Apple will do much better. Ports of Call I’ll go out on an early limb and suggest that, even in 2018, this Mac Pro won’t go 100 percent USB-C. Competing products, like the HP Z2 Mini, have a mixture of USB-C and USB-A as well as explicit DisplayPort and Ethernet. One reason to go that route is that the pros aren’t impressed by glamor shots that never show any cables. They know that they’ll have lots of equipment to attach, and the fewer dongles, the better. Sometimes, IT intervenes and establishes restrictions that make a dongle impossible. A major criticism of the 2013 Mac Pro was how ugly it got as one started connecting devices to do pro-level work. Apple, it appears, will avoid that mistake this time. Routine pro needs like Ethernet ports, a security slot and an audio port—just so messy when you’re trying to be ultra-cute—will likely be retained at first to avoid bad perceptions and grumbling. That doesn’t mean it can’t also be beautiful, in Apple’s way. But this time, I’m betting, form will follow function. And now, a new, exciting journey will begin as we come to learn, over the next year, more and more about our New Hope Mac. For now, from what we’ve heard Apple executives affirm, there can be great joy in Macville.

April 4, 2017 at 4:56 EDT PM Mike Weasner April 4, 2017 The next time Phil says something about Apple innovation (as he did in 2013 in regards to the Mac Pro) we will know what he means: boxed in and limited. April 4, 2017 at 5:12 EDT PM John Kheit April 4, 2017 There will be no joy in manville until those in management responsible for this colossal f’up (who managed to ignore every lesson of the cube) are round up and publicly flayed. People somehow are glossing over what an astonishing strategic business failure this is. That there are a sizable number of pros that have been ignored, and left and/or are leaving the mac because of this. That the response was this late. That they are NOT addressing this business failure and expecting us to walk goose step happily towards their ‘new direction’ without showing the problem is fixed internally is part of the ‘how’ we got here. Show me their corporate corpses and show me the macs, and then maybe we can start about talking about happy shiny people. Until this, let me show apple the hand and it’s particular singular parts. April 4, 2017 at 5:40 EDT PM John Martellaro April 4, 2017 John: People somehow are glossing over what an astonishing strategic business failure this is. Agreed. But on the face of it, this was a day to be happy about Apple & Mac Pro. April 4, 2017 at 5:55 EDT PM bdkennedy1 April 4, 2017 No one asked for a trash can Mac Pro. And no one bought them. I guess Apple didn’t learn it’s lesson from the PowerMac G4 Cube. April 4, 2017 at 5:57 EDT PM JoelS April 4, 2017 Yes, but it is not just hardware. They have also abandoned their pro users on the software side. They need to stay with and aggressively expand pro software for strategic reasons, not let so many of their pro software solutions wither on the vine. Either that, or they need to make it easier for third party developers to co-develop to the Mac. The Mac is loosing ground in the pro world. April 4, 2017 at 7:21 EDT PM fultonkbd April 4, 2017 I am always willing to give any company the benefit of trying something unconventional. It was certainly wasn’t what I wanted for my pro needs. One good thing with them building it was that it got me to purchase quite possibly one of the best Macs ever made – 27in iMac. With that said, if they build a modular MacPro… I’m in. I won’t goose step for that, but I may walk briskly to the nearest Apple store. April 4, 2017 at 7:28 EDT PM Lee Dronick April 4, 2017 Oh yeah Fulton, I love my 27” iMac Retina 5k. April 4, 2017 at 8:54 EDT PM MarcusNewton April 5, 2017 I think today was great news, and it is news I had been hoping to hear for some time now. The idea of new modular Mac Pro has me absolutely drooling over the possibilities. I also what to thank Apple for directly communicating this information to the public instead of us having to rely on sketchy rumors and dubious leaks. It is very refreshing to have a clear picture of the future. April 5, 2017 at 12:22 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Introduction 2. The good, the bad and the ugly 3. Verdict Our Verdict Apple Music is a powerful new candidate in the music streaming world but not one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. With a few tweaks here and there, it will surely become a more compelling option. For Offers something a little different Three month free trial Exciting music discovery features Connects you with your fav bands Integrates with your existing songs Against iOS app is a bit clunky Cluttered design Issues with iCloud integration Bugs! Update: Apple Music on Android is getting a facelift this week, finally bringing it up to par with the experience iOS users have been getting since the start. Content will now be organized into four main sections – Library, For You, Browse and Radio – and the app should play better with Android devices. Original review below... You can count on one finger the number of companies in the world that could launch a new music streaming service and expect to become a major player overnight. That company is Apple and it has duly obliged by launching Apple Music - the long-awaited music app which neatly integrates new-world subscription-based streaming with the old world playback of your existing Tunes library. Simply pay Apple $9.99/£9.99 per month and in return you can stream as much music as you like, as many times as you like, on as many devices as you like. You can do this from inside the stock Music app on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, or with iTunes on your PC or Mac. Starting on November 11, Apple has released an Android app as well, opening up the music streaming service to audiophiles outside Apple's walled garden. Apple Music also offers extensive music discovery channels including round-the-clock radio station 'Beats 1' featuring renowned radio DJs like Zane Lowe, as well as social features that aim to put artists and bands closer to their fans. It's all exciting stuff. The best thing about all this? Apple is giving everyone a three month free trial to give the new service a go - can't argue with that. Why it's a big deal The launch of Apple Music is an enormous moment for music, not just because Apple has been such a major player over the last 15 years but also because it's taken Apple so long to get here. Spotify launched seven years ago and has 75 million active users around the world including 20 million paying subscribers who have collectively created over 1.5 billion playlists. That's not a temporary deal - Spotify is here to stay and Apple has its work cut out for it if it wants to be the number one. Apple's strategy does appear to be paying off. At WWDC 2016 Apple announced that it has reached 15 million paid subscribers in its first year. For comparison's sake, Spotify might have double that, but that took eight years to grow to. But as we'll see, Apple's strategy is as self-serving, insular and crafty as usual, with its goal not necessarily to be the number one straight away but rather to simply up-sell its existing customers. The basics of Apple Music Apple Music costs $9.99/£9.99 per month for a standard dose of all-you-can-eat music streaming or 14.99 for a family package which gives access for up to six people. That pricing is the same as most of Apple Music's competitors, but the family plan is a nice addition and offers real value for money. Don't even try listening on more than one device at the same time with a standard subscription - you'll be instantly be cut off on one of the devices, given a stern warning and administered with a painful electric shock. One of those things isn't true. Focus on music discovery The Apple Music library is 30 million tracks strong and growing - that's not quite as high as the number of tracks available in iTunes but on a par with Spotify and Google Music which are, lets face it, its biggest rivals. Any music that you have in your own personal library that perhaps isn't available to stream you can upload to iCloud and have them seamlessly integrated with the other tracks that are natively available. You're currently limited to 25,000 but that will increase to 100,000 when iOS 9 launches. Setting up and exploring Apple Music Apple Music is divided into six main areas, and you navigate between them using icons at the bottom of the mobile app or via buttons at the top of your iTunes screen. It's worth exploring these one by one in this review as, for better or worse, they really do differentiate Apple Music from its competition. Clearly from the way Music is designed the message is clear - Apple doesn't want Music to be a passive jukebox that simply plays the tunes you tell it to play. It's built from the ground up to learn what you like listening to and to suggest new bands, albums and curated playlists for you to enjoy. This process starts from the first time you log into the service. You're instantly confronted by a number of screens - much the same as Beats Music if you are/were a user of that service - which ask you which genres you most identify with and then which bands you like the most. You can go back and tweak these choices at any time by tapping the icon top left in the iOS app and selecting 'Choose artists for you'. And you can also 'heart' music as you go to continue fine-tuning your taste profile. Apple Music: For You From then on, the For You section of Apple Music will be populated by music Apple thinks you will enjoy - whether it's an old favourite you'd forgotten about, a playlist inspired by your love of reggae or a new album from one of your favourite bands. The design of the page feels almost like browsing a magazine, and you do get the sense that there'll always be something interesting to choose from on this page. The playlists are certainly the most interesting thing about For You. They're all curated by real music experts which adds a weight of authority to the recommendations you could never get from auto-generated radio stations. The more I use Apple Music, the more I like this section. If you want to log on and quickly put something on, there's usually something tempting in there even if it is just an "Introduction to Radiohead" playlist you theoretically shouldn't need because you've already told Apple you like Radiohead. You can continually improve recommendations by 'hearting' the songs and albums you come across, thus telling Apple that you like them. It's neat stuff and lightyears ahead of what Spotify is doing. Apple Music: New The New section of Apple Music is about pointing you towards new releases, top charts, topical playlists, hot new bands, recommended music videos and other genre-specific options. It's probably the screen that will feel most familiar to those people who use iTunes or even the other streaming services. It's a really good section that makes it super easy to find out what's hot both on Apple Music as a whole and in the genres you're particularly interested in. You can't really fault this section, it's the most linear and straight forward part of Apple Music. Apple Music: Radio The Radio section is your way of letting Apple Music choose what you listen to. Beats 1 is obviously the big story here, with its 24-hour roster of superstar DJs and a focus on new music. Whether "new music" to Apple means giving exposure to the indie stars of future or simply being the first to play Kanye West's latest deep sustained booming sounds remains to be seen - so far, it seems like a healthy mix of both. For sure, this whole concept is a really backwards idea but I think it's going to work. Only Apple could pull off a global radio station like this, and while I can't imagine myself listening to it very often - or, let's be honest, ever - a lot of people will, I'm convinced. So far, all the DJs are excellent, playing different types of music as well as interviews, chats and so forth. It's a proper live internet radio station. The artist radio or album radio options you find on other services like Spotify or Google Music are there on this page, too, so you can get a Pandora-style playlist of music that the service thinks is similar to your selection. Apple Music: Connect Connect is the social network part of Apple Music. Just like Twitter or Instagram, you follow bands, artists or individual curators and then you'll get a feed with all the updates that these people choose to share. It seems like a good idea, but there's not much going on in there so far. I can see it evolving into a buzzing social network but equally it demands that artists get involved and there's no guarantee they're going to do that - some integration with Twitter, Facebook and Instagram would go a long way here - but that doesn't look likely to happen for the time being. Apple Music: Playlists and My Music If you ask me, My Music should be the first page rather than the last one. It's hidden almost at the back of the room, but I think that for most subscribers the My Music section is the most important one. It's where all your own music is found, whether it be music that's physically on your device, in your iCloud account or music you've added to My Music as a streaming option. You can sort by artists, albums, songs, genres and composers and you can download albums or playlists to listen to offline. Unfortunately it's one of the weakest areas of the Apple Music service. One thing that Spotify and Tidal both do well is allow you to replicate your music collections digitally - they make you feel like you still own the music even though you don't. They make it very easy to get to the music you're looking for and they simulate that feeling you get from having a vast CD collection mounted on your wall. In Apple Music all this stuff seems like a secondary consideration. For me the design is messy and requires too many taps to get to where I want to go - particularly on iPad where there is a lot of wasted space on some screens while others are far too cluttered. For example, on iPad the My Music section has no sidebar for me to flick between artists, bands, playlists etc. I have to press a drop down to select those things. And having playlists on a completely separate tab is a baffling choice. Just put all my music together in one place! My feelings are that Apple has put so much effort in trying to be different here, that it's ended up creating something unintuitive and awkward to use. 1 2 3 Current page: Introduction Next Page The good, the bad and the ugly Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Most Of Us Don't Need A Fitness Tracker David Nield Apr 5, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple fibit fieldguide fitness trackers google health and fitness wearables Share Fitness trackers aren't what they used to be. The fad gadget you strap to your wrist has seen a precipitous fall in the last year. Pebble closed its doors after releasing a solid fitness tracker, and Fitbit has struggled (though we liked its new Fitbit Alta HR). There's also the fact that fitness trackers, while great for athletes, seem to not actually help most of us lose weight. Image: Fitbit Which means if you're desperate to track sleep or steps or how many calories you consume you might be better off sticking to your phone. If you've taken a dive into your phone's fitness apps lately, you'll have noticed it can track your steps, your runs, and even your sleep without any help. So really, what's the point of buying yourself a separate wearable? Maybe your phone is enough tracker Image: Apple All contemporary smartphones come packed with sensors, which help it sort out where you are on a map, what orientation you're holding the phone in, and so on. It turns out these tiny components can do a lot of fitness tracking, too. Both Google Fit and Apple Health, depending on your choice of OS, are capable of keeping tabs on the steps you've taken, the distance you've covered, and the calories you've burned as you make your way about your day. Image: Google Google Fit is the more fitness focused of the two platforms, as its name suggests. Try adding an activity and you get a hundred to choose from, including everything from water polo to backcountry skiing. A lot of these activities can only be tracked in a very loose way, but the options to record them are there. Apple Health gives a more rounded picture of your health, and while it doesn't have quite as many activity categories as its Google counterpart, it goes into more detail and depth. For example, it includes the option of tracking caffeine intake and glucose levels. Image: Strava What apps do you need to turn you phone into a tracker? You don't necessarily need another device to keep tabs on a lot of these extra measurements, but you do need extra apps. There's a pile of apps, from Strava to Runkeeper, that can measure walks, runs, and bike rides using only your mobile phone, and in a lot more depth than your phone's own software can. (Both Strava and Runkeeper can share data with either Google Fit or Apple Health if necessary.) Image: Sleep As Android And an app such as Instant Heart Rate Monitor (for iOS or Android) can measure your heart rate using the technology built into your phone's camera. It might not be as accurate or as comprehensive as using a device strapped to your wrist or your chest, but it can add new depths to your health tracking, and the apps come with plenty of useful options for analysis and assessment. Apps can use your phone's sensors to figure out just how much quality shuteye you're getting as well. Sleep as Android can judge how restful for night has been for Android, while Sleep Cycle is one of the best options for iPhones or iPads. That's a lot of data you can keep on top of using nothing but your phone and a well-chosen app or two, though admittedly, there's more manual input involved if you want to go beyond the basics of step counts and sleep times, and it will definitely drain your phone's battery a little faster. Yet, as your phone is usually always with you, you may not need that separate tracker. Why you might still want a fitness tracker Image: Fitbit If you do decide to pay extra for a dedicated fitness tracker, the first benefit you get is portability: you don't have to lug a 15cm phone around on your morning jog, because a snug wristband or a tracker clipped to your pocket is doing all the tracking for you. With many smartwatches now including GPS, you can track your location too. Smartphones might feel like extensions of our natural bodies these days, but for some high-intensity activities you really don't want to take your phone with you. From running around on a soccer pitch to doing laps of the pool, the more advanced your fitness activity, the more a dedicated tracker starts to make sense. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And by fitness tracker we also mean smartwatch with advanced fitness tracking capabilities — being able to glance at your wrist as you hit the home straight of a 5K run is much more convenient than trying to fish your phone our of your pocket. The latest fitness trackers also bring more sensors and more accurate sensors to the table: whether it's the continuous heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch or the altimeter, barometer, and compass built into the Garmin Fenix 3, you can usually expand on the monitoring capabilities of your phone with a dedicated wearable. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo That often translates into less time spent manually inputting data — if there's one sticking point likely to interfere with your fitness tracking goals, it's having to enter data manually. It's a job that just never gets done, or doesn't get done often enough, and you don't have to worry about it if you're wearing a device that knows the difference between a gym session and a jog without being told. Of course there are a wide range of fitness trackers out there, some of which do a better job than others at keeping tabs on what you're doing, but generally speaking you get more automation and more detail with an extra device to help your phone along. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo And all that's before you get to the app and software that comes with your tracker, which you may well prefer to the built-in offerings from Apple and Google — Fitbit's bundled app is particularly handy and gives you a detailed breakdown of your stats on the web as well as on your phone. The big downside to a fitness tracker? It's another gadget you'll need to be charging every day (or week), and the majority of trackers are big ugly rubber bands. Those are nearly as aesthetically pleasing as a smartphone in your back pocket.

(Elite athletes would have a swarm of coaches and trainers monitoring them.) I suspect that owning one makes you feel like you're taking your fitness seriously when in fact you've done little to nothing. Reply 0 vangrat @vangrat Apr 5, 2017, 11:07am I both agree and disagree. When I first started losing weight, I had nothing but my phone to rely on. This was a great place to start though. I could track my calorie consumption and steps throughout the day. However, as I got further along my fitness goals, the phone just wasn't cutting it anymore. As such, I got a Blaze. The Blaze allowed me to take the next step, tracking my calorie consumption and burn throughout the entire day. Thus allowing me to better manage my macros, and ensuring my fitness goals were being met. Could I have done that without the Blaze, probably. Would it have been as easy, nope. That's what the fitbit does for me, it makes my fitness tracking easier. Moreover, it acts as a constant reminder to stay fit. It's right there on my wrist, I look at it more times an hour than I care to figure, and it's alerts to stay active keep me on my toes. If you use these smart watches the way they were intended, e.g. tracking calorie burn, heart rate, and physical activity, you will get more than you would from just using a phone. However, the key is that YOU, yourself, and no one else, have to WANT to get fit. If you just strap on the watch and expect to lose weight/get thin/get a beach body, you're deluding yourself. The watch is there to help YOU monitor YOUR fitness, not do it for you. Reply 0 CookingMama @cookingmama Apr 5, 2017, 11:11am I just upgraded from the charge hr to the blaze. I love it! Reply 0 CookingMama @cookingmama Apr 5, 2017, 11:19am GPS tracking is a battery hog, and if you're already using your phone for music (esp streaming or using bluetooth headphones), you can kiss your battery goodbye if you're heading out for a long workout. I love my fitbit because it really helps with the incidental exercise. It reminds me to take the steps, to go for a longer walk at lunch. The Active Minutes are the one to track for weightloss. I need to be hitting around 60 active mins a day if I want to see changes. And now, I have the pretty pretty pink and gold blaze. As a watch, it's pretty good. Reply 0 friendly_Foe @friendky_foe Apr 5, 2017, 12:29pm No one needs a fitness tracker. People have been loosing weight before fitness tracker. If you want to loose weight its simple... "Eat less move more. Eat everything but more fruits and veggies, less meats and even less sweets." Why over complicate a simple solution to a big problem. Eat only this, eat within a certain time, count this and count that. Blah Blah Blah. Now you track every calorie and every move you make and connect devices to you 24-7. If you have noticed you put on weight over the years is because of your lifestyle choices. You can blame your kids, career or metabolism. But the truth is people get lazy and they find things to blame other than themselves. Kids are always running about you should too. If your career is busy walk to the station or to work or park a little further away. Worried it's your metabolism? Don't because it doesn't change through out your life. Be selective with the foods you eat. Don't switch out wholesome foods for something in a pack. The real health isle in the supermarket is the one where you find the oranges and broccoli not the isle with the overpriced fake food. Nothing beats a carrot and bok choy. Change your lifestyle and your body will too. It's that simple no fitness tracker required and it's free!!!!! Reply 0 friendly_Foe @friendky_foe Apr 5, 2017, 12:33pm The only people who need to do do all these fancy things are athletes and movie stars where they need their bodies to be at a certain way. But for the average Joes and Janes nothing could be easier.

Reply 0 shadowlee @shadowlee Apr 5, 2017, 12:56pm Using your phone as a daily step counter makes sense if you keep your phone in your pocket. Unfortunately, women's clothing manufacturers keep insisting that women don't need pockets so my phone mostly lives either on my desk or on my bag. That makes it less useful for step counting. Reply 0 R3 @rthree Apr 5, 2017, 2:02pm I found out yesterday that my Samsung Gear Fit 2 integrates with Strava. This is an exciting concept. Might go for a walk now to test it out cos it just told me I've been inactive for too long. If only it could remind me when it's beer o'clock. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Streaming music came not long after -- Spotify was founded in 2008, and competitors were close on its heels. In 2017, the answer you'd get could not be more different. Vinyl is cool again, as much as it ever has been if not moreso. The power of the internet, too, is changing the way that vinyl records are thought up and sold. Equal Pay Day Is A Good Reminder Of How Much It Still Sucks To Be A Woman In Tech Libby Watson 05 Apr 2017 12:30 PM Today is Equal Pay Day in the US, which is so chosen because it marks, on average, how much longer a woman would have to work to make the same as a man did during the previous year. Women across the US are... well, not quite "celebrating", but marking the day with events and protests, and probably more than a few private grievances about their overpaid male colleagues and bosses. But while the pay gap pervades most occupations, it's often particularly pronounced at higher income levels -- which many jobs in tech are. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip?

This is why earlier this year, there was a bit of a humorous situation where a news broadcaster accidentally activated Alexa for many viewers while on TV. The solution would be of course to create voice assistants that will only react to your voice. We’ve yet to see that being implemented for most voice assistants in the market today, but this is a feature that Apple could be considering. In a patent discovered by Patently Apple, it reveals Apple’s plans to possibly include voice identification features in Siri in the future. The patent describes a system in which users will be able to save their voice with Siri, and whenever Siri is activated it checks against the saved voice to ensure that it is the owner of the device. This means that even if your phone is unattended, users won’t be able to bypass the lockscreen by using Siri. This could also be used together with other Apple devices like Apple TV, where Siri will only recognize the owner which in turn could prevent other users in your home from making unauthorized purchases. We’re not sure if Apple ever plans on implementing this feature into Siri, but it is one of the things that has been brought up in the past, plus it makes perfect sense too in today’s world where privacy and security are pretty hot topics.

The album would be available only to paid subscribers during the two-week period. The music industry has complained for years about Spotify’s free tier, which currently offers the same access to the company’s licensed music as Spotify offers to paid subscribers. There are some limitations on what Spotify features are available to non-subscribers, but that’s it. For its part, Spotify has 50 million paid subscribers, more than double the number of subscribers Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) claims for Apple Music. And Spotify’s free tier is available as long as a user wants it. Spotify’s premium service, like Apple’s, are available on trial basis for 30-days and then users must pay up or cancel. According to Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek, here’s what’s happening: Starting today [Tuesday, April 4], Universal artists can choose to release new albums on premium only for two weeks, offering subscribers an earlier chance to explore the complete creative work, while the singles are available across Spotify for all our listeners to enjoy. The deal is not a good deal for either Spotify or Universal, but it’s probably worse for the record company. By restricting access to paid subscribers, Universal’s artists will lose the revenue that Spotify’s free tier generates because Spotify no longer has to pay for those streams. Worse for Universal and its artists, the deal covers albums only. Unless you’re closer to 50 years old than 20 years old, albums don’t resonate. The majority of today’s audience became addicted to singles and playlists years ago (thank iPod for that). Not having access to the album won’t affect most listeners, but it will cut into royalty payments. And who’s going to be the Universal artist to withhold an album and lose the revenue? Taylor Swift already withholds her music from Spotify, but other top acts like Coldplay, Lana Del Rey, and Lil Wayne are far more likely to want to reach the widest audience possible. Besides, who’ll be the first in line to try it out? A new act or an established one? The former need the widest possible exposure and the latter are looking for maximum revenue. If either group goes along with the new Spotify-Universal deal, it probably fails to achieve its desired goal. Spotify is expected to file for an initial public offering later this year or early next.

ROGERS New Apple Watch bands. Graham Keith Rogers - + On March 28, there were updates for iOS (10.3) that introduced AFPS: the new Apple File System, which is expected eventually to expand to macOS. There may be some gains in space and speed but these are expected to be small. Also updated were macOS (10.12.4), WatchOS and tvOS. On that day, I saw the new iPhone Red and new Apple Watch bands. I was also shown a preview of the Clips app, which will be available this month. When I pressed for a date, I was just told, "April". At home, I started the process of making a new red iPhone 7 Plus my main device, to replace the jet black version I have been using for the last few months. I decided to use the most recent iCloud backup: this is usually done while I am asleep, when the iPhone is charging. The Apple Watch with a new band. Photos: Graham Keith Rogers Data began appearing within minutes as usual, with apps coming down later. I made a mistake when I unpaired the Apple Watch from the current iPhone and tried to pair it with the new one. This was running iOS 10.2.1 and needed 10.3 as I had already updated the Watch. With the size of the download, there were delays, although downloads had been problem-free in the morning. I finally fixed this the old-fashioned way by connecting the iPhone to the Mac and updating iOS using iTunes. Everything worked fine on the new iPhone, except for a couple of third-party bluetooth devices. Once I paired these, all was fine. On the morning of March 28, I taught a demo class for electrical engineers, outlining the Internet of Things and device connectivity: a practical run-through to complement the theory they are taught. I repeated the class for communication engineers on Thursday morning before heading to Apple South Asia Thailand at The Offices At Central World where I joined a demonstration of Logic Pro and Final Cut aimed at those in education. As the Thai recording, movie and video production industries are highly thought of, Cupertino sent some of its experts to show off these powerful applications; but first, partly because of the way these apps have been updated, there was an outline of the new MacBook Pro. While the presentation slides had been prepared in the US, the presenter mentioned some of my comments on the Mac and its Touch Bar in the Bangkok Post. Installation from back-up under way. Graham Keith Rogers Bob Hunt gave a skilled demonstration of Logic Pro. Although I have used GarageBand, I am unlikely to make full use of this powerful application, which is widely used in the recording industry. I interviewed a Thai hip hop star a few years ago who said Logic Pro was integral to his creative process. With its most recent updates, the use of the Touch Bar has been integrated into the workflow and some of the editing processes have become more efficient because of this. Showing off Final Cut (10.3.2) to the receptive audience, with every bit as much expertise as Hunt, Luke Tristram, senior product manager, Pro Video Applications, also made it clear that Touch Bar integration was now an important part of the installation. Highlighting the clips in the timeline gave different Touch Bar displays depending on the media highlighted (video, sound, titles). He first used clips from a documentary to show how the video can be manipulated in real time and how rendering takes place in the background. Both with Final Cut and Logic, the amount of processing power used by the Mac was comparatively low. Titles are pre-installed and are now so good that, in a demonstration of the new Will Smith movie, Focus, he showed how the producers used those from Final Cut rather than sending the work to a title house as is normal. At the end, the demonstration presenters were overwhelmed by questions. The morning session had generated much interest. I did manage to ask Tristram a couple of questions about displays and downloading the application (10,500 baht). He suggested I first access the trial version, which is full-featured and works for 30 days. I also was sent information about the Pro Apps Bundle for those in education. This includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Motion 5, Compressor 4 and MainStage 3 and is priced at 7,500 baht. I ordered this. Over the weekend I recorded some video using the trial version of Final Cut, trying to follow what I remembered of Luke Tristram's demo. Familiarity will help, but I was able to teach myself some of the processes. I will also need to think about cameras in the future. With the output, I later uploaded a couple of videos to my eXtensions YouTube channel, which has not seen much activity so far. That will change. Graham K.

That price point would be similar to Samsung's new Galaxy S8+, which starts at $840 to $850. "iPhone X" concept by designer Gabor Balogh Milunovich said the flagship iPhone could start at under $1,000 as part of Apple's "mainstream luxury" pricing strategy. He also believes the 5.8-inch device will be competing at a screen size disadvantage compared to the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8+, leading him to predict Apple will adopt similar pricing as Samsung. Milunovich thinks that a 256GB model could cost between $950 and $1,000, so the iPhone could very well be the first mainstream smartphone in the United States to have a four-digit price tag. He also predicted that the tentatively named iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will start at around $649 and $749 respectively. An excerpt from Milunovich's latest research note obtained by MacRumors: Contrary to some perceptions, Apple prices quite competitively. Apple likes to position its entry-level products at the mid-market with "Pro/Plus" products close to competitors at the high end. Therefore, we do not think Apple will stray far from the price point of Samsung's most expensive model at $840-850 and will keep the entry OLED model at $850-900. Apple's 256GB OLED model could be $950-1,000, but the 256GB 7 Plus already is $970.The research note cites UBS Asia hardware analyst Arthur Hsieh, who estimates the factory cost of the tentatively named iPhone 8 could be $70 to $90 higher than the iPhone 7 Plus, which starts at $769. Milunovich's prices appear to be merely predictions based on this information, rather than inside sources. In addition to an edge-to-edge OLED display with narrow bezels, the iPhone 8 is expected to resemble the Galaxy S8 in many ways, including wireless charging, no physical Home button, and potentially 3D facial recognition and/or iris scanning. Touch ID might be embedded in or under the True Tone display. Milunovich maintains a "buy" rating for AAPL with a $151 price target. AAPL closed at $144.77 on Tuesday.

Home / Interesting / Watchs & Cars: Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Watchs & Cars: Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 Interesting, Lifestyle | April 4th, 2017 by Nico DeMattia 0 Tweet Smart watches are becoming incredibly popular as of late, more specifically the Apple Watch. While smart watches were originally looked down upon by wearers of … Smart watches are becoming incredibly popular as of late, more specifically the Apple Watch. While smart watches were originally looked down upon by wearers of expensive traditional watches, I see more and more important business people wearing Apple Watches. It’s a rather interesting new trend that’s emerging. But even the nicest of Apple Watches seems to look a bit like a toy, rather than a true luxury item. So what about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45? While Tag Heuer is one of the horological giants of the world, with a rich history in making high-end timepieces, it’s now developed a new smart watch to compete with more high-end Apple Watches. This may seem beneath a brand like Tag Heuer, who has made some truly timeless watches in its day, it shows an emerging trend in the watch industry. To be fair, the new Connected Modular 45 is actually the brand’s second attempt at a smart watch but it’s so far improved over the first model, it’s the one we’re going to talk about. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 gets its name from its modular design. The actual “module’ is what we’d normally call the case of a normal watch. This module houses the sapphire crystal touchscreen display and the electronics underneath. The module can come in a variety of different finishes, such as titanium, ceramic, aluminum and even diamonds. Most of which are offered in a variety of colors. Different sorts of straps and lugs can also be chosen and you can sort of customize the watch with these different options. Inside the Tag Heuer Connected’s module lies an Intel Atom Z34XX processor with 512 MB of main memory and 4 GB of storage. There’s also an accelerometer, gyroscope, tilt detection sensor, microphone, vibrations and haptics engine, an ambient light sensor, GPS, and even NFC payment capabilities. All of this is run on Android’s latest wearable operating system. It’s actually pretty impressive. I think it looks pretty good, as well, and it’s hard to distinguish from a regular Tag Heuer Carrera from even a relatively close distance. The screen is high-def with crisp graphics and, when displaying a traditional watch face, looks every bit like a regular watch until you look really, very close. It also seems to work really well, with a slick processor and smooth operations. It doesn’t seem to lag like some Android-based smart watches. Now, it isn’t cheap, like most smart watches are. With a starting price of around $1,600, it’s about as much as a regular Tag Heuer, so one questions its value. Despite being a fast and slick smart watch that offers a lot of features, it’s still just a smart watch and doesn’t do any more than an Apple Watch would and the latter costs around $250 bucks. For the same money, you can buy one of Tag Heuer’s own mechanical watches, the Formula 1 Calibre 5, which comes with a great automatic movement and handsome looks. I think what the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 really does is offer luxury watch buyers a way to own a smart watch that can handle all of the functions they need it to while not looking like a toy. It looks like a proper watch, is 50m water resistant and has all of the tech they might need. This is a third or fourth watch in someone’s collection, not something to compete with Apple or Motorola for smart watch dominance. My only reservation about the Connected is that real watch snobs, people who appreciate horology and can typically afford three or four premium watches, will likely not want something with circuit boards on their wrist. What do you think, does a Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 belong on the wrist of a proper watch snob as a genuinely useful tool or is it just a toy?

Many readers complain when we compare an iOS phone to an Android phone and I just do not understand their objection. Who wouldn’t want to see how Apple’s flagship stands up to one of the top Android devices? Android Headlines is a website about Android devices, and naturally, we believe in our OS and the freedom and customization that Android OS offers over the iOS environment. I just know if I owned Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, I would surely want to know how it compares to its chief rival. These two devices couldn’t be more different in their specifications or design philosophy, but let’s take a look and see just what common threads we can find. When it comes to specifications and looks, the iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S8 Plus, could not be further from each other. Even though the Galaxy S8 Plus’s display is 7/10 of an inch larger, they are physically very close to the same size, although the slightly taller (1.3mm) and narrower Galaxy S8 Plus weighs 7 grams less. Besides their size, the displays use different technology and different resolutions. The iPhone 7 Plus uses its own Apple A10 Fusion processor, and the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus uses the newest Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor in the US Model and Samsung’s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor in other markets. The iPhone offers 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of fixed internal storage while the Galaxy S8 Plus offers 64GB of expandable UFS 2.1 storage. The primary cameras are both 12MP – the iPhone 7 Plus uses two of them and the Galaxy S8 Plus uses just one, although it is the Dual Pixel variety. The front-facing cameras (FFC) are only a megapixel a part – 7MP on the iPhone and 8MP on the S8 Plus. Both will provide you with excellent photos and social media selfies. They both provide non-removable batteries, but the Galaxy S8 Plus is larger and offers rapid charge and quick wireless charging. They both provide a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and authorizing mobile payments – Apple Pay only on the iPhone while the Galaxy S8 Plus offers Android Pay and Samsung Pay. They have the usual suspects – WiFi, Bluetooth (iPhone with v4.2 and S8 Plus with v5.0), GPS, and NFC (the iPhone’s is only good for Apple Pay), and they each have a connector for charging and data transfer but the Apple plug is proprietary, and the Galaxy S8 Plus uses a standard reversible Type-C port. Please take a careful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another – click on the “View Full Comparison” link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. Specifications Apple iPhone 7 Plus The Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which was released in September 2016, looks very similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 6s Plus, with the usual enhancements throughout the device. Apple moved the antenna positioning to the outside edges for a cleaner look, and the old physical Home button is a touch-sensitive button with no moving parts. Apple introduced 3D Touch on the iPhone 6 and made improves to both it and the Display Zoom. The processor is improved and they added IP67 dust and water resistance, and added a dual camera only on the iPhone 7 Plus. Let’s take a look and see just how the iPhone 7 Plus holds up to the new Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD display with a Full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 401 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) The display features an improved Apple’s 3D Touch that allows the user to press a finger, with varying degrees of force, to make multiple selections. The processor is their new Apple A10 Fusion quad-core clocked at 2.23GHz and coupled to a PowerVR Series 7XT Plus six-core graphics processor. The iPhone 7 Plus packs 3GB of DDR4 RAM and either 32GB, 128GB, or 256GB of non-expandable internal storage. Apple did make some considerable changes in its camera area on the iPhone 7 Plus and it now features a new dual 12MP sensor – one for wide-angle (f/1.8) and one for telephoto (f/2.8) shots. Then it adds phase detection autofocus (PDAF), Quad-LED dual-tone flash, and OIS for its primary camera. For its FFC the iPhone 7 Plus uses a 7MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 for selfies and video chatting, or AppleTalk, in their nomenclature. It uses a 2900mAh non-removable battery to supply power and Apple still offers no form of rapid charging for their batteries. The new Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with many refinements – a dual-camera, improved camera lens, and Quad LED flash. Apple improved the 3D Touch, improved the stereo sound, improved Home button, and added IP67 dust and water resistance. They upped it to 3GB of RAM, did away with the 16GB model, which is worthless in today’s age, and now offer 32GB of non-expandable memory as the smallest amount available. Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack and supplied an adapter for you to use with regular earphones or you can switch to Bluetooth earphones to avoid the proprietary plug. In what appears to be an increasing trend, Apple has lost their 3.5mm earphone plug. The iPhone 7 Plus measures 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm and weighs in at 188 grams. Apple still uses its proprietary plugs and ecosystem services like iTunes, Apple Pay, iMessage, and AppleTalk, making it increasingly difficult for iPhone users to communicate with Android folks. Pricing starts out at $770 for the 32GB model and will cost you $870 for the 128GB model. Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus The new Samsung Galaxy S8 series looks nothing like its predecessor, in either looks or performance – and the Galaxy S7 Edge was no slouch. Samsung took the design of ‘Edge’ model and improved upon it on the Galaxy S8 Plus. Samsung calls it their Infinity Display and it seamlessly wraps around the sides of the device, almost ‘melting’ into the back glass panel with one smooth transition. This new design allows Samsung to squeeze a larger display into a smaller area. Samsung’s physical ‘Home’ button – long a staple on their devices – as well as the ‘Back’ and ‘App’ keys now show up on the lower part of the display with their new 3D Touch area. The fingerprint sensor is now on the back near the camera lens, but Samsung included facial recognition and an iris scanner to unlock your device, allowing you to avoid the fingerprint sensor. The new Galaxy S8 Plus is one beautiful smartphone and easily one of the sexiest devices ever produced. Let’s see just where the new Galaxy S8 Plus stands against the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy S8 Plus sports a larger 6.2-inch Infinity Display that uses the Super AMOLED QHD+ with a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 529 PPI. We must point out that out of the box, the default resolution is set to 2220 x 1080 to conserve battery life, but it can be manually turn up to the maximum through the settings. The display uses a 18.5:9 ratio making it taller and going edge-to-edge taking up 84-percent of the front of the phone. The newest and toughest Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protects the display. The Galaxy S8 Plus has the ‘always-on’ display feature to help save battery life while making it quicker and easier to view notifications. The US model uses the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core 10nm processor clocked at 2.35GHz and an Adreno 540 GPU that can handle any graphics thrown its way. Other countries will use Samsung’s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 Plus continues to pack 4GB of DDR4 RAM and comes standard with 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 memory, as well as possible expansion up to 256GB via a microSD card. Last year, Samsung surprised everybody by going from a 16MP primary shooter to a smaller, 12MP Dual Pixel design, but the proof was in the excellent photos it can take. Well, Samsung has once again surprised everybody by using the same camera from the Galaxy S7 on the Galaxy S8 Plus keeping the same f/1.7, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung said they concentrated on making advancements in their imaging software and purposely avoided the dual lens because they could see no advantage. The Galaxy S8’s FFC did improve from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor, a wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, Live HDR, and then added its own autofocus. The camera area should continue to take great pictures, but it is odd that no improvements in the lens area occurred. Samsung also lowered the battery size from the non-removable 3600mAh to a 3500mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. Besides the beautiful look and feel of the Galaxy S8 Plus, it has IP68 certification against dust and water; it sports a heart rate monitor, an oxygen saturation sensor, and Samsung Health has replaced Samsung’s S-Health. It has High-Res audio for listening through a good pair of earphones, but still only one speaker. You will also find a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung’s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things). Samsung’s new Bixby personal assistant works a lot like Google Assistant, but you can also use the camera – point it at a historical building, it will tell you the history of the place or aim it at a sign in a foreign language, and Bixby will translate it for you. Another new feature is the DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 Plus with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a desktop experience. The Galaxy S8 Plus can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which will allow Galaxy S8 Plus users to make mobile purchases just about anywhere they can swipe a credit or debit card – no specific equipment needed as with Apple Pay. As of now, the Galaxy S8 Plus is running Android Nougat 7.0 with the promise of a quick upgrade – or it may arrive with 7.1 by release time. It measures 155.9 x 73.4 x 8.1 mm, weighs in at 173 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 Plus will cost about $820 outright and is now available for pre-order to be delivered by April 21. …And The Winner Is… The Final Word It is understood that the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus is the winner of this comparison. We are not picking it over the obvious advantages of the Android OS over iOS – we are picking it because the S8 Plus is a better all-around smartphone. It is more innovative, it has a larger and better display, it’s much better looking, it has more RAM for better multi-tasking, expandable memory, a larger battery with rapid and wireless charging, better water protection, a better camera, more features, and better mobile payments with Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Samsung Connect allows interaction with IoTs and the Samsung DeX Station can give you a desktop experience. If you exercise, you can take advantage of Samsung Health, the heart rate monitor and the Oxygen sensor. With Iris Scanning and Facial Recognition, Samsung gives you multiple ways to secure your Galaxy S8 Plus. Considering all things, it is just a much better looking device and more practical. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is well-built and a very popular device, but it lags behind in features when compared to the Galaxy S8 Plus. It may have dual lenses, but it does not out-shoot the single lens found in the S8 plus. The iPhone 7 Plus restricts your mobile purchases only to retailers that can afford to purchase a special piece of equipment. While it is a nice looking device, it is getting a little outdated when compared to the Galaxy S8 Plus. For a phone that loves to use its battery, Apple still resorts to smaller batteries and offers no quick charge feature. Apple still refuses to add expandable memory, but would rather charge $100 more for each memory upgrade – $870 for a 128GB and a 5.5-inch FHD display versus $820 for 64GB of expandable memory and a 6.2-inch QHD+ display in the S8 Plus. Apple has a long way to go to play ‘catch up’ to the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus.

Apple’s magnetic charging solution was a staple of MacBooks for many years, but the company did away with it with the switch to USB-C. Now, however, a patent hints that Apple is working on a way to integrate MagSafe with USB-C. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case First noted by Mashable, Apple has been granted a patent for a mechanism that would act as a MagSafe-to-USB-C adapter of sorts. If that sounds familiar, it’s because it’s eerily similar to the solution that Griffin’s BreakSafe accessory uses to bring MagSafe functionality to USB-C. Obviously, however, being a first-party Apple accessory means that there would be a few benefits over Griffin’s solution. The patent depicts a real MagSafe plug as what would connect between the cable and the USB-C adapter plugged into the computer. As you can see in the figure above, the MagSafe design is akin to what’s been used on recent MacBook designs, but connects to the adapter rather than directly to the computer. As usual, Apple’s patent is vague as to what sort of products the technology could be used with, despite the fact that the figures specifically show use with a MacBook. “Embodiments of the present invention may provide adapters that may connect to connector receptacles on various types of devices, such as portable computing devices, tablet computers, desktop computers, laptops, all-in-one computers, wearable computing devices….” The Griffin BreakSafe has been met with mixed reviews. I personally used it for a long time, but overtime the magnetic connection began to weaken and became detached too easily. Others, however, have had more luck. The company earlier this year expanded its BreakSafe line. Nevertheless, a first-party solution from Apple would presumably be far more advanced than Griffin’s. It’s not a perfect solution, though, as it still involves a weird adapter plug. The ideal solution would be a some sort of magnetic USB-C connector cable. What do you think of Apple’s patented USB-C/MagSafe hybrid? Is it something you would use? Let us know down in the comments and read our full review of Griffin’s BreakSafe here.

While it sounds very simple, this new feature could actually pack quite the punch in that it could be extended to a whole host of future devices. Today we have passwords we type in and Touch ID. In the future, we may also have facial and voice recognition. You may have a vocal password that also carries an audio footprint. Technically it's Voice Biometrics, a feature that's not associated with Siri today. In the future, if Siri doesn't recognize the voice of the owner of the device, accessing Siri or the computer associated with it will be impossible.   Patent Background   Intelligent automated assistants (or digital assistants/virtual assistants) provide a beneficial interface between human users and electronic devices. Such assistants allow users to interact with devices or systems using natural language in spoken and/or text forms.   Up until now when a digital assistant has been invoked with a voice command, the digital assistant is responsive to the speech itself, not to the speaker. Consequently, a user other than the owner of the electronic device is able to utilize the digital assistant, which may not be desirable in all circumstances.   In addition, due to the prevalence of electronic devices and digital assistants, in some circumstances a user may provide a spoken user request to the digital assistant associated with their electronic device, and several other electronic devices in the room would respond unintentionally.   Training Siri to Know your Individual Voice   Apple's invention provides a method to train Siri to know the voice of the owner of the iDevice before responding to a command. Apple's patent FIG. 8B noted below illustrates a process for recognizing a speaker to invoke a virtual assistant.   Today a user will say "hey Siri" and Siri will respond. In the future, the command to call up Siri may be customized to your voice. For instance, a user sets up Siri to recognize the phrase "Hey there, Boss." The customized phrase and the voice must match what's in Siri's database before the digital assistant will respond. The customized phrase is technically referred to in Apple's patent filings as a "Lexical Trigger."   Today if your phone is left at your office desk unattended, someone may still be able to access Siri even if they can't get into your system because you've secured it with Touch ID.   In the future, in order to access Siri, a person will have to know a passcode, use a fingerprint or be recognized by the system via face recognition. Unless your iDevice recognizes you on multiple security levels, Siri will remain unresponsive to commands or requests.   In the future, your Apple TV may only respond to specific users within a household. This way children or teens won't be able to make big purchases or rent movies because Siri can't be engaged and it won't let anyone make a purchase.   You can imagine this kind of security eventually being applied to your vehicle or your home doors in the future. If Siri isn't greeted with the right lexical trigger or doesn't recognize you as the owner of the car, it will fail to start, period. If it's part of home automation, your home door may not open even though someone may have the key.   Apple's patent pending invention is quite simple and yet it packs an interesting punch by delivering a new layer of security for future iDevices, Macs and beyond.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

The update includes a handful of new features such as Find My AirPods. One issue related to the update that is just now emerging, however, relates to iCloud. Some users have apparently had iCloud services they once turned off, automatically come back on… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by MacRumors, some users have received emails from Apple explaining that a bug in iOS 10.3 has caused some iCloud services to activate again despite once being disabled. It’s unclear at this point how many users are affected by this bug, but it seems to relate to iCloud services such as Mail and Photos. Below is the text of the email being sent to users: We discovered a bug in the recent iOS 10.3 software update that impacted a small number of iCloud users. This may have inadvertently reenabled some iCloud services that you had previously disabled on your device. We suggest you go to iCloud settings on your iOS device to make sure that only the services you’d like to use are enabled. Learn more about how to manage your iCloud settings or contact AppleCare with any questions. The iCloud team It’s not explicitly clear as to why this bug is occurring, but it doesn’t appear that Apple can fix it on their side. Instead, the company is advising affected users to go into Settings on their device and see what iCloud services are enabled and ensure that everything is as it should be. Apple also this week released iOS 10.3.1 to the public, bringing bug fixes and improved security. The update also brings back support for 32-bit devices. Furthermore, the company is also currently beta testing iOS 10.3.2 which will presumably be released in the coming weeks and bring additional bug fixes and performance improvements. Have you had any iCloud features re-enabled thanks to the iOS 10.3 update? Let us know down in the comments.

In a small briefing with select journalists, Apple talked about what it plans to do with the Mac Pro and the Mac lineup in general in the future, as well as announcing some updates for current products. The biggest takeaway is that there is a new Mac Pro coming. Apple mentioned that it will be returning to a modular design after the current one didnt work out. With the existing Mac Pro, Apple made a bet on the integrated, dual GPU structure, which proved to be a mistake, as it did not allow easy upgrades since the thermal design was unsuitable for more modern and more powerful GPUs. Also, the dual GPU architecture did not take off as expected, which made it unsuitable for certain tasks. With the upcoming design, Apple will be bringing the ability to upgrade the CPU as well as GPU for a more future-ready pro system. Apple also announced that it will also be making a new pro display. Apple bowed out of the pro display market after they discontinued the Thunderbolt display and worked on a new range of monitors with LG. However, those who would rather have an Apple branded pro display can now breathe easy again as there will be one coming next year along with the new Mac Pro. Apple also talked about the iMac, and how it never expected it to be so popular with pro users. That may have something to do with the current Mac Pro being so incompetent that the pro users had no choice but to go with the next best option, but I digress. Apple said it is also working on a new iMac with more focus on the pro functionality, and that it will be coming some time this year. As for the Mac mini, Apple refused to comment on any future updates. For the time being, Apple has announced spec boost for the current Mac Pro models, which will be available this week. The $2999 model gets 6-core Intel Xeon from the previous quad-core and dual AMD D500 GPU from the previous D300. The $3999 model gets an 8-core Xeon CPU from the previous 6-core and dual D700 GPU from the previous D500. Everything else remains identical. This is only for those who have to buy a Mac Pro right now. Everybody else would do well to wait a year.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 4, 2017 2:59 PM PT Credit: Apple More like this Imagination's new GPU could power Apple iPhone 8 graphics Apple's building its own graphics processor for the iPhone, dropping... Apple's graphics provider wants to bring VR to affordable Android phones Video Hands on with Launchboom's do-everything wearable, Pinn Apple has one big reason to move to a homegrown GPU: It wants full control over the hardware and software in its devices. The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. [ Further reading: Best graphics cards for PC gaming ] Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music.

The red phone is the result of a partnership with (RED). Apple has been partnering with (RED) on products for over 10 years. Apple CEO Tim Cook says in a statement, "Since we began working with (RED) 10 years ago, our customers have made a significant impact in fighting the spread of AIDS through the purchase of our products, from the original iPod nano (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition all the way to today's lineup of Beats products and accessories for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The introduction of this special edition iPhone in a gorgeous red finish is our biggest (PRODUCT)RED offering to date in celebration of our partnership with (RED), and we can't wait to get it into customers' hands." The new smartphone has the same features as the other designs in the iPhone 7 lineup. It is available in 128GB and 256GB models starting at $749. It can be found here on apple.com and in Apple Stores. A portion of sales from the red smartphone will help fund HIV/AIDS programs through (Product) Red. Quartz reports that the marketing for the red iPhone 7 in China neglects to mention the charitable component of the new phone.

Use a VPN Jailbreak Guide: Can I jailbreak?   skip to main content skip to main menu     Analyst: iPhone 8 to be priced relative to Galaxy S8+ By Christian Zibreg, Apr 4, 2017 Tweet 10 Comments Two months ago, Fast Company reported that iPhone 8 would start at above $1,000 due to costlier components and advanced technologies, such as wireless charging, VR capabilities, revamped industrial design, a curved AMOLED screen and more. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich begs to differ, telling CNBC that the device will come in for less than $1,000 as new models are expected to see a “bulge of buying”. He predicted a sale price of iPhone 8 would be between $850 and $900. “We think an $870 price would be accretive to earnings per share but dilutive to gross margin, a dynamic Apple has said it would accept,” UBS noted. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 is priced at $720 and its larger-screened Galaxy S8+ counterpart costs $840. Apple rarely ventures above competitors’ price in the high end, UBS underscored. Although iPhone 8 will be at a display size disadvantage to Galaxy S8+, they’re convinced Apple will price it relative to Samsung’s top model. Here’s an excerpt from Milunovich’s research note: Offsetting this display size differential is the fact that iPhone 8 could have features not included in Galaxy S8+, such as a front facing 3D sensing camera, embedded fingerprint sensor and higher quality facial recognition. UBS is “cautious” on how much higher Apple could go on price given a smaller display. “Apple customers seem fine with paying more for products they feel are differentiated,” he added. Case in point: iPhone 7 Plus, which “has had more demand than any other Plus model released” thanks to the dual camera. The investment bank pegged bill of materials for a 64-gigabye edition of iPhone 8 to be $70 to $90 higher than that of today’s flagship iPhone 7 Plus model. The higher cost will hurt Apple’s gross margin which UBS said is likely to decline to 38.5 percent in the fiscal 2018 year from its estimate of 38.7 percent for the current fiscal year. iPhone 8 could account for 45 percent of shipments in fiscal 2018, UBS said. Based on a higher-priced iPhone 8 and a boosted upgrade cycle, the investment bank predicted that iPhone’s average selling price is likely to be $692, up from a prior estimate of $667. UBS now expects the company’s earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to be $10.55, up from its previous estimate of $10.25. Assuming iPhone 8’s hardware is impressive, will you be willing to pay the higher price?

Apple killed two vulnerabilities with iOS 10.3 that allowed malicious code to run as soon as an audio file ran on its phones. An anonymous hacker working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) disclosed the bugs, which affects Apple TV and watchOS too. Defined as a memory corruption flaw, Apple said it had addressed the problem with “improved input validation.” For undisclosed reasons, ZDI wasn’t permitted to talk about the bugs until today.

The problems derived from the way Android processed metadata within music files. This time it was just MP4s (specifically .M4A audio files) that were used by the anonymous hacker to bypass Apple security. Both vulnerabilities took advantage of the fact that there was a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data on iOS. As soon as a specially-crafted audio file was opened, malicious code could execute. Quirky iOS bugs The audio attack was one of many Apple has patched in the last week that were novel in their execution. Just yesterday, the tech giant released iOS 10.3.1 with a fix for a weakness that meant an attacker within range could have executed malicious code on the phone’s Wi-Fi chip. Google, whose Project Zero staffer Gal Beniamini discovered the bug, hadn’t provided more information on what the attack entailed. It could be similar to an issue outlined last week, when Forbes reported on a hack that only required an iPhone join an evil Wi-Fi network to be compromised. The research, from Keen Lab’s Marco Grassi, was outlined at the Black Hat Asia conference and was also rewarded by the ZDI. ZDI lead Brian Gorenc explained the researcher discovered a series of logic issues that when used in conjunction with a memory corruption bug meant he could run rogue code outside the iOS sandbox – software designed to contain malicious activity and prevent it from spreading across the operating system. Grassi exploited WebSheet, an app that launched when an iPhone connected to a public Wi-Fi network that required the user to go through a web portal to login. According to Gorenc, WebSheet was over-privileged. “[Grassi] combined this with the ability to silently install configuration profiles, and then manipulated legacy diagnostics to pivot to an un-sandboxed application,” he added. Though only highlighted in the iOS 10.3 release, the weaknesses were actually patched in 10.2. Not only did Apple patch that critical weakness, it had to patch another 82 separate vulnerabilities in iOS 10.3 last week. Perhaps the most alarming was a hack that required the user just view a JPEG image for malicious code to run. Again, the issue was disclosed by an anonymous researcher via the Zero Day Initiative. There were three other flaws that meant an attacker could have their exploit running once the photo was processed by ImageIO, the component of iOS handling images. As an added bonus for anyone downloading iOS 10.3 today, it’s shipping with the new and encrypted Apple File System (APFS), which should make it harder for hackers and police forensics teams to grab data in plain text from iPhones. Apple strikes down Thunderbolt password hack The Cupertino firm also released macOS Sierra 10.12.4 last week, where more critical vulnerabilities were addressed. That included a bug that meant a hacker could siphon off passwords for FileVault encrypted storage on a Mac, as discovered by Swedish security professional Ulf Frisk. He told Forbes he found the flaw in August last year and it was quietly patched back in December, using what’s known as a direct memory access attack. He created a $300 device – a malicious Thunderbolt adapter – that could extract the passwords using that technique. Describing the nature of the threat, Frisk added: “Imagine leaving your MacBook locked or at sleep in your hotel room. Anyone with access to it could just have plugged in this $300 device, rebooted it, gotten the FileVault password, typed the password and logged in as you – having access to all your files, your iCloud, everything. You might not even have noticed afterwards. I can imagine a tool like this being used by governments and industrial spies.” Indeed, the Wikileaks CIA files released earlier this month showed the agency was working on similar techniques, using a rogue Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter as a way into Apple Mac internals.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Project Zero uncovers a nasty Wi-Fi chip exploit Posted 9 hours ago by Kate Conger (@kateconger) 0 SHARES Next Story Fae is a new open-source content management system based on Rails Google’s Project Zero has been on a roll lately, unveiling sophisticated bugs in Cloudflare, LastPass and now Broadcom, a Wi-Fi chip supplier whose product is found in iPhones, Nexuses and Samsung devices. Apple patched the bug in a security update yesterday (10.3.1 — and if you’re an Apple customer, you should install this update right away) and Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini explained the exploit in detail in a blog post today. “An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip,” Apple said in its security update notes. This is not good! It is quite bad, in fact, and that might explain why Apple pushed out 10.3.1 so quickly (10.3 was released only a week ago). Apple and Google declined to comment. By chaining together a series of exploits on the Broadcom chip, Beniamini was able to demonstrate a “full device takeover by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction.” This means an attacker on a shared Wi-Fi network could quietly compromise your device without ever tipping you off. Beniamini demonstrated his research on a Nexus 6P, which might account for the equivocating “may be able” in Apple’s security update. Broadcom’s chips are widely used in the mobile phone industry, so the issue extends beyond Apple into other manufacturers, as well. “Broadcom has been incredibly responsive and helpful, both in fixing the vulnerabilities and making the fixes available to affected vendors. For a complete timeline, see the bug tracker entries,” Beniamini wrote. Expect more disclosures from Beniamini — the researcher promised to divulge more about the vulnerability soon.

For the first time in three years, Apple has updated the specs and pricing for the cylindrical tower it first released in 2013. While the design remains the same, the entry-level $2,999 (£2,999) model gives consumers a better deal thanks to the six-core Xeon Processor, as opposed to the quad-core CPU. It also has duel Fire Pro D500 CPUs and 16GB RAM, For those willing to fork out an extra $1000 (£900), they’ll get an eight-core processor and D700 GPUs for $2,999/£3,899. Unfortunately, although the internals have been modified, Apple has chosen not to update the connectivity options, saving USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 tech for next year’s “complete rethink”. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 review Earlier on Tuesday. Apple apologized for letting down its professional customers vis-à-vis the absence of Mac Pro updates down the years. The company also offered some rare culpability, saying the design of the Mac Pro had limited the firm’s capacity to take the range further. "We designed ourselves into a bit of a corner” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s SVP of software engineering. "We wanted to do something bold and different. What we didn’t appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailored that design to a specific vision that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in – into a circular shape.” The question is, giving the possibility of a completely revamped Mac Pro, will consumers be interested in today’s hardware updates?

(KTRK) KTRK By Patricia Lopez Tuesday, April 04, 2017 04:34PM HOUSTON (KTRK) -- Buying brand new Apple products can be pretty pricey, especially if you need to buy more than one item. But there is a way to get these hot electronics at a discounted price. It's often sticker shock when you walk into an Apple store. There's a new player in town and they are making those slick products a lot more affordable. You wouldn't think an Apple computer would bring tears to Christina and William Sizemore's eyes, but it did. The couple lost their home to a fire in February. A candle caused the fire. Because Christine is a graphic designer, she had four Mac computers in her office that were destroyed in the fire. Starting brand new wasn't an option. That's when the couple turned to David Scarbrough, the owner of Experimac in West Houston. The savings can be significant. Prices vary based on the age and condition of a product, but you can expect to save up to 60 percent over buying new. For example, a 15-inch Macbook Pro retails brand new for $1,799. At Experimac, it's $849. We also spotted an 11-inch Macbook Air for $819 and an iPad4 with 32-gig memory for $280. The most recent iPhones are about 40 percent off. Plus, they also perform repairs. All of their products come with a one year warranty. It's the reason why the Sizemores are rebuilding their office with these used Apple products. Find the Experimac location closest to you.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Image Source: Olly Curtis/Future/REX/Shutterstock Apple-branded display in the works for iMac ‘Pro’ and Mac Pro Chris Smith @chris_writes April 4th, 2017 at 5:07 PM Share Tweet Apple on Tuesday announced a mild refresh for the Mac Pro, but the biggest news concerned the future of the Mac line. All the pressure from fans worked, as Apple felt compelled to reveal details about products that aren’t even ready. The Cupertino-based company confirmed its commitment to the Mac by reassuring professionals that it’s working on new products. The Mac Pro was the main topic of conversation with a few hand-picked members of the media, with Apple revealing that a redesigned Mac Pro is currently in the works, but won’t be released this year. On top of that, Apple is working on some products that may be even more exciting than the Mac Pro, including the iMac and a successor to Apple’s now-dead Thunderbolt Display line. Don't Miss: The only Samsung phone more exciting than the Galaxy S8 might not launch this year According to John Gruber’s account of the meeting, Apple insisted on the Mac Pro while acknowledging that very few of its buyers purchase the desktop. The company said only 30% of Mac users are in the “pro” category. Most pro users buy notebooks and then iMacs. The Mac Pro is third on that list and only accounts for a single-digit percent of all Mac sales. Most of the people who use desktops will buy iMacs, Apple revealed. That’s why the company is working on a new line of iMacs that will debut at some point later this year. Will there be an iMac Pro in Apple’s stores this year? Apple didn’t say the name, but Phil Schiller made it clear that “configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind” are coming. Craig Federighi said the iMac evolved over the years into a tool that can be used by professionals. “But there’s still even further we can take iMac as a high performance, pro system, and we think that form factor can address even more of the pro market,” he said. One of the most interesting details of the meeting concerns Apple’s displays. Apple said that it’s working on “Apple-branded pro displays,” as Gruber refers to them, that will go along with the Mac Pro. However, Apple did not share any details about these computer monitors. It’s unclear whether the 2017 iMac and the new Apple display will offer the same hardware. Touchscreen support, however, is not something on Apple’s radar. “Touch doesn’t even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about,” Schiller told Buzzfeed. “They’re interested in things like performance and storage and expandability.” Furthermore, it’s unclear whether they will be launched alongside the new Mac Pro, or whether Apple will unveil them later this year when the new iMac and MacBooks arrive. The company discontinued the Thunderbolt Display line last year, and rumors suggested that Apple will soon launch a display that will incorporate a graphics processing unit that could aid with GPU-intensive tasks on a MacBook. Apple, however, is far from confirming this rumor. Soon after canceling its displays, Apple started selling LG’s UltraFine 5K displays in stores, without making them part of the defunct Thunderbolt line. The UltraFine displays aren’t compatible with current Mac Pro models but work with select MacBooks and iMacs.

The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement.

Excited for Apple Dubai Mall!"   As Ahrendts was tweeting about the new Apple Store, the news was being reported on by Gulf News. The report noted that "The two-level shop will enjoy one of the best locations in the mall and is believed to be one of the biggest in the region, further cementing the brand's presence in the Middle East.   Set amidst an array of dining outlets, the new store will offer customers great views of the Burj Khalifa and the Dubai Fountain, the world's largest dancing fountain.     The date for the outlet's grand opening has yet to be revealed, but the barricade surrounding the storefront has just been unveiled, giving mall visitors a hint of what's coming up.   With a concept titled 'Creativity. Connected', the barricade is a mural wall that seeks to showcase the creative community in the UAE, including start-ups, independent art galleries and local app developers to boutiques, cafes and food trucks.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

By Christian Zibreg, Apr 4, 2017 Tweet 1 Comment Released nine days ago, iOS 10.3 appears to be randomly re-enabling iCloud features that users previously disabled in Settings. The software update consolidates the various iCloud and Apple ID-related features under one central place at the top of the Settings app. The new organization has nothing to do with this behavior. It’s a bug, Apple told customers in an email message obtained by MacRumors, that affects a small number of users. In its issued communique, the iCloud team advises that customers revisit their iCloud settings in the Settings app and manually disable any service that iOS 10.3 may have mistakenly re-enabled on their behalf. For instance, if you disabled iCloud Mail in Settings, be sure that the feature remains disabled after updating to iOS 10.3 Here’s Apple’s message in its entirety: We discovered a bug in the recent iOS 10.3 software update that impacted a small number of iCloud users. This may have inadvertently reenabled some iCloud services that you had previously disabled on your device. We suggest you go to iCloud settings on your iOS device to make sure that only the services you’d like to use are enabled. Learn more about how to manage your iCloud settings or contact AppleCare with any questions. The iCloud team iOS 10.3.1, which released yesterday, fixed a Wi-Fi vulnerability but not this bug. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Apple is currently testing an iOS 10.3.2 update with developers. We know that iOS 10.3.2 contains bug fixes and various improvements, but it’s unclear if the software update will squash this bug. Do yourself a favor and launch Settings, then tap your profile picture at the top and hit iCloud to check if all your settings look good.

Name: Subject: Message: Apple Music for Android gets a big UI redesign and more Newsby John Callaham10 hours ago 15 314 9 Shutterstock Several months after the Apple Music app for Android ditched its beta tag, it’s getting another big update. This time, the user interface is getting a redesign which makes it look more like the version that’s running on iOS 10 for the iPhone and iPad. See also: Apple Music vs Spotify vs Google Play Music December 20, 2016 What does this mean for Android Apple Music users? Well, it means the app’s various sections should be easier to navigate. That includes For You, a section devoted to recommending new music and playlists based on your previous favorites. You can access your own music faster with the improved Library section. You can also check out the lyrics to each song that’s played in the app’s music player, because the words you may think are in your favorite tune might not always be correct. While having a refreshed user interface is certainly welcome, we do have to wonder what Apple’s level of commitment is to offering timely updates to its Music app for Android going forward. It took several months for the new UI to make its way from iOS to Android, and we suspect those sort of updates will continue for the foreseeable future.’Keep in mind that full access to Apple Music does require a paid subscription at $9.99 a month. Apple plans to add access to original TV shows in the near future for Music subscribers, including Carpool Karaoke and Planet of the Apps.

By Emily Bary April 4, 2017 3:32 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple decided to let reporters in on a secret this week: a new Mac Pro is coming sometime next year. Illustration: Getty Images Apple is famously tight-lipped between product announcements, preferring to let fans merely speculate about what’s to come. The company made an exception Monday, when its marketing chief Phil Schiller invited a group of reporters to the hallowed grounds where the company develops Mac prototypes. More from Barron’s Next An Apple Analyst Goes Searching for the Next Big Thing Apple: A Recipe for the Next Five Years Here’s How Apple Shares Could Hit $200 The conversation focused on the Mac Pro, according to Tech Crunch, which attended the meeting. The current version of the computer, casually known as the trash can for its cylindrical shape, hasn’t been a particularly strong seller. Apple loyalists have questioned whether the company was going to abandon the professional market altogether. “We are in the process of what we call completely rethinking the Mac Pro,” Schiller said. That means a new Pro and a new external display -- just not in 2017. Apple last updated the Mac Pro in 2013. The new machine, though, won’t have a touch screen, as Microsoft’s pro computer, the Surface Studio, does. Apple also said that it would be coming out with new iMacs later this year that would have better specs -- presumably making them more appealing to customers who use a lot of professional apps. Is this a signal that Apple will be more forthcoming in the future? Probably not. While the company pointed out that its Mac business is close to having the revenue of a Fortune 100 company, desktops just don’t move the needle much in this iPhone world. We expect Apple to stay quiet on the big stuff. Big Picture: Apple offered a rare view into its upcoming Mac plans.

Less exciting is the spec bumps that make the current lineup more affordable in the meantime, and the company also added in confirmation that new iMac models are coming later this year. But is Apple’s pre-announcement for new Mac Pros enough to address pro concerns? The best 4K & 5K displays for Mac If you’ve been following the conversation surrounding Apple’s recent pro product releases, it’s probably less shocking that it decided to make a rare move and pre-announce new Mac Pros in an interview with journalists long before they are ready to ship. It’s not just the fact that many have been questioning Apple’s commitment to the Mac Pro after going years without an update, there has also been recent dialog that the company is focusing less on the needs of pros in general. Most recently with the new MacBook Pro models that received controversy over a move to all USB-C ports, configuration options, and the introduction of Touch Bar, as well as its decision to give its display business to LG. The LG 5K displays it announced alongside the new MacBook Pros and recommended for users received poor reviews and were later recalled. Part of Apple’s announcement today included confirmation it’s also now building a display to release alongside the new Mac Pro. So, in a move to seemingly address these concerns, Apple has decided to do what it doesn’t usually do and talk about its plans before they are ready to show off a real product. To recap, the main announcements today included: Apple is building a new “completely rethought” Mac Pro with a modular design that is capable of running high-end CPUs and GPUs that can be updated. There will also be a display to go along with it, and both will come out some time next after this year. Until then it has spec bumps on current Mac Pros starting today There will also be new iMacs coming this year suitable for some pros Apple is sorry What do you think?

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ?

Apple quietly released the iOS 10.3 update just a few days ago. In the email, Apple allegedly told users the update may have accidently re-enabled iCloud services that had previously been disabled. Read: iOS 10.3.1 Update: Download Latest iOS Update To Fix Wi-Fi Vulnerability “We discovered a bug in the recent iOS 10.3 software update that impacted a small number of iCloud users,” the email said according to MacRumors. “This may have inadvertently reenabled some iCloud services that you had previously disabled on your device.” The company reportedly asked users to go to their iCloud settings to make sure they turn off any service that could have been mistakenly turned on with the update.   If you want to check which iCloud services are enabled on your iOS device, go to Settings, click on the top section which displays your name (that section includes Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes and App Store), tap on iCloud to see the apps and services using iCloud and use the toggle to turn it off or on. Read: Apple TV Bundle Could Include HBO, Showtime, Starz Via iOS And Apple TV The iOS 10.3 update was released after weeks of beta testing. The update comes with a new Apple File System, Siri improvements and the feature to find AirPods using the “Find My iPhone” app. The new update also features a breakdown of iCloud storage, which could be why there was an issue with iCloud for some users. iOS 10.3 also seemed to cause battery problems for some users, as some reported battery draining problems with the update. Apple Releases iOS 10.3.1 Just days after the release of iOS 10.3, Apple released iOS 10.3.1 Monday. The update fixes a serious security flaw which made iOS devices vulnerable to attacks sent via Wi-Fi, Apple said. The flaw patched by the new update affected devices with a Wi-Fi chip, including the iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later and iPod touch 6th generation and later.

The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Twitter Facebook What users could expect from Apple's homegrown GPUs for iPhones, iPads iPhones could get better gaming, AI, and image recognition features Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 05 April, 2017 06:16 - - - - print email Comments Apple has one big reason to move to a homegrown GPU: It wants full control over the hardware and software in its devices. The device maker is apparently developing its own GPU from scratch after dumping Imagination Technologies' PowerVR architecture, which is being used in the iPhone 7. The smartphone runs on the PowerVR A10 Fusion chip. It's not certain when Apple's homegrown GPU will appear in devices, and the company didn't respond to request for comment. Apple has made graphics improvement a priority in its iPhone and iPad models, so users should get better gaming experiences. The homegrown GPU could also boost artificial intelligence capabilities on Apple's devices, and also bring on board features like image recognition. Apple already uses its own CPU, and a homegrown GPU was the next logical step. The company has already developed its own storage controllers and wireless chips in a bid to cut reliance on external suppliers. To build the best chip for devices, Apple needs to have control over all the critical pieces, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Apple's looking at the iPhone and saying, 'How can we make it better?'" said McGregor. Apple tunes its software to work hand-in-hand with its hardware. With the homegrown GPU, Apple will optimize the graphics to work closely with its Metal graphics API, which is similar to Microsoft's DirectX. Apple's iOS also supports OpenGL. The GPU will add more versatility to iPhones and iPads, and likely push Apple into new markets, said David Kanter, president of Real World Technologies. GPUs are being used to run digital assistants, image recognition, natural language processing, and other AI applications. Apple's GPU could be tuned for Siri, and also for image analysis and filtering in the Safari browser and other apps. Apple will be able to harness the processing power of GPUs -- which are generally considered faster than CPUs -- to accelerate other applications. Apple supports the OpenCL parallel programming framework for Mac applications but has no iOS implementation yet. The time had come for Apple to develop its own GPU as Imagination's PowerVR wasn't a good match for the iPhone 7. Though the A10 Fusion GPU was faster than the competition, it was too power hungry and couldn't sustain high levels of performance for long. "We believe the iPhone 7, to avoid overheating, throttles back from its top GPU speed after a minute or less, preventing it from achieving a high score for all users," said analyst Linley Gwennap, of The Linley Group, in a research note in December. Relying on Imagination Technologies for graphics was risky for Apple. Apple is a minority shareholder in Imagination, which has been rumored to be on the sales block. Moreover, Imagination wasn't the graphics chip leader it once was. Qualcomm, ARM, Nvidia, and other vendors offer mobile GPUs and have jumped ahead of Imagination in recent years. Apple built up a team to design a GPU by poaching graphics experts out of Imagination, AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. The company is also looking to hire many graphics experts for Macs and mobile devices, with a focus on chip design. The company has the patience, skilled employees, and resources to make its own GPU, Kanter said. Apple's approach to bringing graphics technologies in-house has been gradual. It developed Metal, the compilers, and has been incorporating custom graphics cores that are now used in the iPhone 7. Last year, Kanter's analysis of the GPU in the iPhone 7 led to a conclusion that the company was likely on its way to making a homegrown GPU. He found Apple making big changes in the GPU in the A10 chip's PowerVR architecture, such as a redesigned shader core. At the time, Kanter said Apple "could continue to customize more and more of their GPU – eventually designing out Imagination Technologies." There are also rumors about Apple putting its ARM-based chips in Macs, which demand more graphics power. Designing a more powerful GPU that consumes more power can be complicated, and it's perhaps something Apple won't be chasing for now, Kanter said. Apple's approach to developing a homegrown GPU is similar to that of Google. Google picked up data center hardware from regular suppliers, customized it, and eventually, made the hardware itself. But challenges for Apple remain, particularly legal challenges from Imagination, which has questioned Apple's claim of developing an independent GPU technology. Imagination did not accept Apple's claims, saying it would be "extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture" from scratch without Apple infringing on Imagination's IP rights. "Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it," Imagination said in a statement. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

 The Mac’s declining relevance to Apple, in one chart Jeff Dunn Apr. 4, 2017, 4:12 PM 3,479 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Apple wants you to know it hasn’t forgotten about hardcore Mac users. The company this week told a small group of journalists that it’s working on new iMac and Mac Pro desktop computers, both of which are said to be aimed at pro users. The former is expected to arrive this year, while the latter, which Apple says will be completely redesigned, is set to arrive in 2018 at the earliest. To be clear: Apple doesn’t do this often. It doesn’t pre-announce new products, and it doesn’t go out of its way to prove it still loves its most ardent users. But after the tepid reaction to the latest MacBook Pros from hardcore fans, it seems to have felt the need to declare, months in advance, that it hears them. This chart from Statista helps explain why Apple may be so slow to update Mac hardware in recent years, though. Put simply, it’s just not as big a deal anymore: With the iPhone and iPad helping to change the way we use computers, the Mac now makes up just 11% of Apple’s yearly revenue. It is a phone company, first and foremost. That said, everything looks small next to the iPhone. Apple says the Mac is still a $25 billion business on its own, and its second-biggest segment overall. And while “pro” Mac users makes up just a fraction of Apple’s total audience, it’s good optics to keep them happy, and many of them are likely developers that Apple will want to develop future iPhone apps.

In that time, Mac users have become increasingly impatient with the company, which is why Apple decided to break with years of tradition and invite a group of writers to an office building on its campus to explain what it had in store for the Mac in the coming months and years. Don't Miss: Apple has started preparing for crazy iPhone 8 sales John Gruber of Daring Fireball has perhaps the most comprehensive report of the conversation, in which Phil Schiller revealed that Apple was in the process of “completely rethinking the Mac Pro.” Apple’s pricey desktop computer was last updated in 2013, but there is currently a team at Apple working on both a new Mac Pro and a new pro display. But in order for the team to build something worthwhile, it’ll need more than a year. In other words, even though Apple is announcing the new Mac Pro now, it won’t arrive in 2017. Pro consumers will have to wait until at least 2018 to get their hands on new Mac Pro hardware, but in the meantime, Apple is going to release two updated models of the current Mac Pro this week. You’ll pay $2,999 for the model featuring a 6-core Intel Xeon processor, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs and 16GB of RAM, and $3,999 for the model with an 8-core processor and dual D700 GPUs. In addition to the Mac Pro, Schiller and SVP Craig Federighi also revealed that new iMacs would launch this year, geared toward the pro market as well. When asked about whether the company is aware of the fact that many Mac users have begun to lose faith in Apple’s commitment to Macs, Schiller said this: It’s a reasonable question, and this is why we’re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We’re committed to the Mac, we‘ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we’ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers. Apple is in the business of letting its products speak for themselves. It shares new phones, tablets and computers when they’re ready to launch, expecting its fans to jump on board. Whether or not this represents a new path for Apple or is simply a stopgap to appease irritated Mac users remains to be seen, but it’s a good sign for Apple fans who depend on professional Mac hardware for work and play.

To start, Apple Music for Android drops all elements of Google's Material Design in favor of Apple's app design language. The Android app user interface now mirrors that of the iOS version. In-app navigation is simplified thanks to four major sections, called Library, For You, Browse, and Radio. These make it easier for people to move through the app to find their own music or new tunes recommended by Apple. Apple Music 2.0 for Android also adds on-screen song lyrics and larger album art. The app is free to download from the Google Play Store, but the service costs $10 per month. more info at Google Play Store » Related Google's Motion Stills for iPhone Picks Up a Useful Update more Apple news   Apple phones T-Mobile Pitches Free MLB Content to Customers more Google news Android news iOS news AD Comments Start a new discussion You must log in to post.

But even the world's poorest people will soon enjoy the benefits of instant communication and (nearly) limitless access to information. By Alistair Fairweather. Added by Alistair Fairweather on 4 April 2017. Saved under Alistair Fairweather, Opinion, Top Tags: Alistair Fairweather, Apple, Bixby, Huawei, Samsung Tweet There is no innovation more emblematic of the early 21st century than the smartphone. Putting a handheld computer combined with a video camera, permanently connected to the Internet, in the pockets of billions of people has profoundly changed society. But smartphones have already passed their peak, and will be increasingly commoditised in the next decade. The launch last week of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is a case in point. The Korean giant has sold more than a quarter of a billion Galaxy devices since 2010. Only the mighty Apple iPhone has been more successful. And yet Samsung’s newest device is not much different from the previous version. The only real differentiator with the Galaxy S8 is the edge-to-edge screen. There’s no doubt that it is a strikingly attractive phone, or that the new screen adds to its desirability. But the S8 brings little innovation to the market. Sure, it has a facial recognition feature that unlocks your phone when you look at it. And yes, it has a personal assistant, called Bixby. But neither of these are new ideas — even for Samsung. Samsung isn’t the only one struggling to differentiate its new devices. Apple’s last two iPhone versions have been largely identical. The innovations Apple has introduced in the past two years — including the much-hyped “3D touch” — are incremental at best. We also see this trend in hardware specifications. Processing power has been creeping steadily upwards, as has RAM, but there have been no substantial leaps in the last two to three years. The most significant increases have come in storage — top-end phones now offer up to 256GB of capacity — but that has more to do with falling component prices due to economies of scale rather than innovation. The fact that this lack of innovation hasn’t affected sales shows us two things: firstly, most customers don’t really care about new features, and secondly, we’ve reached the natural plateau that governs every technology known to man. If you ask most ordinary users about the processor or the RAM in their device, they will neither know nor care. It’s equivalent to asking them what brand of spark plugs they have in their car, or whether they prefer one brand of lightbulb over another. Most customers use a tiny fraction of the features offered by their smartphone, and they are perfectly happy with that state of affairs. This convergence of customer expectations usually coincides with a technology reaching maturity, and with a rapid slowdown in changes to that technology. Every innovation known to man, from fire to the internal combustion engine to the semiconductor, is subject to this natural law. The only thing that differs is how long it takes to reach this plateau. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 is far from revolutionary, the writer argues The plateau might sound like a good thing for device makers. When technologies are well understood they are cheaper to produce and have stable and reliable markets. But both Samsung and Apple know that this plateau also means that low-cost competitors can begin to close the innovation gap and to eat into their profits. Take Huawei, for example. Five years ago, this Chinese cellular equipment giant was largely unknown outside of the telecommunications industry. Its latest handset, the P10, is roughly comparable with the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7. It’s attractive, functional and powerful. It lacks some of the sex appeal of the big-name brands, but it’s 40% cheaper than either of them. In five years, Huawei’s devices will be every bit as polished as the mega brands. Once smartphone technology is largely commoditised, Samsung and Apple will struggle to maintain their super profit margins. This is why both companies are spending record amounts on research and development, seeking to maintain the gap between themselves and upstarts like Huawei. More than 40% of people on the planet already own a smartphone. That percentage will rise to above 60% by the middle of the next decade. By that time, smartphones will have finished their evolution into functional appliances. Apple and Samsung will probably become the Mercedes and BMW of the smartphone market — substantial players in the luxury segment, but not dominant in the industry as a whole. There’s one clear winner in this titanic battle: the ordinary customer. Smartphones will keep getting cheaper and more ubiquitous, giving even the world’s poorest people the benefits of instant communication and (nearly) limitless access to information. We may be bored with our phones, but the technology they contain will change the lives of another two billion people in the next 10 years. We should welcome that.  — (c) 2017 NewsCentral Media Share this article Tweet Big Bass It’s very impressive if one tracks the evolution of data speed capability. The S8 can do 1Gbps – YES ONE GIGABIT PER SEC – to a handheld device. We are already achieving 200Mbps on S7 and iPhone 7. All we now need is spectrum. Davebee All we need is spectrum. Silly old me for thinking that all we REALLY need is to be free of a raging gang of cadre cronies handing the country over to a coterie of sleaze bags based in the middle east. But I suppose here in the 21st century, insanely expensive electronic baubles take pride of place over all else.

Plus tax. According to 9to5Mac, Apple is emailing iTunes customers who recently purchased Workflow to let them know that the app is now free and that refunds are imminent. It’s unclear exactly what the purchase window is for refunds, although 9to5Mac reported one Twitter user had bought his version “some weeks ago.” When Apple confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch in late March, a company spokesperson said Workflow would remain in the App Store as a free app, but didn’t say whether Workflow’s technology would be built into iOS. That would make sense, given that Apple is pitching the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement and Workflow’s behind-the-scenes automation is tailor-made for getting work done on in iOS.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars APPS Apple Music for Android is finally on par with its iOS counterpart Jordan Novet@jordannovet April 4, 2017 1:08 PM Above: Apple Music for Android, version 2.0.0. Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Apple today updated the Android app for its Apple Music service to make the app’s user interface match Apple Music for iOS, macOS, and Windows (through iTunes). Version 2.0.0 of the Android app, which has 10 million to 50 million downloads from the Google Play store, sheds the frankly mixed-up look and feel of the original incarnation of Apple Music, which debuted in 2015. In September Apple revamped the iOS app, centering on larger black, white, and red text blocks and larger boxes and images. There’s less clutter, too. But the Android app went almost entirely untouched, for six months. Today that changes. The updated version of Apple Music for Android has reshuffled things that existed in the old version, like Beats 1 shows, albums from a vast catalog, and the search function. But now you can see song lyrics from the Now Playing page, for one thing. The My New Music Mix playlist, which is comparable to Spotify’s Discovery Weekly, is available too. There’s also a security fix in this app update. David Coomber from Info-Sec.CA found that “an attacker in a privileged network position” could potentially leak user data, and Apple has fixed the issue by improving certificate validation, the company said in a security update. Not everything in the app is working as you might expect. If your Apple ID account has two-factor authentication turned on, you’ll be told to “type your password followed by the verification code shown on your other devices,” but all you can do is hit cancel or retry. There’s no place to enter the verification code. A viable workaround is turning off two-factor authentication, and then turning it back on again once you’re in. (A reader suggested putting in your password and then putting your six-digit verification code at the end of your password.) It’s not every day that Apple releases or updates an Android app, as Android is the rival, and more dominant, mobile operating system. But Apple increasingly cares about web services such as Apple Music; services are a growth area for the company. For the quarter that ended on December 31, services gave Apple $7.17 billion in revenue, up 18 percent year to year. Apple Music had more than 20 million subscribers as of December.

Apple Music 2.0 for Android has the slick and simplified new look and the addition the Lyrics feature that enables listeners to read (and sing) along in the Now Playing view. New music now appears in the Browse tab, while the Library section now meets it easier to see the music that has been downloaded for offline playback. Related: Android O - 8 features you get you excited for the release The Radio section now features the ability to easily find Beats 1 shows or to start stations from any genre, while recommendations have also been overhauled. Here’s what Apple promises in the changelog (via 9to5Google): WHAT’S NEW An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. You can download Apple Music v2.0 from the Google Play store today. The overhaul isn't a surprise, given the original Apple Music app also matched up to its iOS 9 predecessor, but it's interesting to see Apple's only proper Android app maintain a near identical feel to its stablemate.

Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse.

There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone.

Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple finally upgrades the Mac Pro, admits the trash can design sucks Apple finally upgrades the Mac Pro, admits the trash can design sucks By Joel Hruska on April 4, 2017 at 2:41 pm Comment Just over four years ago, Apple unveiled a new Mac Pro that it swore would reinvent the concept of a workstation. The new system was definitely daring — it ditched internal expansion for six Thunderbolt 2 ports and told users with internal hard drives to buy new external chassis and use those instead. It shipped with dual graphics cards as a standard, despite how Apple has never demonstrated aptitude or interest in pushing GPU-centric computing (the company’s operating systems have been stuck supporting ancient versions of OpenGL for years now). Today, the company finally took a small step towards upgrading the current Mac Pro design, but it also acknowledged what we’ve all known for years — the trash can aesthetic of the 2013 Mac Pro makes it a serious pain to work with. As of today, Apple has tweaked the Mac Pro to include a six-core CPU (up from four) in the $2,999 model and an eight-core CPU (up from six) in the $3,999 model. The GPUs have also been slightly updated; the $2,999 system now ships with dual D500s, while the $3,999 rig ships with dual D700s. Given that these are GCN 1.0 GPUs with the D700 equivalent to AMD’s old HD 7970, we can’t really recommend them. According to Daring Fireball, Apple is planning a major overhaul to its Mac Pro lineup next year, with a more modular design and a product that’s easier to update. As for why the Mac Pro hasn’t been updated for four years, here’s DF’s explanation: Let’s say you’re Apple. You’re faced with the following problem. Three years ago you launched a radical new lineup of Mac Pros. For multiple reasons, you haven’t shipped an update to those machines since. At some point you came to the conclusion that the 2013 Mac Pro concept was fundamentally flawed… [T]hat tight integration made it hard to update regularly. The idea that expansion could be handled almost entirely by external Thunderbolt peripherals sounded good on paper, but hasn’t panned out in practice. And the GPU design was a bad prediction. Apple bet on a dual-GPU design (multiple smaller GPUs, with “pro”-level performance coming from parallel processing) but the industry has gone largely in the other direction (machines with one big GPU). It’s rather frustrating to see corporations declare, years after the fact, that things end users immediately called out as problems are actually, you know, problems. Heck, Apple’s workstation competitors have been mocking its design with salient points about the limitations of the trash can since the platform shipped four years ago, as captured in the ad below by Boxx: I respect Apple for trying to build something new and unusual, I truly do. But the Mac Pro went too far in the wrong direction in its quest to establish itself as unique and different. A whisper-quiet workstation with high-end peripherals is a noble goal, but not if it fundamentally handicaps both the end-user and the corporation that designed it from upgrading the underlying platform. While Apple has upgraded the Xeons inside the Mac Pro, we recommend against making a purchase until more information is available on what these chips can do. While clock speeds on modern chips have scarcely budged since 2013, certain capabilities, like AVX2, still may not be available. It depends on whether Apple stuck with Ivy Bridge-era Xeons (as I’m guessing they did) or actually updated to a more recent iteration of Intel’s Core architecture. Apple’s new, “completely rethought” Mac Pro will be available next year, as will a new “Pro” display. Maybe by then, the (presumably) next-gen Oculus Rift will support it?

Typically, I would follow up that initial statement with jokes about Apple products being featured here on an Android site and how no one uses it and all that jazz, but the reality is that many of you may use this, should you be on a family plan or need all the Chance or Drake exclusives you can get in real-time. So yeah, Apple Music update! The update is v2.0.0 and features an “all-new” design with “greater clarity and simplicity.” It looks like a lot of white mixed with dots and lines of Droid Life’s pink color. Dare I say, it’s hot?  There is also new “Now Playing” feature that allows you to read lyrics as you listen to a song, a “Library” section with all of your goodies, and some other browsing tweaks and recommendation stuff.

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus may not deliver super screen resolutions, but they hit the right notes for many buyers and with iOS 10 there are even more reasons the iPhone is better than Android for many users. iPhone competition includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, One Plus 3, the LG V20 and other phones that deliver a bigger challenge for Apple — but there are still places where the iPhone is clearly better than Android and iOS 10 is better than Android Nougat. Many of these could change with the Galaxy S8 and the LG G6 later this year, but for now – iPhone has an edge. You need to learn what the iPhone does better and how Apple delivers a better experience than Android to see if an iPhone is the best smartphone for you in 2017. Here are 15 reasons the iPhone is better than Android phones in 2017. Use our list of reasons the iPhone is better than Android to figure out which new smartphone you should buy this year. Read our iPhone 7 review to learn what sets this phone apart from the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. You can buy the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus at a discount with the best iPhone 7 Black Friday deals. Read: Siri Tips & Tricks Even if you think you know which phone is best, you might be surprised to learn about all the reasons the iPhone is better than Android. iPhone Apps Are First and Better Looking Most of the popular apps are on both platforms, but many top games and apps still come to iPhone first. We’re seeing more apps come to both Android and iPhone at the same time, but there are still way more iPhone only apps that we see than Android only. When apps are available on iPhone and Android we still often see a better design on the iPhone version than on Android. This is something that still rings true in 2017. For example, we still see some new Snapchat features and Spotify features come to iPhone before Android. iPhone owners are enjoying Super Mario Run, but the Super Mario Run Android app is still on the way. Read: Best iPhone Apps Apps are an area where the gap is closing, but the differences still exist and are noticeable. We also see Apple take better care of the App Store. Recently they purged 47,300 apps from the app store that were simply bad or abandoned. Fast iPhone Updates for All iPhone owners enjoy quick and regular iOS updates for the iPhone no matter what carrier they use. Faster updates are available for all iPhone owners. Android updates take months to arrive on all the devices. After an Android device is 18 months old, you may need to wait for a new Android smartphone to get the latest software. Apple delivers iPhone updates to devices that are three years old. Apple offers iPhone 4s iOS 9 support. It is unheard of to see support for an Android phone that old. iOS 10 is available for the iPhone 5. When you look at Android devices support ends much faster. Google promises at least two years for Nexus devices, which means Nexus 6 support ends this fall and the Nexus 6P in September 2017. Google may push farther out, but it is not a guarantee. Other Android device manufacturers don’t typically match the longevity of iOS updates. On top of the added update support, Apple does not allow carriers to hold up the updates. As soon as the update is available from Apple it is available on every carrier. If you really want Android Nougat, you may need to simply buy a new Android phone. Works Great with All Your Devices If you own an iPhone, iPad and Mac your information flows smoothly from one device to the other. You can quickly sync photos to all of your devices, answer a phone call on your iPad or Mac and send text messages from your other devices. There is also support for Handoff that allows you to start a task on your iPhone and continue on your iPad or Mac. The iPhone works great with the iPad and Mac. Overall the connectivity between these devices is something Android doesn’t yet match without relying on a collection of third-party applications and services to hodgepodge together a similar feature. Sharing a file from your iPhone to your Mac is also faster and easier thanks to AirDrop. This built-in service sends the file wirelessly directly to the Mac, even when there is no other WiFi around.

You simply can’t go wrong. I own an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Apple TV. I would not even consider anything else, especially something from that “G…” company which I abhor. I won’t even use their search engine. Same goes for anything from that software manufacturer that, well, just call it “MS). Try calling any other manufacturer for support and see if you can understand what they are saying. I suppose I am bias toward Apple but after nearly 30 years of dealing with computers of all sorts I guess my opinion is warranted. 07/17/2015 gabe Reply why people like iphones? I never understood why anyone would like to give control to another company of what you do with their device. why force u to follow MEDIA SHARING and digital rights media? you cannot torrent on iPhone, nor transfer music and videos without ITunes or a paid online service in iOS.

I’m just the O’Hare delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, so I say let it grow. 03/04/2017 Evie Reply It is simply the portability. I have watch ,I go to the gym. I have apple computer and I can receive my phone calls there and iMessages. It crashes less often than microsoft does. I can contact apple support, whenever I want. The other time ,the bluetooth in my iPhone did not work, I contacted tech support midnight and they were available. We could not fix the problem. They called me the next day and told me to go to the nearest store and pick up a brand new phone. One more thing, my iPhone was out of warranty for 165 days. They told me they cared about customer satisfaction. When I called microsoft in order to talk to me they wanted $250. Now, compare 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply You’re literally so idiotic that you can’t spell the full name of a company. Only Apple, cuz you’re an I sheep. You can go very wrong. If people were smart these days, they would understand that iPhones are unequivocally not the right choice for them. You wouldn’t recommend anything else, because it is too limited and unintelligent to use anything else. Stop trying to influence other people to buy garbage phones and devices 05/12/2016 Nancy Reply Why are u being a hypocrite calling someone idiotic for not knowing how to spell the company name right when some of ur sentences don’t even make sense. Apple doesn’t have any competition be used it is the best phone to get. 07/13/2016 Rona Reply First of all, don’t criticize someone for calling someone else idiotic when you can’t even use proper spelling or grammar. Second, Apple is all marketing. There is nothing special about it. Android offers phones that have expandable memory (and guess who doesn’t?) and better high-speed data services. iPhones die extremely quickly, you can’t use iTunes on any other devices, whereas Android platforms are available on all devices, the picture quality on an iPhone is pathetic compared to Androids, and Apple products are majorly behind in technology. The latest update for an iPhone came out two years ago for an Android. Apple has a set array of things it can do, and you can’t customize or change that. But if you want a high-end technology phone, choose an Android. It does so much more and you can customize and change its features. I have had both an iPhone and an Android phone. 09/14/2016 Abhishek well,mam i am an android user and i would like to say that iphones are the best because when you buy an android first it will give you good performance but after one month it will start hanging and work slow and that is same with every android devices.and their are so many android malware which also affect performance. Iphones are the best, secure and stable. 09/15/2016 Me Stay butthurt, loser ; ) 12/04/2016 jgames “nothing special about it” fastest phone ever 3d touch very good camera looks very nice “nothing special about it” why do we need expandable memory on iOS? gime a few reasons for that. “better high-speed data” give me your source for all this information. iphones die extremely quickly? how? do you even have an iphone? iphones have much better standby and screen on time with heavy usage than android. you cant use itunes on other devices, yes, but ios wants to keep it ios exclusive because their services are one of the major selling points for them. android platforms are available everywhere, but google software is usually preferred to ios software. pathetic picture quality? wut? iphone pictures wont lose quality when you zoom in and support much more colors than any old android camera. android cameras are very nice as well, though. “apple are behind in technology” a lot of people say this but it’s actually quite the opposite. 3d touch was very innovative, its like a ‘right click’ for your phone. the latest iphone update did not come out 2 years ago. you seem like you have no idea what you’re talking about and just spouting nonsense. apple can do a lot of things without customization, but what customization do we really need? people always saying android is more customizable but never give examples, and when they do its “homescreen.” moving home screen icons around is a pretty useless feature tbh android isnt more high end tech than iphone and i dont see how much more it does. you havent even explained how it can in your comment. so please use common sense before spouting nonsense 02/27/2017 Gage iPhones are by far the better phone. I’ve had android phones for most of my life but i bought an iPhone 6 about a year ago and now I have the 7 and I can’t imagine going back. Android is slow, every button you push there’s a lag before it actually opens the app or whatever you pushed. Also, every android I’ve ever had has had terrible battery life, it never lasts the full day but my iPhone almost always does. And my last point, android automatically installs like 10-20 on your phone that you cannot delete no matter how hard you try. Apple has 3-5. Yes, android has a port for SD cards, but what good is that if a large amount of your memory is made up of apps you don’t want. You’re entitled to your opinion but I advise that you get yourself an iPhone 7 and keep an open mind. I’m fairly certain you realize how much better it is 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Not very nice. Also, Apple is just as good as Android, theres aspects that one company has over the other, and vice versa, so the best thing to do is just to test out both and find your favorite and use it because Android and Apple’s problems and advantages weigh out each other so it really just matters which one you like the most so just use the one u like and stop arguing. 08/19/2016 Zane Reis Reply I prefer Android because of the coustomization it has to offer. I prefer to be able to change change almost every aspect about my phone and making it the way “I” like it, not the way Apple likes it. I like the coustomization while others find it chaotic, confusing, and would rather it be (in their eyes) simpler. 05/26/2016 Billy Reply Says the one who has Zombie Knight as their username. 07/18/2016 Nate Pauley Reply That’s an interesting rather stupid mindset to have and it makes me reflect on the time I had those same views. It took me 6 years as an android user to eventually realise how inferior it is to iOS. Android is plagued with fragmentation, so much that not even customisation can save it. There should be a term that describes blindsided android followers, if there is one then I’d like to know it. iOS is solid, stable, secure and much more better looking than android – Apple pays exquisite attention to the finer details and they will continuously improve on the irritating nooks and crannies so many people mention in the comments. The best part is APPLE USERS CAN ACTUALLY BE A PART of the firmware updates and have assurance in a better OS experience overtime. I’ve had my S6 for a year and I’ve only managed to have one firmware update that took 7 months to deliver. I can only give credit to android for the premium android devices such as my S6, until then the physicality of a device alone cannot make me shift in the near future. I want a solid experience, not a hollow one. 08/02/2016 Adarsh Reply Hi, Your comparison of iphone with S7 is not right because in case of iphone both hardware and software are developed by Apple and in case of S7 developer of hardware is Samsung and developer of software is Google. I use Nexus 5 phone, hardware and software both developed by Google and manufactured by LG and ipad Air2 by Apple. Both devices update periodically whenever updates are released and I am happy with both. 09/15/2016 Me Reply LOL stay laughably buthurt/beyond tasteless loser Fandroid X ) 03/02/2017 xxLoser123xx Reply Wow you know how to use a Thesaurus. 03/06/2017 Sally Fallis Reply Wow! I AM impressed! You know about the Thesaurus!! I didn’t think anyone under 50 ever heard of it anymore! 12/17/2015 Noah Reply This comment, as well as this article are laughable at best. Coming from a person who owns all major Apple products but frequently bounces back and forth in the smartphone department, I don’t see how any of these actually make the iPhone “better” than android. I would say the only point that is valid is the support Apple has from app developers. It’s pretty easy to see that apps on the iPhone can be “prettier” than apps on android with the extra animations, and quick gestures. However even that is relative, since iOS gives you security and “pretty animations” but gives of freedom and functionality in the process. I still can’t tell you which phone is better, as that all is personal preference and I really don’t care which phone is “better”. I just want a phone that does what I want it to do without too many hiccups (which is why I’ll never buy another Samsung device). For now, I’d say in terms of productivity, the iPhone is great if you are a person who needs iMessage, FaceTime, and the Apple ecosystem to feel comfortable doing work. While I believe most android phones will get work DONE. With the amount of third party apps available to you on the play store, multi window, Google now on tap, and other gestures. I have always felt an android is phone is more a workhorse while the iPhone is king of simplicity. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Congrats, you just wasted about 5-15 minutes of your time typing out this article because its not going to convince anyone.

This article and many commenters made me want to vomit thinking he was so biased and the sheep just followed along. I can give numerous reasons Android is a better OS, but that is not the point. However, some Android devices suck. Most of the detractors comments are true of stock Samsung devices. Samsung may be the most popular, but far from the best. They make pretty good hardware, but the software begs for rooting and custom ROMS. I am typing from a Nexus 6P, which is pure Android. Google does good with monthly updates, too. But I am using Pure Nexus, the best reason for owning a Nexus/Pixel device, with ElementalX kernel for out of this world stability, smoothness, flexibility, and battery life. Unless I use hotspot(tunneled over VPN), I only have to charge every 2 days under pretty heavy use. PN is actually updated more than Google’s stock and usually delivers security updates within a day of release, which is faster than Google often rolls it out to most users. 01/06/2016 Leo Keys Reply Why would someone else go with a product by Google, NVidia (I will come back to them), or Microsoft; over that “A…” Company (Repeat)? The reason people would use nVidia over the AMD (god I hate AMD’s Products) GPU’s found in Mac products? They want a more powerful GPU. Apple says that their “PC’s” are better and use top-notch products. Why don’t they use the GeForce GTX 980m in the MacBook Pro? Why don’t they use Quadro cards over FirePro cards? Because Apple doesn’t know anything about Graphics. As for iMac’s I have no clue why some use an i5. Apple products thermal throttle a lot. Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs. It is also much more free to do what ever you want. But, because your an iSheep, you can’t process facts that favor the other side of the grass. Guess your life must be happy, getting råpēd by Apple, every year and paying thousands on eye candy. Why use Google or Bing over Yahoo? Yahoo sucks, that’s why. Face the fact that Yahoo and other search engines are inferior to Google. Apple products are trash and are eye candy for white girls (Starbucks and that stuff). 01/06/2016 Pedro Coimbra Reply Now you have to bring the Nvidia/ATI war? What, the iphone/android isn’t enough for you? Dude AMD cards are equally powerful, no matter how much you “hate them”. Why Apple chose AMD? Maybe prices, power consumption, price/performance ratio, easier to adapt to their hardware, who knows? But a company such as Apple (you can write the complete name, it won’t bite you) so adept at optimization doesn’t make these decisions lightly, they HAVE a reason, one that you *don’t know*, but that’s irrelevant. About the i5, a reason for the apparent lower specs must be because of how streamlined and optimized the OS is, instead of being made to work with zillions of combinations of brands, boards, peripherals. So what you want in hardware to cope with the software, was made achieved with the fat-free software. «Android is secure with the right Antivirus programs», well I guess any system is secure with the right Antivirus programs, isn’t it? but never 100%. How about a system that doesn’t need antivirus, just a little inteligence from it’s user? Android safe… yes, keep dreaming, it’s not as the net isn’t filled with cases of security holes and breaches of android. If you reply to my I advise you right now to not bringing ATI/Nvidia stupid nerdish arguments or sheep mentality, about mobile platforms and geekinesses like that, because I simply don’t have the patience.

Thank you, my hero :) 12/15/2016 Debapriyo Reply You are so dangerously biased towards Apple that some of your words make so sense and are outright stupid. I have no problems with you choosing an apple product but lol. You don’t use Google search engine? Then you are missing out. Their search engine is still the best and most reliable and miles ahead of other search engine options. Google Maps way better than Apple Maps. Every tiny feature Apple introduces in the new version of IOS, Google had it in android 2 years back. I myself love some Apple products and appreciate the high standards of quality they incorporate in their products but please don’t even compare Apple with Google. Apple just makes iphones, macbook and some fancy toys. Google makes much much more and is the spearhead of IT innovation today. Be a fanboy but don’t be an idiot. 03/22/2017 ComputerGeek Reply you’re weird 06/23/2015 Chris H Reply Some of these reasons for being better than Android phones are oxymoronic. An extended warranty and readily available Apple Stores suggest that the iPhone is prone to bugs and damage. I will stick with my G3 because I know if I drop it it won’t shatter and I won’t have to give more money to Apple either for a case and/or a screen fix. There is a reason there aren’t Android stores out there. Because their phones don’t nearly have as many issues in my opinion. Consider Chevrolet and Honda. The Honda will last and is just as nice if not nicer than the Chevy, which will not last nearly as long and will force loyal customers to buy yet another Chevy. 07/27/2016 eiendiaies your_ufo Reply I would love to hear your comment now about your G3. Android stores are not because android companies dont give a f.ck about costumers, they just improve SPECS SPECS AND SPECS but where is NO improving quality. Why for example iphone 12 megapixel camera can beat sony xperia 23 megapixel camera, why iphone 1500 mah battery last longer than lg 3000mah, why fingerprint on iphone works much better than samsungs? And whats a practical difference between 640p vs 2k smartphone screen? Damn the real sheeps dont understand what apple cares about costumers and they stay at same screen resolutions because they just dont need to improve screens, android companies just keep adding numbers on specs. But where is quality improvment? You say iphone works better because of lower resolution screens, but than why androids keep improving resolutions but forget about older android users? I am ex samsung and LG user, rubbish costumer services, if android die than i must wait couple weeks for replacment, if somethin happen with iphone i know where is apple store and dealing with them in same day. Price stays high for iphone for a real reason. Iphone is not about SPECS, its about quality in every aspect. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply The issue with iPhones that I hated was that the only way you could fix any glitch that would inevitably crop up is by factory resetting the phone each and every time. It’s such an annoying and time consuming process having to set everything back up again. When I made the switch to Android I was really impressed by how stable and self contained it was. Whenever there was a glitch it was limited to that particular app and you could simply reinstall it and it’d be fixed. I’ve never encountered any systemwide issues such as the iPhone misc storage bug that would happen to me all the time with the 6s. Apple does a great job hiding all of its glitches by simply not providing any prompts. Apps just disappear when they crash. It’s terrible. I know a lot of people with the misc storage bug to this day and don’t know it. They just think they’re out of space all the time because they need a new phone.. 09/30/2016 Linked Devices Reply I lol’d at how much superior the author thought the lightning cable was because it was reversible.

Some of these were acceptable reasons, but most were not. My wife is using an iPhone 6, and I have the Galaxy S6 edge. We both agree that my phone is far superior in terms of speed and screen resolution, but her camera, even being spec-deficient to my Android, seems as good as, or even better somehow. I like your point on the updates all rolling out at once, but almost every other “point” you made about iPhone being better boils down to one thing: lots of your friends have iPhones. That’s it. That’s the selling point, and the basis of this article. “iPhone apps look better.” – That’s completely relative. Lots of apps do look better, but they generally are paid apps that are free in the Play Store. “Works for all your devices” – So what? I thought this was a phone article. Android works with all your crap too. “No Carrier bundled apps” – I dont know how that’s a selling point, but okay, you win. Bloatware is an issue on android. “Sharing to other iPhones”/”Better resell” – Your friends all have them, so you should too. Then you can sell them to other friends who have older ones and make more money. Ridiculous. Yeah, you get a few more bucks for them, so that means you should have an inferior phone? Who buys a phone because of resale value? Preposterous. “Lightning cable is miles better” – My S6 charges from nothing to 40% in 10 minutes. iPhone can’t do that. I understand that the cable may be good, but “miles better” is a stretch. “Apple Stores” – So? I don’t even understand how this is a point in your article. Go to best buy, it’s the same crap. “Touch ID”/”Headphone controls” – Those both work flawlessly on a good number of high end android devices as well. “iMessage, Facetime, blah blah” / “Share apps easily” – All your friends have these, so you should too, or they’ll laugh at you. “Siri works better than Google Now” – Google Now isn’t Siri. That shouldn’t be a comparison. It’s not trying to be Siri. It’s a voice search, and that’s it. Siri works, but it doesnt work “better” than anything else, because there’s nothing to compare it to. If you like having Siri, good. “Notifications are better” – No, they’re not. Android’s notifications work exactly the same. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying iPhone isn’t better, I’m just saying you haven’t proven that it is here in the slightest. Both OS’s are very well made, and the playing field is far more level than any avid IOS or Android user wants to admit. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply Excellent comment.

Bloatware is not really a problem on Android; any respectable company will only install commonly used and necessary apps like the Play Store and Gmail. If you are buying a phone that will leave your wallet intact (and still deliver better specs in every single measurable way than an iPhone 6, such as the lenovo k3 note) from a less known company which may allow bloatware, you can easily root the phone and uninstall it. I do agree with your other points, though! 05/27/2016 ZENCKPRI Reply Phinfankid you are completely right. I agree with everything you said. You are probably the only logical person who has commented so far. Also the iPhones storage is just a scam to keep people paying and buying more storage. Unfortunately the Samsung Galaxy s6 also removed the microsd slot, but luckily Samsung got it sh*t together with the Samsung s7, which in my opinion is the best phone. 07/12/2016 10beasts Reply You really explained the situation very well! Loved it. 07/09/2015 D Reply This article compares Apples to apples. Your references to Android are focused towards Samsung (you know the company that makes the screen, processor, RAM, and ROM in most Apple devices). Compared to a more vanilla Android experience, Apple blows. My $200 Zenfone 2 is better than any fruity phone at a third of the cost. With Apple, you pay more for less, but get a pointless logo. 07/10/2015 Scott Reply What about Apples different charger cords? Droids micro USB cords work with any other Android device. In fact, pretty much all phones but apple use it. They want you to need to buy new chargers more often. Apples are streamlined fads also, just like every product they’ve ever released. Yeah, cause being “cool” means getting the same more expensive products all the other rich kids got. 07/30/2015 Helene Reply I had both and I don’t agree with this article.

In fact, iPhone is better than android….Because the mobile era is another thing, it’s called mobile for a reason. It should be easy to use and quick. That’s why Apple wins at this point…Come on get real men you wanna play GTA V on your mobile? No for sure. Apps are even better (which surprises me why it isn’t the same for a Mac vs Windows) iPhone’s are faster than most android phones….But if you compare it to stock original android phones, the iPhone still beats them but not as much as other android phones. Because unfourtantely Google didn’t know how to configure Linux properly but i bet you if it does…The iOS faster than android is a history….Linux is ultra-powerful and that’s why most of the world super computers use it…Because you can tweak it the way you like and you will get an extremely faster performance than Windows and Mac. But Google couldn’t handle it I guess….Even the Java language is much faster in terms of processing but I’m still surpsised why iOS apps are still faster….It’s just another replica of Nokia’s fault with Symbian (Nokia never built a stable Eco system for it until it’s near to death period, which led the CEO to get rid of Symbian because it takes years to built an eco system) 05/19/2016 PABLO Reply Right off the bat i can tell you are a little kid who just bought a samsung and is butt hurt you made the wrong choice, “struggles to do one stuff” he also pays great attention in class shown by how grammatically correct this is (as i was writing this I found this… “The iOS faster than android is a history” WHO TEACHES THIS KID I NEED TO COMPLAIN)! 08/04/2015 Robin Reply Poorly written article bringing in irrelevant points and downright false information. Take your “works great with all your devices” section for an example. I use an android phone and an apple computer, and the two devices are 100% compatible with no need for a “third-party application” or service. Completely untrue information in this section. Also I have texts and all the regular online messaging apps I use from both devices well synced. All data, photos, contacts, music, etc from my phone are stored in a cloud service and attainable through my mac computer and my (android) phone.

Here are 10 reasons you have apples for brains: Android is free, Google drive storage is FREE. 15 gig of files, unlimited photos! Androids voice recognition is WAY better, try a comparison, Siri is like a nagging wife who can’t get it right. Android phones have wireless charging! Android phones built in payment that works everywhere. Not at 3% of stores like Apple payment. Android phone MULTITASK, thats right you can run a dozen apps at the same time while talking. Android phones have sizable widgets, so you have live streaming info on your home screen. Android phones are available in endless formats, not like the communist way “everyone has the same”. Android phones PLAY ALL FILES, iphones only play Mp3’s from itunes etc etc pain in the Apple. Android phones have rapid charging, 10 min = 4 hours of use. Android phones are available with 2 days of battery. I could go on and on but your Apple brain will not listen anyways. You probably have a really nice typewriter that you show off the lack of it needing toner or electricity. There is a reason Android is about 82% of the market and Apple has fallen from 33 to about 12%… In fact the remaining iphone users I know all run Google everything on their iphone anyways, why not get the best hardware too.

And childish comparison . 09/16/2015 Srikanth Reply I can say something here because I own and use both iPhone 6 Plus and a Samusng Galaxy S6 edge equally everyday. So I think I am in a position to give a fair judgement …or at least decide what works better for me. I have changed over from iPhone as my default device to S6 edge and back to iPhone few times. But I find myself using iPhone 6 Plus more often than S6 Edge…because of these reasons 1. Smartphone is smart because of quality apps. I always found iOS apps looking neater, working smoother and more consistent compared to Android Apps. Just to quote an example…Adobe acrobat reader which i made default app to open PDF files….is not able to open files since last two days all of a sudden and reporting error. Everything is updated but still doesn’t work somehow. But works fine with iOS. 2. Screen of iPhone is marginally inferior to my S6 edge which is stunning. But I don’t hold them near my nose and try noticing pixels. From a practical point of view iPhone screen is absolutely fine. 3. In spite of inferior hardware specs on paper, I can’t deny iPhone user interface is more fluid and smooth. Thats what makes the experience more pleasant for me. 4. iPhone 6s is already launched…I am not upgrading. But know what? Last night iOS9 update was available to my phone. I have already updated to same. Isn’t that amazing? I can’t help comparing my Galaxy note 4, my near stock android Motorola droid turbo.. etc..which haven’t received even 5.1.1 Lollipop when Android Marshmallow is about to be launched in a month. Sad. This alone is enough for me to stick to iPhone as my default device. 5. I havent noticed parallels for some Apps in Android (Drafts, Soulver etc). Which I learnt to use often and liked. I am a fan of some automation apps like Tasker on android which doesnt have an iOS equivalent. But as of now my use of same is less. 6. I guess iOS is bit more secure compared to android against virus attacks and hacking. it IS something important to me in this era of mobile banking and when we keep so much data on Google drive and One Note etc. and hey…Google has made most of its apps available to iOS. I agree my S6 edge is superior in Camera department and pictures look very good. Also usage of widgets is better in android. But after using both OS since last 3-4 years, I am sticking with iPhone as my default and S6 edge for miscellany and photos. This is what works for me. I know others have other reasons to stick to any one OS. I have best of both worlds now but can’t help saying one is better than other at present. 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Updates are an invalid point, because the newest version of iOS isn’t as good as a 2 three year old version of Android 12/02/2015 Srikantha Krishna Reply I don’t agree with you there. Updates are important. They optimise the software, remove bugs and important to plug security issues. Of course Google releases them but only nexus customers get it. Other manufacturers don’t release it in time. Tell me now how many handsets are going to get Marshmallow and when???? 04/25/2016 Sally Fallis Reply So which is less complicated for the over-50 me who is good with words but not pictures? I had to ask a young person what all those little dots and waves, etc., meant on my Ipod Touch. I really miss words, but I realize I am alone in that. Is a Samsung any easier to navigate for (duhhh…) me? 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply If you are over 50 you should definitely stick with Apple 1. it is extremely easy to use 2. you can do many tasks without even doing anything, but simply telling your phone to wake you up at 5am, or to remind you to take your pills when you get home 3. you can change the text size and icon size to accommodate your eye-sight 4. you can ask any teenager to help you organize the icons into more intuitive way Microsoft Windows phones are rich on words, but while it would satisfy your need for everything being written – the phone will be difficult to use, and will still contain many icons. So, go with Apple, even an older 16GB model, will still be fully supported, and will work perfectly well, do not get 64GB version, you wont need all that memory. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply but apple is expensive 08/25/2016 ermm Reply with android it is much easier to use… you can tell your phone to set and alarm….you can change the text size 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Android is an absurd ecosystem, the UI is very hard to even remember, iOS is better due to the simplicity of the UI. OP was right about iPhones being easy, I use one because android is hard to use. Maybe you should get an iPhone, it’s 5x faster than every android phone in the world and you’ll get a good one on eBay for like $200! Why do you think Google is better on iOS than on android. lel, Android is a joke OS and should be defunct! 10/15/2015 Andras Reply I´ve been an iPhone user for 2 years, recently I bought an Android phone to verify if really Android is superior… After 2 months of testing it, I sell the Android and bought an iPhone 6… This do not prove that iPhone is better, but for my needs, iPhone is totally superior… Android is good, everything is cheap but is not an stable OS… Yes you can have all personalize, but for what? I´m not a teenager anymore so whats the point to have all personalized and change it every week? By the way the output of the sound of the iPhone is really more superior than the output of any Android phone With an iPhone (in music business) is way better you can control lights, console really simple with iPhone and all tech for music is much more easy to sync and to handled on an iPhone… Music business in a MAC is much much easier I love iPhone and I would not change it anymore Like I said I´m not saying iPhone is better for everyone but for my needs yes it is 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply Wow! You’re actually dumber than every other I sheep here. IPhone has good sound? Better than any Android? Hahahahahahaha! Have you even seen an HTC One phone? Best speakers and any phone! Ever. IPhone speaker is tinny garbage. The S6 even has the same placement, but sounds much better. Seriously, Google HTC One m8 or m9. Cm8 literally got the top phone of 2014, and everyone mention how good the speakers work. I also got first place cuz it was vastly superior to any iPhone. Better software, better design, better screen, etc 12/02/2015 Zombieknight Productions Reply And please specify what Android phone it was. Otherwise I’ll assume you’re lying because there are so many and you can’t name one. Or you got a cheaper old one. Android high end phones are very stable. Look it up. They’re way more stable than iOS 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Signed, someone who has never used Viper4Android. Seriously, I can’t stomach the sound output of very many phones without it. Only a few Androids that have nice customized audio processing(like the LG V20) and no iPhones or Windows phones. Many of the rest of Androids can use this superior sound mod. I have a Nexus 6P with Pure Nexus and ElementalX kernel, which has nice front firing speakers, better than iPhones. V4A gives audio processing to match. Not available on iPhones or Windows Phones. 10/17/2015 Tushar Reply Why r u only talking about iphone 6plus,which is much costlier than androide same feature phones, there are some other iphones had launched by apple like iPhone5, 5s,5c i compare this phones whith 20000 rs android phones where battery of iphones so worst and camera and no memory slot, nevertheless this iphones have more cost than android phones. 10/19/2015 Lu Reply LOL you will not get confused using a LIGHTNING cable? are you kidding me????????? Does this mean that it is designed for dumb people who constantly flip the usb port? is this the main reason! why apple cant for some reason jussssssssssssssssst go with the flowwwwwwwwwwwwwww and use a normal USB port that makes it easier for all humans in the world to share chargers? Dude, i use both systems and i can point out one thing better that most people usually ignore, my Father is blind, he uses an iPhone because tbh the Voice-over mode for iPhone is the best ive seen and used so far.

Do you know how much tracking, data mining even occurs with an iphone? Fingerprint bypass? Are u srs? The iphone is for the general public who doesnt know any better just following ignorantly what is popular culture. Android = Professional industry Iphone= uneducated general public facade 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply yeah, tell that to all my banker friends who make millions and choose Apple to be the secure choice for the data exchange and storage, go “personalize” your phone, show them all how individual you are, myspace was definitely better than stupid facebook where you cannot “personalize,” so ignorant right? 11/14/2015 GET REAL Reply A PHONE IS A PHONE 12/09/2015 I phones all the way Reply Umm androids suck, I phones are more high tech and aren’t as slow 12/15/2015 jj Reply Android…LOL, joke. 12/26/2015 juststephen250 Reply Are you Sirious?

All the successful people I know use an iPhone. The only credible alternative in business to an iPhone would be a BlackBerry running BB10. Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants. Thankfully I don’t know anyone with an Android phone. I don’t want to either! Please only contact me if you use an iPhone and have a job / home. I don’t want be associated with anyone that uses an Android. It would make me look bad. Thanks. 03/03/2016 Jack Reply The fact that u say “Android devices are for the unemployed and vagrants”, just ticks me off. You are what I like to call a dumb ass like every kid I know. You only choose an Iphone because every one else has an Iphone, if not you would of picked android and said Iphones suck, you also don’t even know how technology works bitch, so I would not be talking because there are far more android devices with better specs, and fyi i’m a kid obviously i’m not employed. 04/22/2016 Derp Reply Well then maybe you didnt know what a high end android phone is.. Poor you. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply This post is what makes you look bad. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Also, aside from your arrogance making you look bad, you have got to be kidding about BlackBerry. I carried the Z10 now carry the Passport with BB10. I only have it because my company prefers BB’s security. But as far as fuctionality, it’s like working with bear skins and stone knives compared to iPhone or Android. The lack of apps and limited integration with other devices is stifling. That’s why I carry a separate personal phone. It’s also why BB is abandoning BB10 and switching to an Android platform. So are you going to cast off your somewhat acceptable friends who carry BlackBerry when their platform becomes Android? They better run out and get an iPhone when that happens so they can still be honored to be deemed worthy of your friendship. 07/11/2016 Iggy Z Reply 1. Android they switch to is FULLY custom and has all google services BLOCKED 2. This is the reason why companies are abandoning BlackBerry due to high maintenance costs and instead make private applications for iPhones which you can only download using a special code, a secure application within a secure platform, cheaper to maintain, more convenient for an employee to use. I completely agree with Bob, Androids are for 12 year olds and vagrants, the paper specs of Androids (factually and historically) are not an indicator of how they perform. And the fact that you think that you are smarter than a mass of hard working high ranking professionals, and that you need to show them all how “individual” you are by always “personalizing” your phone – just shows you are a fool and have nothing to do but to play with yourself on your phone like a kid, I bet you are one of those people who thinks wearing a watch is stupid and unmanly because you have a clock on your phone. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply ur insulting me cos im twelve so dont try piggy 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply You guys keep proving how Apple markets to ignorant people with a credit card. Reason many companies don’t use Android is because of the differences in OS customization from device to device and manufacturer to manufacturer. That can be a nightmare for testing in house apps. Nothing to do with security. My company uses Android tablets, but all the same kind. Only point you are right about is specs don’t reflect performance. Nexus/Pixel devices have good specs, not the best, but just try finding a faster Android or iPhone, for that matter. Why? Stock Android that hasn’t been bastardized. 01/17/2016 Grace Reply I use an iPhone, but custom built my own PC. I don’t like Android phones (had a Samsung galaxy for a year before switching back) but I also don’t like Apple computers. Honestly? What people buy is a matter of taste.

LOSER! 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply This article is so immature and stupid. Seriously, apps look better? You couldn’t even come up with a better reason?? I can literally break this article point by point. I would just like to say one thing though as a rebuttal, A NEXUS too receives the ota updates. An iPhone 64gb on contract costs almost the same as a carrier free nexus. I am a galaxy s7 user and the screen quality is maybe 2 generations over the iphone. As for the notifications, I prefer android’s iteration way more than apples. And about the cables, except the s7, all flagships use USB type c Samsung compensates with wireless charging. The battery life on a nexus or an s7 edge is way superior than the iPhone. And hangout video quality is as good as facetious. Also I like the fact that you don’t need to get out of hangouts to make a video call. In iphone you can usee iMessage but then to make a video call you need to get out and go to facetime. I get to play with manual controls on my camera which iphone doesn’t permit. I can literally go all day long about this. Just one actual good point about iphone you could have mentioned instead of the trash is that it has a stronger graphic processor that but by a small margin. 03/23/2016 sheel r shah Reply One more thing. You mentioned sharing. Do you feel ashamed that you cannot share media via Bluetooth?? The most basic mode of sharing? Talking about airdrop please use wifi direct once. Or nfc sharing. 03/28/2016 Stanata Reply Basically what this article is saying is: “use iPhone instead of Android – it’s more easy to use if you’re an idiot!”… lol There isn’t even one reason of those in the article that is 100% true… and almost all of them are complete crap! I mean come on – even monkey can plug MicroUSB and it is “a must” standard in Europa for instance anyway. Let alone that the future is in the wireless charging… And who today is NOT using Viber or WhatsApp? Who needs another messenger? I can continue, but don’t see point in that – the articles like this is obviously paid one. But sooner or later it will be clear at the end – the open environment will always be above the close one, because it is more close to the people!

It’s a Huawei, nice BIG screen I guess they call a Phablet. My younger son has an iPhone 6 plus. I decided to try an iPhone 5s just to see what it’s like. I have 30 days to check it out. So far, the ONLY thing see is the slow motion camera that’s cool and maybe some cuter emogies …I think they’re called. Otherwise….. I’m so far not impressed. My Huawei Android is 16g the iPhone 5s is 16g. The Huawei was I think $200 and the 5s $160 with its VERY tiny screen. My son has a 6 plus and 64g and that would cost me $650 or maybe it’s $650 for the6 plus 16g. Anyway…. Lots MORE MONEY. I guess if you have a lot of music… It’s better but I just have Lots of pictures. I like my sd card for these. I don’t know all the techy stuff and I don’t do Twitter or FaceTime or sharing pics except Facebook and text. I thought maybe some apps would be cooler but so far… I’m not impressed with the iPhone at all.

The iOS Is custom built for and iPhone but the android softwares are not built for any particular device or hardware so optimisation is nog as good as in an Apple device. It not about specs the camera which shas more megapixels cannot alone deliver better pictures , a processor with more cores and greater clock speed can not alone give better performence until it utilises the most of it. So as Apple builds it products to its own requirements and deliver better products than android phones. An iPhone has better quality of internals as well as the body and feels premium than its competitors so that’s why an iPhone is an iPhone. 04/26/2016 De'Zsa Smith Reply Currently on my iPhone 6s+, sobbing as I type this. I’ve just got through longingly browsing Google’s Playstore, seeing all the recent updates of my favorite apps and hidden gems that the Apple Store just cannot compete with. Android has some seriously dedicated developers, and I’ve always admired them and even began looking into Android app development. That is… Until I switched over to iPhone several months ago after being a dedicated Android user. I will always be Team Android, hands down. I had a rooted Nexus 5, which means I’m all about customizability, design, testing, flexibility, and freedom. Then I decided I wanted to try something new—FaceTime, great camera, updated social apps like snapchat…you know, the basics. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. Switching over to Apple feels like I’m using a flip phone. Now I’m trying to decide if I should just switch back, or keep this iPhone as a means of communication (don’t know if I’m willing to give up FaceTime with family and friends) and have an Android for all the things I miss. 04/27/2016 weez Reply I just giggle at these articles. Ok Iphone kids, my phone has a webhost, tftp server, a windows deploy share with every iteration of windows going back to w2000, an SMB client, FTP client and host, Tftp server, wi-fi signal scanner, packet sniffer(nmap), a high frequency oscilloscope, a bluetooth HID remote that controls anything bluetooth, a linux/android debugger, point of sale and inventory tracking software(apple has it too but not complete on the phone), and at will I can change my MAC and spoof other phone’s IDs. My phone is a half decade old S2. So I guess if you plan on propping up a desk buy an Iphone, for everyone else that has work to do either grab a toolkit full of different things or just grab your android phone. 04/28/2016 Ken McDowell (@morpheusxp) Reply I don’t understand why it is all Android users say that iPhone users are sheep and that they use an iPhone because everyone else uses an iPhone. The iPhone has less than 20% market share world wide. That means less than 1 in 5 smartphone users have an iPhone. It seems to me going with the herd is more of an Android thing than an iOS thing. Just saying… 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply I think it is more because a lot of iPhone users seem cultic. I honestly think iPhone is a high quality product. But I really like high end Androids as well. However, I know people who use only Apple products and make little comments here and there about how inferior ALL Androids are. In that way I think they are like sheep because they have bought into this notion that their are no good Androids and they are operating on a higher plan than non-iPhone users. 05/23/2016 Anthony Reply Agreed. Probably because in the beginning people lined up outside of stores to get the latest and greatest iphone. It’s great hardware, but I can’t get used to a single button. Plus iphones seem to have a higher resale value. I don’t know. I do like how apple updates their devices in a timely manner and no bloatware, etc. I think Android is getting there, but unless it’s a nexus, updates are all over the place. I want the screen of a Samsung, build of an HTC with the battery life of my droid turbo, a headphone jack at the bottom of the phone instead of the top and I would be in heaven. Plus everyone I know say is that a Galaxy? So people in my area associate anything android as a Galaxy. Great marketing by Sammy, but perception becomes reality sometimes. 05/21/2016 Cowbladder Reply Meant to say plane, not plan. ☺ 01/30/2017 Selenia Reply Yup, it is about the Apple cult and the attitude that you are unwashed and not worthy if you use an Android. The attitude you must be broke, homeless, etc. My Android costs as much as a lower range current iPhone and can do way more. Here in the US, they have much greater market share, unfortunately. 04/28/2016 Joe Reply iphone has nothing on android. They have a good camera but that is about it. isheep all butthurt because android is taking over the world. 04/30/2016 qwertypop13 Reply So far all my favourite android apps were not available on ios, plus a lot of apps are a minimum of 10 cent cheaper on gpl than on apple app store. I also find it totally ridiculous that iphones need to be jailbroken to undergo any form of customization. Plus who wants fast updates at the expense of severe bugs, them slowing down stuff even more and getting a crappy operating system that hasnt changed since 5 years. Iphones are for people that only use their phones to txt and make calls. ps. I have a $20 alcatel phone and wouldnt ever trade it for an iphone. Buy what you like, but the points on this website are the worst I have ever seen. As far as I know you cant even use iphones to transfer files other than audio and photos to and from macs/pc’s. Apple phones are overpriced by like $500 dollars just because they have a flashy logo which they stole from the beatles. 05/05/2016 anthony Reply I love my android devices. Have I had problems. Yes. More than my wife’s iphone? Definitely. But I tinker with it a lot more than her iphone. I transfer files back and forth from a computer a lot easier with my device. Yes using third party apps but it’s still easier. I have all my music in google play, but use itunes (whole family uses ipods) so I just sync up that to google music and playlists as well. Each device has it’s pros and cons. I have used a rooted tablet to get pure android (didn’t like it) and have an ipad 2 which I love. It’s about choice and I like that we have it. Two points I agree with the author about: Timely updates and bloatware. HTC is bucking the trend to stay afloat by addressing this. Wireless charging is not worth it yet. I much prefer quick charging and new devices starting to roll out with usb-c. 05/07/2016 C Reply The article and ensuing comments are a joke. This is what The internet has come to now days. Let me be clear, I have years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux. I have every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you. Now that we have established my far superior ability to actually comment here goes. First of all, the people on this blog and on others like it simply cannot help the fact that more people love iphone than android, period. So they make nasty little comments because they are frustrated that in reality they couldnt influence people in high school and they aren’t able to now. Second the android users who get angry at Apple users simply appear to only be mad because they don’t have an iphone them selves. Guys! Really! Let me be clear I have Windows and android and iOS. Iphone for the nomal every day user is PERFECT! Let them be! The android is perfect for more shady people who want to be power users an anarchists or some how feel like they are breaking the law or the rules. That is how android feels and that’s the base line of the os. I currently have an android because I can be one of those more shady people who like to go against the grain. But I don’t like android. Who the he’ll wants to root a phone? Who wants to spend hours on doing something? Not I! It takes me 10 minutes to jail break an Apple as and BAM I’m a super users with a linux based system and am sitting with a very powerful device! They all being said I have an android bc of expandable memory, an IR blaster, and a few other small features. When Apple steps up the game with these I will switch to Apple. Here is one reason why. What is a smart device? It is an item created to make your life as a human eaiser. Apple does that by leaps and bounds! The phone thinks of you like a loyal old dog and wants to do nothing more than serve your every whim. I can tell you the iphone holds up better, know why? Ever had to fix your mom or dads PC? And you think to your self wth are they doing with this thing. We never hear that issue out of iphone. So really is a beast just for that reason alone simply bc the general population can break them by doing stupid stuff. Now on to adress some other stupid comments for people who pretend they are SO smart. Windows is better than a Mac ios! Hum WRONG! Know why? Windows is a dos based crap system with a gui created for the average consumer to use a device. It’s not a damn computer it’s a pretty device to help you numb skulls use paint and word or get on the internet. What is my point now!! Oh yet MAC IOS is FAR superior at least for anyone who actually knows how to use Linux which by the way was and still is the base os on which all other smart software was and still is created. So you pretty little Windows fanboy users, please get a grip because until you stop drooling over your poster size photo of Bill gates and actually learn Linux you know nothing about computing. The really dumb person who commented about Honda’s vs Chevys! Hahaha seriously though? You also probably know nothing right? Honda and GM use the exact same part manufactures which in turn makes both cars CRAP! Research before you comment. Go get what ever phone you want and fanboys of each need to get a grip! 05/29/2016 C Reply Just to clarify a few things for the “people who pretend they re SO smart” Windows has been detached from DOS since windows 2000, It maintains compatibility by running an DOS virtual machine on the NT Kernel. Not all systems are based on Linux, Linux is based on Unix, Mac OS (and IOS) is largely based on BSD which is a variant of UNIX, The Windows Micro-kernel is also partly based on UNIX. For someone who has “years and years of experience with Android, IOS, Windows & Linux.” and “every certification and more hours logged on to these then most of you” you are spreading a lot of misinformation. I personally own all apple products, but have and still use the other platforms, They all have their advantages and downfalls. And although I use a Mac, Ipad and Iphone predominantly I still have moments of frustration when I miss windows, android and linux for one reason or another. 05/29/2016 CC Reply Not the same “C” as above btw 05/18/2016 Nikhil Bansal Reply Great Information.

But when it comes to the games the android will never be smooth as Apple or faster the performance in apple will always be better. But android will only have a bit better graphics because of its amoled technology 06/02/2016 Jacob Reply If you wanted to make this a fair comparison you’d compare it against Vanilla Android so it’d be the Nexus 6p and immediately your points about bloatware and cable become invalid. Also, how can you say apple doesn’t come with bloatware? Have you tried removing the stocks app recently? What about file sharing, have you never heard of Android Beam? Or the fact almost every flagship has a fingerprint scanner now? This is the most poorly written, one sided piece of crap I’ve seen in a long time. How do you even have a job? P.s. I own a Nexus 6p for private use and iPhone 6s Plus for work and they’re pretty much equal in every way except for the Nexus having a better screen, free apps, faster charging and longer battery life. 07/16/2016 quenchybro Reply +1 lol 06/03/2016 alpharidley9098 Reply This article made me laugh pretty hard. I just love the reasons they give for the phone being better. Now 1 thing that is always MORE important than ALL of these is the actual phone. Also, those apps that come with the phone, it depends on what you are getting… Also, you do know apple is making a switch to MicroUSB right? Humph. Seems like just in this 1 paragraph I have already made better points than this article. Anyways, phone-wise, androids are almost always more powerful than an apple phone because of the fact that iPhones are never equip with a good core or a good amount of RAM. They slow down quite quickly and seem obsolete after a few months. Yes. Months. I have had my Moto G3 for awhile and it is still ultra fast and has no technical issues. 06/03/2016 Jens Lipponer Reply problem with iphones is that u need itunes etc.. and too many permissions. I like to just plug in and drag and drop files…. I don’t give a monkey’s behind whether apps look better or what not. let’s be honest, price wise the iphone is beaten every time. there is just no bang for buck.

It seems obvious to me. At least Android screens don’t break when you drop the phone on carpet like iPhone’s do. There’s Applecare because the iPhones break like a window hit by a baseball because the whole phone is either thin aluminum or covered in glass (which is a hazard if the glass shards cut you and potentially make you bleed out). The aluminum iPhone’s are currently being made of bend in your pocket! They’ll need some high quality flexible glass and easily bent straight CPU (without anything on the inside being destroyed). By the way, for the vibration thing on Android you don’t have to input password or anything just click the power button and hold down the turn down volume button for a second or two and that’s it. 06/10/2016 Shaggy C Reply So your reasoning is half “It’s popular” and most the other half is comparing apple features to the bad features of a multitude of android phones?

It could be called Android or robot or Apple or peaches or dog poo. All I care about is having a good phone that can do the most. Phones are expensive. I’m not buying a brand name. I’m looking to buy something that has everything it could possibly have if I’m going to spend that kind of money. You’re “reasons” show good things about IPhone, but are not “reasons” as to why it’s better. IPhones are good phones. People like IPhones because it’s a trend. It’s popular. That’s it. IPhones are not even close to androids. Be truthful. Androids are mini-computers. Literally. IPhone is not. You can do 100 more things with Android that you cannot do with IPhone. The That is the truth. And Apple products are a lot more expensive. Why would anyone pay more for a phone that gives you less? It boggles my mind. Android has variety. There are many, many phones, companies, styles to choose from. They even offer cheaper options that get the job done. They have an SD card slot. Why would anyone dish out $100’s more for more storage? That SD card is yours forever. For future phones or other devices. You can plug your phone into your computer and save(on the phone or SD card) anything (music, photo’s, video’s, contacts) and it’s yours. Without having to go through ITunes or anything else. Apple doesn’t own my stuff. I own it. And I can customize anything I own. There are IPhone stores for these little nick knacks. Transferring files, contacts, etc. It’s like going to a car dealership. One side has a variety of great cars. The other side has one car that is the most expensive. You see that all the other cars have a ton of features, options, colors to choose from, engines, horse power, cylinders, 2-door, 4-door, SUV’s etc. You ask “what’s so great about this lonely more expensive car tht only comes in one model and doesn’t have these other options?” The saleman replies with “Because it’s popular”. 07/06/2016 Gretchen Alexander Reply Yes, this!

I have two iPhones now, a 5 and a 6, that I can’t get my photos off of onto my PC laptop. I’ve gone into the Crapple store more than three times and still haven’t gotten them off. My idea of HELL is the Crapple store! I hate that place. There’s hardly room to stand and then you end up being sat at a table waiting with a bunch of other frustrated people waiting for a tech to help you. Of course this is after you make an appointment, or in my case last time, two appointments. I don’t see that as a plus at all because not only is going there a royal pain in the ass, but then they don’t even offer much help after several hours. My iPhone does not recognize as a drive when I plug it into my PC. It used to, and then stopped. I don’t want to have to use iTunes to transfer photos or music. I want to just plug it in and have it be a drive and copy whatever files I like back and forth. It does not work; and I’ve spent, literally, hours trying to get it to function that way. I also have a pretty complex DSLR camera and yet it is still easy as can be to transfer the photos from the memory card onto the computer. So why can’t a supposedly user-friendly phone just do the same thing? I seriously hate my iPhone 6 so much I wanted to shoot it, except I discovered it’s worth a good bit of money still so I’ll sell it on ebay. 07/09/2016 Joey Reply A lot of childish responses from android fans here. I gave the nexus 6p and try for 2 months after my old iPhone broke. Hardware was great, but I found on this android phone the app integration and interoperability to be no where near as good as an iPhone. Apple is just better when it comes to form and function. Buy an android if you want to tweak it forever and play in a sandbox, buy and iPhone if you need a productive phone. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply Your comment may not be childish but it is not correct. Comparable Android phones have far better form and function. Take the iPhone 6s plus verses a Note 5 or s7 Edge. The Apple is bigger and heavier yet packs has a smaller or same sized screen as the Samsung’s’ yet has far less features. Both these phones are far more productive, can multi-task properly, be fully customized and allow widgets on lock and home screens for speed, convenience and ease of use. The Note even includes a stylus or pencil. Great compact design, fully featured and greater functionality (Android) vs Heavy outdated bloated hardware with mid-range specs and limited functionality (IOS). Not to forget the limited compatibility of iPhones and lack of choice! 07/10/2016 Chris Reply There are facts, then there are opinions. 07/10/2016 Colin Reply This article is a disgrace, misleading at best. Most of the reasons are just not true or highly debatable. 07/12/2016 Benito Paul Reply congratulation all of u commented on weather iphone or android’s is the best In my point of view it may be any phone that is android or iphone. If we had a phone that should meet our requirements.Requirements means each and every people has different requirements in case of security,memory capacity and so and so. Hence apple or iphone buy any thing because all are vanity, “vanity of vanities” 07/14/2016 aileen Reply I’m someone who switched from android to ios but this article is utter bullshit. Yes, I love my iPhone and i’m so glad I switched by my samsung galaxy 4 was nothing but shit lately but these arguments in the article are dumb as hell. Lightning is better than micro usb? excuse me, what? my iphone takes ages to charge (iphone 6) whereas my s4 charged within an hour. i don’t see how that makes micro usb bad. but well my iphone battery lasts over a day and my old phone could have never. sharing location isn’t hard on android since almost everyone uses whatsapp bc imessage doesn’t exist on android and whatsapp has a location sharing option so that argument was dumb. yes, apps do look prettier on ios but i don’t see how only that would be a reason to switch?? this article clearly comes from someone who has only owned apple devices and doesn’t even know what they’re talking about, if you really want to prove a point you need to ask someone who has used BOTH of the things you’re trying to compare otverwise you’re just gonna embarass yourself. just saying. 07/20/2016 KappaPride Reply Why are you guys even arguing about this? 07/24/2016 George Reply The major advantage iOS has over Android is that Apple designs the phone and software. Whereas for Android (open source) other manufacturers have to play with it to get it to work and sometimes it’s not fluid. Take the Nexus phones for example…they just work like the iphones. No bloatware..nothing (like the iphone). Majority of my friends have iPhones and sometimes I wish I did too because of MMS (iMessage). I used both and I hate that i have to use itune for everything but it is what it is I guess. 07/24/2016 Landry Reply I’m 8 years experimented developer for iOs devices and I say that Apple releases so frequent updates because iOs is just a stone age OS to fool iOs users that Apple works seriously behind their products. It must run to compete Android OS. 07/27/2016 Aza Reply Best to have both. I have an Se and G4 best of both worlds 07/30/2016 Bob Reply So many things piss me off in this article but specifically stood out Notifications I have no idea with this author is saying he obviously hasn’t seen an android phone, they are exactly the same. Lightning vs. Micro-USB Micro-USB usually charges everything from headphones, to power banks, and of course cell phones. And multiple times to insert it is an absurd comment, after about a week you’ll probably memorize which way it goes, and how do you insert it incorrectly more than once. And USB type-C is just starting to come to the mainstream that’s why it’s not on everything. Storage Why do people even buy the 128 GB version, not to get apps but to download media like pictures, videos, music, etc. I agree with the statement about how sd cards are treated but there’s a much more simple solution, buy a larger storage option. Sharing purchased content Sign into the play store with the account that originally bought the content, install it, then sign out. Problem solved, and if anyone says “it’s more convenient” think about how often you might actually purchase something that costs actual money, I’ll bet it’s probably less than once a week. And it doesn’t take long to sign in and then back out 08/14/2016 Adso Rossi Reply I love iPhones. They always have nice designs and I like the simple interface. I have been itching to get an SE with its smaller dimensions (I like small phones). Money is not a problem to me but as much as I really want one I will stick with my Android device. Why? Cause the compatibility of iPhones to Windows pcs are real bad or none. You’d say “get a Mac” but I can’t: too many programs I need that unfortunately are only Windows-available. If this one single point of compatibility would be addressed, the iPhone becoming as compatible as Androids, I would get that iPhone SE in a heartbeat! 08/21/2016 nathanlittles plays minecraft Reply Who the hell needs iPhone I can name 100 reasons why Android is better but I’ll just name 20 1. Freedom 2. Apk 3. More sizes 4. More colours 5. Waterproof phones 6. Big and small tablets instead of the HUGE iPad 7. Clear cache option 8. For apps and also all the app store apps 9. No need for jailbreak but if you root you’re device will have no restrictions :D 10. Notification swipe 11. Google now 12. Google maps instead of the crappy apple maps 13. Multiple users feature 14. SD card storage So you don’t run out of storage easily like on the 16 gig iPhones (128GB or even 256GB) 15. Pattern unlock 16. There’s everything on Google play store even GPS spoofers to do the Pokémon go spoof in like 2 seconds 17. Unknown sources option 18. No need for an apple I’d all you need is a Google account which is way easier to set up and use 19. Get apps that are not out in your country easier (Pokémon go) 20. Android sounds better then apple 08/22/2016 Jim Reply This article made me so angry I must go punch a kitten. It’s an interesting psychological phenomenon, our emotional ties to brand loyalty. It’s as if the device we choose to use says something about who we are as people, and there is some ancient war of two types of people being waged through our genetics. Apple users are like Yankee fans, Android users are the goth kid outsiders. And the war rages on. 08/30/2016 Deleau Clément Reply Hi. Please kill yourself.

Like, the notifications. Android is wayyy better. You clear all at once or swipe. It combines like notifications that you can separate. It allows to interact with the notification and app without opening it and its just, way simpler and cleaner. 09/10/2016 Nigel Nderi Reply Let me settle this. Choose an iPhone if you are incompetent or are ok with a company controlling you’re phone completely. Choose an Android if you want to be able to enjoy the latest technologies and can competently manage it’s abilities without whining that it takes more than half a brain cell to use. 09/11/2016 Josh Mcduff Reply Just read all the comments and wow it’s all he said she said. I’ve had my Nexus 6p which btw one poster said it’s Google made nope huewei or whatever. Point is not the same, for about a year now and I’m now getting the iPhone 7. Are the specs pretty damn similar? Yes alot of the same features? Yes update often? Yes Nexus gets all the Android ones first like Apple. Price? Actually the 7 is less than the Nexus by about 150.00 CAD sooo that defeats the argument about price… Just saying. I love my Nexus but I’m open to changing. Ice bounced back and forth alot between Android and iOS can I say one is superior to the other? Absolutely not it all comes down to does it do what I want it to and can I afford it. 09/12/2016 Lee Reply All good and well people love free stuff but free stuff comes with a price of selling your info to the uncontrollable thirst party. iPhone also offer easy printing option than android you have to download something that will ask you to upgrade by paying just to use your printer no way! Also iPhone helps stop third party apps that try to use your phone making phone calls example if you are searching for nearest restaurant Google will show the call number to the same restaurant but when you try to call instead of calling direct the parasite apps like whatsaapp, text… And more they pop up asking you to use them making a call while they can’t function without your service they bug you each time taking away the time you spend trying to make a call. If you’re in a hurry and these app try to suggest you use it think how buggy this is. The same applies to text messages. 09/15/2016 Jada Reply Have u really owned an android? There are many many more possibilities and helpful apps that came with my galaxy s7 edge and i love it alot! So many more features and charging is so much faster and the battery life is amazing 09/15/2016 Ryan Reply You are a stupid retard Apple isn’t better than android. Apple has had to recall their product so many times because people died from the battery exploding. And with Apple every 3rd phone they stop making updates for it. Android always has updates for their products. Plus Apple owes the government 37 billion dollars Android doesn’t. The iPhone 7 that is coming out is a total ripoff. They copied Samsung. Apple has never made a crack resistance screen and a waterproof phone. Samsung is simply better. 09/17/2016 Rob Doyle Reply I completely am for people having their own opinion, that being said I disagree with the title of this article. That being said without any bias coming into play here, some of the points that the author was trying to make aren’t true or aren’t completely true. 1. “Works with all your devices”… The real title should be works better with all of your APPLE devices. The examples in the article are all apple examples. The author obviously has no experience with android or windows. 2. “Faster Updates”…. Compared to what android device? You can’t just say that Iphones get updates faster and compare that to all android phones. The way that this section was written made it sounds like the day an update is release for Android, nine of there phones get it immediately like the iPhones… this just isn’t true. If you have a nexus you get updates as they are released (just like and iPhone) There is a bunch of other examples that just show the author has no experience with android devices, I’m just going to keep this short. People will choose what they think is best for them. My issue is with the author, not the opinion. All the argument were completely based on opinion and not facts. People are going to read this and take it all as fact, instead of doing research and finding the right device for them. 09/18/2016 Jonathan Masters Reply I have both an iPhone 5 and a Galaxy S7. While there are some advantages to the iPhone, there are several reasons why I just can’t make a permanent switch. First, no home screen widgets (like my calendar and agenda). Sure, you can add something like that to the notifications screen, but that involve swiping, as opposed to right on the home screen. Second, it’s so difficult — even annoying — trying to organize files on the iPhone. On an Android, it operates exactly like a computer should (and our phones really are computers these days), with folders, subfolders, etc., so you can just copy the files to where you want them for later use. You can’t do that on an iPhone, where all of your files go to some mysterious and deep “collection” on the phone. If Apple were to add those two features, then I’d happily switch away from Android. 09/21/2016 de Coulon Thierry Reply I wanted to try an iPhone, so I got an old one. I could simply not install anything because everything on the AppStore has moved to iOS > 7. I could not bring a single file to the phone. All it would do is sync with iTunes on my Mac, but there is nothing to sync because I don’t use this Mac for everyday life. The iPhone I got did not have any smart way to save battery. The iPhone I got could not play any of my music because a) I could not upload it and b) I could not install anything that would play ogg files. The iPhone I got was heavier, thicker and less good looking than my current Sony. So OK it was an old iPhone, but 90% of what I say would be true for the latest iPhone, and at what price! If you live in the Apple world, then an iPhone is probably the logical choice. I live in the Linux world and now I know I’ll never take another look at an iPhone. 09/24/2016 Jim Washko Reply Worldwide stats – Android users 82% vs IOS users 18% There’s not enough votes to even tilt the scale towards IOS being better. Being as the story indicates Android phones are only good for 2 years that makes them more expensive. How can IOS users explain why 82% of the market would rather pay more for less?, if that were in fact true. Iphone offers less control, poor resoluion, no expandable memory and not all phones can share the same apps. Android offers all of it as well as compatible with Windows whcih is currently at 80% of the market share. This is like comparing the Yugo to Prius. Sure the Yugo is cheaper at first, but after a year of so, not so much. Iphone resale is more, but that will drop due to fewer and fewer users as they get tired of the box of crayons with only black and white as an option. when they can get the box of 64 and a sharpener 09/24/2016 Capi Reply Is this all a big joke? You keep saying “iPhone is better than Android” about ten times in the article, like a mantra we have to learn and assimilate, Am I the only one who noticed this? I have and iPad, and iMac and I used iPhone (4, 4s and 5) I am familiar with both iOS and OSX but actually I have an Android and installed Windows 10 on my iMac. OSX is a good system if you like simple and easy interfaces, I don’t really have any problem with it, is a really good system once you learn to do things that are diferent with Windows, like formating drives with Disk Utility. (And if we forget how difficult could be for some people to use drive formats like NTFS in a Mac) But iOS, thats another story, Apple manufactures iPhone and developes a OS which works perfectly with that device, which, supposedly, makes it safer. There ends all iOS and iPhone REAL advantages. There are a lot of reason to say Android is better than Android, but the main reason is that you can freely add and delete files from it. I connect my Android to my computer, I press “Windows key” + “E” and immediately I see all my drives and my Android device there, and I can drag or delete files from it. But when I connect an iPhone I have sync up files with iTunes. Why the hell people think synchronization is good? For example, I spent one week adding all my music from CDs to my iTunes library, then I synced my iPhone and… voilá, my music was there. Then my computer died, and my music adquired during years with my money was completely lost, just because I didn’t buy it to Apple. But hey, music was still on my iphone, but NO, I need a third party program, which costs money or could be a malware, just to upload my songs again to a new computer. (Of course I have all my CDs, but thats a week lost) Im simply asking you to do like me if you can, just try everything, because if I read this article (iPhone is better, iPhone is better, iPhone is better…) I have the feeling that not everyone, but many people conform with iPhone. Just for popularity, for Apple fanaticism, or just because a website is telling you to buy it with superliminal advertising. 09/26/2016 wgallagher142 Reply I actually find that android apps have become much prettier and definitely more modern than iPhone apps at this point.

If I could have 1/50th of your technical expertise I would be overjoyed. Meanwhile, I’ll just be glad I chose a Samsung. At least I got that right. 10/07/2016 Majid Reply None of these arguments accounts for any good reason to buy an iPhone except argument number 1. Android can do these equally or better. I have been a heavy android user till date until yesterday when I bought iPhone 7 plus. I own an iPad since two years. I am happy with my iPad which I use mainly for games and some handwriting. Yes I was annoyed from android. I owned s3. It had, due to some reason, a built in issue which I only realized after warranty finished. My faulty s3 obliged me to hate Samsung and android. Then I bought note 4. It solved all my problems I faced on s3. But still there were some things I did not feel good about. Now after purchasing iPhone 7plus 128 GB I understand the power of google. The three apps Google search, google maps and google drive are enough reason to close down iPhone factory from the face of earth. 10/10/2016 BM Reply Thinking to upgrade from s5. Thought for iPhone 7. But it can not do even 5 % work compared to android. My andrioid mobile automatically silents itself when I enter meetings or office. Automatic meeting mode when meeting is scheduled (only beeps) I can give my mobile to anyone to see coz I have app specific fingerprint. Only sensitive apps are protected. All other is open. These are not possible with apple except jailbreak. These are just samples. I can write journal what android can do. Speed is not important with a Ibrick which can not do anything smart. I’m not a fan of apple or Samsung. I want my work to be done and my pocket secretary to work according to my requirements. 10/10/2016 Charles Alden Reply 15 reasons why Android is better. Reason number one, you have an actual file system. Anyone who has dealt with iOS horrendous file management paradigm appreciates the ease as at which files are accessible in Android. You simply click on Open, navigate to where your files are stored, select, done. There is also never any reason to use the Share function except when sharing data with the internet. Number 2, multitasking, iOS’s multitasking absolutely sucks, especially when you compare it to Android. Example, I can stream a film to my TV wirelessly, while compiling an application via a remote terminal, while downloading a 40GB file directly to my NAS drive which is mounted as a local folder, while I convert a media file to .mp4, while I play N64, 007 Goldfinger using a replica N64 USB game controller. I’m able to select my own default apps, so when I download a file and click open, the app that I normally use for that extension opens up automatically. I have a global search function, which is one of the worst things about iOS, how do you find files. That was rhetoric, you can’t, it’s basically hunt and peck. I can customize voice commands, this is perhaps one of the coolest things about about Android. I have around 250 custom voice commands, mostly for searching files. Such as, “show me all file [file extension] created on [date]. Even photos, show me all photos from [city] on [particular date/month, years], even for a particular person , “show me all photos for [name] on [particular date/month, year]” External display support, when am connect my phone to a monitor not only is the resolution fully supported but so is the aspect ratio. Mouse support, while connected to a monitor I can use a mouse and a keyboard. Even when not connected to a phone, having access to a mouse is an absolute must when using a tablet as a laptop. USB peripheral support, so besides mouse support, my phone supports a TB external HD, HP All-In-One printer in which the scanner even works, USB replica game controllers in which a have one for the N64, SNES, Sega and PlayStation. Better overall specs, I have a 2K AMOLED display, 6GB of RAM, USB C, SD Card reader, HDMI out support, etc. I can use a custom desktop LDPI, I changed my LDPI to 380 which is the LDPI that activates tablet mode, which means all of my apps are a lot more powerful than the normal phone UI ones. I can customize my entire system to what I want it to be, give it personality, iOS users have been using the same system UI for the last 9 years. There is absolutely nothing I can’t customize. Inner app communication is a lot better, since iOS has a Walled off prison, or so called Walled Garden, apps communicate via API’s, which is the root of everything wrong within iOS. Anyway as stated above, I don’t have to use some half assed sharing function which creates a copy of the file your sharing every time you use it to open up my files within multiple apps, I simply click on Open. I can even open up the same file within multiple apps at the same time. I never, ever have to create more than one file, I just use the original file, always. I can use Linux under a Chroot, meaning I have a full Debian server running under my phone. Why would you want this, well first of all I have CLI applications like; Python, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache, etc. I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed like; Dia, Inkscape, Gimp, BlueFish, etc. I can use my phone as a desktop computer, this one might sound weird but not only is it possible, it works incredibly well. Especially when my phone has 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 821. Like I said above I have all of my favorite Linux GUI applications installed in which a bring them up using a xterminal, when I’m at work I have access to about a hundred different Windows applications via a Citrix client which works fantastically. All of my applications including the ndroid ones are opened up in individual windows, so none of that dual app view non-sense. In which in iOS less than 0.5% out of a million plus apps actually support. I have access to widgets, they might not interest you but they are extremely handy. I can use wireless chargers. I can use custom ROMs, even completely different OS’s like Ubuntu Touch, SailFish, etc. I will never, ever not be able to run the latest version of Android. When a manufacturer stops updating their phone, no problem, I just install a custom ROM and they work fantastically. My phone is a computer, a real powerhouse, a real smartphone. Every time I use an iPhone I absolutely hate the experience. I mean even to type a post like this I would have to use a text editor as I would be afraid to loose all of my work as anytime you switch to another app, Safari just resets. It has happened to me numerous times, it’s why sites have started saving drafts, not for the Android users but iOS users. Though what bothers me the most is the lack of multitasking, yes, sure, there are a few apps that can run in the background but they are far and few and none of them are the ones that I need or want to use. Than there is the file system or I should say lack of, dealing with files IOS is simply a complete nightmare. Anytime someone at the office who uses an iPhone gets sassy with me about having an Android phone I simply ask them to show me their user directory, what, you can’t mount it, why not, your phone is so great. Not only do I have my remote server directly mounted as a local directory on my phone but my workstation and all of my cloud services as well, all accessible within any app installed. Again, my phone is also my desktop computer and why not, it’s not only powerful enough but more than capable. I couldn’t believe how horrible the external display support was on my iPad Pro, which I recently replaced with a Lenovo YogaBook, best decision I ever made. Talk about a complete makeover on how I work, I’m actually productive now. I can create detailed reports, all in the background and automatically, I have access to a scripting language, automation, multi-user support with OpenID to access my firms internal network, a real Office suite, MS Office for iOS was a complete joke, there isn’t even a import feature, scripting language, nope, database support, nope, by the way, I have the Android version. Which opens up every app under their own window, iOS’s dual app support on the iPad Pro was a joke, hardly anything supports it and that drag and drop feature, only apps designed by the same developer can use it, so MS Word to MS Excel yes, MS Word to Apple photos, no, useless. Yes, my post is huge, but this authors best 15 reasons why the iPhone is a joke. Almost everything listed I have on either my Yoga Book or new Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus or don’t need it as it’s a waste. In fact 90% of the so called new features in iOS 10 are useless. I held on to my iPad Pro thinking iOS 10 would be a game changer, not only was it not, but there wasn’t a single feature that improved my experience. Apple keeps skipping over every feature that we actually want, need. If your happy with multitasking, file management, the fact that you can’t select your own default apps, lack of customizations, horrible external display support, lack of USB C, limited NFC, horrible USB peripheral support, especially mouse support. Horrible inner app communication including the Sharing function in which took Apple 8 years to even release that crap, ugh, the list just goes on and on and …………. 10/11/2016 Gigi Reply This is one of the most biased articles I have ever read on complementing Apple. I am an adult, I don’t need Apple to limit what I can do with my phone and what I can share and who I can share with. I have used Iphone before and it surely not my cup of tea. 10/12/2016 Emma squire Reply Okay Listen what I think is that you have written an article telling the blank truth of your mind. But you see I have an iPhone 6s,iPod 5,MacBook air, MacBook Pro, Samsung TV with built in smart tv, Samsung galaxy tablet pro and I don’t mind Samsung to be truthful. Also I find that Apple is more easier to use but harder to switch from an iOS device to an LGphone. Emma squire, 11y/o from Aus. 10/14/2016 Babble Reply Let’s face it… I use an android lollipop but after comparing and visualizing the specifications.. One can truly say that iPhone is way more better than android. ..though we need to invest some bucks unlike android phones. 😀 10/14/2016 Huen Reply iOS is superior to Android. I was suckered in buying 2 android devices the samsung galaxy s3 and the nexus 4. I gave it a try because my friends raved about android. They are smart people who generally have great advice and knowledge on technology. So I said I’ll give it a shot because they have good judgement. However I found out that their judgement were out of biased hatred toward apple. Android devices: 1. on paper they have more ram, sometimes quicker cpu clock speed, higher resolution etc. however real life performance tests apple out scores android devices, just check geek bench and speed tests. As for higher resolution our eyes dont even detect the larger resolutions. 2. I found out the hard way, downloaded apps that just didnt work for my device. Google needs to improve this I dont know if they are better now but man they need to detect the hardware your using and tell you ahead of time before you download and install an app that its compatible with your device! 3. customizations my butt!! Its a great idea so called if all your launchers actually look good! haha I tried all these loaders for my s3 and they were all ugly. Just go with apple, its like saying would you hire great designers for your house and you would just let them have their way in designing the house for you or would you want to design it yourself? doesnt make sense look at xiaomi great example they just copy everything apple does and it looks great. Dont hire cheap designers to design the way your phone looks and works. 4. OS – android’s solution to everything is “oh just download this app to make it work or oh just kill this task or reduce brightness or this or that” why?! If I’m paying 1k for a phone why does it not just work? Why must I non stop have to tweak things on my phone to get save battery or make things work? For instance for whatsapp there was no function built into the app that when I want to send a larger video than that of the given limit on a video it just rejects it. On iOS whatsapp gives you a little function that u can just cut the video into segments and send them in separate messages? This sounds like it can be something that is on the app level. I dont know but as for end user experience its just not convenient you need to download another app that will cut videos in segments for you this is retarded. 5. battery life just sucks on android – and my friend is all like well it works for me…well that’s because he had to buy a new battery that was double the size and totally threw out the idea of having a sleek thin phone. Theres on and on the list goes android and samsung devices are not superior devices. The features samsung lovers speak of are just gimmicks. Keyboards, widgets, notifications honestly who cares? Especially when widgets just take down performance on your phone? I just dont see any benefits on android especially the argument went something like this: “oh android phones are cheaper for superior hardware” Like I said hardware maybe superior on PAPER but in real life benchmarks iphones outshine samsung and htc and other top tier android devices. By the way prices are not cheaper anymore so android fanboys have no actual argument. Like I said I tried android and they are not superior phones both hardware and software. Aesthetically Android phones are ugly. You now pay a premium price on sub premium products, and they explode. lol 10/20/2016 Jamezz_ Reply Sure. A Samsung or LG’s phone software is ugly. But stock android?! Android 6.0 stock? It’s an extraordinary interface with origami-style apps. The geometry with the shadows and vibrant colors is beautiful. The app drawer is simple, and you can put the apps you use on your home screen. Android’s advantage is software. iSheep are just too autistic to use it. 10/16/2016 Cmi Reply I have both! I have an iPhone for work and I have an Android for my personal use, in my opinion the phone is shit and could not compare to the Android in any area,i f it were up to me I would NEVER own an iPhone. Anybody who argues this point has never used them side by side. No comparison.anybody who stands in line for the new iPhone is absolutely getting the shaft and not even getting the best product , it’s laughable! 10/18/2016 George Brite Reply Great article. Over the years I’ve had both. Even a couple of Macs. I use PC’s now because I like being able to work on them and build my own. For the average user the I Phone is a better choice. They are simple and work well. Here’s the big negatives for me: The hardware and software are proprietary. In fact the phones are sealed. You can’t install an extended battery. No SD slot. No root access. Comparable Android phones cost a lot less. The Android phones natively work with Google Apps. We use our phones in the business. If I were a casual user it wouldn’t matter if it were a Trac Phone or an I Phone. We use the Google phones and Motorola phones. They run pure Android without all the carrier bloatware. I like to say Apple invented the smartphone, but Google perfected it. It’s like the choice between a toaster oven and a microwave or a full commercial kitchen. Most people will get along fine with the toaster and microwave. They don’t need a commercial kitchen. But, what if you could get the full commercial kitchen for the same price as the toaster and microwave? Everyone has an opinion about which is better. But trust me when I say this isn’t a choice between chocolate and vanilla. There are very distinct differences between the Android and Apple phones. 10/21/2016 ZinicHD Reply Wtf, apps never ever releases on iOS first. It always releases on android first. Also app updates releases on android first, so that’s kind of bullshit what you are saying. The only thing iOS beats android in is security and stability. Also you can get virus scanners on android, so that thing doesn’t matter. And one thing more, who ever uses FaceTime or iMessage, when we have messenger, Skype ect… And that point when you said that iOS stock apps was the stupidest crap I have ever heard. First of all it was a shit point, what are you gonna need the looks for? Second is that not everyone thinks it look better, so keep that mind. I am a iOS user and I am so disappointed that you can’t even customize the most of the things. I have to admit that the design of iOS is pretty nice, but you get quick tired of it. That’s why I jailbreaked my device to get the ability to customize it more professionally. But I don’t compare a android device and a jailbroken device, because jailbreaking is not something that comes with Apple. iOS is also very expensive compared to android devices. And checking storage on android is way more organized than iOS, so I don’t know where you get that idea that checking storage on iOS is better. 10/22/2016 Bent Vanwijnsberghe Reply the lightning port part is bs i have an iphone (looking for a new phone android) and there are around me on my desk already 3 micro usb and 1 lightning port witch costs around 40 bucks for a new one 10/25/2016 Selenia Reply Terrible article by an obvious fanboy. You are listing many things, like lack of carrier or manufacturer bloatware, reversible charging plug, seamless sharing, etc and saying they are exclusive to Apple. Try Googling USB-C, the current standard on any higher range Android, some still cheaper than an iDevice. Try a Nexus, or as of this year, Pixel phone. No bloat, Android as Google intended it. That would be a more fair comparison as those are at least close in the chain to Google, like an iPhone is to Apple. That is, instead of being made by some company who may not even care how it represents Android, build quality, and other important things, instead of pure profit(not say all non Nexus/Pixel phones are bad by any means, but some do give Android a bad name with poor specs and modified/outdated versions of Android). Seamless sharing? Ever hear of WiFi Direct, Bluetooth, or NFC? NFC is the simplest. Just hit share and tap. All but the cheapest Androids have that these days. Anyways, I am convinced you have never used a decent Android, ever. Certainly not one from Google themselves. I will leave you to tend to your iFlock. 10/30/2016 MzJens Reply For android, I think google products like nexus & pixel are much better than samsung. However, I noticed a lot of crappy apps available on google play that doesn’t work. Some apps require root access which only advance users should do. Android interface is not as intuitive as iOS. Some android apps hang. I’ve never had ios apps hang on me 11/10/2016 Pixleboy2 Reply “You have to try multiple attempts before putting the charger in at the right angle” 1. If you do it in a lit environment you will get it in first try because the micro USB shape is easy to see 2. If you are in the dark: And have an official Samsung charger – there will be a “bumps letting you know which way to put it and the only thing that can go wrong is you missing the port, which is possible on iPhone too. And have any old micro USB – there are two, normal, ways to insert it horizontally upside down and horizontally the correct way both 180 degree angles so please don’t exaggerate it. Finally Samsung cares about you that’s why they use micro USB. This may seem weird but basically to legally make a lightning USB cable you need a licence from Apple and Apple only have their own unique charger to earn more profit, that’s why apple chargers are always more expensive, because they are sold by Apple or the retailer needs to make his money back from the licence fare. P.S. Samsung devices come with a 1 year warranty for free and because it’s Samsung you can get cheaper insurance than their one (yes they have one) P.P.S. Sharing has always been easier on android to anything because you could share with a variety of options such as Bluetooth, NFC, messaging app, other third party apps, S share (Samsung own “air drop” that came out in Android version 4.1.3 BI7 – before Ios 7 Also the settings icon is useful, it’s like apple not making the send button on messages 3d touch to send so you don’t accidently press it, sure sometimes you send half written messages but it is more convenient and normal to have it to a single normal touch. And there is a difference between apps looking better and having more features on Apple which are usually hardware based, I just brought this up because no matter who you ask if you compare a Samsung phone with its equivalent iPhone generation, Samsung phones ALWAYS have better displays and MOSTLY have better cameras. Samsung phones are also very comfortable, for example I am writing this on a Samsung galaxy s7 edge There is a setting that allows the micro sd card to be added as side by side storage Finally Samsung has always had earphone controls so either I read it wrong that you said these are things we will miss very much or you are really confused 11/12/2016 Tetsuokenpachi Reply Each and every single of these are false. Android is actually better in every single of these areas. From the first to the last one. Worse yet, many of these points are actually some of the very reasons why idevices absolutely suck. 11/16/2016 Billy Sastard Reply apple is crap, these idiots make their products so expensive, but android is cheaper and has alot of awesome features.android is also WAY more customisable, with out necessarily rooting your device.And if you do, you can do almost anything from installing apps to changing your software. 11/16/2016 Calculadora Gestacional Reply I think both of them are just great! 11/16/2016 Caleb Reply The update can still download on older Apple products, because I have a IPad 2 that came out in 2011 and it still receives all of the latest updates.

Was amazed to see how much progress android has made and makes my iphone look so limited. I am aware that android tends to slow down over time but that is yet to happen to me. For now the openness of android is amazing as it is giving me a computer like experience while iOS still strictly behaves like a mobile device only. Classic hurt points being in iphone /iOS being No expandable memory No dual sim version (i travel internationally and need this frequently) Unable to use lastpass like apps the same way as in android (and keychain is BS, BTW) Simple things like themes unavailable Very less system wide control Very limited customisation I can go on but i think unless my expensive edge can give me same performance as now for ATLEAST 2 years, i’ll eat my words back But, the 15 points mentioned here are almost all very unconvincing. 11/17/2016 Philip Reply Apple are just simple phones no really fancy stuff I have had two Android phone I love their features but not their battery life which is crappie I have had two Apple iPods and two iPhone they were the 4 32 GB & 5s 64 GB now on Android your apps get updated every 3 months on Apple sometimes twice a week IOS updates are twice month at least I bought my iPhone 5s 64 GB which started with iOS 7 in 2014 now it got iOS 10.1.1 it seems the IOS are getting worse not better it freezes crashes most apps lot of the app you can’t even post two year let alone one day old photo I can get on my Samsung Galaxy S3 with 3 year old photos on it and post photos off it to any app only reason I like the small iPhones I can collect lot photos that way I can post to my apps like now I got over 106K photos on my 5s 64 GB which you can’t do with big phones only problems I got with iPhones are updates on apps and IOS’S like this month iOS 10.2 supposedly be coming out it seems the new IOS’s don’t really fixing any problems you get on your iPhone it just give you different problems while you still have the same old problems you also got figure Apple iPhones are about 3 years behind Android phones on new ideals 11/18/2016 Nick Reply Apple!?

You are writing about malware crap which is misleading. New android versions since lollipop allow users to modify app permissions but i think you are so caught up in app constrained ecosystem, you didn’t noticed. IOS isn’t secure anymore as we thought it was. Su vulnerability has already been fixed and there is no more stagefright bug in android. And you obviously have no idea about the difference between android based phones and android phones. Most of the Phones from samsung, htc, sony etc run Custom Android based OS, They are actually custom build port of android, not real android phones, so obviously there will be some issues too if you try to port IOS on samsung. A high end smartphone can go head to head with iphone in each and every aspect. My s6 edge is not even a tad slower than iphone 6, in fact, it performs even better.

How much did they apple pay you for such a bad article. 12/03/2016 Brandon McLean Reply You didn’t mention how Apple has a much smaller battery, late software updates, unneeded restrictions, is insanely overpriced, and most of all, Apples processor specs come in at a fraction of what Androids of the same price have, AKA 1.6 GHZ (Apple iPhones) vs 2.4 GHZ (ASUS, Galaxy S7, OnePlus all running Android), 2 GB of RAM (Apple) vs 4 GB of RAM (Android). Android is by far the superior technology. Your only argument is that Android uses Google’s superior sharing system, rather than their own like Apple does. 12/14/2016 Keith Llewellyn Reply For me, it’s all about security, and Apple has the best. Also, if you buy an iPhone you get updates and support for a couple of years more than Google provides for it’s own Nexus or Pixel phones. Two years worth of updates for the OS and Three years for security updates FROM THE DATE OF FIRST INTRODUCTION is totally inadequate. It means that you have to buy a new google phone from the date it is first available in order to really benefit from the updates. 12/27/2016 Apple Marketing Machine Reply Let’s compare the “core” features of a new iphone to a 2 year old android phone: iphone 7 plus – Released 2016, September Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Released 2014, October iphone 7 plus – 1080 x 1920 pixels (~401 ppi pixel density) Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 1440 x 2560 pixels (~518 ppi pixel density) iphone 7 plus – Quad-core 2.23 GHz Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Quad-core 2.7 GHz iphone 7 plus – 12 MP camera Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – 16 MP camera iphone 7 plus – Non-removable Li-Ion 2900 mAh battery Samsung Galaxy Note 4 – Removable Li-Ion 3220 mAh battery okay…you can have your “better looking apps”. 12/28/2016 MACKabiVIPer42 Reply Yes Android phones are better everything wise but iPhone battery is better last as long as up to 3 to 4 years Samsung last up to 6 months I know had S3 and HTC 1 still got S3 3rd battery it’s just iPod on second iPhone first one was iPhone 4 32 GB lasted 4 years got iPhone 5s 64 GB it’s over 2 yrs old but don’t use for taking photos just for collecting photos which small iPhone can collect up too 100K photos like my iPhone 5s I’m not SELFIE PERSON where I got take photo of my self in every window mirror and bathroom I love stealing other people photos like Anime ladies in bikinis to post on my other apps even Animals if they are cute enough yes Apple do make there apps crappie and there IOS’s also which crashes and freezes a lot then half time you can’t post photos or articles from your e-mail too the apps but I take Apple for small phone over android big phone 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply More pixels require more energy and chip performance.

Unless you count changing your phone cover as “customizing”. 3: It’s not apple, so it’s better (see what i did there?

I have a android galaxy tab 3 and the iPod 6 generation and if I was to choose which is better it’s definitely Apples product and I never would get an android again. When I got my android new at Walmart it couldn’t even get the latest version, it was completely unbelievable. After I had it for 3 months it slowed down on me and its battery life is horrible. Now when I bought this IPod new I’ve had it for a double the time now and it works like new and best of all it can get the latest version. The quality of Apple is way better. In my opinion the iPhone is the best visual quality I’ve seen yet. Ive done some decent gaming on them and if you want something to save your progress then forget android, because not all the game link to your google play account so if you reset it the ones that don’t link are gone. Unlike apple I haven’t had any issues with it. I’ve lost decent money and progress on android because of it. Yes Apple does come out with the newest technology a bit latter then android but you can see it it a good way or a bad. The bad way would be that their slow, the good way you can see it as if their watching googles failing parts and their making it better. 01/03/2017 Marcelino Reply Also I can see you all are fighting over this topic which is pretty stupid. To be honest you can’t necessarily compare them. Everyone is different so everyone is going to want something different. If we all wanted android or we all wanted Apple we would become robots. If you wanted to find a phone to get then get into inside detail to see what your looking for. If you wanted fun texting and want to be more secure then go straight for apple because they got the best for that but if you wanted fun lock screens or be able to put micro SD cards and changeable batteries then go for android but let me remind you that anyone can take the SD card out and take your information. Hope this helps. 01/04/2017 LOREN FOK Reply people will buy iphone just because thats what everyone else has they dont even know what they are buying. They think because its popular its the best choice..all robots who don’t think for themselves 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply Since it’s more popular it’s better … 01/04/2017 farafit Reply i read almost every comments and keep deciding what should i buy: an android or iphone. i own android for 8 years now (from the era when sony ericsson still existed) and got so accustomed to it. i changed devices for 4 times during the 8 years because i want to get spec updates regularly. i love the fact that it is very simple in android: you can buy any android device you want and you will feel like you never changed your phone. contact, picture, apps, music will all still be the same as in the old phone. i heard that iphone is more stable compared to android so i am thinking of switching but i am genuinely scared the switch will cost me more: i will have to buy new headphones, mac (because many say that iphones does not connect well with pc), and i am very clumsy so i’m scared of scattering my iphone screen and will need to pay more to repair it. my husband owns a 4s and it still works until now, and it is true that android has shorter lifespan for a clumsy user like me because after some point android will keep hanging.. but still i think android is perfect for people like me who doesn’t really have the money to be a vivid apple follower.. i don’t want to be all attached to itunes.. i dont want to be obliged to buy a macbook to operate my iphone well.. i just don’t really like to spend almost all of my earnings to buy a single phone, when at the same time the same amount of money can be used to buy an android and a pc, and a vacuum cleaner.. maybe someday i will switch to apple products altogether when i have a mountain pile of money to spend.. but for now i am quite happy with a middle-end android phone and will stick to it.. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply As they say: expensive shoes last longer… 01/10/2017 Frank McConnell Reply iPhones are better than androids, PERIOD. At least we don’t get viruses, androids are very slow and lag A LOT! iPhones are really fast, while androids have “better specs” than every iPhone in the world. Wow, people here in the comments are blind as heck, like have you people ever used and iPhone before? Think before you speak. 01/13/2017 Angwell Reply I have used an android phone for the last 20 yrs and just in the last 2 yrs switched to an iPhone. Sure there may be more that an android can do ( provided you download appropriate apps) but as a comment above made, after a month or 2 the android starts slowing down dramatically. With the iPhone this does not happen. BUT the major improvement that will keep me with the iPhone is security !!!!!! 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh Smith… But My view about your article is…No one can said this iPhone is better or Android is not Or Vice-Versa until you are not aware of their pros as well. There are alot to know about these two before making your mind to go for iPhone or Android, one of them. Both phones have their own features and plus points. It is insane to say this iPhone is best and other phones are rest. As we all know among both of these Android has very good quality of camera but latest iPhone 7 brings the revolution in the mobile market. To know more about this you can read from this link: http://peaktal.com/iphone-ios-or-android-which-one-is-best-to-buy/ 01/17/2017 Shivanki Sharma Reply Well said Josh…But my view about your article is…no one can say with his or her own perception that iPhone is better than Android or vice versa. There is alot to know about before making up the mind to go for iPhone instead of Android. Seriously, its really insane to say this iPhone is best And other are rest….As everyone know this Android has good camera quality but we also know this iPhone 7 placed the revolution in the mobile market as well. What i am trying to tell you is this perspectives and features. To know about these or making a decision about which is better or not… Please read about these two on this link: http://peaktal.com/iphone-ios-or-android-which-one-is-best-to-buy/ 01/17/2017 Haviette Reply Please, folks, be nice. This isn’t a social networking site.

Is that the best you could do, it gives the article away as biased! Shame 01/29/2017 Ashkar Reply I was a Android addict until I choose iphone for an experiment. Now of course I’m an apple fan. 01/29/2017 THETRUEANDROIDUSER Reply Apple fanboys,crying it out.What a pity,brainwashed fools 01/30/2017 dstrauss Reply I have been an iPhone user since day one (currently 7 Plus), but this article is insanely prejudiced. Most of the alleged superiorities are interoperabilty between iPhones (iMessage, Airdrop) or between iPhone and other Apple devices (Handoff) – if you are a PC owner, or have a large number of friends or fellow users on Android, these advantages are insignificant at best. I will concede that updates and lack of carrier bloatware are significant pluses, the author is doing an extreme disservice to new users by basically promoting an iPhone prejudice. 01/31/2017 Matt Perkins Reply iPhones win over Android smartphones for these 5 critical reasons. Security, Privacy, Stability, Performance and Usability. iOS gets far less malware than Android, it has far less critical vulnerabilities than Android. Vulnerabilities are patched quicker in iOS. iOS crashes and freezes less than Android, Apple doesn’t harvest data to sell like Google does (Google has even started collecting identifiable data since they released their new voice assistant). iOS is a faster OS than Android is while Android smartphones slow down faster than the iPhone does. And of course iOS offers the better out of box experience. Not to mention you can never make Android as secure as iOS, only close to as secure. Part of the reason is even if you tweak your Android settings to be similar to iOS, the official Google Play Store gets far more malware than the AppStore and Cydia combined. So only way to even remotely match it is not download apps or games. My other favorite part of iOS over Android is the fact you can use true adblockers in iOS, not just adblock browsers without the need to root or jailbreak. Google will never allow you to block ads in Chrome or block all ads third party ads without rooting. And as you knowing rooting and jailbreaking merely lowers the security of the OS. That’s another thing Jailbroken iOS is more secure than untouched Android as long as you stick to the default repos in Cydia. 02/01/2017 Shaun Anderson Reply Android Download from unknown sources like a regular computer Download files from browser Plug in and transfer anything to and from computer. File System. Just acts more like a computer in regards to freedom to do as you will where iPhone is locked down like a game system. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply You can do all that in iTunes. iPhone is more careful to protect data while android is less careful. Today security is most important and that is iOS goal. 02/02/2017 lg k4 ekran koruyucu Reply LG K10 LTE için sergi 1280 X 720 piksel yüksek çözünürlüklü ekran çözünürlüğe sahip IPS LCD yaptı. 02/10/2017 thomasammy749 Reply Stay at home mom Kelly Richards from New York after resigning from her full time job managed to average from $6000-$8000 a month from freelancing at home… This is how she done !!!!!!!!!!!!!http://jobbuzz7.com 02/14/2017 Debadeep Biswas Reply I also believe iPhone is better than Android. I am tired of using Android and going to buy iPhone soon for better camera, speed and style. 02/17/2017 LordyAlmighty Reply One VERY important fact that no one has mentioned… with Apple you can be a total amoral ignoramous and be surrounded by adoring fans !! Who really cares if the poor sods on the other side of the world live the lives of slaves? Who cares if they have to stand ALL day, and ASK for pissbreaks? Who cares if the companies solution to suicides are suicide nets around buildings and removing knives? Who cares if the iphone costs a dollar to make, but sold for $600? Who cares if most of the jobs are not in the countries paying for the status symbols? So lets be clear, its all about “im better than you because i can waste money on bling, and *&$! your community at the same time”. 02/18/2017 exycheezy Reply I’ve had both. many times. I’ve had every version of the iPhone. I’ve never had an Android phone update properly. My 3 year old plays on my old 2nd gen iPhone that has the latest IOS on it. . .. android can’t do that. with the exception of a Verizon flip phone, every single Android phone I’ve ever had got a virus, crashed and I had to reset to factory settings at least 2 times per phone. I have never, ever ever got a virus on ANY Apple product, and never had to put any software or app to keep it running correctly. As far as customization? Who cares. If you’re so busy and have so much time to waste trying to impress everyone with crazy fonts and wild customization, the iPhone is way to sleek, sophisticated and user -friendly for you. Software dictates hardware. The IOS blows Android OS away. And, any (anyone who’s actually worked on both will agree) Apple product gets sometimes twice the speed out of less RAM and processing than ANY other OS (Windows or Android). Give me stability anytime. so your phone has an expandable memory? What good is it when it won’t run half the time. Have a nice day all. . .. .after all, they’re just phones. . .. right? 02/19/2017 Richie Reply Some things to add (pros and cons) as a PC & Android guy that just switched to iPhone (but I’m staying on PC): 1) The iOS versions of Microsoft apps are better than the Android ones and they work great. 2) Article is correct: the iOS versions of apps are generally better than their Android counterparts, in ways you will notice. It’s really kind of a shame for Android – I don’t get why they don’t just match the exact app. 3) Lightning is neat but I found MicroUSB more useful, since it’s used for more devices, i.e. I have a MicroUSB running from my desk to my PC to charge my wireless mouse, and then I would also use it to charge my phone sometimes. 4) Yes I do miss customization heaven with Android, but this iPhone runs like total butter. Android runs WELL but this thing is so zippy and responsive – you wouldn’t believe it until you spent time with one. 5) ALSO customization isn’t as cut-off as it used to be with iOS. Some apps can latch onto some functions in the phone, kinda like installing an extension for your desktop browser. It’s something. Really I just bought an iPhone to “try something new” and I’m really liking it. 02/28/2017 Toby Reply Just do a Quick google search iphone is less reliable than Android, theres your Answer in the studies. End of debate… 03/01/2017 Viking Sheep Reply These comparisons are so lame… Eg: Country X is much better than the rest of the world, because the rest of the world have varying standards, while Country X has only 1 level of corruption. 03/06/2017 iAlex Reply First: great respect to Steve Jobs who dedicated his life to Apple iPhone invention and to make communication better more joyful between people. Also to feel the power and beauty of technology in your hand. How I wished that Isaac Newton or Ainstein or Nikola Tessa or… would see what we have today… Second: iPhone is far more serious for people who want job to be done as fast and simpler way without delays. Android phones are for kids who like customizations and pretty colors and to look like iron man or similar… Third: iPhone is made of better materials. And looks for business high class. Android phones are copying iPhone’s look especially Samsung. Fourth: iPhone technology, the software and hardware gives you exactly what you need. No more no less. Android technologies gives you extra things which are seldom used and are simply extra using more battery and device performance. Fifth: iPhone has a specific style in design. Keeping updating same style to better one making it each time better and better. Sixth: Applications on iPhone are much better with much less defects than Android. At the end, I had various Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Htc and iPhone phones. I choose iPhone. Now I have iPhone 6s+ black limited edition with golden Apple. It’s very nice piece of equipment. at the bottom line, Apollo 11 travelled to the moon using Fortan on its 360 kb computer. Today we are talking of gigs bytes. So I respect both iPhone and Android technologies for their great effort and progress. Competition shall exist to make difference and better.

 How Apple product pricing compares to its closest competitors, in one chart Kif Leswing Apr. 4, 2017, 2:57 PM 4,574 facebook linkedin twitter email print A fan's drawing of what the upcoming iPhone could look like.YouTube/ConceptsiPhone One of the loudest rumors about the redesigned iPhone expected to launch this fall is that it could cost $1,000 or more. But that price point doesn't seem realistic, writes UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a note distributed to clients on Tuesday. Instead, he expects the redesigned iPhone, with a next-generation OLED screen, to start at $850 or $900. He also expects Apple to launch two other models more similar to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at $650 and $750, close to their current price.  "Apple's prices are consistent with a strategy we'll call 'mainstream luxury,'" he writes. "Entry-level products are positioned in the middle of the market and 'Pro/Plus' products sit at the high end. It's a strategy that enables the Apple brand to be within the reach of a mass market yet be viewed as the premium option." Milunovich illustrates this point by comparing Apple laptop, phone, and tablet prices to other big electronics brands:  UBS "Apple rarely ventures far above competitors at the high end. It is for this reason we do not expect to see a $1,000 iPhone," Milunovich writes.    SEE ALSO: The completely redesigned iPhone 8 could cost a boatload AND: Apple is abandoning its expensive image More: Apple UBS Steven Milunovitch facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru How Apple product pricing compares to its closest competitors, in one chart How Apple product pricing compares to its closest competitors, in one chart One of the loudest rumors about the redesigned...

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 45 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone.

Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music.

Schiller – along with SVP of software engineering Craig Federighi, VP of hardware engineering John Ternus, and Mac PR director Bill Evans – spoke with a handpicked group of favored journalists who were invited to Apple's headquarters in what appears to be an effort to counter discontent among professional power users. Before John Gruber, Ina Fried, John Paczkowski and Matthew Panzarino, Schiller deviated from Apple's standard media playbook – no commenting on unreleased products – and promised the future Mac Pro would be "a modular system" whenever it appears, which won't be this year. Apple did not respond to a request to confirm that this meeting actually took place. According to Gruber's account of the meeting, "The word 'mistake' was not uttered, but this is about as close as we're going to get to Apple admitting they miscalculated with the current Mac Pro's concept. One word that was uttered, however, was 'sorry.'" Apple has been here before. At its developer conference in 2012, after neglecting the Mac Pro for two years, the Cupertino idiot-tax operation released an underwhelming update with 3.2-GHz quad-core Intel Xeon W3565 processor or two 2.4-GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5645 processors, which was already outdated by Intel's 8-core Xeon E5 chips announced three months earlier and a three-year-old ATI Radeon 5770 graphics card. In a blog post at the time, developer Marco Arment called the update "half-assed" and said, "The message is clear: Apple doesn't give a sh** about the Mac Pro." Such sentiment was commonplace, and evidently prompted CEO Tim Cook, in an email to Facebook user Stephen Tanner, to break Apple's code of silence and declare, "We are planning a new Mac Pro for later next year." At the end of the following year, on December 19, 2013, Apple released its "vision for the future of the pro desktop," a black cylinder "designed around an innovative unified thermal core." It then proceeded to ignore the Mac Pro for more than 1,200 days. The neglect prompted Arment to speculate last November that Apple has given up on the Pro market. Similar sentiment, not altogether justified, followed the October release of Apple's latest MacBook Pro, which is limited to 16GB of memory, due to heat and battery life constraints. With the revised Mac Pro nowhere in sight, Apple on Tuesday released a minor speed bump update. The $2,999 model now has 6 Xeon CPU cores, up from 4, and dual AMD G500 GPUs, up from AMD G300 GPUs. The $3,999 model now has 8 CPU cores, up from 6, and dual AMD D800 GPUs, up from AMD D500 GPUs. The unified thermal core that Apple celebrated as innovation turned out to be an obstacle to expandability. Schiller acknowledged that the Mac Pro was "thermally constrained" and Federighi said, "Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate." Gruber asked whether Apple was aware how many people have begun to doubt the company's commitment to the needs of Mac Pro users. Schiller responded, "It's a reasonable question, and this is why we're here today, specifically, to address that question above all else." ® Tips and corrections 37 Comments More from The Register Pro who killed Apple's Power Mac found... masquerading as a coffee table You thought McAfee was a master of disguise? 38 Comments New MacBook Pro beckons fanbois to become strip pokers Who needs an escape key when you've got high-res emoji buttons? 164 Comments Spotty battery life costs Apple's MacBook Pro its gold-star rating Updated Consumer Reports nerd baffled by bizarre results 53 Comments Quad-core coffee table trumped by dual-Mac garden furniture Readers share retro-computing rebuilds, plus a Microsoft CD fit only to be used as a coaster 24 Comments Docker goes native with Windows, Mac beta Want a laptop full of containers?

Recently, Samsung’s biggest rival came up with patent applications that detail an iMac keyboard having an extra feature called Adaptive Input Row, which looks and functions like the Touch Bar.  On Monday, Patently Apple learned of three new Apple patent applications that contain information about a “Keyboard with an Adaptive Input Row.” Based on the descriptions of the new row, it will be placed above the alpha-numeric keys as replacement to the traditional function keys on the user-input device. The documents also mention that the touchscreen panel would be capable of performing the same functionality as the traditional function keys and even more, since it is designed to expand or change to diverse sets of commands and functions.  Because of the obvious similarities to how they function and look, it’s clear that Apple’s Adaptive Input Row in the new patent applications is the same thing with the current MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. An illustration that’s part of the documents shows an iMac desktop standing in front of a keyboard with the OLED strip atop the alpha-numeric keys. Other details found in the patents pertain to the materials and their arrangement to make the setup work in the iMac keyboard.  READ: Why is Apple refunding Workflow users? The appearance of the new Apple patents on the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office’s site comes just days before word about the Cupertino giant’s private meeting with journalists surfaced online. During the said meeting, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said that new iMacs are in the works. According to him, the new iMac desktops that will be released later this year are designed for professional users.  Federighi did not spill the beans on what changes consumers can expect from the next-generation iMacs, but he did share that Apple is pushing the iMac to be a high-performance pro system that’s intended mainly for the professional market, as per Apple Insider. It isn’t clear if part of this new approach would be the addition of the Touch Bar onto the al-in-one computer’s keyboard. Apple’s future iMacs could have Touch Bars on their keyboards.

The company also dropped the cost of various upgrade options. Previously, Apple offered a base quad core model with 12GB of RAM and dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs for $2999 and a high-end 6-core model with 16GB of RAM and dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs for $3999. That 6-core model is now the base model Mac Pro with a new price of $2999. The high-end spot has been filled by a 8-core model with 16GB of RAM and dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs for $3999. Upgrade pricing has also been reduced. For example, it used to cost $1500 and $3000 to upgrade from the 6-core to the 8-core and 12-core, respectively. However, it now costs $800 and $2000, respectively. GPU upgrade pricing has also been reduced. Despite the price drops, we'd strongly suggest that if at all possible customers wait until Apple launches its revamped Mac Pro, hopefully next year.

Read: Apple Releasing Redesigned Mac Pro In Near Future Samsung Pay works in more places than Apple Pay, however there are reported issues with magnetic stripe. With Samsung Pay, you have to hold your device in a certain way above the magnetic stripe reader or it might not work on the first try. With Apple Pay just hold your phone close to the reader and place your thumb on the fingerprint sensor. Apple Pay and Samsung Pay are designed to be extremely secure, since places you make purchases at don’t receive any credit card data. With Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, credit card numbers are not stored on the device or servers. Both options don’t keep transaction information either.

Not This Year Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Promises Mac Pro Redesign Is Coming, Just Not This Year By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: APRIL 04 2017 First, the good news: Apple announced plans to release a completely redesigned version of the Mac Pro. Now the bad news: you won’t see it until at least 2018. But professional Mac users can sleep soundly in the knowledge that Apple understands their frustrations. Why else would the company invite a group of reporters to its headquarters yesterday to update the world on a product it doesn’t plan to release for at least another year? Apple seems to understand that it has a major perception problem when it comes to professional users, and can't afford to ignore the issue until an official product announcement sometime in 2018. Not Built for Modern Workloads The current version of the Mac Pro was released in 2013. At the time, the company thought it was making a bold statement with the unusual form factor that looked more like a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker than a professional desktop machine. But instead of representing a great leap forward for the company’s pro users, the current incarnation of the Mac Pro is now closer to a dead end. A large part of that is likely the fault of the internal architecture, the company admitted to reporters yesterday. Apple designers had gambled on an architectural plan designed to accommodate two smaller GPUs (graphics processing units), rather than a single larger one. Not necessarily a bad idea in principal, but that wasn’t how the industry evolved. Instead, designs and workloads have moved toward relying on one larger GPU. Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi acknowledged to reporters that the current design was inadequate for professional users whose workloads depended on running on a single GPU or single-threaded CPU (central processing unit) performance. Certain scientific workloads require a single GPU, and heavy 3D graphics or VR applications can also be taxing for two smaller GPUs, Federighi said. A Move to Modular However, the Mac Pro’s architecture made it difficult for the company to reconfigure the machine along the lines that their customers required. In particular, while the desktop’s triple chassis design was well-equipped to disperse the heat generated by two lower-power graphics chips, it couldn’t handle the thermal output generated by a single, massive GPU. That left Apple with a device that didn't serve the needs of many of its professional customers. Apple was also unable to upgrade future versions while remaining true to the original design. As a result, the Mac Pro has received little in the way of significant upgrades to its specifications. After four years on the market, the Pro has now fallen dramatically behind its competitors in the professional space. But Apple said that it's already hard at work on redesigning the Mac Pro. Although the company did not reveal any major details, executives did say the next model will be much more modular than the current version to better facilitate future upgrades. The new modular architecture will also include a new Pro display, something Apple has shied away from in the past. Image credit: Apple.

AMD Defends New Ryzen Processor Next Article > Oracle Claims First Truly Converged Cloud/NAS Storage Platform By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MARCH 31 2017 Oracle announced a new platform this week to help enterprises integrate cloud storage services with on-premises NAS storage systems. The platform, called Oracle Cloud Converged Storage, is based on Oracle's ZFS Cloud software, which is included in the latest Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance release. The company is pitching the solution as the first truly converged storage solution that offers both public cloud and on-premises, high-performance NAS (network attached storage). The company said the new tools will allow organizations to move data or applications from on-premises storage to the cloud more easily. There's no need for external cloud gateways or software, or cloud access licenses from legacy, on-premises vendors in order to access public clouds from their infrastructure platforms. Easier Path to Integration Oracle said its new approach significantly eases the migration burden for IT administrators as they move from their own on-premise platforms to public cloud integration. The difficulty usually comes when trying to integrate disparate environments with different security requirements and a variety of industry standards. Struggling with end-to-end visibility, diagnostics and support can also be a problem. With its ZFS Cloud, Oracle thinks it can beat both public cloud providers who cannot deliver on-premises, high-performance storage systems, and also traditional hardware vendors who lack truly integrated public clouds. So says analyst Mark Peters of the Enterprise Strategy Group. Peters says Oracle's converged platform delivers "a genuine hybrid data ability with a 'cloud insurance option' built right into the storage system." Oracle says the convergence of its storage cloud with ZFS Storage Appliances will provide enterprise clients with the same performance abilities as flash storage drives plus the added agility and simplicity of Oracle's cloud storage solution. The company said the converged system can be used for elastic application storage as well as back-up and recovery. Other uses include development, testing, active archive storage, and snapshot replica storage. It can also be used by Dev Ops with a single API for both on-premises and in the Oracle Storage Cloud, and for lift-and-shift workload migration. Newer applications can also leverage data both in Oracle ZFS Storage Appliances (shown above) and in the Oracle Storage Cloud without any application changes. Cloud Meets On-Premises "Cloud [technology] is forcing IT practitioners to rethink their organization's infrastructure to accommodate current technology while future-proofing their business for tomorrow," said Steve Zivanic, Oracle's VP of Storage and Converged Infrastructure. "By converging the Oracle ZFS Storage Appliances with Oracle Storage Cloud, organizations benefit from the highest performing storage systems for their on-premises needs, while seamlessly extending them to Oracle Cloud resources when necessary. Oracle ZFS Cloud is the unifying enabler that helps customers bridge the gap between their current infrastructure and plans for broader public cloud adoption." The company said the new update also includes a series of innovations to the Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance that extend Oracle Database dynamic automation capabilities. Oracle claims these updates can increase database administrator productivity by as much as ten times, as well as add all-flash pools to accelerate business applications. The platform also includes new storage protocols to help automate storage tuning and cloud-scale data protection, with more than 62TB per hour of data backup. Image credit: Product shot by Oracle.

The patent application, revealed this week, shows the Touch Bar and TouchID sensor sitting within the wireless keyboard accessory Apple offers with iMacs and makes available for iPads and those using desktop computing units like the Mac Pro and the Mac Mini. Apple’s application says that as well as its own OLED display, the standalone keyboard could have its own processing unit and GUI within the housing, while it'd almost certainly require a much larger battery capacity. The text from the patent (via 9to5Mac) reads: “In some embodiments, the device may also include a processing unit positioned within the housing, and a primary display positioned at least partially within the housing and configured to display a graphical-user interface executed by the processing unit. In some embodiments, the display is an organic light-emitting diode display. The electronic device may be a keyboard device.” As always, it’s important to state that the patent application in no way offers any assurances we’ll see such a product in the future. However, why shouldn’t iMac and Mac Pro users - often shelling out more for the privilege - be entitled to the same functionality as those rocking a MacBook Pro? Speaking of the Mac Pro, the patent reveal comes at an opportune time. On Tuesday, Apple gave us a mini surprise by pledging to “rethink” the Mac Pro, which hasn’t had a proper update since it was launched in 2013. During a roundtable with press, Apple marketing guru Phil Schiller revealed that Apple would be “completely rethinking the Mac Pro.” “Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now.” A new Mac Pro with the option of a Touch Bar-enabled sounds like a creative’s dream to us. Would you pay a little more for the Magic Keyboard if the iOS-inspired Touch Bar was on board? Drop us a line in the comments below.

Admits to Mac Pro Design Flaws, Promises New Model Coming Better late than never. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 4, 2017 at 2:43PM It's just embarrassing at this point. For a company that famously demarcated the consumer and professional markets decades ago and worked hard to cater to each of those markets, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has rightfully received an incredible amount of criticism that it is seemingly neglecting the professional market (at least when it comes to desktop users). The Mac Pro, redesigned and launched in 2013, has continued to gather dust over the years with no updates whatsoever -- until now. The big news today is that Apple invited a handful of journalists to its campus to deliver the message that a newly redesigned Mac Pro is coming. Not this year, but hopefully next. In the meantime, Apple will be bumping the specs of the Mac Pro, for the first time in nearly four years. Mac Pro. Image source: Apple. "We're sorry" Apple doesn't apologize often. The most recent and prominent apology was the Apple Maps fiasco from five years ago that contributed to Scott Forstall's ouster, in part because he reportedly refused to apologize; CEO Tim Cook had to apologize on Apple's behalf instead. For the Mac Pro, Apple is implicitly admitting that its design -- the sleek black jet engine -- was flawed. Apple designed the system with dual GPUs, while creative professionals have been shifting toward a single, larger and more powerful GPU. The problem was that the current design had thermal limitations that couldn't accommodate a more powerful GPU. According to John Gruber, Marketing Chief Phil Schiller then uttered the S-word: The current Mac Pro, as we've said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we're sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we've asked the team to go and rearchitect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It'll meet more of those needs. Schiller's famous line from the 2013 unveiling, "Can't innovate anymore, my [butt]," is now coming back to bite him in precisely that spot. Meanwhile, the iMac is starting to serve a meaningful chunk of Apple's professional customers, considering the "consumer" desktop's current capabilities. The iMac is also due for an upgrade, although it's in less dire need than the Mac Pro; Schiller says an iMac spec bump is slated for "this year." Interestingly, Apple executives said a new professional display is also in the works, despite prior comments that Apple was exiting the stand-alone display market and instead partnering with other companies. Apple noted that about 20% of Mac sales are still desktops, which is a higher proportion than most would think. The company has sold $23.3 billion worth of Macs over the past year.  Why Apple had to speak out Apple pre-announcing a product is almost unheard of, as it's often aiming to avoid the infamous Osborne effect that led to Osborne Computer's failure in the 1980s. I can only think of two notable examples: The iPhone was pre-announced six months prior to launch in 2007, and the Apple Watch was pre-announced by a comparable amount of time in fall 2014 ahead of the spring 2015 launch. The common thread there is that those were both entries into then-new product categories, so pre-announcing had greater potential to hurt competitors than Apple itself. That's why the announcement of an upcoming Mac Pro that won't be launched until next year (or later) is unique. It will be a rather long wait for a new product in a mature category. Apple probably feels like it has no choice, though, as it's been backed into a corner with criticisms from professional customers that feel like they're being abandoned. Remaining silent for another year or more would be untenable, as it would risk that those users would defect to another platform. Apple had to say something, but pros will still have to wait a little longer for a redesign. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Mello Jr. Apr 4, 2017 9:44 AM PT Imagination on Monday announced that Apple would no longer use its intellectual property, and the company's stock sank faster than a bottomless boat on the news. Apple planned to discontinue its use of the company's IP in new products in 15 months to two years, ending the license and royalty agreement between the companies, Imagination said. Those royalties currently account for about half the revenue of Imagination, in which Apple has an 8 percent stake. Imagination's technology and intellectual property is used in the graphics processor units in Apple's phones, tablets, iPods, TV products and watches. Following Imagination's announcement, Reuters reported the UK company's stock price fell 70 percent, to 76 pence, the lowest since 2009. "I cannot see how Imagination would survive this, given Apple is such a large customer," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. Difficult to Cut Cord Imagination cast doubt on Apple's assertion that it could build a GPU with only its own intellectual property, however, contending that such an effort would e extremely challenging and might violate Imagination's intellectual property rights. Imagination wants its investors to believe that Apple won't be able to totally cut it out of the picture, suggested Ben Bajarin, a principal at Creative Strategies. "It is certainly true that building a GPU from the ground up will likely require someone's IP in some way for Apple, unless of course they acquired the IP they need via some other acquisition they have made," he noted in an analysis of the announcement. Another possible scenario is that Apple will customize the Mali graphics solution offered by ARM, which Apple already is licensed to use, Bajarin said. Heavy Customization What many people don't realize is that Apple has been doing a great deal of customization of the Imagination GPU IP to fit its own needs, Bajarin explained. "Imagination provided the GPU core, but Apple began adding more and more of its technology and displacing Imagination's technology," observed Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst with Tirias Research. "It may have gotten to the point where Apple wasn't using enough of Imagination's technology to make it worthwhile to continue paying for it," he told the E-Commerce Times. Imagination should have been prepared for Apple's move, Krewell added. "The rumors have been floating around for a lot of years that Apple was developing its own GPU to replace Imagination," he pointed out. "Apple has been hiring top GPU architects. There could only be one product they could be working on." Important Step for Apple Gaining control of the GPUs in its products is an important step for Apple. "Apple is putting themselves in a position to own their GPU solution and, as a result, not be beholden to the design direction of a third party whom they may not have total influence over," Bajarin wrote in his analysis. "This puts Apple in an incredibly strong position strategically to control their own destiny in hardware, software, and services -- even more than they do today," he added. Apple has been building out its silicon capabilities aggressively, explained Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. "It allows Apple to optimize chipset designs for its own purposes," he told the E-Commerce Times. "It gives it more control, better integration and more potential optimization." It is not certain that Apple's decision will prove to be a wise strategy, though. "Time will tell how good of a move this was for Apple," Moor Insights' Moorhead told the E-Commerce Times. "Apple has a good track record in silicon, but graphics are harder than CPUs, and Nvidia, Qualcomm and AMD holds most of the IP today," he pointed out. "Under Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has become a far more risk-averse company than it was during Steve Jobs' tenure," noted Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT. "I can't imagination Apple stating such a decision unless they were fully prepared to move forward and execute it successfully," he told the E-Commerce Times. Few Pacts Last Forever Apple has had some stormy breakups with providers in the past. GT Advanced Technologies, which made sapphire screens, in 2014 blamed Apple for forcing it into bankruptcy, for example. "In business, few if any partnerships last forever," King observed. "Apple has a long history of leaving behind strategic relationships when they no longer suit its purpose," he said. "If any Apple partners were unaware of that issue or unwilling to consider it seriously, today's announcement should inspire some serious soul-searching." Imagination made a point of noting that it has reserved all its rights to its confidential information and would be protective of its intellectual property rights. That could signal a court date with Apple. Still, "Apple is not the kind of company you want to go after unless you've got really big bucks," warned Jack E. Gold, principal analyst at J.Gold Associates. "Based on past history, it's hard to win lawsuits against Apple," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Even if you can, it's a five-year or more effort. It takes forever because they'll appeal the heck out of it," Gold pointed out. "If that's what you're relying on to stay in business, you're in big trouble." John P.

 Apple abandoned some of its most important users, and now it's trying to catch up to its biggest competitors Steve Kovach Apr. 4, 2017, 2:53 PM 28,958 facebook linkedin twitter email print Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, introducing the Mac Pro in 2013.AP It's rare Apple admits it made a mistake, but that's what we heard from the company Tuesday. In an unprecedented move — as far as I can recall — Apple pre-announced products it's working on: a new version of the Mac Pro, a high-resolution computer display, and some retooled iMacs with more powerful features. The new Mac Pro and display won't launch for at least another year, and the iMacs are coming later this year, although that's as specific as Apple would get. But there's a lot of history behind the decision to break with tradition and pre-announce a bunch of stuff that isn't even finished yet, and it comes after a series of missteps that gave the impression the company was ignoring some of its most important customers. Apple has earned a reputation for abandoning professional users — the graphic artists, video producers, and programmers that rely on top-notch hardware to get work done. Although it's a relatively niche group today, it wasn't that long ago that professionals like these were the core of Apple's fan base. But Apple essentially ignored its pro hardware and put its engineering prowess behind more consumer-friendly products like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple now says the Mac Pro design can't be configured to fit the high-end specs users want.Getty Images/Justin Sullivan The result? A lineup of Macs that hasn't been significantly updated in the technological equivalent of a lifetime. The current Mac Pro desktop was introduced about three and a half years ago. The Mac Mini, a sort of in-between device for "prosumers," hasn't been updated in about two and a half years. The new MacBook Pro, which launched last fall, rubbed a lot of professionals the wrong way because of its lack of common ports that meant you needed to buy dongles to use many accessories, as well as poor battery life and not enough options to upgrade the memory. Meanwhile, competitors like Microsoft have swooped in to attract the pro market Apple left behind. Microsoft's new all-in-one PC, the Surface Studio, features a gorgeous touchscreen display and accepts stylus input and a new method of control with the Surface Dial, which is perfect for artists and designers. And the Surface Book is a powerful Windows laptop with a touchscreen and all the ports professionals love. In short, it has never been easier to switch from a Mac to a more powerful and capable alternative, and it looks like that won't change for at least another year. The Surface Studio.Microsoft Apple appears to have realized it's losing the high ground in the pro market, so it invited a handful of journalists to its headquarters this week to chat with two top executives about its plans to reassure one of its most dedicated fan bases that it's finally going to turn things around. In that meeting, Apple's senior vice president of marketing, Phil Schiller, and SVP of software engineering, Craig Federighi, revealed just enough details about the upcoming Mac Pro to whet the appetites of users who had been waiting for something new, especially a new graphics processing unit that'll help the computer push out better graphics, and an Apple-made display to replace the Cinema Display that died last year. In the meantime, Apple is throwing pros a bone: The current Mac Pro was updated Tuesday with some faster chips, and those new iMacs launching later this year will get an internal boost, too. But there were other curious aspects about this soft product announcement, especially the company's cagey reply when asked about the Mac Mini in the Mac lineup. Schiller said there weren't any immediate plans to update the Mac Mini, even though it has been over 900 days since its last update, and he didn't elaborate. The execs also reiterated that they didn't want to add touchscreens to Macs — something pros have grown to love on Windows machines. It is refreshing to see Apple admit it has fallen behind. Schiller even said he was sorry for the slow movement in the company's pro lineup. But until Apple can start shipping products, there's a huge opportunity and plenty of time for its biggest competitors to capture the pro market Apple abandoned.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (2) Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000 by Josh Centers It will be 2018 at the earliest before we see the redesigned Mac Pro that Apple has promised (see “Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017), but if you need a cylinder-style Mac Pro in the interim, there’s some good news: Apple has rejiggered the configurations to provide existing higher performance options at lower prices. (These changes have been called a speed bump, but in our opinion, a speed bump requires the introduction of a faster CPU that was previously unavailable. In comparing the technical specs, it seems clear that all Apple did here was drop the prices on existing configurations.) For $2999, the new low-end configuration gets the specs of the previous high-end configuration, which equates to a $1000 price drop. It moves from a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.5 GHz 6-core Xeon E5 and from dual AMD FirePro D300 graphics processors with 2 GB of VRAM to dual AMD D500 graphics processors with 3 GB of VRAM. The new $3999 high-end configuration moves from a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 CPU to a 3.0 GHz 8-core Xeon E5. It too gets beefier graphics processors, trading dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics processors for dual AMD FirePro D700 graphics processors. These aren’t new options, and our best guess based on current prices is that this configuration also received a $1000 price drop. Oddly, the Apple online store reports this configuration as “Currently unavailable.” Both models now feature 16 GB of RAM standard, up from 12 GB for the low-end model, with upgrades to 32 GB ($400) or 64 GB ($1200) available. They come standard with 256 GB of flash storage, and you can boost that to 512 GB ($200) or 1 TB ($600). For the ultimate performance, you can still upgrade to a 2.7 GHz 12-core Xeon E5 CPU ($2000). A tricked-out Mac Pro still costs a whopping $6999! Nor do any other specs change. Notably, the Mac Pro still relies on Thunderbolt 2, so you can’t connect new accessories like the LG UltraFine 5K display. Besides the six Thunderbolt 2 ports, it still has 4 USB 3.0 ports, two Gigabit Ethernet ports, one HDMI 1.4 port, and yes, a 3.5mm headphone jack with optical digital output. For wireless connectivity, it features Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. These improvements aren’t likely to make anyone jump on the Mac Pro train, but if you need to buy additional units for your business in the near future, they’ll provide a bit more performance for your money. For many desk-bound professionals, the 27-inch iMac with Retina display is a better choice, and most of us here at TidBITS now use that machine.   Make your next move. Make your next website.

Macs & Mac OS X | 04 Apr 2017 | Print  | Comment (4) Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency by Adam C. Engst In an unprecedented move, Apple invited five prominent industry journalists to an on-the-record meeting with top executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus (VP of Hardware Engineering). The writers included John Gruber of Daring Fireball, Matthew Panzarino of TechCrunch, Lance Ulanoff of Mashable, Ina Fried of Axios, and John Paczkowski of BuzzFeed. The topic of discussion? The Mac Pro, why it has taken Apple so long to update it, and Apple’s commitment to the professional market. I’ll say more about that in a moment, but first, let me recommend that you read at least the first two of the articles linked above — Panzarino and Gruber, in particular, did an excellent job of capturing both what was said and the implications of those statements. In short, Apple did something it has never done before — assemble a panel of reporters for an on-the-record talk in which it acknowledged design errors and missteps with the current Mac Pro, pre-announced a new Mac Pro accompanied by a new pro display that won’t ship this year, and admitted that it needs to communicate better with its pro users. No, this isn’t an April Fools prank. In essence, this is Apple arguing with my claims in “Understanding Apple’s Marginalization of the Mac” (21 November 2016) that the iOS platform reigns supreme within the company and conceding the point Josh Centers made about the slippery slope of losing pro customers in “What Apple Can Learn from Airwalk” (6 February 2017). To show how important the Mac remains to Apple, Phil Schiller said that the Mac user base is nearing 100 million users and is a $25 billion business — on its own, it’s nearly a Fortune 100 company. (Also interesting was the statistic that notebooks make up 80 percent of Mac sales, with desktops at 20 percent. It’s not surprising, given the stagnation of the Mac Pro and the Mac mini.) The Apple execs also came right out and said that the Mac and the pro audience were key. Schiller said, “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple, that Apple cares deeply about the Mac, we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac. And if we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that, we’re sorry for that — what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” Craig Federighi chimed in, saying “The Mac is — we say it over and over, we’re saying it again here — a huge part of our future, we’re deeply invested in it.” But the entire point of this meeting was to address the pro reaction to Apple’s lack of either concrete actions or announcements in the past. Gruber asked whether Apple is aware of just how many serious Mac users have begun to doubt the company’s commitment to the Mac in general, and the needs of professional Mac users in particular, eliciting this response from Schiller: It’s a reasonable question, and this is why we’re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We’re committed to the Mac, we‘ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we’ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, the Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers. At the moment, Apple has only words to reassure pro users, since the executives said that a completely redesigned Mac Pro and pro display are coming, but they won’t arrive this year. So communication is essential if pros are to stick with the Mac platform for another eight months minimum. But openness isn’t Apple’s style, so we’ll see if the company continues to share details about the future. Other useful statements that came out of that meeting include: Existing configurations of the current Mac Pro are now available at lower prices (see “Apple Drops Cylindrical Mac Pro Prices by $1000,” 4 April 2017). The redesigned Mac Pro will not include a touchscreen like Microsoft’s Surface Studio. Federighi suggested that Apple’s approach will involve making the iPad Pro work better with the Mac. The iMac is slated to receive some upgrades this year, including configurations targeted specifically at the pro market. Apple had nothing specific to say about the future of the Mac mini, though Schiller did say that was because “it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use.” When Gruber asked about scripting and automation, Federighi replied, “We think scriptability and automation of the system remain super important.”   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment James Bailey   2017-04-04 15:10 Well I'm one of those users who absolutely loves my 2013 6-core Mac Pro. The design is perfect for me as a developer. I can add boatloads of RAM and I have a larger RAID array attached to the thunderbolt 2 bus. I write software for a living and live inside virtual machines all day. This computer is perfect for that use case. So while the design is clearly flawed for future updates, it isn't flawed in conception in my view. I am happy to learn that just about when my 2013 Mac Pro starts feeling a little old and slow, I will be able to upgrade to whatever is next but right now it does everything I need and more. Reply Adam Engst   2017-04-04 15:37 The Apple guys said basically what you just did — that the current Mac Pro was great for some professionals, but that the design wasn't ideal for all pros. Reply Geoff Duncan   2017-04-04 21:16 I'm glad the cylindrical Mac Pro has been useful to some people, James! I do a lot of work in pro audio and a bit of multi-platform software development. I can count the number of cylindical Mac Pros I've seen in the wild on the thumbs of one hand. I see old Mac Pro towers in use all the time. I'm glad Apple said *something* about the state of desktop Macs and is trying to reach out to pro users. As someone for whom iMacs and MacBook Pros don't really work, I can't say I'm excited, though. Reply Greg  2017-04-04 20:50 What about Pro apps? Aperture? FCP? Although from what I hear they've already lost the video/film editing business. Reply  Search   Cached.

So why is it worth more than Ford? Updated by Timothy B. Lee Apr 4, 2017, 2:20pm EDT Presented By tweet share Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Where technology and economics collide Tesla’s stock price surged on Monday, pushing the company’s value above $50 billion for the first time. The markets now value Tesla more highly than Ford at $45 billion. At first glance, that doesn’t make any sense. Ford sold 2.6 million vehicles in 2016 and earned $4.6 billion for the year. Tesla shipped a comparatively tiny 76,000 vehicles and recorded a loss of $675 million. The fact that Tesla stock is worth more than Ford stock is a sign that Wall Street envisions very different trajectories for the two companies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has set aggressive growth goals for his company, aiming to produce 500,000 vehicles in 2018 and close to 1 million vehicles by 2020. But even if Musk meets these targets — and that’s a big if — that still wouldn’t justify valuing Tesla more highly than Ford, which already sells more than 2 million vehicles a year, including hundreds of thousands of highly profitable trucks. So Ford’s market price seems to also be a signal that investors are pessimistic about Ford’s prospects. Many observers expect that over the next decade or two the car industry will shift from human-driven, gasoline-powered cars to software-driven electric vehicles. Car companies believe they’ll be able to navigate this transition gracefully, but Wall Street doesn’t seem to believe it. Wall Street sees Tesla, not classic companies like Ford, as the future of cars. Tesla is aiming to be the Apple of the car business Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images for Vanity Fair To understand what the market might be thinking, it’s worth remembering what happened in the cell phone industry a decade ago. Back in 2007, the cell phone market was dominated by Nokia with 435 million units followed by Motorola with 164 million units. Apple released the first iPhone that year but it sold fewer than 4 million units. So it would have been easy for a naïve analyst at the time to dismiss Apple as a minor player. What that analyst would have missed, of course, was that the nature of cell phones was about to change. The kind of old-fashioned “feature phones” that accounted for the bulk of Nokia’s sales was about to be rendered obsolete by the iPhone and a new wave of Android-based smartphones. Nokia executives weren’t too worried. They didn’t have the iPhone, but they had plenty of engineers and strong relationships with mobile network operators around the world. They assumed they’d be able to build a rival smartphone operating system and be a major player in the smartphone business. But making an iPhone-quality smartphone proved to be harder than they expected, and Nokia was caught flat-footed. Efforts to create its own software floundered, and a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone software failed to gain traction. The company was forced to sell its mobile phone division to Microsoft in 2014 — a humiliating end for a company that once led the cell phone industry. We don’t know if something like this is in the cards for Ford and other conventional automakers, but it would be one way to explain why Tesla is so highly valued compared to Ford. Ford executives think they can easily pivot to making electric, software-driven cars, just as Nokia thought they could adapt to a smartphone world. Apple sells 20 percent of smartphones and earns most of the profits Justin Sullivan/Getty Images One other important lesson from the smartphone world is that profits in a high-tech industry are sometimes much more skewed than market share. Apple sells fewer than 20 percent of the world’s smartphones. But the fact that Apple makes both the hardware and software for the iPhone helps it stand apart in the marketplace, allowing Apple to charge a much bigger premium than its Android-based rivals. The result: Despite the iPhone’s modest market share, Apple’s quarterly profits often dwarf the profits of all other smartphone makers combined. Like Apple, Tesla makes many components of its cars, from batteries to self-driving software, in house. Its roots in Silicon Valley mean that the software on its cars is likely to be better than software produced by a company like Ford — a factor that will become even more important as self-driving technology becomes an important factor in the industry. Like Apple, Tesla has a significant base of ardent fans who follow the company’s every move and are eager to buy the company’s new products. Tesla’s big bet on batteries could pay off handsomely And Tesla is also aiming to duplicate another of Apple’s key strategies: making big investments to lock in its supply of key components. One of Tesla’s big bets is on batteries. Electric cars need a lot of lithium ion batteries, and over the years Tesla has struggled to find suppliers to supply its needs. So a few years ago Tesla broke ground on the Gigafactory, a facility in Nevada that will supply Tesla with batteries on a massive scale. Musk is betting that the Gigafactory will give him a big head start over rivals. He’s hoping economies of scale will make Tesla’s batteries cheaper than those from third parties. And as other car companies rush to build electric cars, they’ll discover there aren’t enough batteries to go around, making it hard for car companies to expand electric car production as quickly as Tesla can. Obviously, it’s too early to say if this theory is right. Musk hasn’t even managed to produce an electric car that’s affordable to normal people — his $35,000 Model 3 is scheduled to begin production later this year. But Tesla’s stock price suggests that Wall Street is optimistic about Tesla’s chances. Was this article helpful? Awesome, share it: tweet share Help us improve.

Apple has also made Mac Pro build-to-order processor and GPU upgrades much more affordable for pro users who need higher-end specs than the base machines provide. Upgrading the new 3.5GHz entry-level 6-core Mac Pro to the 3.0GHz 8-core processor now costs $800, while upgrading to the 2.7GHz 12-core machine costs $2,000. Prior to today, the 8-core upgrade was priced at $1,500, and the 12-core upgrade was priced at $3,000. GPU upgrades are also more affordable. With the 6-core machine, upgrading from the stock dual AMD FirePro D500 to the FirePro D700 now costs $200, an upgrade that was previously priced at $600. The GPU upgrade isn't necessary on the new stock 8-core machine, as it ships with the D700s. RAM and flash storage upgrade pricing has not changed, however. It continues to cost $400 to upgrade to 32GB RAM and $1,200 to upgrade to 64GB RAM. 512GB flash storage is available for $200, and the 1TB flash storage upgrade costs $600. Prices on flash storage were lowered back in October alongside the launch of the new MacBook Pro. All in all, a maxed out Mac Pro machine with a 12-core processor, 64GB RAM, 1TB flash storage, and dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs will now cost $6,999 instead of $9,599. The Mac Pro lineup has not gained any refreshed or updated hardware -- all that's changed is configuration and price. The machines continue to use Ivy Bridge E Xeon processors, dual AMD FirePro GPUs, and Thunderbolt 2. Apple's reconfigured Mac Pros are available starting today from the online Apple Store and Apple retail stores. The 6-core model can be purchased immediately, but the 8-core model is listed as "currently unavailable." Today's price drops come ahead of a promised overhauled Mac Pro that will be introduced sometime after this year. Apple is working on a high-end high-throughput modular Mac Pro system that will facilitate regular upgrades to meet the needs of Apple's pro user base.

All of the non-pro users who simply desire a Mac Pro can complain all they want, but this is a significant price reduction, no matter how you look at it. Apple is certainly on the right track, and it was a great move to offer the price reduction in conjunction with the pre-announcement. Shops that need these machines will be happy with this.

They have made it obvious that they do not want the mac in their lineups. By not upgrading it; sales go down; it gives them reason to put the nail in the coffin. Just get it over already Apple. Everyone is tired of you dragging us along. Put a bullet in the mac line up already; the current lineup is a disgrace. No upgrades, glued parts, insane prices, you can't even plug your flagship product into a new 3k macbook without a freaking adapter. This has all been done intentionally - to slowly kill off your Mac line up because you cannot control the content on Mac. You have tried with your crappy Gatekeeper software (terrible) and it failed. Now, you are trying to kill off the Mac entirely because you can't control the content via the App Store- where you already make most of your $. Long live the classic macbook pro.

No. Because no true "Pro" has time to mess-around finding drivers and haxies to make macOS work on non-Apple hardware. [doublepost=1491331489][/doublepost] The "update" and "price drops" are a joke. It's 3500 euro for the base model, and it's the only model available, and you get no bluetooth 5, no usb-c, no thunderbolt, 3, yes, you can power 5k monitors but there's a tiny catch for that. the ram is still ddr3, we're on ddr5, .. I guess this "magical big re-thinking" just means "2016 hardware" i doubt all these 'todays standards' will be in the future mac pro. This is a stopgap until the next system comes out in 2018, not a design refresh.

Its just a desperate act as Apple notice that the Pro market is slipping and afraid of what impact it may have. THe lack of updates is nothing short of negligence from Apple. THey could have done this almost yearly with very little effort. But at least we got some unusal news, which is good. Though apples time frames can be painful for pro users. I wouldnt buy this Mac Pro unless I was absolutely desperate for new hardware.

The Apple warranty does not apply to damage caused by user fumbling and bumbling. And even if it’s only the screen that breaks, Apple will charge $129 to $149 for the fix. But imagine if, when you dropped your phone, bumpers popped out from each corner to cushion the impact — or even allow the phone to float when it falls into water. Apple has been looking at just such a system, and received a patent for it April 4. The technology is built around sensors such as the accelerometer present in most modern smartphones, which can detect when a device is in “free fall,” according to the patent. “The length of time in free fall may be used to calculate the height and velocity of movement and thus to make a determination whether the device has been dropped or merely set down,” the patent document said. An iPhone equipped with Apple’s patented bumper system for damage and loss prevention (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) When the software determines that the phone has been dropped, out spring the corner bumpers. And these cushions could not only help prevent breakage, but enable flotation. “Devices may sometimes be exposed to elements such as water and may even be dropped into water environments such as a lake, ocean, or even a bathtub or sink within the home,” the document said. Although Apple delicately avoided mentioning the toilet, 39 percent of smartphone owners use their devices in the bathroom, according to Google, and 19 percent of users drop their phones in the toilet, according to online services firm Plaxo. Whatever the body of water, Apple’s technology could reduce the damage, or prevent loss, according to the patent document. “In a situation where the portable electronic device is dropped into water, the user may face a risk not only of irreparably damaging the device due to water ingress, but also of losing the device altogether as these devices will sink,” the document noted. “The shock absorbers may include buoyant material which permits the portable electronic device to float in the event that it is dropped or otherwise exposed to a water environment,” the document said. “By enabling the device to float, this may permit the user time to retrieve the device from the water environment and prevent damage. “In addition, by enabling the device to float, it is prevented from sinking to the bottom of a lake, ocean or other turbid waters where retrieval may be problematic.” The bumpers, once out, could be retracted by the user after recovery of the phone from the ground, floor or toilet. And the corner-cushions could be made fashion forward, or, alternatively, unobtrusive. “Bumper cushions may be colored or otherwise configured in a decorative mode such that they add to the appearance of smartphone or blend into the edge or body of the device.” Of course, patented technologies don’t always end up in consumer products — but when Apple releases the iPhone 8, we’ll certainly be eyeballing the corners.   Main image: A dropped iPhone scenario with a bumper-equipped device (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: Apple, bumpers, cushions, drop, float, iPhone, Patents   More Posts in Big Tech Wolverton: Trump’s signature means no broadband privacy for you April 4, 2017   Report: Apple working on new Mac Pro (finally) April 4, 2017   Yahoo and AOL to get odd new name, questionable logo April 3, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       charlie hustle how about not making it out of glass         Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Apple patents shock absorbers for iPhone that pop out when… Report: Apple working on new Mac Pro (finally) H-1B visa lottery brings truckloads of applications, new… Yahoo and AOL to get odd new name, questionable logo Brain drain?

Read More. @Bershidsky April 4, 2017 11:02 AM EDT a | A By Leonid Bershidsky This year, Android is donning the crown of the world's No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. As an Android user, I don't really mind -- but there are ominous aspects to its growing dominance and a possibility that better technology may not get the recognition it deserves. StatCounter, the web analytics company, reports that Android devices accounted for 37.93 percent of global internet traffic, just ahead of Windows' 37.91 percent. That's remarkable, considering that most people use some version of Windows on computers at work. Given the mobile operating system's momentum as people spend more time on their phones, the scale will soon tip further in Android's favor. On the revenue side, Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, has long been the dominant moneymaker. AppAnnie, a firm that keeps tabs on the app economy, predicts, however, that it will be displaced by Android this year. While Apple's App Store will still collect almost twice as much revenue as the Google Play store, owned by Google's parent Alphabet Inc., third-party Android app stores will make sure that the Google operating system tops iOS. Android, King of the App Universe Annual consumer spending in app stores   Source: App Annie *Forecasts Alphabet doesn't say how much it's making from Android, nor does Apple break out the App Store in its financial reports. Last year, Oracle, which sued Google for copyright infringement, disclosed a number in court: It claimed the Android revenue reached $33 billion between 2008 and 2015. There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google's main business -- ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. That revenue stream, which Apple doesn't have, may well compensate for Alphabet's lack of control over the third-party stores. Android is the ugly duckling of the operating-system world. It's technically open-source and free to use, so device makers like to tweak it. That creates chaos and often lowers the quality of the user experience, which advanced users try to fix by messing with the system themselves. Because of the variety of Android flavors and hardware on which the system runs, updates are intermittent for most users -- those who don't own a Google-branded or co-branded device. Though the general interface design has approved in recent years, it can sometimes feel raw and less convenient than that of Apple's sleek iOS. Many, including myself, like Android because it can be an exciting set of building blocks for a little boy (or girl). That it's winning the operating system race is exciting to those who, like me, have argued that the open-source approach is the most progressive. Besides, Alphabet's push to turn phones into virtual reality devices is an interesting vision for the future of a gadget that's getting harder and harder to improve. But Android's emerging dominance is also worrying for two reasons. One is privacy. The reason Android is free is that Google, Alphabet's main unit, is an advertising company that collects lots of data about users. Given the erosion of privacy protections, I'm not sure Google is the platform on which I'd like to do most of my personal computing. The other problem with Android's ascendancy is that it's not a good operating system for desktops and laptops. The three major operating-system makers -- Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft -- have chosen distinct approaches to handling different kinds of devices. Apple creates a separate system for every device category -- the MacOS for laptops and desktops, the iOS for phones and tablets, and separate systems for wearables and set-top boxes. Alphabet is trying to make a mobile system usable on devices equipped with a hardware keyboard. Android apps run on Chromebooks, and Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 smartphone can be turned into a desktop machine by using a special dock. But many of the apps run in phone size in the middle of a big screen, and many desktop apps to which Windows and Mac users are accustomed are not available for Android. It's an irritating compromise. Microsoft has the most promising approach: It's trying to port its desktop operating system to mobile devices. That its Surface laptop-tablet hybrids run the full version of Windows is a major competitive advantage over competing products using iOS and Android. Microsoft has also tweaked Windows so that it can now run on ARM processors, the architecture used in mobile devices. This appears to be the most promising approach to the seamless use of the same apps across various devices. But Microsoft has botched its smartphone project so badly that even selling phones with the full version of Windows -- which will truly turn the pocket device into a scalable computer -- would probably be an uphill battle.  If Android's dominance keeps growing and Microsoft cannot sell the public on its superior vision, that will mean a victory for suboptimal technology, something I, for one, would be sorry to see.

(Reuters/Robert Galbraith) Share Written by Mike Murphy April 04, 2017 Apple recently convened a small group of journalists at its headquarters to inform them that the Mac Pro, Apple’s powerful trashcan-shaped desktop computer will live. The $3,000-and-up computer, used around the world by videographers and other creative professionals, was first launched as a giant, metallic desktop machine about a decade ago. Its current design was unveiled in 2013 and has not received many significant updates since then. Apple has overhauled its laptop computers in the last year, but didn’t acknowledge its desktop lines, leading to some consternation that they were being neglected, or perhaps even abandoned. But a group of Apple’s top brass, including the head of software Craig Federighi, told reporters (and programmer John Gruber) that a new version of the desktop is in the works. But Apple won’t rush the update. The company is working on an entirely new design for its desktops, as well a new Apple-designed monitor to use with them. (Which may well be welcome news for customers who purchased the LG monitor Apple touted at its last press conference that had to be recalled because they didn’t work near wifi routers.) “You won’t see any of these products this year,” Apple’s marketing director Phil Schiller told Axios. (If you want to read Apple’s intricate plans for these products you won’t be able to buy for quite a while, there’s Mashable.) In the meantime, Apple is introducing more powerful versions of its existing Mac Pro and iMac models today, to tide consumers who can’t wait until at least 2018 to get a new desktop computer. By previewing its plans in this way, Apple apparently chose, for the first time, not to “suffer in silence” any critical reactions it might receive for not updating its Macs over the course of the year. Axios’ Ina Fried characterized Apple executives’ inability to offer substantial updates to its most powerful machine over the last few years—leaving some of its most dedicated users in the lurch for so long—as a “rare admission of a misstep.” Apple’s Mac sales have been surprisingly resilient in recent quarters, especially given the relatively few new models Apple has introduced in the last few years, the company’s insistence that the iPad can replace most laptops, and the global downturn in the PC market. Whether they’ll be as sturdy this year, given Apple is admitting entirely new designs will be released in the future, seems less likely.

Apple – represented by bigwigs Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi and John Ternus – was unusually forthcoming about the shortcomings in its current lineup of Mac Pros and the future of the line. The current edition of the Mac Pro was introduced in 2013. While it scored points for its attractive design and quiet operation, it has largely been panned because of its limited upgradability, inconvenient expansion ports and lack of one central, powerful GPU. In response, Apple is not abandoning its Pro line, as some suspected, but instead it is taking time to completely overhaul its approach. According to Schiller, the next Mac Pro is going to be more modular, easier to update and will be offered alongside a pro display, and is expected to become available sometime in 2018 or later. Apple will also be updating its iMac line with a pro focus.

Apple Confirms New Mac Pro Is Coming By Bryant Frazer / April 4, 2017 Stop me if you’ve heard this one before — Apple says a new Mac Pro is coming. It won’t be here this year. But when it does arrive, Apple promises, it will be completely redesigned, it will be totally geared to pro workflows, and it will be very, very cool. That’s the word, once again, from Apple HQ in Cupertino, where a handful of tech journalists were briefed yesterday about the company’s plans for pro users. As it did way back in 2012, the company acknowledged that existing Mac Pro machines are not keeping up with the demands of pro workflow and promised a new Mac Pro design is in the works, while specifiying that it’s not coming anytime soon. For now, the company announced stopgap performance upgrades to the base configuration of the existing three-year-old Mac Pro design. If you need Mac Pros now, that’ll help. But if you can possibly wait, you certainly should hold out for the new revision, which we can hope to see in 2018. For the complete details, check-out the first-hand reporting from the outlets who were in the room: Axios, BuzzFeed, Daring Fireball, Mashable, and TechCrunch. If you just want the summary, here are the key points from those articles. Don’t look for a new Mac Pro until 2018. Apple Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said redesigning the Mac Pro will “take longer than this year to do.” That probably means 2018 — but Apple avoided specifying a date. The new Mac Pro will have a new pro display to go with it. Apple didn’t specify anything about the display’s resolution or other capabilities, but it’s safe to say 4K will be the baseline for any pro display released in 2018 — with a 5K or even-higher-resolution display probably just as likely from Apple. The current Mac Pro design is just too hot. Apple banked on a dual-GPU configuration built around a central heat sink as a way of dissipating the heat, but couldn’t accommodate more powerful graphics cards in the design. Revamping the current Mac Pro to handle larger single GPUs would have created a heat profile that the architecture couldn’t handle. Pro users have more MacBook Pros and iMacs than Mac Pros. Apple said the Mac Pro is third among pro users, making up less than 10 percent of all Mac sales. Overall, 80 percent of all Macs sold are notebooks, and only 20 percent are desktop systems. (This suggests that the Mac Pro makes up much less than 10 percent of all Mac sales.) As the Mac Pro stagnated, the iMac became the desktop priority. Apple saw the iMac as a priority in order to meet the needs of pro users who didn’t quite need the power of a full-on Mac Pro to handle their workflow. In fact, new iMacs will be coming out later this year in configurations aimed at pros. Apple is sorry. Four of the five stories specifically quote Schiller as using the S-word to describe its failure to satisfy customers who were waiting for an updated Mac Pro.

Will the new iMac ship with Flash storage as standard? Apple will be introducing new iMacs in 2017 with spec bumps that will make them even more attractive to pro users. (Click here to read the latest version of this article.) Talking to journalists in what appears to be a bid to convince pro users that Apple hasn’t forgotten about them, Apple VPs Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi and John Ternus revealed that the company is completely rethinking the Mac Pro with a new design planned for some time in 2018. It was also revealed that because the Mac Pro in its current form hasn’t been meeting the needs of many pro users, some pros have turned to the iMac instead, and as a result Apple intends to provide those users with an update to the iMac designed to suit them later this year. (Read about Apple's plans for a new Mac Pro here). According to journalists from Engadget who were present at the briefing, Federighi revealed that Apple sees the iMac as appealing to a percentage of pro users who find that it is capable enough for them. Those users are probably choosing iMac over Mac Pro because the pace of updates is faster and thanks to increased capability. “So many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by Mac Pro through a next generation iMac,” he said. Apple has put “a lot of our energy behind” this new iMac, according to Federighi. News of Apple's renewed focus on the Mac, with the upcoming new iMac and Mac Pro redesign, will be a relief to those who were thinking that the company had turned its back on the Mac in favour of the iPhone and iPad, which account for much more of its business.  Those users had reason to be concerned. The Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013 (although Apple is now offering a spec bump and a price cut following the news of it's renewed interest in the Mac). Similarly Apple's last iMac update came back in October 2015, when it introduced a Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipped the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. If you want  to buy a new iMac check out these stories: Where to buy iMacs in the UK, our Mac buying guide 2017 and the best cheap iMac deals UK. When will new iMacs be launched in the UK? We know that Apple is planning to release new iMacs later in 2017 but we can only guess when at the moment. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. It certainly doesn't look like they will arrive at a Spring event as it's looking increasingly like Apple won't be holding a Spring event this year. The next plausible event at which the iMac could arrive is WWDC, taking place in early June. You can read about what we expect Apple to show attendees of WWDC here. WWDC would be a good opportunity for Apple to talk to its pro users - or at least those pro users who fit in the developer category (Apple itself has said broad a definition Pro is when it comes to Mac users). Another reason to expect to see an iMac launch at that event is that in previous years Apple has launched new Macs there. In fact it was at WWDC that Apple revealed the design for the Mac Pro back in 2013. Another likely timeframe for the iMac update is September or October 2017. A September launch would coincide with the launch of new iPhones, while in past years Apple has held an October event to launch new Macs and iPads. In fact the last iMac update was in October 2015. What specs can we expect from the new iMac? We know that Apple intends to introduce a new iMac designed for the pro users who have moved away from the Mac Pro. So we can expect a pretty high spec machine. We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. Will the new iMac have a touch screen? There have been calls for Apple to introduce touch screen capabilities to the iMac, but it is looking increasingly unlikely that it will. Phil Schiller was asked about whether Apple would consider adding a  touch screen to the Mac during the journalist briefing at which the plans for a new Mac Pro were revealed. His response: "No". His collegue Craig Federighi suggested that the iPad Pro offers a far better drawing experience. What processor will the new iMac use? Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. In early January, Intel used CES 2017 in Las Vegas to introduce its Kaby Lake processors officially, after announcing low power versions of Kaby Lake processors in August of 2016. The chips shown off in January are powerful enough to be used in Apple's Macs. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might annoy the early buyers. Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. The AMD Zen processor, launched in 2016, boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. At the end of February 2017, in the response to news of a recording-breaking benchmark performance by the new AMD RYZEN 7 1800X processor, Architosh discussed the possibility of Apple switching from Intel to AMD as its Mac chip supplier. The site was particularly interested in AMD's superior power efficiency, something which fits in with Apple's recent philosophy. "Today's current iMac 5K model," the site points out, "uses an Intel 14nm Skylake 4-core i7-6700K processor with a TDP of 91W. Based on the iMac's actual frequency, the TDP is possibly low 80s W range. But AMD's RYZEN 7 1700 is at 65W already and has 8 cores." Architosh even ponders if AMD's recent development work has been geared towards catching Apple's eye: "Is it possible that when AMD decided to work from a clean state four years ago that they began the RYZEN line with the possibility of wooing Apple at some point in the future?" As we said above, switching to AMD processors for the next iMac would be a surprise, but it no longer seems impossible. What Graphics chips will Apple use in the new iMac? It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." Will the new iMac ship with Flash storage as standard? We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives.

Essentially, this is just a pricing adjustment: the former $3,999 model is now the $2,999 base model, while the previously built-to-order 8-core model with dual D700 GPUs is now the high-end stock configuration. The base model Mac Pro with a 3.5GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 processor, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs, and 16GB of RAM is available to purchase now for $2,999 online and at select Apple Stores in the United States, Canada, Europe, and select other regions. Online orders ship in as little as one business day. The higher-end model with a 3.0GHz 8-core Intel Xeon E5 processor, dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs, and 16GB of RAM is listed as "currently unavailable" online, with no purchase button yet. Just moments ago, the model was listed as available in "30 business days," but Apple has removed that timeframe. Today's reshuffling raises the entry-level Mac Pro to a 6-core processor with 16GB of RAM for $2,999, compared to the former base model with a quad-core processor and 12GB of RAM. Likewise, Apple used to sell a high-end 6-core Mac Pro for $3,999, but has today bumped that model to 8-cores for the same price. There are no other hardware changes to either model, but upgrade pricing for built-to-order configurations is now cheaper. Upgrading from 6-core to 8-core or 12-core, for example, used to be $1500 or $3000 respectively, but it is now $800 or $2000 respectively. AMD FirePro graphics upgrades are likewise cheaper. The news came today in a collection of announcements that Apple unveiled to journalists near its headquarters in Cupertino, including a confirmation of new pro-level iMac models coming later in 2017 and a promise that the Mac Mini is still "important." Apple also announced that it is working on a "completely rethought" version of the Mac Pro, as well as a pro display that works with the system, but Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller admitted that "you won't see any of those products this year."

The short answer, nothing really excites me about Apple any more. The current leadership is sucking the life out of Apple at an alarming rate. Apple is deteriorating quicker than most people notice. The only focus they have is how to increase profit margin and milk their loyal base for it, brainwashing them into believing that they are still that same innovative company. They are currently testing the idea that the loyal base will also swallow product refreshes with minimum performance upgrades and removed features and functionality counting on brand power, thinness and aesthetics. They will very soon be in trouble if they continue screwing us over. I am a long-time Apple fan, watching its implosion into a car-salesman-type corporation already considering alternatives. MacBook Pro has been my workhorse since the first generation. The New MBP is an insult that fits into the profit margin approach I described. They stripped it to absolute minimum, hoping to also profit on things sold separately, offer minimum performance upgrades while the 15" model maintains the price of the 17" discontinued model, which had all of those things included. Sure, they are currently reaping benefits from the increased profit margin, but the loyal base and fandom is quickly softening and falling apart, which will eventually cause massive troubles across the board, including profits.

The lovechild of a pedal bin and the Death Star has been untouched by Apple since 2013, but in a roundtable attended by Buzzfeed News , Phil Schiller revealed that the company is "completely rethinking the Mac Pro". "Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There's a team working hard on it right now," he said. Hard, but apparently not that hard: "You won’t see any of these products this year," he added – apparently the team will be taking their time over getting it right. The new system will be planned with the ability to upgrade at its core – something that’s lacking with the unusual design of the existing Mac Pro, at odds with its target demographic: professionals who need the most bang for their buck. That almost certainly means the end of the road for the circular design. As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explained, the design is obviously striking, but tough to work with. "We wanted to do something bold and different," he said. "What we didn't appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailored that design to a specific vision that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in - into a circular shape." pple’s vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus added: "It served its purpose well. It just doesn't have the flexibility we now know we need to have." Whether the next step will be an equally unusual shape (hexagons are underrated) or a return to more conventional computer design will become clear at some point in the next few years. But for now rest assured power users: Apple hasn't forgotten you.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry The pros and cons of an Android-powered world: Leonid Bershidsky The pros and cons of an Android-powered world: Leonid Bershidsky There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google's main business -- ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. By: Bloomberg | Published: April 4, 2017 10:53 PM This year, Android is donning the crown of the world’s No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. (Reuters) This year, Android is donning the crown of the world’s No. 1 operating system, both in terms of the number of devices that use it and the revenue its ecosystem generates. As an Android user, I don’t really mind — but there are ominous aspects to its growing dominance and a possibility that better technology may not get the recognition it deserves. StatCounter, the web analytics company, reports that Android devices accounted for 37.93 percent of global internet traffic, just ahead of Windows’ 37.91 percent. That’s remarkable, considering that most people use some version of Windows on computers at work. Given the mobile operating system’s momentum as people spend more time on their phones, the scale will soon tip further in Android’s favor. On the revenue side, Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, has long been the dominant moneymaker. AppAnnie, a firm that keeps tabs on the app economy, predicts, however, that it will be displaced by Android this year. While Apple’s App Store will still collect almost twice as much revenue as the Google Play store, owned by Google’s parent Alphabet Inc., third-party Android app stores will make sure that the Google operating system tops iOS. Alphabet doesn’t say how much it’s making from Android, nor does Apple break out the App Store in its financial reports. Last year, Oracle, which sued Google for copyright infringement, disclosed a number in court: It claimed the Android revenue reached $33 billion between 2008 and 2015. There is no comparable number for Apple, but Android has a certain business model advantage: Part of the revenue comes from Google’s main business — ads shown to users in the Google apps that come with Android. That revenue stream, which Apple doesn’t have, may well compensate for Alphabet’s lack of control over the third-party stores. Also Watch: Android is the ugly duckling of the operating-system world. It’s technically open-source and free to use, so device makers like to tweak it. That creates chaos and often lowers the quality of the user experience, which advanced users try to fix by messing with the system themselves. Because of the variety of Android flavors and hardware on which the system runs, updates are intermittent for most users — those who don’t own a Google-branded or co-branded device. Though the general interface design has approved in recent years, it can sometimes feel raw and less convenient than that of Apple’s sleek iOS. Many, including myself, like Android because it can be an exciting set of building blocks for a little boy (or girl). That it’s winning the operating system race is exciting to those who, like me, have argued that the open-source approach is the most progressive. Besides, Alphabet’s push to turn phones into virtual reality devices is an interesting vision for the future of a gadget that’s getting harder and harder to improve. But Android’s emerging dominance is also worrying for two reasons. One is privacy. The reason Android is free is that Google, Alphabet’s main unit, is an advertising company that collects lots of data about users. Given the erosion of privacy protections, I’m not sure Google is the platform on which I’d like to do most of my personal computing. The other problem with Android’s ascendancy is that it’s not a good operating system for desktops and laptops. The three major operating-system makers — Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft — have chosen distinct approaches to handling different kinds of devices. Apple creates a separate system for every device category — the MacOS for laptops and desktops, the iOS for phones and tablets, and separate systems for wearables and set-top boxes. Also Watch: Alphabet is trying to make a mobile system usable on devices equipped with a hardware keyboard. Android apps run on Chromebooks, and Samsung’s latest Galaxy S8 smartphone can be turned into a desktop machine by using a special dock. But many of the apps run in phone size in the middle of a big screen, and many desktop apps to which Windows and Mac users are accustomed are not available for Android. It’s an irritating compromise. Microsoft has the most promising approach: It’s trying to port its desktop operating system to mobile devices. That its Surface laptop-tablet hybrids run the full version of Windows is a major competitive advantage over competing products using iOS and Android. Microsoft has also tweaked Windows so that it can now run on ARM processors, the architecture used in mobile devices. This appears to be the most promising approach to the seamless use of the same apps across various devices. But Microsoft has botched its smartphone project so badly that even selling phones with the full version of Windows — which will truly turn the pocket device into a scalable computer — would probably be an uphill battle. If Android’s dominance keeps growing and Microsoft cannot sell the public on its superior vision, that will mean a victory for suboptimal technology, something I, for one, would be sorry to see. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

It’s been reported that hackers could infect your handset by sending you a song, but don’t worry. Apple has already killed that vulnerability. cocoparisienne / Pixabay How could a song hack your iPhone? This bug, defined as a memory corruption flaw, was disclosed by an anonymous hacker working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI). Apart from the iPhone, this bug could affect the Apple TV and watchOS as well. With iOS 10.3, Apple fixed two vulnerabilities that allowed malware to run as soon as an audio file is played on the handset. The company used “improved input validation” to address the issue, according to Forbes. This vulnerability is quite similar to the one discovered in Google’s Android operating system in 2015. At that time, researchers found that they could put an exploit code in MP3s and MP4s. This time, the issue is with MP4s which were used by the anonymous hacker to breach Apple’s security. A lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data on iOS supported the bug. This was not the only vulnerability that Apple patched with iOS 10.3. A weakness that could have allowed a hacker to send malicious code on the phone’s Wi-Fi chip was also addressed last week, notes Forbes. Apart from these, Apple also patched 82 other vulnerabilities with iOS 8.3. The most noticeable was one in which a hack just required a user to view a JPEG image. This vulnerability was again revealed by an anonymous researcher via the Zero Day Initiative. What else has been fixed in iOS 10.3? Apple’s latest update also fixes a vulnerability that allowed hackers to control a user’s web browser and then demand a ransom from the user in return for giving them back control of their device, according to ArsTechnica. Explaining how the hackers were able to trick users into handing over a ransom fee, security firm Lookout said, “The scammers abused the handling of pop-up dialogs in Mobile Safari in such a way that it would lock out a victim from using the browser.” The hackers would block then block the Safari browser until the user paid ransom in the form of an iTunes Gift Card. “During the lockout, the attackers displayed threatening messaging in an attempt to scare and coerce victims into paying,” the security firm said in a blog post. To make sure that your iPhone is protected against these hacks, head to Settings > General > Software Update. If you are downloading the latest iOS 10.3, you also get the new and encrypted Apple File System (APFS). This, according to Forbes, will make it harder for hackers and police to extract data from iPhones. Along with the security fixes, iOS 10.3 comes with new features. Siri can now be used to check statuses, pay bills and book a ride. The voice assistant can also be used check the fuel level in a car, turn on the headlights and activate the horn.

But then it’s not supposed to be exciting, and that doesn’t mean it’s not a compelling device. Like the iPhone SE before it, Apple’s latest tablet is an iterative update designed to appeal to a specific subset of consumers. With its simpler name — iPad succeeds the iPad Air 2 as the company’s mainline tablet offering — and with a more affordable price tag, it’s a device that’s designed to appeal to first-time iPad buyers or those looking to upgrade from one of Apple’s older tablets and the education market. In attempting to capture the attention of those consumers, Apple’s newest iPad is mostly a success. Let’s take a look. Design, build quality and internals At first glance, the 2017 iPad looks exactly like the device it replaces, and for the most part, the two devices are identical. Measuring in at 9.4 x 6.6 x 0.29 inches, the iPad shares a similar footprint as the iPad Air 2. However, at 469g, it does weigh a touch more than its predecessor. Without access to an iPad Air 2, I wasn’t able to confirm whether cases that were designed for the iPad Air 2 will fit the new iPad. However, judging from pictures of the iPad Air 2, form-fitting cases designed to fit Apple’s previous tablet will also fit iPad, though some of the cutaways designed to give quick access to iPad’s physical buttons may not align perfectly. If you’re coming from an older iPad, you’ll notice one minor physical difference between the new iPad and some of its older siblings. Like the iPad Pro and the refreshed iPad mini 4, the 2017 iPad does not feature the physical mute switch found on older iPad models. To mute the new iPad, users need to either hold both the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously or pull up iOS 10’s Action Center and tap the relevant button. In the former case, more often than not it takes a second or two before the iPad registers the user’s intention. However, the biggest external change between the iPad Air 2 and 2017 iPad is that the new iPad does not feature a fully laminated screen or any type of anti-reflective display coating, two features found on every other iPad model currently manufactured by Apple. If you’ve never used an iPad with a laminated screen, then you’ll be hard pressed to notice what it brings to the experience of using one of Apple’s tablets. Without a laminated display, there’s a subtle bend when you press your finger against the screen and it emits a hollow sound when tapped. It still feels great to use the new iPad, though some might feel like something is missing if they’ve used other versions of Apple’s tablet before. “Without a laminated display, there’s a subtle bend when you press your finger against the screen and it emits a hollow sound when tapped.”  Meanwhile, The loss of any type of anti-reflective is something of a non-issue. While glare is still apparent when viewing the new iPad’s screen outside, its display is 500 nits brighter than the screen featured in its predecessor, making it easy to read in all but the sunniest conditions. I’ll also note here that screen resolution remains unchanged from the iPad Air 2’s 2048 x 1536 pixel Retina display. The display also doesn’t feature the True Tone technology found on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, nor does it feature its wide colour gamut display. One other welcome change is a bigger battery, with the iPad featuring a 32.4 Wh power cell. However, like every iPad ever released, Apple promises 10 hours of continuous video playback. In my short time with the device, I got a little more than 10 hours watching movies on Netflix, browsing the internet and using apps like Tweetbot and Lightroom. Screen aside, this is an evolution of the same well-built tablet Apple has offered to customers since 2010. Even as Apple’s most affordable mainline product, the 2017 iPad feels exceptionally made. At launch, iPad is available in ‘Silver,’ ‘Space Gray’ and ‘Gold.’ Unfortunately, like with the iPad Air 2, there’s no Rose Gold option for those who want it. Performance The 2017 iPad’s marquee addition is the new A9 processor. While I’m usually not one for benchmarks, in the case of the iPad and its A9 chipset, I’ve decided to include several Geekbench comparisons to help illustrate how the A9 compares to the iPad Air 2’s A8X and the iPad Pro’s A9X. After putting it through the benchmarking tool, the iPad’s two core A9 processor earned a 2410 single-core score and 4095 multi-core score. By contrast, the iPad Air 2’s three core A8X processor received a 1825 single-core score and a 4397 multi-core score. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro, beating both the iPad and iPad Air 2, scored 3085 and 5240, respectively. Therefore, depending on the situation the iPad Pro A9X chip can deliver between 17 and 25 percent better processor performance. In practice, I never found the iPad lacking in the performance department. It handled everything I threw at it with ease and iOS 10 always felt responsive. Those coming from an older iPad like the iPad 2 will appreciate just how smooth using the new iPad feels. That said, if you’re looking for reasons to get the iPad Pro instead, it will theoretically deliver about 20 percent better performance depending on the task. Conversely, if you’re currently own an iPad Air 2, you should skip the new iPad, as the former actually delivers better performance in certain scenarios due to its three core design. For everyone else, the new iPad will be a meaningful update, in part because their current device might not even allow them to take advantage of iOS’s iPad multi-tasking features. Software The 2017 iPad comes with iOS 10.3 preinstalled. While a meaningful update for iPhone, iOS 10 was less of a milestone for iPad owners thanks to the fact that not a single one of Apple’s tablets currently supports 3D Touch. Starting with iOS 9 and continuing more explicitly with iOS 10, Apple has built much of the iPhone’s most useful time-saving functionality around 3D Touch. Unfortunately, those shortcuts aren’t available to iPad owners. With iOS 10 on the iPad, there’s always more busy work than there is on the iPhone. For example, something as simple as clearing the pulldown notification pane can take several extra taps because the user can’t press down on the ‘Clear’ icon to bring up the clear all notifications command. Similarly, users can’t press down on the Setting app icon to jump straight to the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and battery settings. The fact that this functionality is missing doesn’t make the iPad unusable by any means, but it does feel like it could be more efficient. Another issue is that iOS 10’s iPad multi-tasking features still don’t feel particularly elegant or polished. Changing how apps are displayed within iOS 10’s split-screen mode is one particular annoyance. To make an app that was launched using iOS’s Slide Over panel the primary app on the screen requires the user to first pull the divider that appears when two apps are running side by side all the way to the right and then pull out the Slide Over panel again to launch a new app. Neither of these two issues make the iPad usable, but they’re issues that have been with Apple’s tablet since the start. Seven years after it first came out, it still feels like software is the main issue holding Apple’s tablet platform from being something more than a platform primarily designed for consuming content. To be fair, this particular iPad was never going to solve that issue, but every time I come back to try a new iPad, it feels like the platform is an update of iOS (or melding of operating systems) away from real greatness. Of course, if you’re in the market for a simple and approachable software experience, then the flaws I mention above will seem more like positives. Conclusion One other thing to point out is that the new iPad does not include the Smart Connecter found on Apple's two current iPad Pro models. As such, it is incompatible with the company's Smart Keyboard attachment. As a result of this, those that want to use this device as a two-in-one will need to take the extra step of finding a decent Bluetooth- or Lightning-capable keyboard to use iPad as a laptop replacement. In Canada, the 32GB iPad starts at $449 CAD. For the sake of comparison, the iPad Air launched at $549 when it first came to Canada, though by the end of its lifecycle it was possible to find one for $499 or less. In a lot of ways, this is the new iPad's greatest strength. For what it offers, one of the best pure tablet experiences available on the market, the new iPad is an easy device to recommend, especially if the iPad Pro's more premium features don't seem like they're worth it to you. Buy one for a loved one and they'll likely appreciate it for years to come, which is more than you can say about most devices released today. "Like the iPhone SE before it, Apple's latest tablet is an iterative update designed to appeal to a specific subset of consumers."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   8/10 Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Reddit Related Articles News Mar 16, 2017 3:29 PM EDT Marshmallow and Nougat rollout of Assistant doesn’t include tablets, Google confirms News Dec 8, 2016 4:14 PM EDT Fido slashes price of iPad Air 2 by $200 on Easy Pay News Jan 24, 2017 11:05 AM EDT Detachable Chrome OS tablets with Android app compatibility could be in the works News Mar 21, 2017 8:59 AM EDT Apple announces updated 9.7-inch iPad, starts at $449 CAD [Update: now available] Comments fred the biggest flaw is the amount of RAM, otherwise great tablet Brad Fortin The RAM seems fine for most casual users. Power users should opt for the iPad Pro with 4 GB if they need more RAM (after all, iOS is very RAM-efficient). Can’t Fix Stupid Basically if you’ve got an IPad Air 2 released in 2014, there little reason to get this. Even the original iPad Air still holds up pretty well to this. The biggest improvement here is the price. It gets the 9.7″ iPad back down to a price that people are more comfortable with and does away with the 16gb for the base model. 32gb is much more usable. The Air 2 and the Pros had climbed too high off the back of the strong USD and Apple simply charging more. At $449 there is clowns still trying to sell iPad 4, Air and Air 2’s at a higher price used! Bottom line I think this will get Apples 9.7″ segment going again.

By Rob Enderle April 04, 2017 Ford got a wake-up call yesterday morning; Tesla just passed Ford in valuation, making Tesla, on paper, with only two cars, more valuable than all of Ford with all of its truck and car lines.  This is pretty amazing if you think about it because Tesla is unprofitable while Ford is having one of its most profitable years in its long history. Tesla has sold 76K cars vs. Ford’s millions of cars and trucks, and Tesla has issues selling in most states while Ford is a successful multi-national.   What is really strange is Tesla basically lives on word of mouth and does very little marketing, while Ford runs expensive multi-national ad campaigns (some are damned good).  I’m thinking Ford’s CMO may have some explaining to do…   However, the stock market is largely about people who invest in the future, and clearly investors think that Tesla is the car equivalent of Apple, while Ford is more like Sony (or the company that made the Flintstones car) despite Ford’s massively better sales performance.  And, to be fair, Tesla was largely designed after Apple, while Ford still has its roots in an organizational structure closer to how things were in the 1940s rather than how they are now with leading tech companies today. Cars are quickly becoming rolling computers, but Ford hasn’t caught onto that yet. To address what is a massive technological and perception problem, Ford increased its engagement with Blackberry and dropped a billion dollars into Argo AI, which uses engineers from both Alphabet (Google’s less famous new name) and Uber.   Will this be enough to hold off Tesla?  In a word, no.  (Granted, Tesla could still self-destruct, but betting against Elon Musk has been a bad bet so far, even with the leaked set of Tesla options).  It is a start, but Ford likely should be thinking about creating a Skunk Works project if it wants to hold off the inevitable because Tesla is only the tip of the iceberg with regard to what is coming.   Argo AI and Blackberry Both Argo AI and its massively increased investment in Blackberry engineers can move the ball significantly when it comes to creating a car that is smarter.  It should allow Ford to quickly move farther by adopting what both firms have already created rather than having to either reverse engineer what already exists or start from scratch.  However, neither of these entities are embedded into the Ford culture, and the related engineers will likely be seen as encroaching outsiders overruled when it comes to advancing Ford’s products by those that have been with the firm longer and are more deeply entrenched in Ford’s culture.   Just learning the politics of getting a car through Ford’s development process will slow down the impact of these new groups and, worse, the external image that is driving the low valuation will be more closely tied to products that entered the design cycle a decade ago than it will be tied to products Ford will be bringing to market three to five years from now. (What is likely driving Tesla’s valuation is the Model 3, a small SUV and sports car, not its existing lines).   In short, what Ford needs is a mechanism to not only drive significant change short term but to convince investors that they’ll have something in market equal to or better than Tesla’s new products when they arrive without damaging sales of current offerings.   To get there, these technology investments and related efforts have to look like they are driving change, not having to drag Ford’s culture kicking and screaming towards it.  Skunk Works Skunk Works was a term created to describe a unique entity created by Lockheed Martin to get around its own inability to drive rapid advancement through its existing factories.  Most of the truly advanced planes out of Lockheed have come from this effort, which consists of a separate group with high autonomy, tasked with driving change and not held back by existing process or policy. Even though the efforts aren’t always called “Skunk Works,” the practice has been widely used in a variety of industries to create unique products and move aggressively on market opportunities.  There have been a wide variety of products that have come from Skunk Works-like efforts.  The iPod came from outside of Apple, the original Apple Mac was a Skunk Works effort, the Sony PlayStation was done by a very independent working group, and the practice remains popular with even major retailers using this method as a way to advance their companies.  Now, Ford does have a relatively independent lab in Palo Alto working on efforts like this, but there is as of yet no indication that that this lab has the independence necessary to productize what it comes up with.  Microsoft had some similar efforts, and the Xbox was created as a result of one of those efforts. However, two other efforts— one would have given Microsoft the 3D lead on the Web, and the other would have created a timely competitor to the iPad— were both killed by internal politics. And the death of the last took the related lab with it, showcasing how important it is for these teams to have the independence and authority to overcome entropy and execute.   Wrapping Up Ford basically created the U.S. auto market with the Model-T, but its ability to innovate drifted back after a failed effort to create flying cars decades ago. Today, Ford is mostly known for leadership in pickup trucks. Even GM, a company known for being very slow moving, appears to be more cutting edge with its Bolt, and particularly its Volt offerings, and GM likely isn’t moving fast enough either. Ford’s Palo Alto Lab, Blackberry and Argo AI partnerships could make the difference, but only if it can execute like a fully capable Skunk Works project; if it doesn’t, then we’ll be talking about how the company missed the future in a few short years.    If you’d like to learn more about AI, be sure to check out TMC and Crossfire Media’s newest conference and expo, Communications 20/20, happening July 18-20 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The event will focus on the next wave of technology and innovations that will transcend the importance of person to person contact, disrupting the future of the entire communications industry. Find out more HERE.

By Alistair Charlton April 4, 2017 15:10 BST Apple's marketing head Phil Schiller introduces the Mac Pro in June, 2013Reuters In a rare admission of guilt, Apple has conceded that it 'designed itself into a corner' with the current Mac Pro, which arrived on a bullish wave of self-confidence in 2013 but has barely been updated since. During an equally rare roundtable interview with members of the press, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineer, Craig Federighi, said: "We designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will....[and] it became fairly difficult to adjust [to allow for more powerful processors emitting more heat]. " That bold new look meant the Mac Pro was a computer arranged around a triangular heatsink and slotted into a cylindrical case. Air flow was managed beautifully and the computer looked striking and unique, but the design meant updating components was impossible – even for Apple, never mind DIY-savvy buyers. As a result, the bold "can't innovate? My ass!" war cry of Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller at the launch of the Mac Pro became a running joke. It has now been over 1,200 days since the last Mac pro update compared to an average of 449 days since the product line first arrived in 2006. Also speaking at the roundtable, and reported by Buzzfeed News, Schiller said: "We are completely rethinking the Mac Pro. Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There's a team working hard on it right now." But, as promising as that sounds, it will be 2018 before we see the fruits of the labour. "You won't see any of these products this year," Schiller said, adding that the team assigned to the project have been told to take as long as they need to get the new Mac Pro right, and not repeat the same style-over-substance mistakes again. Referring back to the current Pro's shape, Federighi added: "What we didn't appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailored that design to a specific vision that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in – into a circular shape." Neither said what the next Mac Pro would look like, but it seems likely that it will be less compact and ditch the cylindrical design, but without taking up as much space as the boxy (but easily upgradeable, even by customers) original. Schiller said: "We made something bold that we thought would be great...and what we discovered is that it was great for some and not others – enough so, that we realised we had to take another path...and look for the next answer." According to Apple blogger John Gruber, who was also at the roundtable, Schiller didn't say 'mistake', but did issue a rare apology. "The current Mac Pro, as we've said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we're sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we've asked the team to go and re-architect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It'll meet more of those needs."

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Apple Is Completely Rethinking The Mac Pro And Pro Display Posted: Apr 4 2017, 11:08am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Apple   Apple Announces Complete Update of Apple Mac Pro Plans new iMac for This Year   Apple experts say that they are completely rethinking the Mac Pro based on professional feedback to make it more pro customer Apple customers might have complained somewhere in frustration that the company has not made any revisions to the Mac Pro after the year 2013. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com The same model has been in the market for almost four years now and while the company might have been making innovative changes with other products, Ma Pro remained wanting for attention.  Fret no more because Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller has news for the Apple customers around the world. During a round table conference with a handful of journalists at Apple’s Machine Shop hardware prototyping lab, Schiller revealed in an interview to BuzzFeed that the company is currently invested in rethinking the whole Mac Pro. He revealed that the company is not only working on the computer but also the modular system. He said that they are also working on pro display.  “We are completely rethinking the Mac Pro,” Phil Schiller said during a recent roundtable with a handful of reporters at the company’s Machine Shop hardware prototyping lab. And it won't just be the computer. “Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now.” Schiller said that they will also release pro models of the iMac. In a statement, he said that Apple is going to be making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind. “We have big plans for the iMac,” said Phil Schiller. “We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind.” Schiller admitted that they had previously designed their way into a corner in efforts to be bold and different at the time. He said that they are designing the new iMac and pro display based on the customer feedback.  According to The Verge, he said that while they had been keen on releasing the Touch Bar with Mac Pro in 2013, it hardly seems to be on top of the list of priorities for users. Instead, emphasis was given to poor battery life, limited storage and lack of USB ports. Schiller said that they are going to design the new model without the touchscreen feature and concentrate on solving the currently recurrent issues in the new model of Mac Pro and pro display which will not be available until next year.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Apple Is Looking To Develop Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip Technology Game Changers! Apple Is Looking To Develop Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip Technology By Jesse James on 4 April,2017 Tweet Pin It The good folks over at Apple are back in the news, announcing some big new plans for the future. Yesterday the word came down that Apple Is Looking To Develop Its Own iPhone Graphics Chip Technology. This marks an interesting change for the brand as they plan to stop licensing its graphics chips to British firm Imagination Technologies. Apple is looking to introduce the new technology into next year’s iPhone, though Imagination seems doubtful of such a move without using Imagination’s intellectual property. Imagination Technologies issued a statement that reads: “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination, but Apple has declined to provide it.” It goes on to state that: “Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions.” Speak your thoughts on this interesting news in the comments and let us know your thoughts.

And Nick Murray, an YouTuber who spends quite a lot of his time behind the wheel of a 991.2 Carrera 4S, has plenty of answers for us. In his latest clip, the vlogger talks about the infotainment system on his Neunelfer, focusing on the Apple CarPlay bits. This is the point where we should probably list the most important points the Porschephile makes, but we'll start by telling you that the video does provide a relatively reasonable explanation for the retro Machintosh riding shotgun in Nick's 911. Nick lists at least three important quirks of the AppleCar play in his Porsche and, fortunately, none of these seems to be critical. Of course, the man also talks about the assets of the system, which are enough to make any Apple or Porsche fan to rub his/her hands in excitment. We are now about one year and a half away from the moment when we came across the (unofficial) news on Porsche refusing to introduce Android Auto in its vehicle due to Google reportedly asking for too much data. While the tech giant has denied the news, we have yet to see any change in the carmaker's decision. No fresh info on the topic seems to have surfaced meanwhile, so those willing to mix Google infotainment with the Porsche crest still have to turn to various compromises in order to do so. Who knows? Perhaps Google and Porsche will sort things out before the German automaker gets to complete the development of the next-generation 911, which has already been spotted testing in Carrera, Cabriolet and Turbo guise.

Michael Gleissner, whose companies have filed a number of questionable trademarks, has been ordered by UK’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to pay Apple £38,085 as a result of a dispute. Three Gleissner-connected companies filed to revoke 68 Apple trademarks covering terms such as iPhone and iPad. Apple argued that the cancellation petitions should be struck as an abuse of process. Apple said that the cancellation proceedings were prompted by Apple’s defense in another action a Gleissner company brought. Bigfoot Internet Ventures Pte. Ltd filed to revoke Apple’s “Sherlock” trademark for non-use. The IPO agreed, with a panelist writing, “I am satisfied that the real purpose of the revocation applications is to coerce Apple to surrender or assign its SHERLOCK registrations…” and “I find that the applications for revocation were brought for an ulterior purpose without which these proceedings would not have been commenced.” The IPO Registrar has now ordered Gleissner and three of his connected firms to pay a total of £38,085 to cover costs associated with the dispute. He can appeal the decision. (Hat tip: George Kirikos) Tweet Email Learn more...

Reply JohnUK says April 4, 2017 at 1:05 pm The “Judgement” of the IPO makes interesting reading but also reminds me that the whole “system” IS geared to being biased, it appears anyway, to large Corporates to the detriment of the “man on the street” . Even the IPO said to me ” whether you are granted a Trade Mark may be dependent on how hard you persist” !! . In other words if you are a large company you can often get a trade mark that the ordinary person would not be granted. For this reason I side with Michael Gleissner despite his losing this application/hearing.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile iPhone 8 said to feature the iPad Pro’s revolutionary display tech Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 31st, 2017 at 11:04 PM Share Tweet A new research note from analysts at Barclays reveals that Apple’s 2017 lineup will feature True Tone display technology. Originally introduced as a feature exclusive to the iPad Pro, Apple boasts that the technology takes advantage of four-channel ambient light sensors “to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment.” The end result is a display with more natural color tones, making for a more comfortable viewing experience in the process. Don't Miss: Using my iPhone for the next six months is really, really going to suck Barclays’ research note, originally obtained via MacRumors, reads in part: For the expected iPhone 7S models, as well as the iPhone 8, we think ams’s content increases due to the inclusion of its full spectral sensing ambient light sensor, as already seen in the iPad Pro for that device’s True Color screen functionality. We estimate this to be a material step-up in content from the $0.60 range to $1.00. Coupled with the edge to edge OLED display that will reportedly grace the iPhone 8, Apple’s flagship iPhone 8 this year will assuredly boast the most advanced display we’ve seen to date from Apple’s venerable iPhone. All the same, don’t expect the iPhone 8 to feature a curved display a’la the Samsung Galaxy S8. As we noted earlier today, Apple’s next-gen iPhone may feature a slight curve but won’t come close to matching what Samsung pulled off with its S8 lineup. Display technology aside, Apple’s iPhone 8 is shaping up to be a monster of a device that will undoubtedly usher in the most dramatic iPhone upgrade cycle we’ve seen to date. Some of the device’s rumored features include wireless charging, a blazing fast A11 processor, improved water and dust resistance, and much improved battery life. What’s more, the iPhone 8 will reportedly include a number of advanced 3D cameras that will presumably be used for facial recognition and augmented reality purposes. As far as storage is concerned, Apple with the iPhone 8 will finally start giving users more bang for their buck with 64GB said to be the storage option on the entry level model.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed ‘Siri, please dial 999 and save Mummy’s life’ 28 Mar 2017 6 Apple, iOS, Law & order, Mobile Post navigation Previous: India extends ‘Orwellian’ ID card scheme as critics warn of risks Next: eBay to ‘downgrade’ verification by switching to SMS by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit London’s Metropolitan Police have released a recording of an emergency call made by a four-year-old boy that saved his mother’s life. The boy, who identified himself as Roman, told the emergency service call handler that his mother was dead. She was, in fact, unconscious, lying on the floor. To make the call, Roman had unlocked his mother’s mobile phone by pressing her thumb to it. Then, he used Apple’s Siri voice assistant to ask for help. Siri dialed 999: the British emergency number. Police were dispatched after the call handler stayed on the phone talking with Roman long enough to piece together his address in Kenley, south London. They arrived 13 minutes after the call and forced their way in to find Roman and his two brothers inside with their mother, who was lying unconscious on the floor. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Paramedics were able to give what the Met’s Command and Control Unit (MetCC) called life-saving first aid to the woman. She regained consciousness, after which she was taken to the hospital. Police released this audio of the call in the hope that people teach their kids what their home address is and how to call police or emergency services in an emergency: Chief Superintendent Ade Adelekan, from the MetCC, where 999 calls are handled: If you do nothing else today, then I’d implore any parents of young children to sit down with them and make sure they know what to do in this kind of situation and that they know how to contact police or other emergency services in an emergency. As this case demonstrates so poignantly, it could really be the difference between life and death. It’s an amazing story, and thanks to his quick thinking and by asking Siri for help, this little boy saved his mum’s life, and it means she is still here and can be extremely proud of him and his brothers. It is an amazing story, but it’s not the first of its kind. In June last year, an Australian mother, rushing to the nursery when a baby monitor showed her one-year-old had stopped breathing, dropped her phone while she was turning on the light. She still managed to tell Siri to call for help while she performed CPR. Both she and her husband credited the few precious seconds that Siri gave them for potentially making all the difference. The outcome of that particular story is one of the upsides of the fact that recent iPhones can be set to always be listening for commands. That new feature came about in iOS 9, when Apple enabled activation of the built-in personal assistant at the sound of your voice, rather than waiting for you to hold down the Home button. If that’s turned on, Siri can not only open music and send text messages; it can also make hands-free phone calls on its own while you drive, or, obviously, in critical situations like that faced by the Australian family last year. Note that Siri in hands-free mode only works on newer models when not plugged in to a power source. Older models – at least back to 5s – need to be plugged in to a power source to enable Siri to work in hands-free mode. Other phone brands can also be set up for hands-free voice assistance, of course. This story illustrates one good reason to activate the feature. But your kids don’t need to know all that. What they should know, as the MetCC said, is their home address. Another part of their training should be how to unlock a phone and how to summon help – be it through a voice assistant or pressing an emergency services number like 999 or 911. Roman’s mother is probably thanking her lucky stars that Roman knew how to do just that.

I would add that it should be dependent on the battery status of the phone though. If you have barely enough battery left to make the call it wouldn’t be very helpful if collecting the GPS of your location drains what’s left of your battery. Reply TenguTech says: March 28, 2017 at 9:21 pm You can dial an emergency number on iPhones (and I expect most other phones) without unlocking them. On an iPhone the screen screen where you enter your pin has an ‘Emergency’ button. Press this and you can enter the emergency phone number. Reply Brian T.

On the locked home screen when I swipe the call button, it asks for a fingerprint or password then has “EMERGENCY CALL” button you can push. Once pushed, it lists four emergency contacts that I set up, a number pad to call 911, and an icon for emergency medical information. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

At the time of its launch, the Mac Pro was a major redesign of the most powerful machine Apple made - a small black cylinder that was designed to cool itself while making minimal noise However, Apple has now said it may have restricted itself in the way it designed the Pro, limiting what it could ever do to replace the machine. 'I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will,' Mr Federighi said, adding that the Mac Pro's set-up then became 'fairly difficult to adjust'. Mr Schiller added that Apple was 'sorry to disappoint' Mac Pro customers who wanted more regular updates to the computer, adding that it was now working on creating 'something great' to be released in the future.  LATEST RUMORS ON THE IPHONE 8 Sources told Nikkei Asian Review that Apple has ordered 70 million OLED displays from Samsung. It is said that Apple believes the iPhone 8 will 'fly off the shelves'. Apple is set to release three phones for the iPhone 8 family – and the premium could cost more than $1,000, as it is said to be fitted with a curved OLED 5.2 inch screen. The other two will measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches, and have a liquid crystal display. Sources also said all three handsets will be designed with wireless charging functions – if suppliers can solve the overheating issues with the technology. And it is said that the trio will also be waterproof. The person also noted that one of the smartphones will have a 3D sensor that lets users access it through facial recognition technology. Only the handset over $1,000 will not have the feature, the person said.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 40 shares Most watched News videos What happened when we sent a female reporter to catcall men?

The company has been quiet about this product for so long that many had started thinking that perhaps Apple was going to discontinue it. However, that’s not going to be the case. Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller has confirmed today that the Mac mini remains an “important” product for the company which essentially means that Apple isn’t going to discontinue it anytime soon. He revealed this in a press briefing earlier today in which more details were also revealed about the company’s plans for the Mac Pro and iMac. Calling the Mac mini an important product in Apple’s lineup, he said that Apple wasn’t bringing it up “because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use.” He added that the Mac mini will remain a product in Apple’s lineup but the company has nothing more to say about this product today. Apple last refreshed the Mac mini back in 2014 and it remains the cheapest Mac in its lineup. Schiller’s comments today suggest that the company is open to the idea of refreshing the Mac mini at some point down the line. However, there’s no news right now on what the company is planning on doing next with this product. If it’s going to get a major overhaul of whether Apple is only going to refresh the specs. We’ll have to wait to find out for sure. Apple has confirmed today that an entirely new Mac Pro will be out next year and that it’s going to launch iMac configurations aimed at pro consumers later this year. Filed in Apple >Computers.

Update: Apple No Longer Supports the iOS 8 to iOS 7 Downgrade Apple normally does not allow users to downgrade from iOS 8 to iOS 7, but for a very small period of time Apple servers will verify the update with iOS 7.1.2 or iOS 8. Apple no longer allows this manual method to downgrade from iOS 8. This was a great option for iPhone 4S users who discovered the iOS 8 performance is not up to their needs. You can downgrade from IOS 8 to iOS 7 for a limited time. Another user who might like this is an iOS 7 jailbreak user who tried iOS 8 thanks to the new features, but decided they couldn’t use their iPhone without a jailbreak. The iOS 8 jailbreak is likely far off, so if you need a jailbreak to happily use your phone don’t delay, downgrade today. Before you start the iOS 8 downgrade to iOS 7 you need to visit this page to see if Apple is still signing the iOS 7.1.2 update. Once Apple stops signing the iOS 7.1.2 update for your device there is no way to downgrade unless you saved blobs long ago on an iPad 2. For everyone else find your iPhone or iPad on this page and make sure the iOS 7.1.2 line shows a green yes, like the listing below. Make sure you can still downgrade to iOS 7 before you start. If this is still green you can move fast and downgrade to iOS 7 while Apple is still signing updates. If you attempt to do this after Apple stops signing updates the verification will fail and you will need to restore to iOS 8. As long as it is green you can download the iOS 7.1.2 ipsw for your device. The best place to go for a fast iOS 7.1.2 update now is direct from Apple. You can use the iOS 7.1.2 direct download links from RedMondPie. The iOS 7.1.12 download is pretty large so it may take about 15 minutes to download. After you download you will need to follow the directions below. You must restore, which wipes the iPhone or iPad clean to factory settings. You can not restore from an iOS 8 backup, but if you have a recent backup from when you were on iOS 7.1.2 you should be able to restore that when this completes. Downgrade from iOS 8 to iOS 7 Before you proceed make sure Apples is still verifying the iOS 7.1.2 update. Failure to do so will lead to an annoying restore to iOS 8 and a waste of your time. 1. Download the iOS 7.1.2 ipsw for your device 2. Plug your iPhone into a computer and open iTunes. 3. In iTunes click on the iPhone option in the upper right. If you see the Restore and Upgrade options you are on the right screen. 5. Special Click on Restore iPhone. A special click involves holding a key while you left click. Hold alt/option on Mac when you click Restore iPhone… On Windows, hold Shift when you click Restore iPhone… Do not try the Check for Update option. 6. Find the ios 7.1.2 download and click on the .ipsw file. After a few minutes the iOS 7.1.2 update will complete. If Apple is still signing the iOS 7.1.2 files you are good to go. Just make sure you don’t update to iOS 8 again. If the process fails it is likely Apple stopped signing the iOS 7.1.2 update and you need to Restore to iOS 8. 19 Responses 09/17/2014 Justin Reply says firmware is not compatible with device? but I’ve tried both for iPhone 5c so I don’t have any other options 09/18/2014 mich Reply so it means once i have backed up my iPhone in iTunes under ios8, it is no longer possible for me to revert to iOS 7.1.2 because the back up in iTunes is already under ios8? unless i don’t want to restore all contents from old iOS especially contacts and messages? 09/18/2014 Ronald Reply Still signing :-) 09/18/2014 Ant Reply I have a iphone 5.

Tip use Firefox to download the 7.1.2 ispw file, it wont work with Internet Explorer, happy downgrading, 09/20/2014 Dave Darby Reply Still working. Just downgraded. 09/20/2014 Brian Laidlaw Reply When I download the Ipswich file it is a zip file and there is no ipsw file name so I can’t find it after clocking on restorers. Any ideas….my iPad 2 is slow as molasses….just useless 09/20/2014 Michael Reply Hi you need to download the ipsw file with Firefox to get the correct file association. If you use Internet Explorer you get a file zip association which will not work. Regards Michael 09/20/2014 To Reply Is it also possible to upgrade my iPad from iOS 6.1.3 to iOS 7.1.2? Will it work to restore my backup from iOS 6 and would you guys recommend me to upgrade? Im having an iPad 2. 09/20/2014 Dave Bridge Reply Thanks for this how-to article! SO thankful I can still downgrade!! Tried iOS8 on my old iPad2 and it was horrible!! I’ll give it a try on my iPhone 5S later, but the iPad2 stays at iOS7.12 for the rest of it’s life I supposed I can define “horrible” just to steer others away from trying it. I open the smartcover and now it takes about 4 seconds before the screen comes on. It used to be nearly instant. I double-click the home button, and again its about 4 seconds for the system to respond. That’s how the native functions perform, so you can imagine how great the apps run. Not bashing iOS8 in general, just advising you to avoid it on this older hardware: iPad2 32GB Wifi 09/21/2014 BEN Reply Hi, I downloaded the correct iOS version for my iPhone 5S, but it says the update cannot be completed due to the firmware being unsupported. Can anyone help with this??? Thanks 09/28/2014 Skoor Reply Will i lose everything if i downgrade from 8 to 7.1.2.? And how can i make sure i dont lose anything ..

The firm has announced a limited refresh of the machine, the first time it has upgraded its innards since 2013. But it said it would not be able to release a "new model" until an unspecified point after 2017. The tech firm had faced criticism that it was not addressing the needs of its professional users. It released a new line-up of MacBook-Pro-branded laptops in October, but was attacked for not including more powerful graphics cards in them and for removing several of the ports found in earlier models. One expert said the latest announcement would reassure graphic designers, video editors, scientists and other power users that Apple was not abandoning them to focus on iPads and iPhones, which outsell the Macs. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The latest MacBook Pros added a touchbar but dropped the SD card slot among other ports Apple's engineering chiefs told a small group of journalists - which did not include the BBC - that the company had been constrained as a consequence of how it had expected graphics chip technology to develop. The firm had believed it would become more common to use multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) to carry out complex tasks. The Mac Pro was designed to use two in parallel. Instead, component-makers have focused on designing parts that maximise the output of a single GPU and give out more heat as a result. This caused problems for the trash-can-like design of the machine. It did away with the multiple heat sinks and fans found in earlier Mac Pros, and instead used a single triangular piece of aluminium to conduct heat away from its processors, helping it to run more quietly as a result. "The way the system is architected, it just doesn't lend itself to significant reconfiguration for somebody who might want a different combination of GPUs," Techcrunch quoted Apple's hardware chief John Ternus as saying. "We realised we had to take a step back and completely re-architect what we're doing and build something that enables us to do these quick, regular updates and keep it current and keep it state of the art, and also allow a little more in terms of adaptability to the different needs of the different pro customers." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The current Mac Pro model was designed to be a fraction of the size of its predecessor The firm's software engineering chief Craig Federighi added: "I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner... being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate." The refreshed models add more powerful CPU (central processing units) and dual-GPUs than before. But otherwise little has changed, including a lack of USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports common to Apple's other high-end systems, which offer data speed benefits. "I think it was simply untenable for Apple to continue to remain silent on the Mac Pro front," commented the tech blogger John Gruber, who was also invited to the meeting. "No matter how disappointing you consider today's speed bump updates to the line-up, they're certainly better than no updates at all. "[But] if they had released these speed bumps without any comment about the future of the Mac Pro, people would have reasonably concluded that Apple had lost its... mind." This is the second time in a week that Apple has been in the news because of GPUs. On Tuesday, Imagination Technologies - the British designer of GPUs for its smartphones and tablets - revealed that Apple planned to go it alone and design its GPUs in-house. What's the difference between a CPU and a GPU? Image copyright Apple In basic terms, a CPU calculates single sets of instructions more quickly (or two sets of instructions simultaneously if a dual-core chip is involved), while GPUs specialise in carrying out many calculations at the same time. This makes GPUs better suited for "parallelisable" tasks - jobs that can be broken down into several parts and run simultaneously because the outcome of any one calculation does not determine the input of another. As the name suggests, powering graphics is one example, but others include speech recognition and pattern matching. Things that happened since Apple last updated the Mac Pro: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A revamped Mac Pro was unveiled in June 2013 and put on sale six months later, but had not been updated since Apple released the last version of its top-end desktop computer way back on 19 December 2013, but opted not to update it at its latest event. The "trash can" was targeted at video editors, 3D graphics artists, engineers and other professionals who wanted a powerful workstation. But three years is a very long time to go without a refresh, and a lot has happened in both tech and beyond in the interim. To give an idea of how long it's been, all the events below have occurred since the computer went on sale: the European Space Agency landed a robot on a comet Scotland voted no in its independence referendum video game Flappy Bird was released, pulled and released again Apple unveiled two generations of its smartwatch the Ashley Madison infidelity site was hacked the comedian Robin Williams died celebrity photos were stolen from iCloud accounts and posted online the Robocop movie reboot was released at cinemas movie director Michael Bay quit the stage part way through a speech at a Samsung event at the CES tech show the iPhones 6, 6S and 7 have been released Related Topics Computing Apple Share this story About sharing Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn More on this story Imagination Technologies' shares plunge after Apple ends contract 3 April 2017 Apple adds Touch Bar to MacBook Pro laptops 27 October 2016 Related Internet links Apple Daring Fireball Techcrunch The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites Top Stories Syria gassing 'came from rebel side' Russia says chemical gas that killed civilians in a rebel-held Syrian town came from rebel weapons. 5 April 2017 PM suggests free movement extension 5 April 2017 Labour ruling 'fails Jewish community' 5 April 2017 Features Video How Princess Diana changed attitudes to Aids Hunting for treasure at low tide How France's alt-right seeks to sway election The women who sleep with a stranger to save their marriage Video Jane Austen, 'thug' style Is Trump wise to take on China over trade?

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 LG G6 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus VPN News It’s official: Apple is working on new Mac Pro and iMacs It’s official: Apple is working on new Mac Pro and iMacs By Darren Allan PC   Apple gets back into desktop mode Shares Apple hasn’t forgotten about desktop computers, and is working on the next-generation Mac Pro to arrive in 2018, with refreshed iMac all-in-ones also set to pitch up – and those will be on sale this year. As Mashable reports, all this emerged in a meeting with a trio of Apple’s top executives, including the firm’s marketing guru Phil Schiller who said that the company was working on “completely rethinking the Mac Pro”. The last incarnation of the Mac Pro was revealed almost four years ago now, and it was dramatic in terms of a major redesign with a bold cylindrical form factor, although some referred to the machine as the ‘trashcan’ Mac. Craig Federighi, senior VP of software engineering, was also present at the meeting – along with John Ternus, his hardware engineering counterpart – and the former admitted that the Mac Pro “didn't well suit some of the people we wanted to reach”. The real problem with the powerful desktop PC wasn’t its resemblance to a wastepaper bin – although that probably didn’t help – but Ternus explained that it was trying to be a one-size-fits-all solution for all pro customers, and this didn’t work given the marked diversity of those potential buyers. The system wasn’t configurable enough, put simply. So what will the new Mac Pro be? You guessed it: more configurable. And Apple says it will speak to a wider and more diverse range of professional users. We can also potentially expect another eye-catching design, Mashable reckons, although perhaps a tad more toned down given some of the aforementioned reaction to the 2013 model. The not-so-great news, at least if you’re keenly awaiting a Mac Pro refresh, is that Apple made it clear this revamped model won’t be available until 2018 – at the earliest. In the meantime, you can get a MacBook or MacBook Air now iMac info But on the bright side, as mentioned we will see refreshed iMacs this year, and it was interesting to hear that part of the reason the Mac Pro got put on the backburner, according to the Apple execs, was due to professional types switching to new (more powerful) iMacs in increasing numbers. Apple’s all-in-one computers will get a ‘significant’ update at some point later in 2017, including some new models which will be aimed specifically at pro users (presumably with even more power under the bonnet). Again, no hard details were made available when talking about the next-gen iMac, just as with the redesigned Mac Pro. Seemingly, then, this uncharacteristic detailing of future products from Apple is a clear reaction to the growing feeling that the company had abandoned desktop PCs.  It comes following Tim Cook’s comment last month that Apple will do more in the ‘pro area’, and broad assertion that the firm is still serious about desktop computers. Indeed, Federighi even admitted that Apple didn’t come to terms with the fact that it needed to do more regarding the Mac Pro, and that the realization that the firm wasn’t fully addressing the professional market came “later than we liked”. The three executives were also keen to make it clear that Apple has been listening to Mac Pro users, and those who don’t like the current model, in the quest to better shape the next-gen offering. Just as Microsoft has been since Windows 10 was launched, Apple is clearly keen to appear to be a company that listens to user feedback, and acts upon it. Pro Plus It also emerged that the Mac Pro is getting an upgrade, granting the current range boosted specs, while keeping prices the same. The base Mac Pro will be equipped with a six-core Xeon processor (rather than quad-core), and on the graphics front, it’ll have twin Fire Pro D500 GPUs (as opposed to a single D300). The top-end offering will up the ante to an 8-core processor with dual D700s. Prices will remain static at $2,999 (£2,999 in the UK, AU$4,899) and $3,999 (£3,899, AU$6,499) respectively. And finally, Apple also revealed that a Pro Display will be coming, too, although there were no specifics revealed on the monitor at all, save for the fact that it will be built by Apple itself, and not LG. Don’t expect the display, or the new iMac, to have a touchscreen though – Apple has made its feelings perfectly clear on this matter several times before, and Schiller did so once again in this latest meeting.  It’s just not happening.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Android dominates Windows as most popular OS in total internet usage By Rei Padla - April 4, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter For years, Windows has dominated the computer OS screen. No doubt Microsoft has dominated the PC industry for many reasons but not anymore in terms of Internet usage. It is no longer the dominant OS according to StatCounter who reported that Android has already overtaken Windows as the most popular operating system in the world, at least, in Internet use. This is in terms of total internet usage across mobile, desktop, and laptop. So it’s Google versus Microsoft this time. Not Microsoft versus Apple nor Google versus Apple. For the first time in history of tech, Windows is behind with only 37.91% of Android’s 37.93%. Okay, so that’s not exactly a huge gap but the fact is still there. There are more Android users now compared to Windows users. We’re talking about not just mobile but data also include both laptop and desktop PCs. Looking at the regions, North America Windows is on top with 39.5% share. Apple’s iOS is at 25.7% while Android 21.2%. In Europe, Windows is still the most popular with 51.7% and Android at 23.6%. It’s a different case in Asia as Android dominates Windows with 52.2% and 29.2% share, respectively. Data were from last March. This study is important and interesting because it was only five years ago when Android only held 2.4 percent of the global internet usage according to StatCounter’s CEO Aodhan Cullen. This phenomenal growth is mainly due to the popularity of smartphones in accessing the internet. There are more people using their Android phones to access their email, social networks, and online communities compared to before when they need to log into their laptops or PCs whether at home, school, or office. In this day and age, netizens have their smartphones in their hands. Some people don’t have just one but two Internet-enabled smartphones. Sales of traditional PCs have also been seeing a decline. Windows fans don’t need to worry though because Microsoft still dominates the “worldwide operating system desktop market”. This is for the laptop and personal computer only at 84%—mobile not included. Don’t be confused. Android overtaking Windows is only in terms of internet use. The number for mobile may even be bigger once AI, Augmented Reality, and Continuum become more popular.

Part of the problem lies in Apple’s heavy reliance on Intel. Making matters worse, the chip maker abandoned its tick-tock release schedule as it’s become economically unsustainable. Perhaps that’s why Apple summoned its senior executives Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi and John Ternus for “a small roundtable discussion about Mac” with five journalists (Matthew Panzarino, Lance Ulanoff, Ina Fried, John Paczkowski and John Gruber). In the case of Mac Pro, Apple miscalculated the repercussions its radical redesign would have on pro users. While it looks great, Mac Pro’s design makes it hard for Apple or its customers to replace tightly integrated internals with more powerful CPUs and massive hot-running GPUs. The main idea guiding the development of Mac Pro was that the most demanding of pro users would take advantage of the machine’s plentiful Thunderbolt 2 ports to boost graphics via external Thunderbolt modules. It never really took off. As Schiller acknowledged: As we’ve said, we made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others. Enough so that we need to take another path. One of the good things, hopefully, with Apple through the years has been a willingness to say when something isn’t quite what we wanted it do be, didn’t live up to expectations, to not be afraid to admit it and look for the next answer. Federighi added that thermal core design proved difficult to update Mac Pro regularly. Apple’s Product Realization Lab, where they craft prototypes of future Macs The decision to outfit Mac Pros with dual GPUs backfired because the industry had just begun adopting workstations with one big GPU. Here’s how Federighi framed it: I think we designed ourselves into a bit of a thermal corner, if you will. We designed a system with the kind of GPUs that at the time we thought we needed, and that we thought we could well serve with a two GPU architecture. That that was the thermal limit we needed, or the thermal capacity we needed. But workloads didn’t materialize to fit that as broadly as we hoped. Being able to put larger single GPUs required a different system architecture and more thermal capacity than that system was designed to accommodate. So it became fairly difficult to adjust. At the same time, so many of our customers were moving to iMac that we saw a path to address many, many more of those that were finding themselves limited by a Mac Pro through next generation iMac. And really put a lot of our energy behind that. Specs are important no matter how you look at it, more so if you’re in the market for a pro workstations for some serious number crunching and creative work. Federighi was first to admit that Mac Pros are currently not well-suited for virtual reality apps (and Oculus agrees). “Certain kinds of high-end cinema production tasks” is another example where Mac Pros don’t excel at because, as Federighi notes, many pro apps don’t balance themselves well across multiple GPUs, but can scale across a single large GPU. Schiller jumped in, apologizing for keeping customers waiting for new Mac Pros: The current Mac Pro, as we’ve said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we’re sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we’ve asked the team to go and re-architect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It’ll meet more of those needs. Mac has an important, long future at Apple, that Apple cares deeply about Mac, we have every intention to keep going and investing in Mac. And if we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that, we’re sorry for that—what happened with Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it. And that’s our intention. Asked if Apple was aware of just how many customers have begun to doubt its commitment to Mac and the needs of pro users, Schiller responded by saying: It’s a reasonable question, and this is why we’re here today, specifically, to address that question above all else. We’re committed to Mac, we’ve got great talent on the Mac, both hardware and software, we’ve got great products planned for the future, and as far as our horizon line can see, Mac is a core component of the things Apple delivers, including to our pro customers. And on Apple’s own pro apps: I just want to reiterate our strong commitment there, as well. Both with Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X, there are teams on those software products that are completely dedicated to delivering great pro software to our customers. No foot off the gas there. The following quote is attributed to John Ternus, who is in charge of Mac hardware as Apple’s Vice President of Hardware Engineering: Some of our most talented folks are working on Mac. I mean, quite frankly, a lot of this company, if not most of this company, runs on Macs. This is a company full of pro Mac users. Federighi added that using Xcode downloads as a metric suggests that it is possible that software developers are actually Apple’s largest pro audience. “It’s growing very quickly, it’s been fantastic,” he said. Schiller offered this message to concerned pro users: We recognize that they want to hear more from us. And so we want to communicate better with them. We want them to understand the importance they have for us, we want them to understand that we’re investing in new Macs—not only new MacBook Pros and iMacs but Mac Pros for them, we want them to know we are going to work on a display for a modular system. We want them to know we’re continuing to invest in MacOS as well as our pro app software for pros… those are things we want to clearly communicate to them. And yes, we want them to know that, while we have not had updates to the current Mac Pro, we’re going to keep it on the price list because there are customers for whom it does work—for the things they need to do… We want to at least make the value of it better while we’re doing that. For those wondering about the state of automation and scripting, Federighi said that “scriptability and automation of the system remain super important” to Apple. Some other notable tidbits: 15 percent of all Mac users use at least one pro app multiple times per week. Additional 15 percent of all Mac users use pro apps at least once per week. 30 percent of the overall Mac user base is the pro market. The split between notebooks and desktops in Mac sales is 80/20. The most popular notebook with pros is MacBook Pro. The most popular desktop with pros is iMac (followed by Mac Pro). Notebooks are the most popular Macs with pros, before iMac (#2) and Mac Pro (#3). Mac Pro’s share of all Mac sales is a single-digit percentage. Sales of the new MacBook Pro are up about twenty percent year over year. Mac sales were up in 2016 and continue to outpace the PC industry. Mac user base is nearing 100 million users. Mac as a business is nearing a $25 billion run rate. Mac, Inc. would file as a Fortune 100 company on its own. Just to illustrate the effects of Apple’s dependence on Intel, the chip giant recently delayed Cannon Lake, its 10-nanometer evolution of existing Core processors. A company executive said that the new chips could now enter mass production next year. There’s little Apple can do when its key supplier delays processors, especially chips suitable for iMacs, Mac minis and Mac notebooks, into next year. The Cannon Lake platform supports LPDDR4 memory which consumes less power than the power-hungry DDR4 RAM inside the new MacBook Pro. In other words, the delay could endanger a rumored 32 GB MacBook Pro release in 2017. The current state of Mac updates, via MacRumors’ Buyers Guide. Here’s how many days have passed since Apple released major updates to these Macs: iMac—539 days since last release (average: 317 days) Mac Pro—1,202 days since last release (average: 449 days) Mac mini—901 days since last release (average: 438 days) MacBook—350 days since last release (average: 375 days) MacBook Pro—159 days since last release (average: 320 days) MacBook Air—757 days since last release (average: 350 days) The takeaway: Macs have a bright future ahead as new iMacs with pro-level features are coming later this year and a next-generation Mac Pro with modular design along with Apple-branded pro displays due in 2018. As for the most affordable Mac model—Mac mini—that machine is “important” to Apple and as such won’t be going away in the near future. In Schiller’s words, it’s “more of a mix of consumer with some pro use” and “remains a product in our lineup”. Thoughts on Apple’s comments?

Use Apple’s online comparison tool Related Topics Apple, Craig Federighi, iMac, John Ternus, Mac, Mac Mini, Mac Pro, News, Phil Schiller Bacillus Seems they got ashamed of themselves. And found out how many (real) Pro customers and devs jumped ship. Probably too late. Note that those switchets won’t return anytime soon, because most modern media-intensive apps are now primary Windows based or on other platforms. Those who feel betrayed and went through lots of trouble, don’t come back that easy, Phil. And in particular, the non-upgradeable trashcan ad-interim solution will be the one nobody buys. So that won’t stop the bleeding. You look like apprentices in the IT industry. Petur “Sorry” about a “pause” who are these guys? Did they just recently wake up, after three years and figure out that their product, Mac Pro, was outdated the day it was presented to the public? Seriously you cannot have been awake these three years. These guys think more about the looks of their product then the functionality of them. They are in a wrong field of a job. “Enough so that we need to take another path” Yes I agree, you should apply for a job at a flower shop. You are about to destroy the functionality of the iMac, it´s way, way to thin. I love the MacOS and I still use my 2010 iMac, with i7 and I added a SSD and 32GB memory. Javier Gore That’s what happens when you charge 2013 technology sugar coated with a radical yet innovative design. They clearly sat in their laurels expecting emotional buyers to be the mainstream buyers who drive their production line. Reality proved them very wrong: Rationality won over emotionality and people realized they could buy way more powerful hardware and build windows machines or even hackintoshes at a much lower cost. ic0dex https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6dce0bd99123c1826be79fd628695df4c4e8f48a1cbc62842c0e792da4b4d411.jpg   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Analyst: iPhone 8 to be priced relative to Galaxy S8+ Has iOS 10.3 randomly turned on your previously disabled iCloud services in Settings?

 Why Apple will never abandon the Mac Kif Leswing Apr. 4, 2017, 12:16 PM 4,827 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook loves the iMac.Getty Steve Jobs has a famous quote that lays out a perfect metaphor for the future of laptops and desktops. Jobs said in 2010: When we were an agrarian nation, all cars were trucks, because that’s what you needed on the farm. But as vehicles started to be used in the urban centers, cars got more popular … PCs are going to be like trucks. They’re still going to be around, they’re still going to have a lot of value, but they’re going to be used by one out of X people. If this metaphor were reality, and laptops really were trucks, then the parking lots at Apple headquarters would be filled with pickups, not Teslas. Because basically everyone who works for Apple in software development is spending their days on a Mac — they're not coding on iPads. John Ternus, Apple's vice president for hardware engineering for Macs, said so in a briefing earlier this week. "Some of our most talented folks are working on the Mac," Ternus said, according to Daring Fireball. "I mean, quite frankly, a lot of this company, if not most of this company, runs on Macs. This is a company full of pro Mac users." Steve Jobs implied the Mac was like a truck.Getty Images/Scott Olson On Tuesday, Apple reaffirmed its commitment to its oldest product line. It updated its trucks. The current lineup of Mac Pros got the latest components, Apple teased a faster iMac model, and also made vague promises about an expandable, redesigned Mac Pro coming next year, for the most demanding users. The reason that Apple is breaking with tradition and talking about upcoming products is because pro users are essential to Apple. They make up a small proportion of Apple users — 30% of Mac users, Apple estimates, which is a fraction of the number of iPhone users. But Apple is not necessarily worried about video editors or artists, like Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Studio. It needs to keep the Mac strong because the Mac is what every single serious iPhone developer uses. Currently, Apple's software for making software, Xcode, is only available on the Mac, and there's no iOS version. Apple is planning for a day when software development is done on tablets and phones, releasing the educational programming app Swift Playgrounds last year, but most developers still require a hardware keyboard, a command line, and a Unix-like environment, like macOS provides.  “I think if you use Xcode downloads as a metric, it’s possible software developers are actually our largest pro audience. It’s growing very quickly, it’s been fantastic,” Apple software SVP Craig Federighi said at the Mac briefing.  Some other Mac stats Apple shared on Tuesday: 80% of Macs sold are laptops, and 20% are desktops. It's a $25 billion run rate business on its own based on holiday quarter sales, which were up 20% annually. That's no iPhone business, but it would still be a Fortune 500 company on its own. Developers, developers, developers Getty Developers are critical to Apple. The number of great apps available for iPhones and iPads is one of the biggest reasons to pay more for an iPhone over an Android phone. Apple likes to tout the job creating effects of software development for the iPhone, most recently saying that there are 627,000 jobs attributable to the "iOS ecosystem." Do most developers need a pro machine with beastly GPUs and CPUs, like Apple is promising the launch in the future? No. Most developers can make apps and other software on Apple's laptops, and the company knows this. But increasingly, next-generation experiences, like Apple CEO Tim Cook is fond of talking about, will require lots of power to do 3D-rendering. Apple wants to make sure that people can do AR and VR development on Macs. Plus, if you've ever spent time with software engineers, you know that a lot of them like to have a lot of horsepower on their daily rig. So Apple can't get rid of Macs, even though they're dwarfed by the size of the iPhone business, because they're trucks. Developers are using those trucks to build the mountain of iPhone, and Apple's moat, and that's why the company won't be abandoning the Mac anytime soon.

It has been three years since the company decided to refresh the Mac Pro specs and it’s finally doing that today. It has even made some surprising revelations today that you don’t normally expect to hear from Apple. The Mac Pro specs have finally been refreshed today three years after the existing model was first released. Customers who pick up the $2,999 base model of the Mac Pro will now get a six-core Intel Xeon processor with two AMD D500s and 16GB of RAM instead of the quad-core Intel Xeon E5 processor with dual AMD FirePro D300 graphic cards and 12GB of RAM. The premium model with its octa-core Xeon processor and two D700 graphic cards costs $3,999 as it has ditched the six-core E5 processor and two D500 graphic cards. Despite going through a specs refresh, the Mac Pro doesn’t get USB Type-C ports. It’s going to offer six Thunderbolt 2 ports, two Ethernet ports, an HDMI port, and four USB-A ports. Apple has also confirmed today that it’s working on a completely new Mac Pro that’s going to be launched with an Apple-branded pro display at some point next year. The company has confirmed that new iMac configurations aimed at professional customers will be launched later this year. Filed in Apple >Computers. Read more about iMac and mac pro.

By Jason Murdock April 4, 2017 16:17 BST The latest Apple bug fixes should be downloaded now Getty Images Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users are being urged to update their devices immediately after the US tech giant released a critical update in its latest patch release – iOS 10.3.1 – that if left exposed could let hackers launch cyberattacks over WiFi. The vulnerability was discovered by Google Project Zero – a bug-hunting team that regularly finds security flaws in mainstream software and anti-virus products. In an advisory released on 3 April, Apple said an attack "within range" of a device could launch malicious code via WiFi. The update is now available to download for iPhone 5 and later, iPad 4th generation and later, and the iPod touch 6th generation and later. Listed under CVE-2017-6975, the description stated: "A stack buffer overflow was addressed through improved input validation." "My understanding is that it could affect anyone who is operating their mobile with WiFi on nearby an attacker," iOS security expert Will Strafach told IBTimes UK. "This is not a common vulnerability and I believe it is critical to upgrade now that the vulnerability has been mentioned publicly." No other technical details have yet been released. When Apple released iOS 10.3 last week it came with a slew of security upgrades, fixing issues with accounts, audio, iTunes Store, Safari and much more. However, there was also a lack of over-the-air support for 32-bit devices like the iPhone 5 and 5c. This has changed with the latest 10.3.1 series of fixes, likely showing the critical nature of the find. You can check for the update now just going to Settings > General > Software Update. Alternatively, you can manually download the update from Apple's iTunes service. For users, iOS 10.3 signalled many software improvements. It featured enhanced AirPod support, Safari support for Reduced Motion preferences and advancements to its CarPlay capabilities. As reported, the public beta of iOS 10.3.2 was released last week and is now being thoroughly tested.

Apple may be designing its own graphics processors to make the augmented-reality glasses Tim Cook has dropped hints about, but the move is also an opportunity to build something that takes the security and modern app development of iOS and puts it into a device format Mac users have been asking for. By Mary Branscombe for 500 words into the future | April 4, 2017 -- 16:14 GMT (09:14 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Could a touchscreen Mac really be on the way? Image: Sarah Tew/CNET A surprising number of Mac users would really, really like to have touchscreens. But that can't happen with MacOS, unless Apple undertakes the same long, slow, painful journey that Microsoft has been on. Microsoft has worked on making third-party software work well with touch instead of a mouse ever since Windows 7 first added touch support, and Microsoft cheated by using Microsoft Research and machine learning to make Office touch more accurate without making the icons any bigger. Special Feature Cloud - How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. Read More Neither Apple, nor its third-party software developers, nor its users, really have the appetite for that. But touchscreen 'laptops' could happen easily, if iOS grew up into Apple's laptop operating system, and Apple is clearly making some big investments in the way it designs the ARM chips iPads use. Apple this week told Imagination Technologies, which has been providing the GPU for its ARM SoCs, that it will stop using them in "15 months to two years". So will that be when we see something you could call a touchscreen Mac, if you didn't look too closely, that satisfies the unhappy MacBook Pro customers? Apple has always been very ready to fire customers it doesn't see as worth investing in. It used to be that you had to regularly buy a new Mac to be able to get the latest version of OS X. The expectation is that users will buy a new iPhone, if not every year, then every other year. While you can upgrade the OS, older phones often don't cope well with the latest version, or don't have the hardware to support new features. So it's possible that Apple is willing to give up 'Pro' customers who want a more powerful machine than fits in the sleek, thin, lightweight systems that Apple wants to create. Those priorities have shaped the design of the new MacBooks. Adding more than 16GB of RAM would mean using more power, which would mean shorter battery life. The new keyboard technology hasn't been universally popular in the USB-C MacBook, but it means the keyboard is thinner. Don't like the tradeoffs in that design? You probably aren't Apple's target customer. After all, Macs are only 10 percent of Apple's income, and its CEO Tim Cook suggested at the launch of the iPad Pro that tablets will replace notebooks. "If you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones," he said. Apple is still making Intel Macs; there's a new Mac Pro on the way that's being completely rethought, yet again, and interim models with new Xeon processors. Apple is also rumored to be interested in Intel's 3DX Point memory, now with the easier to pronounce name of Optane, which has made it as far as the datacenter as SSDs and will be available as DRAMs some time after that. It's unlikely that Apple was ever hoping to get those in the 2016 MacBooks. Apple just doesn't gamble on unfinished components like that. But this kind of new technology may be what it's waiting for to give the developers who need speed a new generation of systems. But those customers aren't the biggest group of Apple's customers, no matter how vocal they're being about frustrations that are enough to drive some of them to Windows, now that it can run command-line Linux tools that developers depend on. However much Apple mocked touchscreen PCs as vintage trucks and toaster fridges, there's clearly a market for devices that let you both touch the screen and type on the keyboard, and iOS is a better way for Apple to build that. Apple has been using its ARM license to design its own CPUs since the first iPad. Now it has hired enough silicon designers, several of them from Imagination, to design its own graphics processors to go alongside those. And that happens just as ARM CPUs go from being underpowered but very good at processing lots of threads at the same, to having performance that's remarkable close to Intel CPUs on the right tasks. That's why Microsoft is adding ARM servers to Azure. In the datacenter, ARM is right for very parallel tasks like machine learning and search indexing. But that's also enough performance to build a next-generation iPad Pro that could run something closer to Photoshop than a mobile app. After all, Microsoft thinks next-generation ARM chips are fast enough to run the Windows version of Photoshop in emulation.

The Mac Pro is getting a minor speed bump today, too. Looks like it’s damage control time in Cupertino. Surprise! Apple says a redesigned Mac Pro is coming Apple spilled the beans by inviting a handful of writers to its Mac Product Realization Lab in Cupertino where they met with Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, and John Ternus who is the vice president responsible for Mac hardware engineering. They had a frank discussion about the state of the Mac Pro where Schiller said, With regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro.’ We’re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers. He went on to say Apple is working on a “modular system,” and that includes a pro display. They aren’t shipping, however, this year. “We think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that’ll take longer than this year to do,” Schiller said. What Apple is saying is that pro users who have been waiting for release something—or anything—new in the pro desktop space have to wait a little longer, but there’s finally a light at the end of the tunnel. That, coupled with today’s minor performance bump, may keep its pro desktop user base from moving to competing Windows machines—at least that’s the hope. Today’s updates are CPU and GPU only, no Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C. The US$3,999 model gets and 8 core Xeon CPU, up from 6 cores, and the dual AMD D500 GPUs are now D800 GPUs. The $2,999 now has a 6 core CPU instead of 4, and includes dial AMD G500 GPUs instead of the G300. Apple, the Mac Pro, and Customer Confidence The problem Apple is facing right now is that many of its customers have lost faith in the company’s pro-level computer strategy and feel abandoned. That’s no spurprise considering the company’s last pro desktop came out over three years ago, and many in its target market flet the design was too limiting. The current Mac Pro was introduced in June 2013 and shipped in December of that year. Its cylinder shape can’t hold expansion cards, there isn’t room for additional internal drives, the GPUs are relatively lower performance, and feels like a design that’s been painted into a corner where expandability isn’t an option. Apple hasn’t done anything to refresh the current Mac Pro since it shipped even while competitors keep rolling out new pro-level desktops with new processors, more RAM, and better GPU options. The Mac Pro is, for all practical purposes, a nearly four year old snapshot in time. That’s changing soon-ish, and the message Apple is hoping it’s giving pro customers is, “We haven’t forgotten you.” The message they may be hearing, however, is “Don’t go. Please. Really, were going to fix this.” Still, the promise of a compelling new Mac Pro with a high end display to match is enticing if Apple pulls it off, and if it isn’t too late. Here Comes the Pro iMac Apple isn’t looking at the Mac Pro as its only pro desktop option. New iMacs are coming later this year, according to Schiller, “specifically with the pro customer in mind and acknowledging that our most popular desktop with pros is an iMac.” It’s possible the iMac is popular with pro users because in many ways it out performs the aging Mac Pro. That said, more pro-level feature in Apple’s all-in-one desktop can’t hurt. Based on Apple’s uncharacteristically candid discussion about its pro desktop roadmap, you have three options if you’re in the market for a new machine: Wait unti later this year for the new iMacs, wait for next year’s new Mac Pro, or abandon ship and move to Windows. Losing Mac Pro Users Odds are Apple is concerned too many users are choosing option three and wants to stop those losses. Considering Mac Pro sales make up a single digit percentage of overall Mac sales, it’s interesting that the company is openly committing to the pro desktop market like this instead of quietly letting the product die. Based on the current pro user sentiment this redesigned Mac Pro better be out of the park amazing, especially since we have to wait another year before seeing it. Hopefully today’s move wasn’t too little too late.

Or maybe it part of their long term plan timeline. April 4, 2017 at 11:43 EDT AM reasonableboy1 April 4, 2017 It’s good to see Apple listening to people and the fact that they are going to produce displays as well as a new Mac Pro, shoes how serious they are about the Pro customers. I think the iMac Pro was always going to happen before this announcement and shouldn’t be a surprise. Would also like them to provide user friendly upgrades to iMacs such as memory & SSD upgrades without having to have a degree in engineering to make the upgrades. April 4, 2017 at 11:51 EDT AM geneking7320 April 4, 2017 I wonder what would be the cost to upgrade the Mac Pro to Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C. Was it so prohibitive that they decide to wait for the new machine? April 4, 2017 at 12:09 EDT PM Jamie April 4, 2017 It’s very good news – all we wanted was an evolution. Looking forward to what that might look like. There are a great many people ready to shell out real $$$ for something superb. 🙂 April 4, 2017 at 12:34 EDT PM MOSiX Man April 4, 2017 Someone at Apple has been listening to certain Apple-related podcasts.

April 4, 2017 at 3:19 EDT PM MarcusNewton April 4, 2017 I also think this is great news all around. Large price cuts on the current Mac Pro, a possible iMac Pro in the Fall, and clear communication from Apple about what pros can expect in the future. I am now both happy and optimistic about the Mac for the first time in a long time. I am impressed Apple decided to openly communicate its future plans. I imagine it took a lot for them to admit the 2013 Mac Pro did not work for many types of professionals and needed to be redesigned from the ground up. I have to wonder, with today’s unprecedented move of revealing future plans, if this was a result of Apple doing normal course correction, or if the bleeding of professionals to competitors was so bad that they were desperate to staunch the flow. Either way, I am still very happy that Apple is investing this kind of time and money into new pro level Macs. As someone who depends on pro level Macs for a living it is a great relief to know there is a real future and not just speculation about one.

Some of the world's most popular musicians may now have the option to release albums on Spotify as Premium-only for two weeks, according to a new deal announced on Tuesday. The new waiting period will be offered to artists with Universal Music Group, which owns brands that work with artists like Drake, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Paul McCartney and Andrea Bocelli. It's designed to offer subscribers "an earlier chance to explore the complete creative work, while the singles are available across Spotify for all our listeners to enjoy," CEO Daniel Ek said in a statement. The deal, which favors users of its $4.99 and up subscriptions, strikes at the heart of Spotify's battle with Apple Music, as the European start-up reportedly eyes an IPO. Universal artist and mega-star Taylor Swift has been a loud critic of Spotify, calling it a "start-up with no cash flow [that] reacted to criticism like a corporate machine." Swift ultimately favored Apple Music, while Drake released an album as an Apple Music exclusive. Spotify's new policy is flexible — not every album will be released on Spotify the same way, Ek said. For now, it's unclear which artists will participate. While Swift and West have pressured the streaming industry, Universal Music boss Lucian Grainge said on Tuesday that the success of services like Spotify is "essential to the ecosystem's enduring health." The new Spotify deal affords Universal Music Group "unprecedented" access to Spotify's data. "Eight years ago, when streaming was a welcome but small source of revenue, UMG embraced partners like Spotify as a way to help return music to a vibrant future benefitting the entire ecosystem," Grainge said. "Working hand in hand with these digital services brought us the industry's first real growth in nearly two decades. Today, streaming represents the majority of the business. Our challenge is transforming that upturn into sustainable growth." Bolstering subscription revenue may be of growing importance at Spotify. Last month, the Financial Times reported that Spotify was on the brink of closing licensing deals that could take it closer to an initial public offering. (There was no mention of an IPO in Tuesday's announcement.) Still, as Spotify is moving toward more exclusives, Apple may be moving away. Drake's latest album was not an Apple Music exclusive. "When I was at radio, exclusives were the way to get the audience, because you would have the records before they were released. That doesn't happen anymore," Zane Lowe of Apple Music told CNET last month. "Most records are out all at the same time, so everyone's been forced to brush up on their editorial charms. How are you actually presenting the music, rather than owning it? ... Distribution is a choice, but it's not a hook I hang anything on." Anita BalakrishnanNews Associate

Wants to Build Its Own Graphics Processors It's all about taking control of a critical technology. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 4, 2017 at 11:00AM On April 3, graphics intellectual property vendor Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) disclosed to investors that its largest customer, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), had informed it that it would no longer need its technologies going forward because it will shift completely to in-house graphics technology. Given that Apple has successfully used Imagination's technology for years (although microprocessor expert David Kanter says that Apple has been significantly customizing it for several generations), why would it want to make a clean break? Image source: Apple. It's not about the money I've seen hypothesis thrown around that Apple is simply looking to cut costs. As Imagination disclosed in its announcement, its revenue from Apple in its current fiscal year is expected to be around 65 million pounds, or roughly $80 million. The royalties that Apple pays to Imagination for technology licensing probably show up on Apple's income statement as part of its cost of sales, ultimately impacting gross margin. For some context, Apple's cost of sales during its fiscal year 2016 were $131.376 billion. If we strip out those royalty payments from its fiscal 2016 cost of sales, we get total cost of sales of $131.296 billion. The difference is essentially a rounding error. Furthermore, to build its own graphics technology, Apple needs to invest substantially in research and development. The R&D expense required to keep a pipeline full of leadership graphics intellectual property likely isn't trivial and would almost certainly negate, if not more than offset, any savings on the cost-of-goods-sold side. This isn't about the money. So, what's it about? The bottom line is that graphics technology is likely to become increasingly important over time. Not only is leadership graphics technology critical to enabling applications such as mobile gaming and high-resolution displays, but graphics technology is likely to become even more important as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) -- both areas that Apple is said to be working on -- potentially go mainstream. Graphics technology is a critically important asset, and I suspect that Apple thinks that it can do a better job of building its own graphics processors tailored to its hardware and software needs than Imagination can. Although it may seem as though Apple is being a bit arrogant here, thinking that it can build better technology than what a company that's been doing this for a long time has been doing, it's worth keeping in mind a couple of things. First, Apple has been scooping up graphics talent for many years now and that talent doesn't just consist of new college grads -- it has hired experienced engineers and managers from many of the top graphics companies in the industry to get this done. So, even if Apple is relatively new to graphics, the teams that it has tasked with building this technology certainly comprise industry veterans. Beyond that, Apple can now build graphics processor technology to its own specifications, without having to worry about building technologies that need to be applicable to a broad range of customer needs. Moreover, Apple can afford to throw much more money at building graphics technology than Imagination ever could. Remember that Imagination's operating cost structure is fundamentally limited by the fact that it needed to develop graphics processors and other technologies while turning a profit on a relatively small revenue base. Apple's financial position allows it to be able to spend multiples of what Imagination can, which could ultimately lead to better products custom tailored to Apple's needs. And finally, I think Apple's silicon engineering organizations deserve the benefit of the doubt. Apple has built world-class mobile chips with industry-leading CPUs, image signal processors, and other key technologies. Given its execution in every other area of its chip technology, there's little reason to doubt its ability to build great graphics processors.  This might be bad news for Imagination, but this is likely good news for Apple and its customers.

Stocks Mixed: Top Tech Ratings Cut, But Upgrade Lifts This Dow Stock (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)'s valuation stands at more than $750 billion, which makes it the biggest component in the S&P 500 index. But what impact does the behemoth have on the index's movement? According to CNBC's Brian Sullivan, Apple's 24 percent year-to-date gain implies the stock contributed 2.2 points to the S&P 500 gains since the start of the year. While this number may seem significant, the fact is Apple contributed more to the index than the next three biggest contributors combined. CNBC cited Howard Silverblatt, an index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, who pointed out that Apple alone contributed 11 percent of the S&P 500's gains this year. Moreover, if Apple wasn't a member of the S&P 500 then the index would be up less than 5 percent this year. Apple also happens to be the best performing member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In fact, the second-best performing stock in the index so far in 2017, Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), is up just 14 percent. Cowen: Path To $160 David Seaburg, head of sales trading at Cowen and Co, explained to Brian Sullivan during a recent "Trading Nation" segment why Apple's stock has upside to $155–$160 per share. According to Seaburg, consensus estimates on Apple among Wall Street analysts are too low and the Street will adjust their numbers higher. The analyst cited the upcoming iPhone 8 release and suggested that demand for the new phone in China will be "off the charts." Bottom line, Apple's valuation continues to trade at a discount to the market and "money can continue to gravitate into this stock."

Analysts at UBS reckon that there will be a premium iPhone edition this year, but that pricing for the model won’t reach lofty four-figure heights. The news come in response to longstanding rumours that Apple is plotting a special 10th anniversary edition iPhone 8 model, to sit alongside more conventional handsets. According to UBS, the factory cost of the special iPhone will be between $70 and $90 more than the iPhone 7 Plus, and that the handset will eventually sell for between $850 and $900. In these post-referendum times, it’s likely that British pricing would fall around a similar figure – almost certainly north of £800. Apple is expected to announce a new roster of iPhones in September. Amongst these is said to be a special edition phone that will feature 64GB of storage as standard. But the most prominent rumour is that it will be the first iPhone to feature an OLED display. Despite rival Samsung having used OLED screens in its Galaxy smartphones for years, Apple has been slow to pick up the technology – which may be thanks to the fact that Samsung manufactures the lion’s share of phone-sized OLED displays. Unlike conventional LED-backlit LCD panels, an OLED screen has pixels that produce their own light. This means individual pixels can be turned on and off, allowing for deeper blacks to be display. What’s more, the lack of a backlight means OLED panels are much more power efficient than LED-backlit alternatives. Apple launched the original iPhone back in 2007, so we’re almost certain to see something special from Cupertino in 2017 to mark the 10-year anniversary. Selling cheaper iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus models alongside a special edition iPhone 8 would be a sensible way for Apple to capitalise on users who are willing to pay more for better specs. Of course, analyst predictions are just that – predictions. Take this report with a pinch of salt, as there’s every chance we might not see a special edition iPhone 8 this year after all.

Image: Mashable composite: Apple By Lance Ulanoff2017-04-04 15:59:02 UTC Pity the Mac Mini. It's not Apple's most powerful Mac, nor has it ever been a design triumph. A dozen years after Steve Jobs launched it, there's never been a memorable Mac Mini ad campaign. It's the orphan of the Mac ecosystem.  SEE ALSO: The Mac Pro is getting a major do-over Even during a rare and wide-ranging discussion on all things Mac, (especially the Mac Pro and iMac) at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters on Monday, Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller didn't mention the Mini until asked directly about it. To be fair, the discussion was mostly about pro users and their affinity or lack thereof for the current Mac Pro line. Spoiler alert: Mac Pro is getting a major update next year and the iMac line can expect one in 2017. But what about the Mini? "We weren't bringing it up because it's more of a mix of consumer and some pro use," explained Schiller to the reporter who asked the question. "And so," he continued, "we're focusing today, specifically on things that are important to pros. While there are some pro users [for the Mini], there are also a lot of consumer users, so we weren't covering it today." Apple executives Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi hold a roundtable conversation with journalists on the Mac inside the machine shop at Apple's Product Realization Lab. The barely mentioned the Mini. Image: Apple Then Schiller paused and tried to offer a modicum of reassurance to Mac Mini fans: "The Mac Mini remains a product in our lineup. Nothing more  to say about it today." 'The Mac Mini remains a product in our lineup. Nothing more  to say about it today.' Okay, so that's not exactly a ringing endorsement for the little computing box that hasn't seen a significant update since 2014.  The good news is that, as a standalone computing box, the Mac Mini, which starts at $499, offers the kind of product versatility in a single design that Apple prizes. When asked why Apple doesn't always offer a wide range of hardware options on its Macs, Schiller said, "It's our job to strike that balance between needing as large a group of users as possible, while making the fewest number of products that enable that. So we can put more energy in making them really great." The Mac Mini is essentially a computer box that can fit easily in almost any situation. It can also be configured with a pretty powerful Core i7 CPU. To add a further wrinkle, Apple, on Monday, also promised to deliver an Apple Pro display in 2018. Now imagine what that would be like hooked up to a rather affordable, but still powerful, Mac Mini. Yes, there's still a road ahead for the neglected little box.
