 Apple is doing something unprecedented to make fixing cracked iPhones easier Stephen Nellis, Reuters Jun. 7, 2017, 4:36 PM 16,944 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock By the end of 2017, Apple will put its proprietary machines for fixing cracked iPhones in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers, including Best Buy. The company had previously restricted use of its so-called Horizon Machine to its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers, and it has guarded the machine's design closely. The move is significant for the multi-billion-dollar screen repair industry. It should also speed up wait times for iPhone repairs in countries around the world. Hey Siri, where can I get my cracked iPhone screen fixed? Apple customers will soon have more choices as the company looks to reduce long wait times for iPhone repairs at its retail stores. By the end of 2017, Apple will to put its proprietary machines for mending cracked iPhone glass in about 400 authorized third-party repair centers in 25 countries, company executives told Reuters. Among the first recipients is Minneapolis-based Best Buy, which has long sold and serviced Apple products. The electronics retailer already has one of the screen-repair machines at a Miami-area store and one coming soon to an outlet in Sunnyvale, California. Fixing cracked screens may seem like small potatoes, but it's a multi-billion-dollar global business. The move is also a major shift for Apple. The company had previously restricted use of its so-called Horizon Machine to its nearly 500 retail stores and mail-in repair centers, and it has guarded its design closely. The change also comes as eight U.S. states have launched "right to repair" bills aimed at prying open the tightly controlled repair networks of Apple and other high-tech manufacturers. Apple said legislative pressure was not a factor in its decision to share its technology. It allowed Reuters to view and photograph the machines in action at a lab near its Cupertino, California headquarters. Until now, Apple had never formally acknowledged the Horizon Machine's existence. The initial rollout aims to put machines in 200, or about 4 percent, of Apple's 4,800 authorized service providers worldwide over the next few months. The company plans to double that figure by the end of the year. "We've been on a quest to expand our reach," said Brian Naumann, senior director of service operations at Apple. He said repair wait times have grown at some of the company's busiest retail stores. Pilot testing started a year ago. In addition to Miami, a few machines already are operating at third-party repair centers in the Bay Area, London, Shanghai and Singapore. Shops in some countries where Apple has no retail presence will also be early recipients, including locations in Colombia, Norway and South Korea. Apple would not say how much its partners are paying for the equipment. To be sure, any mall repair kiosk can replace a cracked iPhone screen. Apple says its customers can get their devices fixed at non-authorized shops without voiding their warranties as long as the technician caused no damage. But the Horizon Machine is needed to remedy the trickiest mishaps, such as when the fingerprint sensor attached to the back of the glass gets damaged when a phone is dropped. For security, only Apple's fix-it machine can tell the iPhone's processor, its silicon brain, to recognize a replacement sensor. Without it, the iPhone won't unlock with the touch of a finger. Banking apps that require a fingerprint won't work either, including the Apple Pay digital wallet. "Right to repair" gaining steam A repaired Apple iPhone is seen inside the proprietary Horizon machine fixture as it undergoes a repair procedure at Apple's display repair laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, U.S., May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones worldwide, many to customers who don't live near an Apple Store or an authorized third-party repair center. For fixes, many have turned to mom-and-pop shops and independent technicians that now dominate the trade. Research firm IBISWorld estimates the global cell phone repair business generates about $4 billion in revenue per year. Many of these entrepreneurs do good work. Some don't. All use copycat parts because Apple, like other major manufacturers, doesn't supply original parts or repair manuals to anyone but authorized service partners. Big companies defend this arrangement as the only way they can guarantee high-quality repair work and keep hackers away from the proprietary software that makes their products tick. Consumer advocates, however, say their aim is to wring outsized profits from repairs. Independent technicians often charge less than the cost of a factory fix. Enter right-to-repair bills. New York, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming have introduced legislation looking to aid small shops and do-it-yourself tinkerers. These proposed measures would require manufacturers to supply repair manuals, diagnostic tools and authentic replacement parts at fair prices to independent technicians and the general public. Apple, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar Inc and medical device maker Medtronic Plc have lobbied against New York's bill. In Nebraska, Apple sent its state and local lobbying chief Steve Kester to visit the Republican lawmaker sponsoring that state's measure. "Apple is telling me this is a bad thing because you're going to have a mecca for hackers in Nebraska," State Sen. Lydia Brasch said of Kester's February visit. Apple hasn't commented on the bills, but a trade group it belongs to contends the Nebraska measure would force the company to divulge how it secures sensitive data on the iPhone. "Think about how much of our personal lives are in this device," said Mike Lanigan, head engineer for Apple's service efforts. Inside the lab An Apple Horizon machine fixture made to service broken iPhones is seen at Apple's display repair laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, U.S., May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam Apple got into the screen-fixing business just three years ago with the introduction of the iPhone 5. Up until then, customers whose phones were out of warranty paid a "repair" fee, but Apple simply replaced the entire phone. Lanigan said customers have been requesting repair service since shortly after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, but the company waited until it could perfect the process. "We view the service aspect of this as all part of the overall Apple experience," Lanigan said. Apple doesn't break out repair revenue in its financial statements. Analysts estimate it at $1 billion to $2 billion annually for all products. As Apple's screen mending has matured, its prices have dropped to $129 to $149, depending on screen size, from $229. That's competitive with many independent shops for newer iPhones. Still, some technicians charge as little as $60 to fix older models. Apple says its process aims to make the display look like it just came out of the box. To demonstrate, the company allowed Reuters to observe the Horizon Machine at a repair lab in Sunnyvale, California. In the cavernous, brightly lit lab painted in Apple's signature sparkling white, two lab technicians clad in T-shirts, shorts and tennis shoes scurried between rows of long white metal tables stuffed with test equipment. Dozens of Horizon Machines lined the tables. The contraptions, gray metal boxes the size of a microwave with a swing-out windowed door, vary slightly in shape depending on the model of iPhone they repair. Apple would not say where the machines were made or by whom. In a smaller training room, a technician laid out the tools Apple uses to fix iPhone screens: special screwdrivers for the iPhone's five- and three-lobed screws, a custom suction-cup for loosening the screen without tearing the delicate ribbon cables behind it, and a press to squeeze iPhone 7s to ensure waterproofing. Once the new screen is mounted, the iPhone goes into the Horizon Machine, which allows Apple's software to communicate with the fresh hardware. Over the course of 10 to 12 minutes, the machine talks to the phone's operating system to pair the fingerprint sensor to the phone's brain. While that unfolds, a mechanical finger jabs the screen in multiple places to test the touch-sensitive surface. The machine also fine tunes the display and software to match the precise colors and calibration of the original. "We design for a customer experience that exceeds anything our competitors try to do," said Naumann, Apple's service chief. "We endeavor to make it right at the same standard as when the customer bought the product." EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Apple unveiled its long-awaited HomePod at its annual developers conference taking place this week in the heart of Silicon Valley, enticing lovers of its products with a high-end offering in a market dominated by lower-priced devices from Amazon and Google . Analysts are yet to be convinced that HomePod will rock the smart speaker market the way iPhones came to rule the smartphone world and iPods dominated MP3 players. “If we are comparing this to Apple’s past successes, it doesn’t fit that model,” said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. “This product is much more of a me-too offering.” There was no overwhelming differentiation in HomePod, according to the analyst. But he saw a big negative — it is more expensive. HomePod, infused with machine smarts by Siri digital assistant, will be priced at US$349 (about RM1,490) when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain. HomePod will take on Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the Internet and more. Amazon sells Echo devices for US$179, and smaller “Dot” versions for US$50. Google sells Home for US$180, promoting the smart speakers with discounts. HomePod’s tune Apple played up the rich speaker quality of HomePod, and synched it with the company’s music service that boasts 27 million subscribers. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company’s Siri team tuned the virtual assistant as a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the Internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a voice-commanded assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. “Apple’s base should like it, because they are committed to the ecosystem,” Enderle said of HomePod. “If you are paying the extra money because Apple is requiring you to do so to access your stuff, that is the Apple tax and it is the kind of thing that people don’t like.” HomePod combined elements of Echo and Sonos smart speakers, known for rich sound quality, according to Reticle Research principal analyst Ross Rubin. Apple lovers already tend to be “premium product buyers,” and may not flinch at paying more for what they believe is a superior quality product, said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing announces the new Apple HomePod during the annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California June 5, 2017. Just a glimpse Blau suspected Apple only gave a glimpse at its vision for HomePod, noting its potential to be a command centre for smart houses and to mesh with iPhones, iPads, online services and more. “We have to imagine there is going to be more there,” Blau said. “Is it going to be an Echo killer? A Google Home killer? We are going to have to wait and see. Apple be saving some insights into HomePod for later this year when it is expected to unveil a tenth-anniversary edition of the iPhone. Since HomePod will not hit the market until December, it is unlikely to catch much of the year-end holiday shopping wave and post big sales this year, according to Blau. “I think, over time, they are going to do just fine in this category but it is going to take a while,” the analyst said. “I don’t think it will be the next iPhone,” Blau said of HomePod, “but, Apple could gain share and be a leader.” In a blog post Technalysis Research founder Bob O’Donnell depicted Apple’s latest product news as an affirmation that the company has not fallen behind competitors and is working to take advantage of potentially exciting new technologies. But O’Donnell also expressed scepticism on Apple’s ability to dominate this new segment. “Yes, some songs may sound pleasing, but for true audiophiles who actually want to hear what the artist and producer intended, Apple’s positioning of the HomePod as super high-quality speaker is going to be a very tough sell,” O’Donnell said in a blog post. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook launches disaster maps to help aid workers save lives Cracked screen woes?

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM news.com.au June 7, 20177:56pm The iPhone 5, iPhone 5c and the iPad 4 are all being left in the dust by Apple. IF YOU’RE one of the remaining people still rocking an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5c, Apple has confirmed some bad news for you. The new operating system iOS11, set to be rolled out later this year will effectively make the device obsolete in terms of Apple’s ecosystem. The software update will run only on devices with a 64-bit processor, meaning it won’t be compatible with the guts of the iPhone 5 or iPhone 5c that feature 32 bit processors. The same goes for the iPad 4. While the phone will still work (and it’s a little bit amazing that it still does), users won’t be able to download the latest apps or security upgrades to protect against hackers and vulnerabilities. RIP iPhone 5, 5c and iPad 4. No iOS 11 support.#WWDC2017— Canoopsy (@Canoopsy) June 5, 2017 Such a move has previously been hinted at by Apple, with users opening 32-bit software in iOS 10.3 being met with a message saying the app will not work with future versions of iOS. And back in 2015, Apple told developers that all new apps had to be written in 64-bit code. When news.com.au reported on the expected change earlier this year, a number of readers expressed disappointment saying they preferred the more compact size of the old device, which is notably smaller than its successors. But the first two generations of the iPhone 5 are certainly getting old. The first iPhone 5 went on sale nearly five years ago and was the last Apple smartphone to be overseen by Steve Jobs. It was the company’s second iPhone to support five major versions of iOS: six, seven, eight, nine and 10. But that run has now come to an end. Whether it’s planned obsolescence or just the natural order of things, the iPhone 5 is not long for this world. Sorry, guys.

The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. The “HomePod” speaker unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs US$10 to US$15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. “It will reinvent home audio,” boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about US$350 in December in the US, UK and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for US$180; Google's Home speaker goes for US$130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the US are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fuelling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company “can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. “This is the start of the AI wars,” he said. Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality “experiences,” although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though.

The firm also revealed some new additions to its hardware lineup with the 10.5-inch iPad Pro and HomePod speaker. Although its software and hardware announcements were the most exciting, Apple also talked about its growth, and in particular with its streaming music service, Apple Music. The firm announced that it had amassed 27 million paid subscribers. That is quite impressive considering that only a few months ago, Apple was touting that it had just attained 20 million subscribers. While the growth is occurring at a steady pace, rival Spotify has most recently shared that it was able to eclipse 50 million subscribers. But there is a stark difference between the services since Apple does not offer a free ad-supported tier and must instead rely on converting customers with its three-month free trial. With the HomePod on the horizon, Apple has made strides to bolster its music streaming service with AirPlay 2 and giving developers more power with its new MusicKit API. Along with Siri integration and leveraging its Apple Music platform, the firm is hoping that the HomePod will become a huge success.

Apple announced it will soon support Amazon’s Prime Video on Apple TV. But, for now, you still can’t buy an Apple TV on Amazon.com. By Emily Bary June 6, 2017 5:50 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Amazon’s Prime Video service will soon be available on Apple TV. Photo: Getty Images Are Amazon and Apple ready for a detente? The two giants have had a simmering feud over media content and hardware. Amazon’s Prime Video service has always been notably absent from the Apple TV’s list of apps. And in October 2015, Amazon.com stopped selling Apple TV devices. That ban still holds, even though you can buy mounts and other Apple TV accessories on Amazon.

There are signs of a thaw in the relationship, but it’s unclear how far both sides will go to play nicely with each other. During Apple’s keynote address Monday, CEO Tim Cook sure sounded upbeat in talking about the Amazon Video app that’s finally coming to the Apple TV. Apple TV owners, he said, will be soon be able to watch “great original content” like Transparent, Man in the High Castle, and Catastrophe. But, so far, indications are that Amazon isn’t changing its policy around Apple TV sales. Asked about the issue on Tuesday, Amazon declined to comment, and Apple referred us back to Cook’s keynote. Apple typically takes a 30% cut of transactions made within apps on its devices, and Amazon was thought to be resisting an Apple TV presence because it didn’t want to pay up. In pulling Apple TVs from its stores two years ago, Amazon told The Verge: “It’s important that the streaming media players we sell interact well with Prime Video in order to avoid customer confusion. Roku, XBOX, PlayStation and Fire TV are excellent choices.” Amazon also removed Google’s Chromecast streaming device from its store in 2015. With the Apple TV about to welcome Prime Video into the fold, Amazon will soon need a new excuse for keeping Apple out. One business rationale: Amazon wants to sell its Fire TV Sticks, and the fewer additional streaming devices made available on its site, the more likely consumers are to buy a Fire product. Big Picture: There seems to be a thaw in the icy relationship between Apple and Amazon. But, for now, it’s only Apple making the public concessions.

The show’s first episode is launching at around 9pm on Tuesday, exclusively on the Apple Music streaming-music subscription service. The 10-episode show — designed to highlight Apple’s multibillion-dollar App Store business — features aspiring app developers vying for a chance to win venture-capital funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners. A new episode will be available exclusively on Apple Music each week on Tuesday evenings. Apple Music is set to bow original series Carpool Karaoke: The Series on Aug 8, featuring a lineup of celebrity guests. The 16-episode show is based on the popular sketches from CBS’s The Late Late Show with James Corden, and Corden will appear in at least two of the segments. That show also is being released on a weekly cycle, with a new episode to be released each Tuesday. Planet of the Apps is produced by two TV veterans, Propagate’s Ben Silverman and Howard Owens. Will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk serve as executive producers and mentors on the show, which is hosted by Zane Lowe, a New Zealand-born DJ who is creative director of the Beats 1 radio station on Apple Music. Apple kicked off the Planet of the Apps series with a screening Tuesday at its Worldwide Developers Conference at the San Jose Convention Centre. For now, Apple’s original entertainment strategy is geared toward reinforcing Apple Music, which starts at US$10 (S$13.80) per month.

It’s a lot to wrap our heads around, so we put together this list of all the company’s hardware announcements, with links to more info. We’ll follow it up with a list of new software announcements. iMac Apple made some major improvements to its iMac line, including new GPUs, new Kaby Lake processors, and a 4K screen on. They can also handle more RAM. Apple iMac 2017 iMac Pro iMac Pro is an all-in-one iMac aimed at professional users—note that Apple is also still working on the Mac Pro teased to journalists earlier this year. The iMac Pro will support up to 18 cores, 128GB of RAM, AMD Radeon Vega GPUs, Thunderbolt 3 ports, 10Gb Ethernet, and up to 4TB SSDs. They will start at $4,999. iMac Pro MacBook Pro Apple iterated on MacBook pro, just 10 months after they were updated in late 2016. The update includes higher drive capacities and new Kaby Lake processors. MacBook Air Apple also slipped in a brief mention about a processor update for MacBook Air. The company also lowered the price of the entry level 13-inch MacBook Air iPad Pro Apple announced two new iPad Pro models, a 12.9-inch update (starting at $799) and a 10.5-inch model (starting at $649) that replaces iPad Pro 9.7-inch. New features include a new Pro Motion Retina display with higher refresh rates, a new A10X Fusion processor with 6 cores and 12 GPU cores. The 10.5-inch model has a much smaller bezel so that the larger-screen device has the same footprint as the 9.7-inch model. iPad Pro HomePod HomePod ($349) is Apple’s entry into both the home music market as well as the home virtual assistant market. Apple is emphasizing music, though, saying it intended to “reinvent home music” with HomePod. Our own Dave Hamilton nailed it when he said the expected “Siri speaker” would compete with Sonos. HomePod Full Wireless Keyboard with Numeric Keypad At last. At last! Apple has a Full Wireless Keyboard with Numeric Keypad ($129)! We’ve waited for this one forever. Apple Full Wireless Keyboard with Numeric Keyboard Leather Apple Pencil Case Another quiet product launch is Leather Apple Pencil Case ($29), which is exactly what you expect from the name. Apple’s new Apple Pencil Case The Mac Observer's WWDC 2017 coverage sponsored by: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Full Wireless Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, HomePod, iMac, iMac Pro, iPad Pro, Leather Apple Pencil Case, WWDC, wwdc2017 You might also like… Get Free Bitcoins from 21 Faucets That Pay Apple’s Rumored Siri Speaker Targets Sonos, Too Here are the iPhones and iPads that Won't Run iOS 11 Now That Apple’s Announced the iMac Pro, What Does This Mean for Mac Pro Design? - Page 2 of 3 Apple's WWDC Keynote Was One We Never Dreamed Could Happen 3 Comments Add a comment geoduck June 6, 2017 I want to see the teardown on the new iMac and MacBook Pro. I’ve heard mixed opinions about how hard this will be to upgrade the iMac yourself. As far as the MacBook Pro, in addition to upgrading the processor, did they put the more form fitting, and higher capacity battery they supposedly couldn’t get working for the introduction last fall? iMac Pro. Drool fest. I can’t wait to play my “How expensive a computer can I configure” game with it. I would love it. But I in no way need it. My 2016 5K 27 in iMac is really allI need for a while. I am simply astonished they kept and updated the MacBook Air. I totally called that one wrong. I am going to see what reviews say about the new 10.5 in iPad. The line makes far more sense now. Now the iPad is 9.7 inch and has clearly lower specs. The iPad Pro line both have a larger screen and clearly higher capabilities. I’m interested in a bunch of the iOS11 features for the iPad Pro. I love my iPad Air, but this might be enough to get me to update, maybe. If not this year in another year when iOS 12 won’t run on it. A full wireless keyboard YES!! I do wish they had been able to get the TouchBar in it. Frankly once they roll out more Pro computers, unless they broaden the TouchBar beyond the MacBooks, developers will be slow to use it. Also a TouchBar makes more sense on a desktop computer. On a laptop it still strikes me as good, but a full touch screen would be better. Leather Apple Pencil case I DON’T CARE. Even if I do get a new iPad Pro and a Pencil, a leather case for it strikes me as a bit gauche. And finally the HomePod. I think Apple is very smart positioning it as a fantastic speaker, that also does other things. Amazon and Google have positioned their offerings as mediocre speakers that sell you stuff by monitoring your every word. People are becoming more privacy and security conscious and I think in the long run Apple’s strategy will win out. But it’s not for me. June 6, 2017 at 8:29 EDT PM Lee Dronick June 7, 2017 Speaking of HomePod, see today’s Joy of Tech comic http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/2426.html June 7, 2017 at 7:41 EDT AM Jamie June 7, 2017 I’m guessing they can get pretty expensive, geoduck. Still, I guess we should bear in mind that a tricked out Power Mac in the 90s could cost upward of $10,000 in *yesterday’s* dollars. I’m curious to see if HomePod becomes a family of products somewhere down the line, that would be very cool. June 7, 2017 at 11:14 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

In addition to a full list of Apple’s hardware announcements, we’ve put together a list of Apple software announcements. macOS High Sierra macOS 10.13 High Sierra is fully baked! Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi told us so. It will introduce Apple File System (APFS) to the Mac, boost Safari, block video autoplay, and help prevent intelligent tracking. Other improvements include Mail, support for H.265 video, and more. Metal 2 Metal 2 is the next generation of Apple’s low-level graphics API. It will deployed across macOS, iOS, and tvOS, and dramatically boost graphics performance. It also brings native VR support and support external GPUs on the Mac! iOS 11 iOS 11 brings improvements to Mail, Music, Photos, Siri, Maps, and Control Center. It will also support multiple speakers in HomeKit. Jeff Butts has done a hands-on piece, as well as a video tour of some of the changes in iOS 11 Developer Beta 1. Files App Files is just an app in iOS 11, but it’s also much, much more. It gives users access to the files on their iPhones and iPads, including iCloud Drive and third party cloud storage services. This is a first for Apple, and it represents a huge stride forward in iOS usability. Craig Federighi demos Files app in iOS 11 at WWDC ARKit I’m presenting this as a subset of iOS 11, but ARKit may end up being one of the most important announcements from WWDC 2017. It’s a set of APIs that let developers add the many new augmented reality (AR) tools built into iOS 11. MusicKit This set of APIs allows developers to integrate music controls and access to your music library directly in apps. With MusicKit, developers can let users create playlists, add songs to their library, and play music from Apple Music. App Store Redesign The App Store is getting redesigned, as Apple works on the hardest problem in online sales: discovery. Features include a new layout, tabs, and new ways to present apps. Apple Business Chat This one sneaked past a lot of folks, but Apple announced Apple Business Chat. It allows users and businesses to directly connect through iMessage, which could have big implications for support, sales, and more. We’ll get more details from Apple later this week, but Andrew Orr rounded up what we know so far. watchOS 4 Apple didn’t deep into many specifics on watchOS 4, but our takeaway is that Siri is taking a more prominent role on Apple Watch. New features include new watch faces, a new app dock, a flashlight that can also be used as an emergency beacon, improvements to Music app, improved Fitness features, and a lot more. watchOS 4 Siri Watch Face Apple Pay Cash Apple is moving into the banking business with Apple Pay Cash. This service will allow people to send one another money through iMessage using the accounts they have in Apple Pay. Transferred money is held in in Apple Pay Cash, which can then be used to make Apple Pay transactions like normal, send it on to someone else, or withdraw it to a bank account. This is a very big deal, and it’s a move designed for China and modeled in part after Venmo. Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV. This wasn’t an Apple product, but it was an important announcement for Apple TV and Apple’s broader ecosystem.

Eric Risberg, File AP Photo FILE- This March 1, 2017, file photo shows an exterior view of the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco. Uber has fired more than 20 employees after a law firm investigated complaints of sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and other violations of company policies. An Uber spokeswoman says the firm Perkins Coie was hired after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the ride-hailing company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages. Eric Risberg, File AP Photo National Business June 07, 2017 12:13 AM Uber moves to repair tainted image with 20 firings, 1 hiring By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT Uber, the world's leading ride-hailing company, has taken two big steps toward repairing its corporate image: It fired 20 employees for a host of harassment problems and hired an Apple marketing executive to rescue its tainted brand. Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber's chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company's ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. "Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. More action could come next week when a report on Uber's culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber's culture. During Uber's ascent to becoming the world's most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley's penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber's valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber's aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick's self-admitted need to "fundamentally change and grow up" has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It's also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google's autonomous vehicle arm. Uber's former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc. retained Perkins Coie after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages and superiors ignored her complaints. After the posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation. The probe into Fowler's complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn't say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm "unfettered access" to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company's size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation.

Eric Risberg, File AP Photo Business June 07, 2017 12:13 AM Uber moves to repair tainted image with 20 firings, 1 hiring By TOM KRISHER AP Auto Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT Uber, the world's leading ride-hailing company, has taken two big steps toward repairing its corporate image: It fired 20 employees for a host of harassment problems and hired an Apple marketing executive to rescue its tainted brand. Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber's chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company's ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. "Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. More action could come next week when a report on Uber's culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber's culture. During Uber's ascent to becoming the world's most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley's penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber's valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber's aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick's self-admitted need to "fundamentally change and grow up" has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It's also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google's autonomous vehicle arm.

During the interview, Schiller and Federighi dove deeper into some of the news from yesterday’s jam packed keynote, which Schiller quipped was 3 and a half hours long at first draft… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover Federighi opened by explaining the logic behind this year’s macOS High Sierra release. He noted that macOS releases where Apple takes a step back to refine and improve the experience are often the most well-received releases, hence the logic behind High Sierra. One thing Federighi wanted to set straight was the speed of Safari. He said that he was “sick of people not giving them their due” in regards to the Safari team, thus why he felt the need to proclaim on stage that Safari is the fastest browser out there. Federighi noted that Apple continues to place a heavy focus on privacy, as evident by macOS High Sierra’s support for clearing tracking data and further protecting user information. When asked if Apple’s privacy-first attitude affects its products, Federighi explained: “I think it takes longer to do things right. We’ve come up with architectures and we’ve started to talk some about how we’re able to sync information through the cloud, like Siri, in a way that’s secure and encrypted.” He concluded that Apple’s goal is to “keep privacy properties but have some cloud characteristics.” One interesting tidbit of information came from Federighi, who when asked about the rollout of Apple Filesystem on iOS explained that Apple had tested the transition with iOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 in the background without the end user knowing. This helped Apple ensure that the transition would go smoothly when iOS 10.3 launched to the public. In regards to the new iMac Pro that Apple showed off, Schiller explained that Apple believes there is a market for those who want pro-level specs in an all-in-one body: The hope is and the belief is that there are customers across all of those [MacBook, iMac, Mac Pro] that want more performance and like all-in-ones. If we can give them the performance they expect from a tower machine in an iMac, there’s a base of customers that want that. They’re pushing boundaries of editing, 3D rendering, and AI work. To them, there isn’t enough power. As much as you can give them, they want. Already the response I’ve been getting, on the iMac Pro, people are saying ‘I’ve never imagined I could get an iMac like this.'” Schiller concluded by reiterating Apple’s commitment to the Mac, saying it will “keep the mac at the forefront.” Speaking on the iPad Pro, Federighi and Schiller explained one of the biggest selling points about the new models are the displays. “While competitors may focus on resolution, our focus is on color depth, on refresh rate. These are where the really big wins are. Brightness, true tone display. I think our display team is doing unreal work.” Schiller also explained the need for the Files app, saying that pro users need a filesystem while others don’t. “For most consumers, they don’t need to use the Files app, ” he said. When asked to compare the HomePod to the iPod Hi-Fi, Schiller said that sometimes you have to do things over again to get it right. Sometimes you get to try again to get it right. It’s a different thing, different time, different scenario. There is one gigantic difference: our audio engineering team now is incredible. As you’ve seen with iPhone 7 and stereo speakers, four speakers in iPad Pro, AirPods. They’re really talented. Schiller spoke on the future of the Mac App Store, as well, which came across as neglected following the massive overhaul to the iOS App Store in iOS 11. So I will say this until we are satisfied one day: We care about it, we believe in it, we’re invested in it. It matters and over time you’ll see proof of that. Doing it first to the iOS App Store was the right thing to do. Other things over time. Finally, Gruber and Schiller conclude the interview by talking about product leaks. Gruber noted that there were few software leaks ahead of this WWDC, but hardware leaks continue. Schiller explained that Apple is doing a lot to combat leaks. “There’s a lot of work that’s gone on. It’s a really really hard and challenging and we may never be perfect at it, but the teams work hard at it.” The Apple executive explained that when something leaks, it’s disappointing to the people and teams who had spent so much time working on it. At the end of the day, it’s really when you’re a team has worked really hard and you get the opportunity to have me or Craig present it to the world. Schiller also said that Apple “can’t ever be mad at the sites that post things out of a misplaced love for us.”(Hi Phil!!) The full interview should be posted to Daring Fireball sometime soon.

"Now, what the heck, you're probably asking, does a high-end speaker system have to do with the resignation of a famous retail CEO? Simple, they help define what's working and what's not working in this crazy stock market," the "Mad Money" host contended. Cramer began by saying that as a mall-based store, J.Crew struggled in the past few years like many of its counterparts despite Drexler's strong reputation in retail. "In the age of Amazon, where driving to the mall is an anathema to many shoppers, Mickey couldn't distinguish his goods enough to entice people into a place where they didn't want to go to begin with. Much has been made of his fashion missteps. I think those are way off-base," Cramer said. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer reveals what Apple's HomePod and J.Crew's departed CEO have in common    Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 11:57 AM ET | 12:39 Now, mall-based retailers from Under Armour to Urban Outfitters are missing the mark because young shoppers go to the mall knowing exactly what they want instead of planning to browse and spend time there, a sign that brand loyalty is waning. Therein lies the similarity between tech giant Apple and the management shake-up at J.Crew, the "Mad Money" host said, aside from the fact that Drexler served on Apple's board for 16 years, appointed by the late Steve Jobs to help the company develop its retail presence. "Despite all this internet disintermediation, despite the endless hunt for bargains via Amazon, Apple's got the best brand loyalty in the world," Cramer said. "The loyalty is the key to the earnings per share, it's the key to its stock's recent run, [and] it's the key to why Warren Buffett became the company's largest shareholder." Cramer thinks Apple's $349 HomePod, a clear challenger to the $179 Amazon Echo, will have plenty of takers despite its price tag because of the company's commitment to brand loyalty, an intangible but crucial sales driver that has been all but lost on traditional retailers of late. "Think about retail," Cramer said. "Don't you increasingly believe that most apparel's generic?Think about televisions. Totally generic, right? I mean, my daughter bought a 55-incher the other day and I didn't ask which maker, I figured it would work no matter what. Big deal, right? Same with the fridge I bought recently. And the washer and dryer. I'm getting a grill. I don't even care who makes the grill. I recently bought a terrific bike; the owner of the store suggested it, I'd never even heard of the brand." Dwindling brand loyalty, while it is a drag on some brick-and-mortar retail, puts Apple's products in the spotlight. Cramer figures the consumer products giant would not be putting out a sound device at a high-end price if CEO Tim Cook was not sure it was superior to similar products on the market. "That's what Mickey Drexler really ran into," the "Mad Money" host explained. "I don't sit there anymore and say 'I need to have Crew.' I don't say I need to have anything. Yes, when it comes to the ultra-highest end clothes there's some loyalty, but most people don't wear Brioni and I buy my casual clothes at Costco. Hey, they always seem to have a good deal. Or I buy on Amazon." So at the end of the day, where traditional retailers have failed to grasp customers for the sake of their brands, Apple reigns supreme even with a formidable challenge from Amazon. "I used to have a brand that I was loyal to, every one of those items that I just mentioned," Cramer said of his fridge, grill, bike, and washer. "And to me, it would've been heresy at another time to trade away. Now, I don't care about any brand except for Apple." Questions for Cramer?

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Security Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple might be helping governments spy on users in real time Chris Smith @chris_writes June 6th, 2017 at 11:08 PM Share Tweet Two unrelated reports suggest that Apple might have the technical capability of mass spying on its customers in a certain area and feeding the obtained information to intelligence agencies that would be able to take immediate measures. Apple has long maintained that the privacy and security for its users are more important than government backdoors into its software, and Tim Cook’s opposition to the FBI in early 2016 sparked a massive debate on encryption. But, just recently, Cook confirmed that Apple helped the UK following the terrorist threats that hit the country in the past month. In what capacity did Apple intervene? Cook didn’t say, and an anecdote from a recent event has raised concerns that Apple is helping with mass spying. Don't Miss: iOS 11 is hiding two game-changing new iPhone features A paragraph at the end of a Rolling Stone story about the OneLove Manchester benefit concert detailed a rather disturbing story. Here it is in full, as published by Kory Grow: And it felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my Apple Notes app, ‘Helicopter hovering overhead,’ which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I’d written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they’d read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn’t a threat. ‘You have to understand, tensions are running high,’ one of the men said with a smile and a handshake, allowing me through the gate. Manchester was secure tonight. It’s likely that an iPhone-wielding journalist taking notes about an event would actually save those notes in the cloud, for fast retrieval on a MacBook, or another computer. What Grow seems to imply here is that UK intelligence agencies were able to act minutes after he typed those words in the app. If that’s true, then the only way they’d be able to do that is with Apple’s help. Apple could in theory access iCloud data, and with the help of advanced AI and machine learning, it could pinpoint possible suspects to law enforcement. That sounds rather scary — and it’s just speculation at this stage/ Here’s what Cook told Bloomberg about Apple’s involvement. “We have been cooperating with the U.K. government not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks. I cannot speak on detail on that. But in cases when we have information, and they have gone through the lawful process we don’t just give it, but we do it very promptly.” Cook, however, said that Apple did not break the encryption and instead used metadata information. Strong encryption “doesn’t mean no information. Metadata exists, and that’s very important for building a profile,” he said. So Apple could have told UK intelligence who’s talking to whom and where they are, without revealing the encrypted contents. As recent as mid-May, a Russian security company that develops forensic software, discovered that deleted Apple Notes would still be retrievable from iCloud even after the 30 days period when they remain active in the Recently Deleted folder. A The Wall Street Journal report in mid-March 2016 said that Apple is looking to improve iCloud encryption without harming users. At the time, Apple was able to decrypt information stored in iCloud.

Furthermore, the tech company has also confirmed that the developer beta of the mobile operating system is not available for download. For someone who has a developer account with Apple, downloading the new iOS 11 is as easy as logging into the App Store. However, for those who are not into developing for iOS devices, there is still a way of doing so. Installing iOS 11 developer beta with Apple developer account As mentioned, installing Apple’s latest developer beta version of iOS 11 is very easy. One only needs to log in to his or her Apple developer account, click the download icon and viola. In a few minutes or so, iOS 11 will download and install to your iOS device. Before you proceed with the installation Users should note that installing the iOS 11 developer beta on a device is a rather risky move. For one, since the firmware version is still in beta, it means that it is still riddled with bugs. Some of these bugs may cause the device’s battery to drain for now apparent reason, inadvertently reset, and app crashes. In worse case scenarios, bugs on beta firmware can cause total corruption of storage that leads to loss of data. That is why for anyone thinking of installing the latest version of iOS, data backup is a must. Another thing worth mentioning about iOS 11 is the fact that is does not run 32-bit applications anymore. So, for users who installed that new beta release, be prepared to not be able to use some unsupported apps. Apple’s Craig Federighi discussing the Files app for iOS 11 (via arstechnica.com) One more thing Unfortunately, as iOS 11 signals the end of an era for 32-bit applications, this means that the new mobile operating system is not compatible for some of Apple’s older hardware. For mobile devices like the iPhone, support starts with the iPhone 5s. Both the iPhone 5 and 5c are unsupported since both phones sport 32-bit ARM application processors. There will be no way of running iOS 11, at least for the time being, on these phones due to their internal architecture. In addition to the iPhone 5 and 5c, some iPads will also not be supported on iOS 11. Any iPad older than the iPad mini 2 will not be able to upgrade to the new iOS. Lastly, only the most recent iPod touch device is supported by the update. Again, any device older than the ones mentioned will not be able to run iOS 11 so there is really no point in trying. Installing without Apple developer account In case you really want to install the new iOS on your device but you do not have an Apple developer account, there is simply solution that you can follow. It should be noted that this technique installs a profile to the target device. Whether this profile is harmful or not, user discretion is advised. To install the iOS 11 developer beta, open the link from your iOS device’s Safari browser. This will then prompt the user about the profile installation. Click on install and restart the target device. Once it restarts, it will then proceed in installing the latest iOS beta firmware. For those who are still confused, check out the video below.

Uber has fired more than 20 employees after a law firm investigated complaints of sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and other violations of company policies. An Uber spokeswoman says the firm Perkins Coie was hired after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the ride-hailing company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........DETROIT — Uber, the world’s leading ride-hailing company, has taken two big steps toward repairing its corporate image: It fired 20 employees for a host of harassment problems and hired an Apple marketing executive to rescue its tainted brand. Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber’s chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company’s ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. “Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. Advertisement Continue reading More action could come next week when a report on Uber’s culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber’s culture. During Uber’s ascent to becoming the world’s most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley’s penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber’s valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber’s aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick’s self-admitted need to “fundamentally change and grow up” has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It’s also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google’s autonomous vehicle arm. Uber’s former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc. retained Perkins Coie after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages and superiors ignored her complaints. After the posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation. The probe into Fowler’s complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn’t say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm “unfettered access” to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company’s size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation. ____ AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed from New York.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular E3 2017 Battlegrounds Games of 2017 PC Gamer Club Far Cry 5 Hardware Guides Apple's new iMac Pro costs $5000, but is it overpriced? By Tuan Nguyen We attempt to put together the new iMac Pro for less. Comments Shares Near the end of the company's World Wide Developer's Conference yesterday, Apple announced a new desktop PC. No, not a new Mac Pro like many were hoping for, but a new all-in-one iMac... Pro. Here are the specs: 27-inch 5K display with 500 nits brightness and P3 color 8-Core Intel Xeon CPU, configurable up to 18-Core 32GB of 2666MHz DDR4 ECC RAM, configurable up to 128GB 1TB PCIe SSD, configurable up to 4TB SSD AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU with 8GB of HBM2, configurable to Vega 64, 16GB Front 1080p FaceTime HD camera Built-in stereo speakers, with 4 microphones, 3.5mm headphone jack 10GbE Ethernet Four Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports Four USB 3.0 ports 802.11ac wireless with Bluetooth 4.2 SDXC card slot with UHS-II As far as specifications go, the iMac Pro is a pretty beefy PC, and in all the right places. It's got one heck of a CPU, and a yet to be announced AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56. Apparently from the iMac Pro specs page, AMD is going to announce a Pro Vega 64 as well. We reckon that these GPUs will be based on AMD's Vega Frontier edition, and not the consumer version of Vega that is supposed to be announced sometime in August. Apple says that the $5000 base price for the new iMac Pro is a good deal, comparing its new computer to similar systems, specifically HP, which Apple said would have costed you $7000 for a similar system. Could it work for gaming? Probably. Would it be the best gaming PC that Apple has ever released? Yes. Based on the CPU and GPU alone, the new iMac Pro would be a fantastic gaming PC. But the old adage is that Apple computers are overpriced for what they are and that if you DIY, you can get an equivalent system for cheap. So let's try it! We went to our friends at PCPartPicker and built a system that attempted to match the new baseline iMac Pro feature for feature, to see how much we would actually save: PCPartPicker part list: CPU: Intel - Xeon E5-2620 V4 2.1GHz 8-Core Processor ($408.99) CPU Cooler: NZXT - Kraken X62 Liquid CPU Cooler ($158.99) Motherboard: Asus - X99-E-10G WS SSI CEB LGA2011-3 Motherboard ($649.00) Memory: Crucial - 32GB (1 x 32GB) Registered DDR4-2133 Memory ($253.81) Storage: Samsung - 960 EVO 1TB M.2-2280 Solid State Drive ($479.99) Video Card: Zotac - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB Founders Edition ($678.99) Case: Silverstone - TJ04B-EW ATX Mid Tower Case ($151.90) Power Supply: SeaSonic - PRIME Titanium 1000W 80+ Titanium Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply ($242.89) Operating System: Microsoft - Windows 7 Professional ($134.99) Monitor: LG - UltraFine 5K Display 60Hz Monitor ($1299.95) Other: ASUS Model ThunderboltEX 3 Expansion Card ($69.99) Keyboard: Apple - MB110LL/B Wired Standard Keyboard ($49.00) Mouse: Apple - MB829LL/A Bluetooth Wireless Laser Mouse ($79.99) Speakers: Logitech - Z130 5W 2ch Speakers ($18.99) Card reader: Kingston - Digital MobileLite G4 USB 3.0 card reader ($9.24) Total: $4686.71 What we end up with is an awesome PC that would give our high-end build competition. We also have a system that's a productivity powerhouse as well. Our build has Wi-Fi, 10-gigabit Ethernet ports, USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, and even Apple's own keyboard and mouse—although not the cooler space gray versions. Unfortunately, we only saved $313 by building it ourselves and that's only after sending in $25 worth of mail-in rebates. If you can build the exact same specs as the new iMac Pro, let us know in the comments. Specs aside, we're not going to get the svelte design of Apple's new iMac Pro, and its admittedly good manufacturing build and design. But you go into DIY knowing this from the get-go. What you do get in return though is the ability to expand internally, which the iMac Pro doesn't offer.  If you use NZXT's new BLD system, you actually end up paying NZXT more to build a machine than the $313 you would be giving to Apple to build the iMac Pro. This is also in-line with what system builders will charge, and in many cases you'll end up paying even more for higher-end boutique builders. So if we're comparing builders, Apple's actually a deal! Of course, $1,300 of our price tag is wrapped up in the 5K monitor. It's an understandable cost for Apple's build, especially when you consider the all-in-one design, but you can save a considerable amount of money—and still have a kick-ass gaming monitor—by building separately. For pros editing 4K video, the 5K display makes sense. This is the demographic the iMac Pro is targeting. For the average enthusiast though, a cheaper 4K display will suffice. While Apple may have charged a big premium for its computers years ago, it looks like this is no longer the case today. If you're in the market to spend this kind of money on gaming though, you'd obviously be better off with our extreme gaming PC build guide than an iMac Pro.

Apple's HomePod smart speaker enters a market segment dominated by Amazon and Google, but is being touted as a high-quality music device Photo: AFP tech Apple wants to rock the market with HomePod, but faces challenges June 7 01:00 pm JST 1 Comment By Glenn CHAPMAN SAN FRANCISCO Apple's new HomePod speaker may be music to the ears of its loyal fans, but how much it can crank up volume in the smart speaker market remains to be heard. Apple unveiled its long-awaited HomePod at its annual developers conference taking place this week in the heart of Silicon Valley, enticing lovers of its products with a high-end offering in a market dominated by lower-priced devices from Amazon and Google . Analysts are yet to be convinced that HomePod will rock the smart speaker market the way iPhones came to rule the smartphone world and iPods dominated MP3 players. "If we are comparing this to Apple's past successes, it doesn't fit that model," said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. "This product is much more of a me-too offering." There was no overwhelming differentiation in HomePod, according to the analyst. But he saw a big negative -- it is more expensive. HomePod, infused with machine smarts by Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain. HomePod will take on Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. Amazon sells Echo devices for $179, and smaller "Dot" versions for $50. Google sells Home for $180, promoting the smart speakers with discounts. Apple played up the rich speaker quality of HomePod, and synched it with the company's music service that boasts 27 million subscribers. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company's Siri team tuned the virtual assistant as a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a voice-commanded assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. "Apple's base should like it, because they are committed to the ecosystem," Enderle said of HomePod. "If you are paying the extra money because Apple is requiring you to do so to access your stuff, that is the Apple tax and it is the kind of thing that people don't like." HomePod combined elements of Echo and Sonos smart speakers, known for rich sound quality, according to Reticle Research principal analyst Ross Rubin. Apple lovers already tend to be "premium product buyers," and may not flinch at paying more for what they believe is a superior quality product, said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. Blau suspected Apple only gave a glimpse at its vision for HomePod, noting its potential to be a command center for smart houses and to mesh with iPhones, iPads, online services and more. "We have to imagine there is going to be more there," Blau said. "Is it going to be an Echo killer? A Google Home killer? We are going to have to wait and see. Apple be saving some insights into HomePod for later this year when it is expected to unveil a tenth-anniversary edition of the iPhone. Since HomePod will not hit the market until December, it is unlikely to catch much of the year-end holiday shopping wave and post big sales this year, according to Blau. "I think, over time, they are going to do just fine in this category but it is going to take a while," the analyst said. "I don't think it will be the next iPhone," Blau said of HomePod, "but, Apple could gain share and be a leader." In a blog post Technalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell depicted Apple's latest product news as an affirmation that the company has not fallen behind competitors and is working to take advantage of potentially exciting new technologies. But O'Donnell also expressed skepticism on Apple's ability to dominate this new segment. "Yes, some songs may sound pleasing, but for true audiophiles who actually want to hear what the artist and producer intended, Apple's positioning of the HomePod as super high-quality speaker is going to be a very tough sell," O'Donnell said in a blog post. © 2017 AFP How to Invest in Japanese Income Properties as a Foreigner: For Beginners June 24th (Saturday) in Kita Aoyama, Tokyo, Private Consultations and Networking After the Seminar Real Estate Japan Inc.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Here’s all the iOS 11 screenshots you’ve been waiting for Chris Mills BGR News June 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Unless you’ve been trapped in a VR cave, you’ve probably heard by now that Apple has a new version of iOS. The 11th edition of Apple’s mobile OS has it all: redesigned apps, a system-wide facelift, new Siri, and yes, a kinda-sorta Dark Mode. Don't Miss: Yet another study shows Verizon and T-Mobile are the fastest networks iPhone One of the biggest visual changes is to Siri. You now get a circular icon at the bottom that turns into a waveform when Siri is waiting for you to speak, which looks a lot like the light on top of Apple’s new HomePod. The action buttons are also redesigned to be a little more engaging, and overall it’s meant to make Siri feel like less of a one-trick pony. Whereas previously, interactions with Siri were limited to a single question followed by an answer, Siri’s bag of tricks is now much bigger. A side effect is that you have multi-stage interactions with Siri far more frequently. If you ask her to translate a phrase, for example, you’ll get a choice of languages before the translated phrase is shown. If you ask her to get an Uber, she’ll ask what kind of car and then confirm your location before ordering.   Messages has also had a minor redesign, mostly to put the Message apps far more front and center. Although the physical apps haven’t changed much, they’re more prominent in the Messages app than ever. Expect Apple Pay to appear right up front in the near future. Read More The App Storee has a complete overhaul. The design is more card-based, and individual elements are more distinct than they were previously. There’s a new selection of tabs, including a “Today” page that’s meant to surface new content, and a Games tab to highlight, well, Games. Individual apps also have a new page that jumps out when you tap for more information. The design features more bold headers — a theme throughout iOS 11, actually — and reviews are highlighted much higher up. It actually feels more like Amazon than the App Store, which may well be deliberate. Speaking of redesigns, the Music app has a facelife. Although the tabs have stayed the same, Apple’s new bold-header design makes an appearance, and individual artist channels make a bigger appearance. The Control Center has been completely changed. It’s down to one pane rather than three, and you’re able to customize settings and buttons to whatever you want. Navigating the new Control Center makes more sense with a 3D Touch device, as hard-pressing on an icon gets you more options like flashlight brightness or timer duration. The most welcome addition is being able to customize the buttons, including having a toggle for low-power mode. The new brightness and volume controls certainly look a lot more quirky, but they’re smaller and (I find) quicker to adjust with a single thumb flick. Another menu that’s been changed big-time is Storage. It used to be a place to just see what’s taking up room, but you have way more control over your storage in iOS 11. There’s a few “suggested” settings up top, like auto-deleting old Messages conversations off your device, or offloading unused app data off your device and onto the cloud. The “Offload App” feature is also available app-by-app. It removes all local data from your device, but if you choose to re-download it in the future, you won’t have to sign back in again, play through old levels of a game, or redownload Kindle books. It’s a particularly fantastic idea for apps you only use twice a year on Wi-Fi but don’t want taking up room the rest of the time. Finally, there is a new Dark Mode of sorts. It’s the same Invert Colors option that’s existed in the Accessibility menu for years, but with tweaks to make it more usable. Media like photos and app icons remain the true color, but white and black (and every other color) are now inverted. It’s still a little buggy and will probably remain that way until app developers fully embrace it, but it seems like the dark-screen hordes may finally have their wish. iPad Apple saved more of the big design changes for iOS 11 on the iPad, which is more multi-tasky than ever. Mail looks and feels like more of a desktop email app and less of a blown-up iPhone app. There’s more options to see your emails while also composing a draft, and split-screen viewing is way better. There’s a new, much wider taskbar that looks a lot like the dock from macOS. You can long-press on icons to get more options. The multi-tasking overview gives you a better look at all the apps you currently have open. Files is an all-new app that is the file manager we’ve been clamouring for since the iPad first came out. Drag-and-drop, one of the iPad’s big new (old) features, should be particularly useful here. Split-screen viewing is made better with the new dock, which lets you drag apps to the side to open them in a split-screen view with your current app. Drag-and-drop works for more than just pictures — you can drag and drop a webpage into an email to share the URL, for example. The Photos app now uses machine learning to recognize people and dogs, and can make you a cutesy little slideshow with all the living things you love in life. The App Store redesign is less cluttered on the iPad, and much more horizontal than the vertical card design on the iPhone. Finally, the keyboard has also been redesigned.

Image credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty At $US349 ($465), HomePod certainly pummels the smart home speaker market on pricing. Though Australian pricing hasn't been announced yet, we expect it to be around $499. Amazon's Echo costs $US180 ($240), while Sonos' Play:1 is $US199 ($265). Google Home, which is also making its way to Australia, is $US129 ($172), expected to be at least $199. All of them are spying on you, in one way or another. Better sound, dumber assistant The Homepod isn't being pushed on consumers as a voice assistant or even a smart home hub. Apple's banking on this thing sounding damn good, and hoping the rest will fall into place. Among its competition, HomePod seems to have the best audio setup of the bunch. Inside are seven tweeters and a 10cm subwoofer, and HomePod supposedly adjusts its audio performance based on its placement in the home. The Echo has never received high marks for its audio quality, with its single tweeter and subwoofer, while Sonos' lineup is the preferred multi-room setup for coastal liberal elites and company bathrooms everywhere. Want to create a multi-room audio setup that honours your Palo Alto overlords? That will run you $US700 ($932). That's closer to a thousand dollars than it is to zero dollars, so I hope you love listening to tunes. You can achieve the same multi-room audio experience with two Sonos Play:1 speakers, all for under $US400 ($533). The company's self-awareness concerning Siri's shortcomings is evident based on how they describe it on the HomePod page: Because it has Siri, HomePod can hear and answer questions in the most popular categories. Timers. Clocks. Measurements. Translations. News. Sports. Weather. Traffic. And general knowledge. It's great at the things you want to know, and do, in your home. That description of what Siri can do pales in comparison to the skills Alexa boasts thanks to its Alexa Skills Kit, an API for third-party developers to integrate the assistant into their apps. HomeKit plays catch up to Alexa's ubiquity HomePod also doubles as a smart home hub, the latest HomeKit-friendly hub besides the Apple TV (and your iOS device). That means you won't need your phone every time you want to turn on your smart lights and cue some music — just scream into the void, "Hey, Siri!" With a six-microphone array, it should hear you. Ditching your phone for always-on smart home control is great, but not unheard of. It's basically what the Echo does best, and Amazon's head start means it already has a foothold in the home automation market, however nascent it may be. Amazon's site is full of Alexa-enabled devices, and its compatibility with smart home hubs such as Samsung's SmartThings means Apple's already playing catch up. It won't be a huge gap to close, however. Companies such as Ecobee and Belkin have added or are adding support for Apple HomeKit through the addition of hubs or software updates. Spotify (or Amazon, or Tidal, or Google Play, or Pandora) fans need not apply Right now HomePod only supports its own music streaming service, Apple Music. Apple's press release for the HomePod put into question the future of streaming music from your personal library. I reached out to Apple in order to clarify what can and can't be played on the HomePod, but never heard back. I wasn't expecting Apple to come out of the gate with support for Amazon or Spotify music streaming, but I certainly was hopeful, especially after the company announced, in the same presentation, support for Amazon Video on Apple TV. What I was expecting was something about playing music from your personal library. There's no way Apple would prevent users from streaming their own tunes to the HomePod, but they did get rid of Magsafe on their MacBooks, so anything is possible. Aside from looking like a concept design for what became a murderous artificial intelligence, the HomePod is pretty cute, if not a little bland. It's a 18cm tall round speaker with a microphone array used to listen to your demands. To recap: Apple's $US349 ($465) HomePod has a less capable assistant than Amazon, is compatible with fewer music platforms than Sonos, and is more expensive than Google Home. Good thing it comes in two colours! It's out in December, so who knows what'll happen between now and launch day? Ready your wallet. Comments phil @phil Jun 7, 2017, 2:39pm It's out in DecemberDecember?!? Surely then it's a bit early for a launch? And will be interesting to see how another >6 months of software development improves it. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Chris Jager 07 Jun 2017 11:30 AM Foxtel has announced a revamped high-definition video streaming service dubbed Foxtel Now - and it's priced competitively with Stan and Netflix. With subscriptions starting at just $10 per month, it's a far cry from the company's prohibitively expensive Pay TV offerings. (In fact, it's actually cheaper than Netflix's HD tiers which start at $11.99.) But what do you actually get for your ten dollarydoos? Does Foxtel Now include Game Of Thrones? Do you still need to add a bunch of additional packs to make it worthwhile? We take a look at the prices, inclusions and your frequently asked questions. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

Macs & Mac OS X | 05 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (24) Tripping to macOS 10.13 High Sierra by Tonya Engst If you’re Apple, and you’re looking for a name for your new version of macOS, which is aimed at being a refinement to the previous version, what do you do? Name it High Sierra and make stoner jokes about how it’s fully baked. For film buffs, like our own Michael Cohen, Apple could instead have gone with a quote from the 1941 flick “High Sierra,” in which a character named Big Mac says, “Times have sure changed.” The rest of us might identify with Humphrey Bogart’s character, Roy Earle, who replies, saying “Yeah, ain’t they? You know, Mac, sometimes I feel like I don’t know what it’s all about anymore.” Under the hood, macOS 10.13 High Sierra will usher in the new APFS file system, H.265 HEVC video, and Metal 2 graphics. These changes will upgrade the Mac to a modern file system, bring a new industry standard for video compression to the Mac, and provide significantly enhanced graphics processing. They show that Apple is serious about the Mac’s future and about making necessary upgrades for Mac users in graphics-intensive creative fields like animation and virtual reality. Apple also announced a few welcome tweaks to its core apps. Apple developers can access the High Sierra developer preview now, and a public beta should be available later in June. Apple expects to release High Sierra to the general public this fall (expect September or October). The upgrade will be free and run on all systems that support macOS 10.12 Sierra. It’s All About Speed -- The new 64-bit file system, called APFS, stands for Apple File System, and it’s not just for the Mac — it’s already in iOS 10.3 and will become part of tvOS and watchOS. Because APFS is decades newer than the HFS+ file system that the Mac uses currently, it was designed with modern-day concerns in mind, such as how to best work with solid-state drives. APFS won’t make the Finder look different, but it should provide better performance: a task like displaying the size of a folder or duplicating a large file should go far more quickly. You can also look forward to features such as native encryption, faster backups, and better behavior in the case of power outages or system freezes (see “What Apple’s Forthcoming APFS File System Means to You,” 24 June 2016). The new HEVC (High-Efficiency Video Coding, also known as H.265) provides 40 percent better video compression for 4K video than the previous H.264 standard, as well as hardware acceleration when used on certain newer Macs and with Apple’s Pro tools. In essence, in High Sierra, video should take up less space and stream better. Metal 2 replaces the previous Metal API and is a big deal for developers — and by extension for anyone who wants the Mac to be taken seriously as a high-end creative platform. Apple’s description of Metal 2 lists the goodies expected in Metal 2, including GPU-driven pipelines, enhanced machine learning, and support for virtual reality rendering on external GPUs. Apple also announced an External Graphics Developer Kit, but details are still fuzzy. We’re still bummed that Apple passed on the opportunity to call it Heavy Metal. App Enhancements -- Apps that will see improvements in High Sierra include Safari, Mail, and Photos. The Safari Web browser will, to be blunt, show Web pages that look and sound less trashy. Safari’s Reader view is enabled automatically for every Web article that supports it, removing ads, navigation, and distractions. Autoplay Blocking will stop media playback from occurring when you open a page — Macworld, we’re looking at you! Safari’s new Intelligent Tracking Prevention will remove tracking data that allows third parties to access your browsing history. In addition to enhancing your privacy, this feature may cause you to see fewer ads based on products you’ve researched or purchased in the past. You’ll be able to customize all these features on a per-site basis, and the same applies to page zoom, location services, notifications, and content blockers. Search in the Mail app will be faster and feature a Top Hits area in the results that will attempt to display the “most relevant” results. This feature is designed to learn from your actions, so the more you use it, the better the results should get. Mail will also have a new full-screen split view that puts the compose window next to your messages and better message compression, allowing it to consume less disk space. Photos receives important tweaks that should interest many types of users. The interface will include a persistent sidebar and a redesigned Edit view. Facial recognition training you perform on one device will now appear on all your devices, the Memories feature has new categories, and new editing tools will help with fine-tuning and color saturation. In the fun department, you’ll be able to edit Live Photos like the mini-movies that they are, with looping, reversing, trimming, and picking a key frame. You’ll also be able to turn a Live Photo into a long exposure to blur movement. Photos will also finally bring back integration with external editors such as Photoshop and Pixelmator that was last seen in iPhoto. It will support third-party extensions so you can export projects to non-Apple printing services, such as Animoto and Shutterfly. Other changes that Apple announced include more natural voices for Siri, simple tables in Notes, flight information in Spotlight, Siri music recommendations in Apple Music, and the capability to share a link to a file stored in iCloud Drive with anyone. The last feature noted on Apple’s Web page about High Sierra mentions iCloud storage plans for a family; presumably more details will be forthcoming. Tripping to High Sierra -- Perhaps we at TidBITS can be accused of inhaling, but reactions to High Sierra were generally positive. We’re always in favor of Apple refining existing features that seem, well, half-baked. In the end, High Sierra adds timely improvements that will make every day use of apps like Safari and Photos more enjoyable while simultaneously adding foundational enhancements to enable previously unimaginable capabilities on the upcoming iMac Pro and promised Mac Pros. Apple even demoed some of this during the keynote by showing off a real-time virtual reality creation environment that was used to create a Star Wars experience. It may or may not have been the sort of thing anyone could do, but it was impressive. Right now the future looks groovy for macOS.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

The world doesn't use the term Fall. Why not use the well used words for months. Just because Apple is California-centric there is no need for TidBits to follow suit. Now about the US-centric but strange date format ... Reply Craig Cruden  2017-06-05 22:54 The important parts of the world do use the term Fall (Canada). Not to mention that Autumn is not that efficient and it forces you to open your mouth wider and you end up swallowing flies during the spring if you do. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-05 23:41 Well, considering Apple uses "fall", I would argue that TidBits is just reporting what Apple said without editorializing. ;-) Reply Tonya Engst   2017-06-06 10:08 Scott is correct here, but I found this thread amusing. As an editor for TidBITS/Take Control, I've asked authors to revise their text dozens of times, reminding them that the seasons are different in the southern hemisphere and noting that someone always complains if we imply that all our readers are in the north. Yesterday, when filling the role of writer, I did feel that "fall" was what Apple said and that writing "Q3" wouldn't be right, since "fall" might mean early November (though probably not). My hope was that the parenthetical "(expect September of October)" would be sufficient, because our southern readers would work out what I meant. But, I see now that it is impossible — someone will complain... and if one person complains then others noticed as well but didn't bother to write in about it. Next time, I'll try to find an elegant way to quote Apple's "fall" and explain it differently. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-06 10:36 What?!? Not every one lives in the north? The King in the North! ;-) FWIW, Apple states "Coming this fall" on the website for both iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra (still think that is a stupid name...of all the California landmarks, that is the best they can do...although it did lend itself to some nice, corny jokes). For the iMac Pro and HomePod on the website it says "Available December". Now, I will note that I am seeing the US Apple website...maybe they make regional adjustments/corrections, but I kind of doubt it. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:33 We explained our date format style a decade ago. It's very intentional, and not particularly U.S. centric. :-) http://tidbits.com/article/8749 Then, in issue #1000 (from 2009), we updated our canonical date format to spell out the month name and use four digits for the year so it would be easier to read in running text. Reply John Cooper  2017-06-06 12:30 To try to please readers such as Michel who don't want to engage in the same sort of inner translation that I make every time I read one of the many U.K.-based Mac sites, I would probably phrase things along the following lines: "Apple expects to release High Sierra to the general public during the U.S. fall season (expect September or October)." Reply Tonya Engst   2017-06-06 13:02 That's a nice way or wording it. Thanks for the idea. Reply James Pannozzi  2017-06-06 03:50 Oh LOOK everyone ! An article mentioning the new Mac file system which somehow avoided ALL mention of the BETTER file system known as ZFS that Apple could have used but shut down the project. Too bad it's STILL available, developed outside Apple, free, and works stunningly well. https://openzfsonosx.org/ Reply Derek Currie  2017-06-06 08:21 Please look at comparison lists between APFS and ZFS. They're extremely similar. I personally think of APFS as Apple ZFS or Son Of ZFS. Oh and my understanding of Apple's abandonment of the formal ZFS standard is that Oracle reneged on their promise to contribute to the project. Sound familiar? A similar scenario is why we now have LibreOffice. Reply Tonya Engst   2017-06-06 10:14 Yes, the purpose of this article was to share the news from the WWDC keynote. For the most part, I left it to the comments or other articles to analyze the merits of the choices that underlie the features. Reply James Pannozzi  2017-06-06 10:22 Descended from Mount Illumos, ZFS would have made possible easy file exchanges between Macs and something called the Linux operating system, used on MANY servers. But why use something standard when you can go proprietary and retain control, eh ? How many more features available on older Macs will quietly disappear in the newer OSX releases so that you can be forced to use the "CLOUD", eh? The O3X crowd is moving right along, I think only ZFS encryption is among the things they haven't done (of course using logical volumes, you can use the Mac file system encryption). The time for proprietary things LOCKING you into Macs is over. They have their uses, and for other things, other systems have theirs. The myth that OSX is "special" IS OVER. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-06-07 00:16 Wishful thinking. Reply James French  2017-06-06 04:39 Thanks for this excellent roundup of yesterday’s keynote. I think you missed one big improvement for Photos (big for me, anyway). It will now sync Faces info between devices, at last. This has been driving me mad! Reply Tonya Engst   2017-06-06 09:58 James, the article above does mention the upcoming new/better behavior of the Faces feature, but it also mentions several other new Photos feature, so I can see how you'd overlook it. I was surprised that the feature didn't work that way in Sierra. Reply Derek Currie  2017-06-06 08:18 Now that the Mac is moving to APFS, I strongly suspect we're going to have to pay for upgrades for our disk utilities. Start saving now! Reply Steve Nicholson  2017-06-06 09:02 Early in the High Sierra demo, Craig talked about how Safari smokes the competition. I'm not sure if he was still riffing on the stoner jokes or if that was accidental. It made me laugh either way. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:34 Oh, I'm sure it was intentional. :-) Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:38 As somebody who's been quite critical of Apple in the last few years, I was pleased with what I read here about mac OS High Sierra. I like the idea of a Snow Leopard style update that focuses on improvements, refined underlying tech, and clean-up rather than adding a lot of flashy nonsense that everybody will have forgotten two days after the release (Ping?). Regarding this "The new HEVC provides ... hardware acceleration when used on certain newer Macs and with Apple’s Pro tools." What "certain newer Macs" are we talking about here? Will dedicated GPUs be required? Or will Intel Iris graphics for example be able to hardware accelerate? Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-06-07 00:20 A good question. No doubt Apple will release more details, but my guess is that discreet GPUs will be required, which will shut out many Mac laptops. Reply Cory  2017-06-06 21:16 A fun read that kept me going right to the end. Reply B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-06-07 00:25 Thanks for the summary of High Sierra. It was a much easier read than the puffy descriptions on Apple's web site. I look forward to the new features in Safari. Currently you can click on the microphone in a tab that is playing a video, but the ability to shut them off globally will be a godsend. The tracking blocking will also be welcome. The security extensions I currently use in Safari don't address either of those problems. Reply Scott Slade  2017-06-07 13:13 Adam, any indication that the PDFKit framework will be more stable in High Sierra?

Watching WWDC’s keynote yesterday it dawned on me. Tim Cook was just showing off the latest watch faces that were added to the Apple Watch OS collection. Like, who gives a crap about stupid watch faces, right? And Toy Story? 2010 called – it wants its cartoons back, am I right? But watching Woody and Buzz and Jessie flopping all around the screen made me realize something. Be better Smartwatches aren’t watches. Well, ok they are watches, but they’re not just watches. They are so much more than watches. Then why does Android Wear spend so much time trying to pretend that it’s a watch? When you flip through the watch faces that are available by default on most smartwatches, you get a lot of dials and digital readouts and whatnot. But most of the time you don’t really come across a stuffed toy flopping around the screen, and why is that? We’ve grown up knowing what watches are – they’re time pieces that, you know, tell time. Often there is other functionality from moon phase complications to Casio stopwatches – depending on your price range. But no watches are comprised of the kinds of screens we’re seeing on smartwatches. And maybe, just maybe, the prime difference between the Apple Watch and so many other Android Wear watches is that Apple recognizes the fact that we’re not all wearing watches on our wrists – we’re actually wearing miniature smartphones. And maybe, we should start acting like it. Bring it on This is a fundamental shift into how we view smartwatches. When you put into perspective – suddenly, having a square watch face is no big deal. Why shouldn’t small smart devices have small rectangular screens? Why do we spend so much time and effort into trying to display to the outside world that we’re wearing a watch instead of a smartwatch? Because that’s what we’re wearing. And Apple owns that fact. One point that often comes up is that smartwatches “look funny” if they’re not round, or if they’re off, because all you have is a blank screen of your wrist. Well, why shouldn’t a smart device have a blank screen when it’s not in use? That’s what makes sense. When I go to bed, I turn the TV off, and at no time do I find it weird that I have a large blank rectangle in my family room. Why shouldn’t the same principle apply to my wrist? And furthermore, why shouldn’t I have simple text blocks that tell me what my next appointment is, rather than a calendar icon in a circle and a time in hours? Why shouldn’t I have Google Now cards on the main screen with my time display? If we’re going to wear a smartwatch, let’s start emphasizing the smart rather than the watch. Hold up Now before you go on a tirade, let me explain that I understand there are likely tons of watch faces which will display that information for me much like an Apple Watch. But the point of this editorial is to get across two things – I’m talking about default options. The average user may not even know how to download other watch faces. I’m talking about out of the box functionality. Those separate watch faces don’t speak to the aesthetic values most Android Wear fans hold, meaning Round > Square, and always on > off/blank In general, the Apple Watch doesn’t have those problems. They have been optimized to work the way Apple wants them to work, and what is clear is that Apple wants smartwatches to be smart first, watches second. Or, at the very least, Apple emphasizes “smart” just as much as “watch”. Leaders and followers Regardless, I wonder if perhaps Android Wear might have something to learn from the Apple Watch. Apple is leading the way in terms of smartwatch market share, and maybe this is why. It’s certainly something to think about. Android Wear picked a good market to try and emulate. Most designer watches are beautiful and expensive, so they’re good role models. But maybe they’re the wrongs things to emulate. Maybe we should accept the fact that our smartwatches are mostly smart, and by the way, they tell time too. Share This Post Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber's chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company's ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. FILE- This March 1, 2017, file photo shows an exterior view of the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco. Uber has fired more than 20 employees after a law firm investigated complaints of sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and other violations of company policies. An Uber spokeswoman says the firm Perkins Coie was hired after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the ride-hailing company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) "Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. More action could come next week when a report on Uber's culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber's culture. During Uber's ascent to becoming the world's most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley's penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber's valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber's aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick's self-admitted need to "fundamentally change and grow up" has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It's also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google's autonomous vehicle arm. Uber's former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc. retained Perkins Coie after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages and superiors ignored her complaints. After the posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation. The probe into Fowler's complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn't say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm "unfettered access" to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company's size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation. ____ AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed from New York.

Those fired for sexual harassment as well as bullying, discrimination and other behavior that violated company policies included both managers and lower-level workers. Some had retaliated against other employees after they complained about bad conduct, said Bobbie Wilson, a partner at the Perkins Coie law firm, which did the investigation. Separately, Uber announced Tuesday that it had hired Apple marketing executive Bozoma Saint John, who will be Uber’s chief brand officer. She ran global consumer marketing of Apple Music and iTunes. Her task at Uber will be to improve its brand image so people like it as well as they like the company’s ride services, an Uber spokeswoman said. “Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love,” Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement. Advertisement More action could come next week when a report on Uber’s culture by former Attorney General Eric Holder is likely to be made public. He is supposed to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber’s culture. During Uber’s ascent to becoming the world’s most valuable startup, the San Francisco-based company took Silicon Valley’s penchant for sexism, for cutthroat, unapologetic competition and distaste for government regulation and kicked it up several notches. For a while, this worked well, pushing Uber’s valuation to nearly $70 billion. But this year, Uber’s aggressive corporate culture and 40-year-old Kalanick’s self-admitted need to “fundamentally change and grow up” has caught up with it. In addition to the sexual harassment allegations, Uber is the target of lawsuits, boycott threats and a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities. It’s also been accused of corporate espionage by Waymo, formerly Google’s autonomous vehicle arm. Uber’s former chief autonomous car researcher took confidential documents from Waymo before his startup firm was purchased by Uber, according to a Waymo lawsuit. Uber also is searching for a chief operating officer and chief financial officer as it prepares for a possible public stock offering. Uber Technologies Inc. retained Perkins Coie after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages and superiors ignored her complaints. After the posting, Uber set up a 24-hour hotline to take complaints from employees, and hired Perkins Coie to investigate them. The firm checked into 215 complaints, and 57 remain under investigation. The hotline will remain in operation. Check out Federal News Radio's latest podcasts. The probe into Fowler’s complaints is still underway, and Wilson wouldn’t say if any of those fired, or 31 other employees placed in counseling, were involved in that. Wilson said Uber gave her law firm “unfettered access” to people and documents that were needed for the Fowler investigation. Problems at Uber are not unusual in the technology industry, given the company’s size of more than 14,000 employees, said Wilson, whose firm has done similar work for the biggest tech companies in the nation. ____ AP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed from New York.

If you didn't get a change to tune into WWDC 2017, here's the 11 most important and interesting features: 1. Apps in iMessage will be easier to access All of your iMessage conversations are automatically synchronised with iCloud. That means now, when you sign into a new device, it’ll transfer all of your old messages over. This will save memory on your iPhone, as only the most recent messages are saved locally. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. 2.

So it’s not like you’re talking to a robot, and more like the film Her. You can also get it to translate languages. For example, you can now ask, ‘how do you say hello in Spanish’, and Siri will speak the answer for you. At launch you’ll get all of the biggest, hottest languages, including English, French, German and Chinese. Apple iOS 11: 11 new features coming to your iPhone and iPad Apple iOS 11: 11 new features coming to your iPhone and iPad (Slideshow provided by Pocket-lint) And, the virtual assistant will now take context into account when it’s suggesting content.

It’ll suggest an Facebook if you always wake up and check Facebook. This is synced across all devices. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. 4. Camera quality is improved and images take up less space First of all, images and videos are better compressed, so they’ll take up less storage space on your iPhone. That’s great news for anyone who’s a bit snap happy. Apple has also improved image quality in portrait mode, making it slightly better in low light, and app developers can use depth API, to use it in their apps. You can now play around with Live Photos. Changing basic things like trimming the length, automatically looping them, and selecting the keyframe. 5. Photos app uses machine learning to create Memories The Photos app now uses machine learning to automatically create memories (Albums) based on time and location. It’ll also learn what’s in the images, like a dog, for example, and create memories around that. 6. Major redesign to Control Centre Control Centre is now more use friendly, it makes changing these key functions super easy, and adds 3D touch for even more controls. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. 7. Apple Maps inside buildings Apple Maps will now give you more details about your location, well, if you’re in the US that is. Once you arrive at a mall “moll” or airport, Apple Maps will give you an internal map of the building.  This is US only at launch, and will roll out over time. 8. Speed Limit and Lane Guidance in Maps This one’s super useful. The iPhone, with Apple Maps, is now a much better sat nav replacement, with Speed Limits and Lane Guidance information when driving. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. 9. Do Not Disturb While Driving This is a great one for safety. You iPhone will use Bluetooth or WiFi to detect when you’re driving, and will suggest you turn on the Do Not Disturb While Driving mode. This turns off screen and will not give you notifications.  You can set it up to automatically send a text to people telling them that you’re driving, and it’s easy to turn off if you’re passenger. 10. HomeKit app now supports speakers Using AirPlay 2, Apple HomeKit will now allow you to create multi room audio setups in the Home app. This includes using your television and the Apple TV as an audio device. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. 11.

The streaming music service has 27 million paid users, Apple said this week at its developers’ conference. The series follows hopeful app developers on a journey to win $10 million in funding from LightSpeed Ventures Partners, which was an early investor in Snapchat. Apple’s efforts in commissioning its own shows has been tentative so far. IN addition to “POTA,” from Ben Silverman, Apple has also acquired James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke,” and exclusive rights to the documentary, “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives.” Silverman is the former co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and the producer of “The Office,” “Jane the Virgin” and other shows. “This show celebrates how hard it is to get apps made, executed and launched,” Silverman told The Post: “Apps have changed quotidien life.” He citied UberEats and the PBSKids as two frequently used in his home.

When Planet of the Apps producers Ben Silverman and Will.i.am first pitched their project to Apple, they went through much the same process as the app developers who would later appear on their show. "I didn't put them on an escalator," jokes Apple senior vp Eddy Cue, referencing the concept that a business pitch should only take as long as it would to ride an escalator, or elevator. Regardless, Cue was sold on the concept, which takes viewers into the process of developing a mobile app and then raising a round of venture capital. Not only would Planet of the Apps help promote Apple's App Store, but it fit with Apple's growing interest in offering original programming to build up the audience for its Apple Music service. Apple is putting that plan into action with Tuesday's premiere of Planet of the Apps. The first episode of the series, which screened earlier in the day at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, will hit Apple Music at 9 p.m. PT. The first episode will also be available for free on iTunes, as well as the Planet of the Apps website. Hosted by Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe, Planet of the Apps follows entrepreneurs as they prepare to pitch the venture capitalists at Lightspeed Venture Partners. Each episode starts with the developers making the case for their products in front of a panel of advisors — GOOP founder Gwyneth Paltrow, Honest Co. co-founder Jessica Alba, musician Will.i.am and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. After hearing each escalator pitch, the mentors vote on whether they want to hear more. "Yes" votes result in a longer demo of the apps with the goal of matching a mentor to each company. That's when the work begins. The advisors meet with the developers and help them strategize about their businesses, all in preparation for the VC pitch, which comes at the end of each episode. "We know what it's like to be in those rooms," says Alba of that final pitch process. "We know the good, the bad and the ugly of pitching your company. That's why we were so beneficial to them." While this entire process is condensed into a hourlong episode of television, the advisors explain that they actually worked with the companies for several weeks. "We spent lots of time with them, hours and hours of hacking away at the best way to pitch the company, how to monetize it, how to scale the business," says Alba, who recalls going through a similar process in the early years of Honest Co., which sells non-toxic baby products and other household goods. Long after shooting has ended, both Alba and Paltrow say they still talk to many of the entrepreneurs they met on the show. "I've developed really nice relationships with them, and some of them are bringing me on as an official advisor," says Paltrow. "I've had a great time; I've learned a lot." Each of the 10 episodes focuses on two mentors and two apps. The show is rolling out week-to-week in part to give the audience more time to download the apps featured in every episode. In fact, Apple will be promoting the show and its affiliated apps in its newly redesigned App Store. The show also is being featured on the Apple website. Apple has previously said that it is planning a stand-alone app for the show, though it has no updates on when that will launch. Apple has been making pilgrimages to Hollywood ever since the 2003 launch of iTunes, its effort to help legalize the online music marketplace. But with Planet of the Apps, the tech giant better known for making iPhones than hit television shows is dipping its toes into content production. Later this summer it will also release Carpool Karaoke, its spinoff of the popular segment on The Late Late Show With James Corden. The shows are being planned to bolster Apple Music, the company's $10-per-month streaming service. With 27 million subscribers, Apple Music still only has about half the paid base as rival Spotify's over 50 million members. Original programming is seen as one way to lure new users, a tactic that Spotify also explored last year when it released a slate of shortform, music-themed programs.  Though the usual questions for a new streaming player surround the launch of Apple's first original series — How many of Apple Music's 27 million subscribers will watch the show? Will it help draw new members the way original programming has done for Netflix? — Silverman says he relishes that uncertainty. It helps that he’s no stranger to being a part of Apple’s Hollywood experimentation. When he was an executive producer on The Office, he worked with Cue to help make the NBC comedy one of the first shows available for purchase on iTunes in 2005. "When you're part of something new, you'll have more attention and more noise," he says. "The conversation around your show becomes more important because you're not one of the thousands." But if Planet of the Apps does for Apple what many in Hollywood hope it will, it could end up being one of dozens of original shows that the tech company greenlights — though Cue says he uses the word "shows" loosely since Apple is also buying exclusive music videos, documentaries, concert videos and other mostly music-themed programming. That could mean a second season of Planet of the Apps, too. "I hope it's very successful," says Cue. "I think there are a lot of developer stories to tell."

Apple Inc. introduced Monday a music speaker, its first new hardware since Apple Watch was rolled out two years ago, at an annual gathering of software developers. (Xinhua) SAN FRANCISCO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Apple Inc. introduced Monday a music speaker, its first new hardware since Apple Watch was rolled out two years ago, at an annual gathering of software developers. To be "smart," the latest product in Apple's portfolio, known as HomePod, comes with a A8 microprocessor chip, the same power engine in the technology company's flagship iPhone smartphone and iPad tablet computer. To be available on the market in December this year, the compact wireless speaker has some identical functions offered by similar products made by other companies, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, but promises to produce higher quality sound. Activated by voice with Apple's natural language user interface Siri, it will have access to Apple Music, a music-streaming service. Although HomePod seems to be a more expensive competitor of Echo, which was released by Amazon.com two years ago, Apple's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook opened the Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, with an announcement that Prime Video, a video streaming service operated by Amazon.com, will be integrated into Apple TV, a digital media player and microconsole. At the event in San Jose, Northern California, not far from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Cook said his company now has 16 million registered software developers worldwide for its consumer electronics and 3 million of them were added last year. A parade of executives followed Cook unto the stage and unveiled a series of updates to Apple's hardware, software and mobile applications, or apps, including iMac desktop computer, MacBook laptop machine, iPad, Apple Watch, iOS software operating system and App Store. The company said its App Store has so far paid out 70 billion U.S. dollars to developers, of which 30 percent was made last year. Potentially indicative of what Apple probably will come up with its next smartphone, expected to come out later this year on the 10th anniversary of its initial rollout of iPhone, is its plan to release an augmented reality (AR) kit to developers, so as to encourage the creation of AR apps to work with the new device.    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next   KEY WORDS: Apple YOU MAY LIKE First Apple Store in southeast Asia opens in Singapore Nokia, Apple settle patent disputes, sign cooperation agreement Nepal's "apple capital" failing to meet rising demand for juiciest apples Apple Inc. allowed to road test self-driving vehicles in California Apple suppliers in China to use more renewable energy MORE PHOTOS Three giant pandas return to Chengdu from Japan to start new life Joseph Muscat sworn in as PM of Malta Taxi drivers launch voluntary drive for college entrance exam Mourning held for victims of London Bridge attack in London MOST VIEWED Scenery of Dongchuan Red Land in SW China's Yunnan Macaques attract tourists at scenic spot in SW China's Chongqing Monk runs on 135-meter-long thin plywood in water in SE China's Fujian Chinese submersible Jiaolong dives in Yap Trench Lotus flowers blooming in south China's Guangxi Musical held in Estonia to mark Int'l Children's Day Musicians of Moscow military music school take part in street concert Colorful salt lakes seen in Yuncheng city, China's Shanxi EXPLORE XINHUANET News China World Business Culture Edu Sports Sci Tech Health Entertainment Regions Asia & Pacific Americas Europe Africa Organizations North America Services Investment Doing Business Work in China Study in China Visit in China Live in China Emergency Weather More Photos Video In-depth Special Reports Corrections 010020070750000000000000011100001363428241

(Photo: Orlando Gutierrez) LIKE MANY MARRIED MEN, Norman Foster takes enormous pride in his garage. His is brand new, an immaculate structure made of German glass and polished Japanese mirror, built behind a petite 1902 palace in Madrid that has been refurbished to house the Norman Foster Foundation, an archive and research center inaugurated on June 1st, the illustrious British architect’s eighty-second birthday. The day before, itching to show the place off, Foster had some friends over. “Jony!” said Norman, greeting Jonathan Ive, the T-shirt wearing chief creative officer of Apple. The two tanned designers brought it in for a hug. Ive had just arrived, presumably from Apple’s new donut-shaped, Foster + Partners–designed headquarters in California. In short order the garage door, a two-and-a-half-ton slab of glass supported by one wheel, was pivoted open by four hired hands, sweeping past Umberto Boccioni’s Unique Forms of Continuity in Space, 1913, a Futurist man rushing in the direction of Le Corbusier’s original 1926 Voisin Lumineuse coach, which Foster acquired and had impeccably restored. The “Pavilion of Inspirations,” as it is referred to in press material, is a storehouse for memorabilia and miscellaneous Guy Stuff a dad, if he is wise, knows not to bring into the house. In the architect’s case, a large Andreas Gursky photograph of the Engadin ski marathon (Foster participates annually) and a large Robert Longo drawing of Russian fighter jets (Foster flies planes, the civilian type). Contained within a big vitrine are, among other mementos, miniature tensegrity structures and Dymaxion cars; models of Zeppelin blimps and Lionel model trains; an Olivetti typewriter; and, perhaps to tickle Ive, a first-generation iPhone. Come evening, the driveway played host to a cocktail reception. Ivorypress publisher Elena Ochoa Foster, the architect’s glamorous Spanish spouse, was parked between the front gate and the palace porch, wearing a gold Claude Lalanne collerette and oversized, squared-off glasses. She welcomed invitees with kisses and unreplicatable facial expressions. Foster had told me the choice to locate the foundation in Madrid was not determined, as many assume, by his wife’s nationality. But witnessing her cool, larger-than-life personality at the party—before wedding Foster, in 1996, she made a name for herself as a professor of psychopathology and the host of a TV show called Let’s Talk About Sex—it is hard to imagine it located anywhere else (let alone Brooklyn, which was under consideration along with Manhattan, Berlin, and London). Left: Outside the Norman Foster Foundation. (Photo: Nigel Young) Right: The Norman Foster Foundation. (Photo: Guillermo Rodríguez) Lord Foster, less comfortable with freeform conversation—he fidgeted with his white Apple Watch as we spoke—prefers to ground discussion in things. Fortunately, there were plenty of things inside the palace. A selection of Foster’s models and sketches are displayed in nine rooms across two floors, which the architect roamed, hobnobbing with esteemed guests like James Costos, the former United States Ambassador to Spain, and his partner, Michael S. Smith, the Obamas’ White House decorator; and billionaire captains of industry Alberto Cortina and Plácido Arango, companion of artist Cristina Iglesias, whose carbon-fiber canopy is suspended over the driveway. The usual accusation that architects are hopelessly complicit with power can’t be leveled against Foster: He is not some naive pawn of the powerful global elite but rather one of its members, with an estimated fortune of $220 million, according to last year’s Sunday Times Rich List. As for me, pitiful, unpedigreed freelancer—I was underdressed and underage. With a few exceptions—Ochoa and Foster’s two teenage children, and middle-aged old money like Pia Getty—the attendees were up there in years. Septuagenarian Bianca Jagger, dressed in a beige full-length coat and silver platforms, seemed spritely compared to the reclining bronze by Henry Moore next to her. By 8:30 the next morning, most of these eminences, plus legions of students, had packed the 1,700-seat Teatro Real. The foundation’s director, María Nicanor, who arrived from London’s V&A in January, kicked things off. Manuela Carmena, Madrid’s leftwing mayor, in her welcome, implored Foster to help “reduce inequality in our city.” But as the day went on, this plea for equality proved one of the few things the guru-participants—drawn from art, architecture, urbanism, academia, and the tech industry—could not care to imagine. Entitled “The Future Is Now,” the conference sought to demonstrate the foundation’s holistic, interdisciplinary approach to urgent global issues. The artists—except for Cornelia Parker, who kept it refreshingly kooky—spoke the studied managementese of consultants, discussing the “culture sector” (Olafur Eliasson) and its “very large return on investment” (Maya Lin). “First become a billionaire, then become a mayor,” advised Michael Bloomberg, who, after taking jabs at Trump, millennials, and other low-lifes, offered glowing endorsements of Elon Musk and similar visionaries. “You are one of them,” he said, gesturing to Foster, “Jeff Bezos is another one.” “The Future Is Now” conference at Teatro Real. (Photo: Orlando Gutierrez) Listening to Bloomberg and others talk, you start feeling like any apprehension about their future could not possibly be born of legitimate political or ideological difference. Instead, it’s some sort of character flaw—an indication of constitutional weakness. It took conservative historian and Ivy Leave TV pundit Niall Ferguson, part of the panel on technology, to shatter the liberal consensus. And that’s when things got bizarre. (Was I really agreeing with Henry Kissinger’s authorized biographer?) After sitting through a keynote by architect Matthias Kohler on robotic construction, a conversation between Financial Times managing editor Gillian Tett and a tight-lipped Jony Ive (“the change right now is… intoxicating”), and then a longwinded fried-eggs-versus-omelets analogy by MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, Ferguson pounced. “There’s other things to do with eggs,” he said, recalling how, the night before, Teslas chauffeuring conference participants were targeted by angry huevos-wielding cab drivers protesting Uber. The self-appointed “voice of doom,” Ferguson accused the people who work in technology of being historically ignorant, and warned of an impending backlash against their innovations by labor. “The rotten eggs have only just begun to fly!” Negroponte, giddy techno-optimist, dug in: “There is no question that twenty years from now, people will learn French by swallowing a pill.” What goes in must come out, and Foster, who in his opening keynote championed the great life-giving potential of sewage for urban agriculture, returned to fecal matters. “I was reminded that really there is a history of technology responding to crises,” he said in his closing remarks, explaining how The Great Stink of London (1858) was overcome by the construction of a new sewer system, and The Great Manure Crisis (1894) by the eventual transition from horses to automobiles. Will high-rise farms fertilized by human waste satiate growing urban populations and stave off ecological collapse? If there’s one thing optimists and pessimists can both agree on, it’s that the future is shit.  David Huber Permalink Comments diary picks must see critics' picks news video film passages slant Architecture Slant Performance artguide In Print Current Issue archives 500 words previews bookforum A & E 中文版 All rights reserved. artforum.com is a registered trademark of Artforum International Magazine, New York, NY
Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Is Apple’s $349 HomePod overpriced? Maybe… maybe not 06/06/2017 at 10:59 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments There was a very infomercial-like “how much would you expect to pay?” moment during yesterday’s unveiling of the Apple HomePod speaker. High-end WiFi speakers from companies like Sonos typically cost $300 to $500, while smart speakers like an Amazon Echo or Google Home tend to cost between $100 and $200. So you might expect to pay $400 to $700 for a HomePod which combines aspects of both, right? But no… the HomePod is “just” $349. If you’re comparing to the speaker to an Amazon Echo that’s a pretty steep premium. And that’s basically the comparison we all expected to make when rumors of a Siri-powered Apple speaker started making the rounds. But it might not really be the best comparison to make. Apple says HomePod doesn’t just sound better than Amazon or Google’s speakers. It designed HomePod to compete with premium WiFi speakers from Sonos and others. And while we’ll have to wait a while for detailed reviews from experts in home audio equipment, early impressions seem to be pretty positive. Plenty of tech journalists report that the HomePod is competitive, if not better than a Sonos speaker and makes the Echo and Google Home line of products seem like toys. Viewed in that light, it’s probably best to think of the HomePod as a premium speaker with built-in Siri functionality. That’s how it’s priced, and that’s allegedly how it sounds. And from that point of view, $349 is actually a pretty competitive price. Of course, not everyone wants to drop that kind of money on a single speaker. If all you want is a voice-activated device for news, weather, and traffic updates, question-and-answer, games, and maybe a little music thrown into the mix, Amazon and Google have much cheaper options to sell you. And since Amazon and Google are making their Alexa and Assistant software available to third-party developers, we could eventually see smart speakers that do sound just as good as a HomePod in the future. Just don’t expect them to be as affordable as today’s Google Home/Amazon Echo/Tap/Dot devices.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 5 Comments on "Is Apple’s $349 HomePod overpriced?

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. But the missing key here is that both Amazon and Google’s ecosystems have cheap and easy linking via industry standards to whatever speaker and amp anyone wants to use. New. Old. Vintage. Whatever you want. Amazon – Echo Dot leaves you about $300 to invest in that speaker/amp. Google – Home plus Chromecast leaves you about $200 for the same exercise. And that’s if you only want one speaker. Google with two speakers that sync if you want – $130 for Home and $70 for two Chromecasts. Now you’ve got $500 left to spend on speakers and amps against two Applepods @$350 each. Even worse, Google Assistant is on the verge of being everywhere so that $130 Google Home probably isn’t even necessary. You can probably just use the Chromecasts and whatever entry point for Google Assistant you want. That leaves over $300 after buying a Chromecast to buy something… Read more » Vote Up3Vote Down  Reply 1 day 22 hours ago Author Brad Linder Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Yeah, I sort of touched on the Echo Dot + speaker in my previous post, but didn’t feel like rewriting it today. But I do think that Apple has the chance to create a Sonos-like ecosystem here. HomePod might just be the first of many products. Perhaps they sell the 1st-gen model for $349 and it becomes sort of the home hub/speaker. Then in a year or so they start to offer $100 – $600 satellite speaker accessories that you can use to build out your whole-home sound system. Maybe there’ll even be a $50ish mic and cheap speaker that you can put anywhere in the house just for Siri interactions, while the good speakers are in just a few rooms, sort of like NVIDIA’s Spot accessories for the Shield TV. https://liliputing.com/2017/01/closer-look-2nd-gen-nvidia-shield-tv.html Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 22 hours ago Member peanut_throwaway Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Another point of interest is what connectivity Homepod has. I have not been able to find that out with a quick look around. If the only connectivity is through Apple software then that’s a real letdown. I would expect a good speaker properly taken care of to last for many more years than even Apple will be supporting this product with software I’d suspect. I currently listen quite often to stuff via a Chromecast Audio into a Tivoli Pal speaker I’ve owned for some time. I couldn’t even tell you how long at this point. 20 years? Something like that anyway. It sat on a shelf for a number of years doing nothing but collecting dust since radio reception is lacking where I live now and I also just don’t listen to much local… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 17 hours 40 minutes ago Guest epinoa Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Credit: Apple     Apple has unveiled its "HomePod" speaker as it moves to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home as a smart home and music hub. HomePod, powered Apple's Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. "It's so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. HomePod will taking Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod an potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads.

Tweet Share Email Print Back to Home page Apple Bottom Jeans Foto Won Photo HARRINGTON, Del. - Kdk Standardbreds' Apple Bottom Jeans ($7, Montrell Teague) overcame outside post number eight for a win in the $17,500 Mares Open harness racing feature Tuesday at Harrington Raceway. Empress Deo assumed the early lead from St Kitts to an opening quarter in 27.4 seconds. St. Kitts re-took the lead and was the boss to the half mile in 56.3 seconds while Sweet Bobbie attacked first over to the three-quarters mark in 1:25.1. Mosquito Blue Chip circled three wide on the final turn while Purrfect Bags flanked four wide in a stirring stretch finish, but it was Apple Bottom Jeans who was widest of all and outkicked her rivals for the win. Purrfect Bags was second with Mosquito Blue Chip third. Trained by Kevin Switzer, "Apple" notched her fifth seasonal win and put her over the $80,000 mark in seasonal earnings. Apple Bottom Jeans had been racing in New York (Yonkers) for the past month before returning to her home state. It's not often the top four finishers on a half-mile racetrack have the outside posts, but it happened in this case as the top four finishers in order by post position were 8-7-6-5. Teague and Tony Morgan each had three wins on the program. Delaware Standardbred Breeders Fund action will commence Monday June 12 with three $20,000 divisions of pacing colts and geldings in action. Tuesday June 13 will feature the first leg of pacing fillies and Wednesday June 14 will highlight the trotters. The $100,000 finals will be contested on July 27. Matthew Sparacino Comment (...)

The update also includes refinements to Photos, Safari and Mail. “macOS High Sierra delivers important forward-looking technologies and new opportunities for developers wanting to tap into the power of machine learning and create immersive VR content on the Mac,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “The core technology innovations in macOS High Sierra, combined with our advances in hardware, will continue to push the Mac forward in exciting new ways.” VR or Virtual Reality is a key component to the underpinnings of macOS Sierra, now making it possible for more powerful Macs to run VR applications. Leading VR companies are joining Apple to drive VR innovation on the Mac with features coming later this year — Valve is optimizing their SteamVR platform for macOS and enabling connection of the HTC Vive headset, while Unity and Epic are bringing their VR development tools to macOS.  macOS High Sierra will be available as a public beta and will be a free upgrade for Macs this fall.

Yesterday, Apple releases its first original series, Planet of the Apps, starring the two successful Hollywood businesswomen, rapper Will.i.am and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Would-be inventors partnering with the four will design and show off apps that help people shop, exercise or look after friends in a series that looks a lot like The Voice or Top Chef. With US$250 billion (RM1.06 trillion) in cash and securities sloshing around, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant could have tackled online powerhouses like Netflix or Amazon. Instead, the company is starting small and staying close to what it does well, challenging Spotify and Google’s YouTube with a slate of new videos about music and technology. “This show will echo and reflect a cultural transformation in our society led by technology companies like Apple,” said Ben Silverman, an executive producer of Planet of the Apps. With the new videos, Apple’s aims to get fans watching on their iPhones, which deliver almost two-thirds of the company’s sales. Planet of the Apps will be available only on Apple Music, the two-year-old music streaming service that now has 27 million subscribers. To stand out against competitors, Apple has developed programmes that include a spinoff of the popular late-night skit Carpool Karaoke and a documentary about record mogul Clive Davis. It’s also adding a new TV and Movies tab. ‘Office’ producer Silverman, a Hollywood veteran who produced the US version of the hit TV series The Office, one of the first shows available for sale on the iTunes store, has been pushing Apple to get into video for years. The growing importance of video streaming via set-top boxes, phones and tablets has led analysts to speculate the company may buy a movie or TV studio. Eddy Cue, an Apple senior vice president and the company’s conduit to Hollywood, downplays those ambitions. On frequent visits to Los Angeles, he presses studios to make theatrical films available on iTunes sooner. He’s also pushing a new TV app on Apple TV, the popular set-top box that consumers use to watch Netflix and other streaming services. “Apps have truly changed the world,” he said. “When you look at apps, they are a cultural phenomenon all over the place,” Cue said. In episode one of Planet of the Apps, aspiring entrepreneurs present their creations to the show’s four judges: Alba, Paltrow, Will.i.am and Vaynerchuk. They probe for weaknesses and strengths before deciding if they want to mentor the contestants. Developing ideas Each judge spent weeks helping their proteges develop ideas and features in preparation for a pitch to a venture capital firm, Lightspeed Venture Partners, an early backer of Snap Inc. For the hosts, it was an opportunity to display a side less known to consumers. “I was nervous about it,” said Alba, who’s insisted she’s more comfortable playing a character in front of the camera than herself in a reality show. “This is how I think. This is how I operate. This is what motivates me. It was very intimate.” Apple is sparing no expense to ensure people know about the show. The company screened the program Tuesday at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, to coincide with the public debut, and will promote the show with billboards, TV commercials and wall-to-wall advertisements across iTunes, its App store and its website. The campaign will last for weeks. There are 10 episodes in total — one will appear on Apple Music each week until the first season concludes. Apple’s involvement was a draw for both Paltrow and Alba. The show gave each a chance to showcase their business acumen — Paltrow co-founded Goop, a media and lifestyle brand, while Alba started Honest Co. Will.i.am., a member of the rap group Black Eyed Peas, was an early investor in Beats Electronics, which Apple bought for US$3 billion. Vaynerchuk co-founded VaynerMedia, which counsels companies on social media practices and marketing. “I felt much more comfortable doing it with Apple than a broadcast network,” Paltrow said in an interview. — Bloomberg                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Silicon Valley’ star Thomas Middleditch hops aboard ‘Godzilla’ cast ‘The Kid from the Big Apple’ to screen at Italian film fest Big Bang’s TOP in critical condition, doctor says TLC drop first music video in 10 years with ‘Way Back’ (VIDEO) Harry Shum Jr joins cast of ‘Crazy Rich Asians' ‘Silicon Valley’ star Thomas Middleditch hops aboard ‘Godzilla’ cast Big Bang’s TOP in critical condition, doctor says Andy Lau announces plans to tour in 2018 Big Bang’s TOP tests positive for marijuana during military service Comedian Kathy Griffin says her career is over after gory Trump photo (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Senders also have the option of marking a message 'urgent' to bypass it Victor Barreiro Jr. @vbarreirojr Published 8:10 AM, June 06, 2017 Updated 8:11 AM, June 06, 2017 The 2017 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC 2017) provided a lot of different bits and bobs that Apple fans could really get into. Chances are, many people are salivating over the new hardware upgrades and operating system improvements. (Read: Apple 'HomePod' speaker to take on Amazon, Google) They're great and all, but they were expected. Whether you're a Windows, Apple, or Android fan, "more power!" or "better efficiency!" tends to be the name of the game every year. What definitely caught me by surprise, however, was one little change in iOS 11 that could very well save my life or the lives of my loved ones in the future. It's called "Do Not Disturb While Driving." The new feature, which will be part of iOS 11, is an automatic setting that will come with the operating system upgrade. It will determine if you are in a moving vehicle and will essentially prevent people in cars from using their phones. People sending messages to a user will receive automated messages telling them the phone's owner is driving at the moment. They can also bypass the function by denoting their message as urgent. Those not in the driver seat can also tell their phone they aren't driving, allowing passengers to use their phones normally. Now, I'm a bit of a neurotic person, and I get an itch to answer messages when I hear beeps. Even though I can fight the urge to respond, it leaves me agitated or distracted. While "Do Not Disturb" modes already have their place on all sorts of phones and tablets on both iOS and Android, I'm usually also afraid to leave a work or personal message unanswered or leave people in the dark about my activity. Automatic replies and urgency tags for messages are a step forward to providing peace of mind for people like myself, and would also let family members know you're busy. Of course, for Filipinos reeling from the lopsided implementation and suspension of the Anti-Distracted Driving Act, this is a technical solution to a very human problem. It creates its own feedback loop, and hopefully, disciplines Apple users into ignoring their phones during drives. I look forward to seeing iOS 11 and potentially buying a new iPhone (assuming more powerful and robust phones this year), just for this one feature alone. – Rappler.com Filed under:2017 WWDC•Apple•Do Not Disturb While Driving•WWDC•WWDC 2017•iOS 11 HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller speaks during the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP CALIFORNIA, USA – Apple on Monday, June 5, unveiled its "HomePod" speaker as it moved to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home as a smart home and music hub. HomePod, powered Apple's Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual developers conference. (Read: My favorite from WWDC 2017: an auto-reply feature while user drives) "It's so cool, we really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said of the new device. HomePod will be taking on Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have been building momentum in the market for voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. HomePod is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the Siri team at Apple had tuned the assistant into a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, who said the team worked to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. Playing to strength HomePod capped a keynote presentation at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference that included updates to its iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs available on HomePod. "Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri," said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. "The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market so far." Some industry insiders, however, note that Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Amazon has dominated the category of connected speakers since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods or rides and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6% of the US market, compared with 23.8% for Google Home and 5.6% for others including Lenovo, LG, Harmon Kardon and Mattel. Macs and iPads Cook used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan's devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named "High Sierra" in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and "intelligent tracking prevention" that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple provided a look at an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. The iMac Pro was to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999. Apple told the developers they were overhauling the App Store, giving it a fresh look, and beginning to add the floor plans of shops and airports to its mapping program. Apple also released a software kit so developers could infuse augmented reality into applications for iPhones or iPads. Given the hundreds of millions of Apple mobile devices in use, that will create the largest augmented reality platform in the world "overnight," executives said. – Rappler.com Filed under:High Sierra•HomePod•internet of things•smart speaker•speaker•Apple HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Apple's computers get Intel's latest chip, the Kaby Lake processors. Screenshot from Apple Apple unveiled their hardware and software future at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), bringing out upgraded computers, operating systems, and one new product, the HomePod. There's no new iPhone though. In its place? These 10 announcements that show us the refinements the US tech titan has in store for consumers in the near future. 1) MacBooks, iMacs refreshed Apple's popular laptop line gets a shot in the arm in the form of Intel's latest chips, Kaby Lake and support for twice the RAM. The MacBook, MacBook Pro, and the MacBook Air are now all available with the Kaby Lake chips. The 12-inch MacBook will also now be available with faster solid-state drives (SSD); the 13-inch Pro will now be offered in a Touch Bar-free version; and the 15-inch version will now carry discrete graphics as a standard feature. REFRESHED. Apple gives their laptops a boost this year. Screenshot from Apple The MacBook Air has also finally stepped onto 2017, shaking off some of the cobwebs it's collected since its 2015 upgrade. It's still the entry-level MacBook many have come to know but at least now it's available with a 1.8GHz Intel processor – a bump-up from its 1.6GHz days. Like the MacBook Air, the iMacs were due for an upgrade, having been last updated in 2015 as well. The new all-in-ones get the Kaby Lake treatment, along with a display that Apple calls "the best Mac display ever," and 2 Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, thus making them the first iMacs to use the port standard. The 21.5-inch model can carry up to 32GB of RAM while the 27-incher can carry up to 64GB. They will come with a variety of AMD Radeon Pro graphics cards to choose from with the entry-level 21.5-inch model carrying an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU. US prices start at $1,299 for the MacBook and the Pro; $999 for the Air; $1,099 for the 21.5-inch iMac; and $1,799 for the 27-inch iMac. The iMacs are also now available in the US. 2) Indoor maps Apple Maps now features indoor mapping, a feature that maps out the inside of locations such as malls and airports. It's currently limited, however, to malls in select cities including Chicago, Hong Kong, New York, Boston, London, and Tokyo. Around thirty airports will be available in its launch window such as John F. Kennedy Airport and La Guardia in New York, and London Heathrow Airport. 3) "Do Not Disturb While Driving" iOS 11 feature You might have seen the navigation app Waze stop you from inputting a location while driving. Apple's taking the concept of anti-distracted driving functionalities to a new level as it blacks out your screen and block notifications when it detects that you're driving. It also sends automated responses to message senders, telling them that the user is currently driving. (READ: My favorite from WWDC 2017: an auto-reply feature while user drives) Users may set certain contacts as important so their messages bypass the blocking, and can also exit the mode should they want to. 4) The most powerful Apple computer ever? For the new iMac Pro, the specs speak for themselves: up to an 18-core Intel Xeon processor, a 27-inch 5K display, an AMD Radeon Vega GPU, up to 16GB of VRAM, up to 128 GB of ECC RAM (a type of RAM that detects and corrects some forms of data corruption), and up to 4TB of SSD storage. US prices start at $4,999 when it ships in December 2017. Apple called it their most powerful computer ever. 5) Apple gets serious with virtual reality, announces native support for HTC Vive and Steam VR Apple announced that their new graphics API, Metal 2, is VR-friendly and has been optimized to make programming virtual reality-based applications easier. With "Metal for VR" shipping with new macOS High Sierra, Apple and its computing devices now have official support for VR headset HTC Vive and the software behind the headset, SteamVR. VR development engines Unity and Unreal will now be natively supported as well. 6) Improvements to Camera and Photos apps Apple's new iOS 11 – now available to developers, while the public beta phase is expected later this year – introduces optical image stabilization for Portrait mode; "Loop" and "Bounce" effects similar to Instagram's video-looping Boomerang feature; and a "Long Exposure" feature for Live Photos that lets one animate a part of an image i.e. running water. One Intriguing tweak is iOS 11's new image file format, known as the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) which claims to be able to encode images taken with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in a smaller file size. 7) Apple smart speaker HomePod to bank on high-quality audio Apple squeezes into the intensifying smart speaker wars with its HomePod. Its big sell: its supposedly amazing sound. It's equipped with a seven-speaker array of tweeters, an upward-facing subwoofer, and "spatial awareness" tech, which is supposed to optimize the sound depending on the space in which the speaker is placed in. (READ: Apple 'HomePod' speaker to take on Amazon, Google) Like Amazon Echo and Google Home, the Siri and Apple A8 chip-powered speaker will be able to answer voice queries, give reminders, and send iMessages. The speaker has a six-microphone array, which Apple claims is able to hear commands even from afar and amid high audio volume. 8) Siri gets a more natural voice In iOS 11, Apple says they've refined Siri's voice to be more natural, making the digital assistant more human-sounding through variances in intonation, pitch, emphasis and tempo. Apple's engineering head Craig Federighi illustrated this by saying how Siri will read out the weather forecast for a number of days. Instead of saying "sunny" in just one way, it will try to intonate each instance differently to replicate, more or less, how humans would speak. Apple says Siri's smarter now, able to translate English words and phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish on the fly, and makes use of machine learning to deliver personalized suggestions based on a person's usage of their device. 9) iPad Pro now has a 10.5-inch version The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is gone while the 12.9-inch version gets upgraded. Both 10.5- and 12.9-incher are equipped with a new A10X six-core CPU, which includes a 12-core GPU. They both support HDR video with a 120Hz refresh rate. The first generation iPad Pros' variable refresh rate reached a maximum of 60Hz. The higher refresh rate is crucial not just for displaying smooth motion but also for smoother Apple Pencil use. Apple's stylus, the Pencil, is also now the fastest digital pen in the world, with a response rate of 20 milliseconds (ms), beating out Microsoft Surface Pen's 21ms. The new Pro is also said to be 50% brighter than earlier models, and has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 7-megapixel front camera. The 9.7-inch Pro, discontinued upon the announcement of the new models, also had a 12-megapixel rear shooter but only a 5-megapixel front camera. US prices start at $649 for the 10.5-incher and $799 for the 12.9-incher, and they will start shipping in the US next week. 10) WatchOS 4 arrives Along with MacOS High Sierra for the MacBooks and iMacs and iOS 11 for iPhones and iPads, Apple also unveiled its new OS for its wearables: WatchOS 4. It will have a new Siri watchface that uses machine learning to show you information it believes is most relevant to you, and for Disney fans, Toy Story watchfaces. WatchOS 4 also promises better integration with connected gym equipment such as near-field communication (NFC) linking and deeper integration. – Rappler.com Filed under:apple•apple keynote speech•high sierra•imac 2017•ios11•ipad pro 2017•macbook 2017•watchos 4•wwdc 2017 biggest announcements•wwdc announcements•wwdc 2017 HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:05 AM, June 7, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Apple’s new HomePod speaker may be music to the ears of its loyal fans, but how much it can crank up volume in the smart speaker market remains to be heard. Apple unveiled its long-awaited HomePod at its annual developers conference taking place this week in the heart of Silicon Valley, enticing lovers of its products with a high-end offering in a market dominated by lower-priced devices from Amazon and Google. Analysts are yet to be convinced that HomePod will rock the smart speaker market the way iPhones came to rule the smartphone world and iPods dominated MP3 players. “If we are comparing this to Apple’s past successes, it doesn’t fit that model,” said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. “This product is much more of a me-too offering.” There was no overwhelming differentiation in HomePod, according to the analyst. But he saw a big negative — it is more expensive. HomePod, infused with machine smarts by Siri digital assistant, will be priced at US$349 (S$481) when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain. HomePod will take on Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the Internet and more. Amazon sells Echo devices for US$179, and smaller “Dot” versions for US$50. Google sells Home for US$180, promoting the smart speakers with discounts. HOMEPOD’S TUNE Apple played up the rich speaker quality of HomePod, and synched it with the company’s music service that boasts 27 million subscribers. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company’s Siri team tuned the virtual assistant as a “musicologist” that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the Internet cloud. The speaker has the “power to rock the house,” according to Mr Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a voice-commanded assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. “Apple’s base should like it, because they are committed to the ecosystem,” Mr Enderle said of HomePod. “If you are paying the extra money because Apple is requiring you to do so to access your stuff, that is the Apple tax and it is the kind of thing that people don’t like.” HomePod combined elements of Echo and Sonos smart speakers, known for rich sound quality, according to Reticle Research principal analyst Ross Rubin. Apple lovers already tend to be “premium product buyers”, and may not flinch at paying more for what they believe is a superior quality product, said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. JUST A GLIMPSE Mr Blau suspected Apple only gave a glimpse at its vision for HomePod, noting its potential to be a command centre for smart houses and to mesh with iPhones, iPads, online services and more. “We have to imagine there is going to be more there,” Mr Blau said. “Is it going to be an Echo killer? A Google Home killer? We are going to have to wait and see. Apple be saving some insights into HomePod for later this year when it is expected to unveil a tenth-anniversary edition of the iPhone. Since HomePod will not hit the market until December, it is unlikely to catch much of the year-end holiday shopping wave and post big sales this year, according to Mr Blau. “I think, over time, they are going to do just fine in this category but it is going to take a while,” the analyst said. “I don’t think it will be the next iPhone,” Mr Blau said of HomePod, “but, Apple could gain share and be a leader.” In a blog post Technalysis Research founder Bob O’Donnell depicted Apple’s latest product news as an affirmation that the company has not fallen behind competitors and is working to take advantage of potentially exciting new technologies. But Mr O’Donnell also expressed scepticism on Apple’s ability to dominate this new segment. “Yes, some songs may sound pleasing, but for true audiophiles who actually want to hear what the artist and producer intended, Apple’s positioning of the HomePod as super high-quality speaker is going to be a very tough sell,” Mr O’Donnell said in a blog post.

Related Apple set to unveil Siri-powered speaker as California conference kicks off Apple's HomePod speaker will 'reinvent music' Apple made a host of new software and hardware announcements at its annual WWDC. While essentially a developer conference, it gives customers a sneak peek at upcoming products and software features — all of which will also be available in India towards the end of 2017 and early 2018. Hitesh Raj Bhagat & Karan Bajaj take you through the major announcements HomePod This is Apple’s new connected home speaker with a focus on audio quality. It’s powered by Apple’s A8 processor that enables all sorts of software audio wizardry. Inside the small enclosure, HomePod hides a 4-inch long-throw woofer, seven tweeters (each with their own amplifier), and six microphones. A prototype of Apple's new HomePod is displayed during the 2017 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC). (Image: AFP) HomePod is spatially aware, which means that it maps the room in which it is placed to optimise the audio output. Using Siri, you can play music and ask questions regarding news, weather, traffic, ask it to read your messages, set reminder/alarms/timers and so on. If you have two HomePod speakers, they will automatically work in tandem with each other. Priced at US$ 349, the HomePod is expected to launch sometime December this year, so we expect it to reach India early 2018. iMac Pro The biggest surprise from the event was the new iMac Pro that will come in a darker Space Grey as compared to the typical silver. It challenges the perception that you can’t fit a super-powerful, workstation-class computer into an all-in-one design. It’s also built to cater to the needs of power-hungry folks who have been complaining of lack of upgrades to the Mac Pro line. It has a 27-inch 5k display and is the first iMac to offer 10Gb Ethernet and 4 Thunderbolt ports. Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President Software Engineering speaks under a projection image of an iMac computer. (Image: Reuters) This means you can connect two additional 5k displays and 2 RAID storage drives simultaneously. In addition, the iMac Pro comes with Vesa mount option for those who want to mount it to a wall. You can get it with a choice of 8, 10 or 18 core Intel Xeon processor, up to 128GB RAM and up to 4TB SSD storage. Moreover, it will come with the workstation-class Radeon Vega GPU with up to 16GB dedicated memory. Other features include a 1080p FaceTime camera, UHS-II SDXC card slot, stereo speakers, four microphones, 4 x USB 3.0 ports, WiFi ac and Bluetooth 4.2. iMac Pro will be available from December onwards and will be priced at US$ 5,000 for the base variant (8-core, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Radeon Vega GPU with 8GB memory). The box includes a new Magic Keyboard with numeric keypad and Magic Mouse 2 — both of which are in a matching Space Grey colour. iOS 11 — A BIG UPDATE WITH NEW FEATURES ACROSS THE BOARD new features added to iPhones, iPod Touch and iPads — some that are mentioned up front and some that you will find out for yourself. For starters, there’s a big push for augmented reality (AR) and the ARKit for developers will help them build new experiences in time for the full release of iOS 11. Siri will sound a lot better (both male and female voices) because the voice will be more natural and expressive. There’s a ton of machine learning that goes into something so small. There’ll be new camera features, a new image file format (smaller size), updates to Apple Maps (with maps for airports and shopping malls around the world) and AirPlay 2 (with support for multi room audio). Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller speaks during the opening keynote address. (Image: AFP) A new feature called Do Not Disturb While Driving is quite interesting. iPhone will automatically detect if you are moving in a car and switch off all notifications (and distractions). If you’re in a car but not driving, you can tell it so and it will open up all features. Someone who texts you will get an auto-response mentioning that you’re driving. In case someone is trying to reach you urgently, they only need to reply ‘urgent’ and the phone will let it through! And iPads get a host of exclusive features too. There’s a new customisable dock (quite like OS X) that lets you quickly switch between apps or start side-by-side apps (split view). There’s a new Files app that shows you all your files, whether they’re stored on the device storage or your choice of cloud provider. There’s many new features in the Notes app and support for drag-and-drop across the system. This update will make the iPad line a lot more powerful for someone who wants to use it as a computer replacement. iOS 11 will be a free update later this year on all iPhone (5s and later), all iPad Air and iPad Pro models, iPad 5th generation, iPad mini 2 and later and iPod Touch 6th gen. If you have a paid developer account, you can download the developer beta right away. A free public beta will be available for all users later this month. Revamped App Store The new app store will make it easier for you to discover new apps and games. The new Today tab will showcase the apps better with larger images and videos. Other tabs include apps, games, updates (shows you what’s changed in the latest update) and search (shows details of in-app purchases). WatchOS 4 This new update for Apple Watch gives Siri new capabilities and enhances the fitness features. There’s a new Siri watch face that updates with information from your favourite apps and shows you relevant information at different times of day. This could include activity, alarms, Breathe, Calendar, Maps, Reminders and news snippets from the Apple News app. Other new watch faces include a Kaleidoscope and faces with characters from Toy Story (Woodie, Jessie, Buzz Lightyear). As for fitness, it includes auto-sets for pool workouts and new motion and heart rate algorithms for High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) workouts. WatchOS 4 will be a free update for all Apple Watches that are paired with iPhone 5s (or later) that have been upgraded to iOS 11. New Apple iPad Pro Apple has announced the new iPad Pro in two display variants — 10.5-inch (2,224 x 1668 pixels) and 12.9-inch (2,732 x 2048 pixels). This is step up from the conventional 9.7-inch screen because of slimmer bezels. Apple says that the width this new screen offers is enough for a full-size on-screen keyboard that should be more comfortable to type on. Having said that, there will also be new keyboard covers and covers with built in storage for the Apple Pencil. The Pencil stays the same as before. Both devices have slim bezels, 600 nits brightness, HDR video support and 120Hz refresh rate. Both variants come with a new hexa core A10X fusion chip, M10 coprocessor and storage has been bumped up as well. The base variant gets 64GB storage, midrange is 256GB and the top-end gets a massive 512GB. The camera is the same as on the iPhone 7: a 12MP camera with f1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization while the front gets a 7MP camera with f2.2 aperture. Other common features include TouchID fingerprint scanner, four speakers that auto-adjust, dual microphones, optional LTE, WiFi and Bluetooth wireless connectivity. As is usual for iPads, these will also deliver up to 10 hours of battery life. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro is priced at US$ 649 onwards while the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is US$799 onwards. Mac OSX High Sierra The latest version of Apple’s desktop operating system includes a new file system, high efficiency video coding (HEVC) and support for virtual reality content creation (powered by the new hardware upgrades). The new file system is simply called Apple File System (APFS) but don’t be worried – it is fully compatible with the previous HFS system but offers numerous advantages such as faster data transfers, native encryption and protection of data in case of power failure or system crashes. The Annual Hardware Refresh In line with the yearly hardware refresh, Apple has updated the MacBook and iMac line-up with the latest 7 th generation Intel Core processors. The iMac also gets improved displays, support for VR, up to 64GB RAM, up to 2TB Fusion drives and new AMD Radeon Pro GPUs. Prices for the new iMac start at US$ 1,100. For the MacBooks, the main upgrade is the new processor along with faster solid state memory drives. Prices for the MacBook starts at US$ 1,299 while the MacBook with TouchBar starts at US$ 1,799. We expect the upgraded variants to launch in India very soon. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter. You can also follow us on Facebook and Twitter.

Club MacStoriesWeekly Extras MENU ABOUT PODCAST NEWSLETTER ADVERTISE SECTIONS APP REVIEWS IPAD DIARIES STORIES APPLE HISTORY IOS AUTOMATION GAMES Readdle Brings Split View Drag & Drop to Their iPad Apps iOS 11: iPad Wishes and Concept Video Things 3: Beauty and Delight in a Task Manager This week's sponsor FlightLogger Real-time flight tracking for worry free travels. iOS 11: The MacStories Overview By MacStories Team At this year's WWDC keynote event, Tim Cook took the stage in San Jose to reveal the eleventh major version of Apple's flagship mobile operating system. iOS 11 includes a number of improvements across the board, but with significant emphasis placed on increasing productivity for the iPad. Alongside the storm of iPad-specific features, the next version of iOS will also bring advancements to the Lock screen and Control Center interfaces. Built-in apps and services such as Maps, App Store, Notes, Messages, Podcasts, Music, Siri, and more received individual updates — some more comprehensive than others. The new ARKit and Core ML frameworks were announced as well, giving us our first tangible examples of Apple's investments in AR and developer-friendly machine learning. Despite a decade in the wild, in many ways iOS is still a young operating system. It's good to see Apple not resting on its laurels, but instead continuing to reevaluate and redesign the areas of the OS that need it — such as iPad productivity features and the App Store. The ground-breaking potential for iPad users in iOS 11 shows just how much that aspect of the system has been neglected, but many of the other changes show how Apple's slow refinements over years are paying off. Below you'll find a detailed look at what Apple is unabashedly calling "turning iOS up to 11." iPad Productivity Ryan: Craig Federighi called iOS 11 the largest iOS release for iPad ever, and that's no exaggeration. The next major version of iOS provides iPad users with an upgraded Dock, improved multitasking, systemwide drag and drop, a powerful file system, and enhancements to Apple Pencil and the software keyboard.1 Dock and Multitasking iOS users know the Dock as the space at the bottom of the screen where a select number of frequently used apps live. Historically, the Dock on iOS has been relatively featureless – it allows you to quickly access your favorite apps from any navigation screen, but nothing more. But with the changes coming to iOS 11, the iPad's Dock is getting upgraded to more closely resemble its macOS counterpart, with a few special multitasking benefits to boot. The first change worth noting with the iPad's new Dock in iOS 11 is that it can hold a lot more apps than before. Similar to the Dock on macOS, now the Dock can feature a screen-wide assortment of your most important apps. This is supplemented by a new predictive area on the right-hand side of the Dock, which offers suggestions based on what app it believes you'll want to launch next – including Continuity apps. Besides its added space for more apps, the iPad's Dock is also more accessible than ever before. No longer confined to your Home screen, the Dock can be invoked while inside any app by sliding up from the bottom of the screen – a gesture formerly assigned to bring up Control Center. This provides quick, easy access to all of your most-used apps systemwide so you can switch apps without needing to return to the Home screen. In addition to providing a quick way to switch apps, the Dock also allows you to engage in multitasking by dragging an app directly out of its docked icon and on to a select portion of the screen, effectively opening the second app in Slide Over. Once this second app is floating above your primary app in Slide Over, you can tap and hold it to drag it along a horizontal plane – it can either come to rest on the right or left-hand side of the screen. If you'd like to make that app a permanent fixture on your screen, you can choose to have it lock into Split View on the side of the screen where you placed it. For all apps found in the Dock, this is a tremendous upgrade in multitasking behavior over the previous app picker, enabling quicker access to the right apps and more flexibility in the way you configure those apps – including options for the app on either side to be in 1/3 or 2/3 view. The multitasking features of the Dock join with a newly redesigned App Switcher to provide even greater multitasking improvements over past versions of iOS. When sliding the Dock up from the bottom of the screen, if you continue dragging further upward, you will invoke the new App Switcher. This redesigned App Switcher can contain not only other apps, but also app spaces. Similar to the spaces found in macOS, any screen setup of two apps side-by-side can be saved as a space in the new App Switcher, allowing you to create custom screen setups for different tasks on the iPad. The App Switcher is also, interestingly, now home to iOS 11's redesigned Control Center. Overall, the iPad's new App Switcher shares a lot in common with the Mac's Mission Control feature, and it works well in its iOS form. iOS 11's updates to multitasking seem to provide iPad users exactly what they've long hoped for. The Dock is a clever importation of a familiar Mac concept, and the new App Switcher is sure to make iPad power users quickly forget about its unfortunate predecessor. Multitasking on iPad has new and greatly improved days ahead. Drag and Drop Touch screens have long provided a more intimate form of interaction with content than is possible using a trackpad and cursor. Yet despite that, the ability to intuitively drag and drop items across different apps has been lacking on iPad, the touch device best suited for it. That changes in iOS 11, with robust drag and drop support offered in a touch-enhanced form. In its keynote presentation, Apple showcased drag and drop being used to do things like move images, text, and URLs between different apps – and in more ways than one. The simplest method is simply to tap on content and drag it from one app in Split View into the app on the other side of your screen. But the feature can also be used to drag content from an app on screen into an app that isn't currently on screen. This can be done by bringing up the new App Switcher and dragging your content into an app that resides there. The richness of dragging and dropping content across not only current apps, but also those in the App Switcher, is made possible thanks to drag and drop's multitouch support. With multitouch, you can select some content, then use other fingers or your other hand to select additional content, and pull up the Dock or the App Switcher to navigate to wherever you'd like to drop that content – all in one swift action. Despite being one of the more impressive technical achievements in iOS 11, there isn't a lot else to say about drag and drop right now other than that it's here, and it looks fantastic. Time and testing will provide more details on the specifics of its implementation in iOS, but assuming it works as advertised, Apple has created an elegant, intuitive, and capable method of drag and drop that's perfectly suited for iPad. Files File management on iOS has a new name: Files. Gone are the days of the iCloud Drive app; it has been replaced by the more powerful Files, which resembles macOS's Finder in the way it provides rich organization tools and can integrate with third-party cloud storage providers like Dropbox, Google Drive, and more. Files is truly a Finder equivalent on iOS – and then some. As I mentioned, you can set up all of your third-party cloud services inside of Files, making it a unified hub for all file management needs. Every file you have, across all your cloud providers, accessible in one place. This unification of files benefits from the new Recents tab of the app, which shows all of the most recently updated files across the entire Files app, no matter which providers those files come from. Another highlight of Files is its expanded organization tools. Unlike the iCloud Drive app, Files includes support for tagging files – a feature macOS has had since El Capitan. It also includes a new Favorites section where you can keep any folders you need quick access to. There is also an expanded line of options for sorting or filtering through files, making it easier to find what you need. One way that the Files app takes advantage of drag and drop is that if it's in your Dock, you can tap and hold on its icon to view a handful of your most recent files, each of which can be picked up and moved into another app. Files also features rich drag and drop support for selecting multiple items at once, and moving them around into different folders or tag assignments. Apple has long been resistant to the idea of adopting traditional approaches to file management on iOS. The previous iCloud Drive app merely served as a half-baked, limited imitation of the Mac's Finder. I'm thankful that the company has changed course and provided a rich, powerful solution like Files on both iPad and iPhone. Implementing a system that's more familiar to legacy options should make it easier for more people to transition from Mac to iPad, should they desire to do so. Pencil and Keyboard Enhancements Rounding out the iPad-specific improvements in iOS 11 are enhancements to the Apple Pencil and the software keyboard. The Apple Pencil is now more deeply integrated into a number of areas across iOS. Paired with the new Create PDF system-wide action extension, Instant Markup is a powerful tool to easily annotate content from a variety of apps. The Markup feature found in iOS 10 has been upgraded with more tools that mimic those found in Apple Notes' sketching feature, and it's more streamlined too. With Instant Markup, there are less taps required to annotate a document – simply press the Pencil to the screen and mark away. Instant Markup is especially helpful when you want to annotate a screenshot. By default, after you take a screenshot in iOS 11 that screenshot's thumbnail will appear at the bottom of the screen. Tapping the thumbnail instantly loads it in Markup mode. Apple Notes is home to several of the Pencil's other new powers. A feature called Instant Notes allows you to simply tap your Pencil on the iPad's Lock screen to unlock it and begin taking a new note. Handwritten notes are now searchable as well, making Apple Notes a solid option for storing both typed and handwritten text. Another Notes feature that relates to the Pencil, though only indirectly, is that Notes now has a Document Scanner so you can scan paper directly into the app, then annotate with the Pencil if needed. A final Pencil feature in Notes, which is also available in Mail, allows you create inline drawings – typed text will move out of the way to make space for your drawing. The iPad's software keyboard has been improved through consolidation.2 Now letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation marks live on the same keyboard. This is accomplished by putting two options on every key. The primary button input is in black, while secondary input options appear at the top of each key in light grey; flicking down on a key triggers its secondary option. System Apps Alex: Every iOS revision to date has included improvements to a grab-bag of system applications, and iOS 11 is no different. While there are definitely a few regulars that Apple seems to enjoy toying with as design and interface playgrounds, the rest of the batch are generally a mystery until keynote day. This year we saw a fairly standard batch for the most part, but with a few unexpected contenders making appearances — such as the App Store app and a new Apple Pay iMessage app. App Store The App Store received the biggest change this year, with a full-scale redesign to match the design language that was pioneered by the Music app last year. A series of five tabs at the bottom divide the app into its main sections, with the primary tab being the new "Today" view. Today is a new take on featured apps in the App Store, where Apple can choose new apps to highlight each day and include individual editorials for them. The view is made up of a horizontal stack of cards that can be scrolled through — each card showing artwork for the featured app in question. Tapping the artwork will bring up an editorial that Apple's team has written discussing the app, such as a story about a moment in a game or a how-to article describing how to use an advanced feature. This is a fresh take on featured apps which Apple hopes will bring back some of the fun of discovering great new apps in the App Store. Beyond the Today section are sections for Games and Apps, which have thankfully been split apart into two different categories. This could potentially help to cut down on Games utterly controlling the App Store market in recent days, but we'll see how it plays out over time. From what we can see so far, these two sections seem to be where Apple is moving the featured sections that used to make up the front page of the old App Store. The last two tabs are familiar: Updates and Search. While Updates doesn't have any noteworthy changes, Apple is boasting a new "enhanced search." Supposedly this will allow apps to be discovered by more than just their name or any keywords their developers have bought ads against. The example on Apple's new App Store preview page shows a search for "geometry puzzle" finding the newly released (!) Monument Valley 2. Overall, the "all new design" of the App Store seems a bit underwhelming to me, but I do see legitimate potential in the new Today section. Editorials around apps is something we love here at MacStories, so we're excited to see Apple's take on writing interesting pieces about new apps. Maps In iOS 11, Apple's Maps app will be seeing three big new features: indoor maps, lane guidance, and speed limits. All of these are welcome additions, continuing to close the feature gap that Google Maps still maintains over Apple. Indoor maps are launching for shopping centers and airports at first, and will show detailed views of where shops and terminals are located, including what floor they're on. This feature is launching in a small selection of cities at the start, but Apple says they'll be expanding it over time (similar to their flyover feature from a few years ago). Lane guidance is a feature that Google Maps already has strong support for, and I'm very excited to see it come to Apple Maps as well. With this addition, Maps will not only instruct you on which roads to turn on, but will actually inform you which lane you need to be in when approaching your next exit or fork. When driving on unfamiliar freeways this can greatly improve your ability to navigate without missing any important exits. The speed limit feature is also a welcome addition — and pretty much self explanatory as to why it's useful. If you've ever asked or thought the question, "What's the speed limit right now?", then you know why this could be helpful. Messages The biggest new feature for Messages is syncing with iCloud. Finally we can say goodbye to our Messages failing to sync their order or sometimes failing to come through at all when we switch between devices. Furthermore, deleting a message on one device now deletes it from all of them, another welcome addition. Naturally, the syncing is all still end-to-end encrypted. Beyond syncing, Messages is also getting a slight UI tweak for iMessage apps. An iMessage app bar is now instantly visible at the bottom of the screen when you open a new conversation, requiring fewer taps to access the apps, and also will likely make it harder to forget they're there like I often do in the current interface. One final note that goes in the low-hanging fruit category: Digital Touch has lost the prominent placement it previously held in Messages, demoted to simply being an iMessage app now. Apple Pay iMessage App Apple is adding a brand new iMessage app of their own: Apple Pay for iMessage. This iMessage app enables person-to-person payments via Apple Pay for the first time. Simply open the iMessage app in a conversation and enter an amount, then hit send and authenticate with Touch ID to pay. I think this will be a great new way to easily transfer money — and will eliminate the hesitancy people sometimes feel about giving their credit card info to some of the other payment solutions that are popular these days, such as Square Cash and Venmo. Camera Apple's Camera app has seen some love in iOS 11 as well. The app includes new filters to improve portrait photography, including advancements in low light photo quality. New compression technology also allows the photos taken by Camera to be stored at half the size without degrading quality. The aspect I'm most excited about are some of the new features around Live Photos. These include the ability to select a different frame of the Live Photo as the main frame, something which was not previously possible. There are also new features to turn your Live Photos into GIFs. Apple tries to do this intelligently and automatically, so you just need to choose an effect and iOS takes care of the rest. These effects include infinitely looping GIFs, "bouncing" GIFs, and infinite exposures (this just fuses the whole photo like a long exposure, it doesn't make a moving GIF). Photos In the Photos app, Apple continues to bear down on their machine learning initiative. Now the app will create more "Memories" based on events like birthdays, anniversaries, compilations of your pets, etc. These Memories will also automatically adjust to fill the screen whether you're watching in portrait mode or landscape. In terms of interoperability, Photos will now sync your metadata between devices. No longer will the work you put into confirming people's faces and names be wasted each time you pick up a different device. News The News app will now contain daily curated content from Apple News editors in a new Spotlight tab, as well as a selection of the day's top videos from around the web. Other than that, the News app has gone mostly unchanged in this version of iOS. Music Apple may have failed to gain traction with their music social networks in the past, but that never has and seemingly never will stop them from trying again. This year, Apple Music subscribers can create a profile so their friends can follow them and see all the music that they're listening to. Friends can also share playlists with each other and see the Apple Music Radio stations they've been listening to. Home Apple's Home app has remained mostly unchanged, but it has received support for a new category of devices: AirPlay 2 speakers. So far this change seems purely added for Apple's upcoming HomePod devices, but we'll see if other device manufacturers are added to that list over time. Notes Along with the impressive iPad-specific new features added to Notes, the app has also gained the ability to create inline tables. The new functionality is accessible from the shortcut bar above the QuickType keyboard in the Notes app. The Notes share sheet UI has also been updated, now enabling you to browse through your folders, and even search for specific notes before choosing where to save your content. Despite all the new additions in Notes, the background paper texture in the app has survived another year — an unwavering final tribute to the skeuomorphism of iOS 6. Please, Apple... Please take it away. Siri Apple has once again reworked Siri's voices, now claiming that they sound more natural and expressive than ever before. A brand new feature for Siri is its ability to translate between languages. Apple is calling this a beta for now, but the potential of a fully-functioning translator in a phone is immense. Siri also has new integrations with Apple Music, so asking it to play you a song will have a better chance of resulting in something that you will actually like. It can also answer contextual questions about currently playing tracks, such as "Who's the drummer in this song?" Apple is also talking up their machine learning capabilities system-wide, and pushing the idea that Siri is a universal personal assistant, ingrained throughout the fabric of the OS. Better QuickType suggestions, Safari search suggestions, intelligent calendar event suggestions, recommended stories in News, and more. Some of these features are not entirely new concepts to iOS, but Apple seems keener on them this year than last, so perhaps they've finally really pulled it off. User Interface Improvements Ryan: Ever since the introduction of iOS 7 in 2013, Apple's mobile operating system has yet to see a major overhaul of its user interface. With each version since then, there have been only minor UI revisions, and iOS 11 continues that trend. It contains no substantial refresh, but it does come with a handful of noteworthy iterative tweaks. Unified Design Language One of the most immediately noticeable changes in iOS 11 is the spread of certain design elements from iOS 10's Music, News, Maps, and Home apps. The design trend pioneered by those apps made its way into the TV app last December, and also this year's update to the WWDC app, so it's not surprising that iOS 11 further expands that same style. The Podcasts app is the most prominent adopter of this design, closely imitating the Music app now, while in many other system apps the majority of design elements remain the same as before. Certain specific elements though – such as headers and search bars – have changed to help provide a more unified look and feel across the OS. Lock Screen and Notification Center One point of fragmentation regarding notifications is being altered in iOS 11. Now when viewing notifications from a device's Lock screen, you can swipe up to load the full list of missed notifications – the exact list you would have previously seen inside of Notification Center. This new Lock screen behavior is the only way to access Notification Center in iOS 11; swiping down from the top of the screen now returns you to the Lock screen, where you can access the Search screen as usual by swiping right, and the Camera by swiping left. This change may bring some initial confusion, but it seems like a helpful consolidation that promotes greater simplicity in the long run. Another feature of the Lock screen I've noticed in my brief usage of iOS 11 is that a card containing audio playback controls will proactively appear on the Lock screen for short periods of time after I've paused playback. This is a small, but extremely useful addition I'm sure to take advantage of every day to restart playback. Control Center iOS 11 brings two major changes to Control Center, one of which has long been asked for, and the other of which comes as a real surprise. On the hopes-and-dreams-fulfilled side of things, Control Center can now be customized with the buttons and toggles that you care about most. Not only that, but you can also 3D Touch on more objects in Control Center than ever before, and some of those objects expand into a menu with even more buttons in it. The second major change is that Control Center has received a full redesign. Gone are the three separate panels introduced just last year in iOS 10. In their place is a single-paged Control Center that looks and feels substantially different. It is rare for Apple to introduce a whole new interface design just one year after another similarly radical shift, but that's what they've done here. It seems like the best route to go though; iOS 11's update appears simpler and more efficient than before, so it's a welcome change. System Frameworks Alex: While new interfaces and improved applications always get the spotlight, Apple's yearly framework updates and new releases are a category that requires attention as well. These may not be as flashy, but they often represent brand new opportunities for developers to create categories of apps that have never existed before on the platform. Over the coming months and even years, as we see more and more apps released with AR and machine learning capabilities, we'll be able to trace their origins back to the frameworks announced alongside iOS 11 this year. ARKit ARKit is a brand new framework from Apple which allows developers to create augmented reality experiences on iPhones and iPads. The framework fuses camera sensor data with CoreMotion data from Apple's M-series motion coprocessor chips to accurately track the world relative to the position of an iOS device. In other words, as you move a device around a room, ARKit is able to track exactly where the device is at any given point, including its orientation. The other main aspect of ARKit is analyzing a room to determine the location of flat planes such as tables or the floor. It can then use these or other feature points to anchor virtual objects in place and make them impervious to the movement of the device. The above two features are among the hardest problems for developers of AR apps to handle, and with ARKit Apple is taking these almost entirely off their plate. Developers of ARKit apps will thus be free to create and build their worlds without having to pay so much attention to the problem of making sure their worlds stay in place in the real world. Core ML Core ML is the second brand new framework that Apple announced at this year's keynote. This framework's goal is to expose the power of machine learning to developers without requiring them to build these complex abilities into their apps from scratch. The two flagship features of Core ML are computer vision and natural language processing. Core ML's computer vision functionality supports face tracking and detection, landmark identification, image registration, object tracking, and detection of text, rectangles, and bar codes. On the natural language processing front, the framework will intelligently analyze text and output information about it such as the important parts of speech and other powerful language recognition techniques. Core ML has other features as well, making it easier for developers to integrate a wide variety of machine learning models into their apps and run those models locally on their customers' iOS devices. These aspects of the framework are a bit beyond the scope of this article, but if you're interested you can read deeper into them on Apple's Core ML preview page. Core ML doesn't do all of the work for developers, as they will still need to understand machine learning models well enough to handle the output of the framework's processed data. However, the most difficult part of that work — taking raw data and processing it into something meaningful — can now be handled by Apple. Machine learning may still be a highly advanced field to get into, but Apple has taken the first step toward lowering that barrier to entry with the introduction of Core ML. It will be very interesting to see where they go with this framework in future years. SiriKit SiriKit was announced at last year's WWDC, marking the first time that third-party developers had an officially supported method of allowing users to interact with their apps via Siri. The main limitation of SiriKit is that Apple only opens it up to a small subset of app types, and unfortunately that fact is not changing this year. Instead, Apple is choosing to continue slowly, ever so slowly, opening the framework to new types of apps. In the latest version of SiriKit, the lucky winners are task lists and note-taking apps. Developers of apps in these groups can now set up Siri integrations so that users can create and manage their task lists or notes using their voices. This includes setting up tasks based on a user's current location, or a specified date. SiriKit has also been opened up to QR code apps, so users can make or request payments, or display their contact information by asking Siri to call up a QR code from a third-party app. Users can also request that Siri scan a QR code for them — after which their iOS device will automatically open the app that the scanned code relates to. Miscellany Ryan: As with every iOS release, there are plenty of smaller additions to improve the overall experience of the platform. One that will appear among the first iOS 11 changes for owners of new devices is Automatic Setup. The setup process on new devices has grown substantially longer over the last several years, and Automatic Setup is meant to address that problem. It can import many settings, passwords, and preferences on to a new device automatically if you hold that device near an existing iPhone, iPad, or even Mac, making setup experiences quicker and thus more pleasant. A new expansion of Do Not Disturb is designed to help create a safer driving experience. When you first begin driving with an iOS 11-equipped device in tow, your device will suggest turning on Do Not Disturb While Driving. With this feature activated, incoming notifications will be blocked until you've arrived at your destination. It can be configured so that people who message you while you're driving will receive an automated reply letting them know that you're currently driving, and that you will get back to them later. There's even a helpful addition that lets those people message back "Urgent" in case of emergency, and their message will be let through. Another smaller feature is the One-Handed Keyboard, which slides keys over closer to one side of the screen so your thumb won't have as far to reach while typing. iPhones are used one-handed every day, so the addition of a keyboard optimized for one-handed use makes a lot of sense. AirPlay 2 is a major upgrade to Apple's proprietary wireless audio and video streaming technology. The highlight feature of AirPlay 2 is that it enables multi-room audio, so you can control playback through multiple speakers from a single device. Full Speed Ahead iOS 11 brings new and exciting developments to a variety of fronts. Despite the ways iOS has grown in maturity over recent years, Apple has clearly kept investing a substantial amount of resources into continuing a strong development streak. Some of that effort has gone into making the iPad a better PC replacement for power users and the mass market alike. New frameworks like ARKit provide a glimpse into the enormous potential that AR technologies have to transform the way we view the world – and the part our iPhones have to play in that. A number of iOS 11's improvements are subtler, more iterative, but they combine to make the platform simultaneously more capable and easier to use. It's no secret that here at MacStories, we're big fans of the iPad. Federico laid out his vision for the future of the iPad last month, and with iOS 11 Apple has delivered on several of the wishes and thoughts he outlined. The Dock, App Switcher, and drag and drop solve so many of the iPad's limitations – they make common actions like moving documents or switching apps both simple and intuitive. A powerful, unified file management system like the Files app removes one of the major barriers to entry for those transitioning from a Mac or PC into iPad-first computing. These changes all further weaken the narrative that the iPad isn't built for real work. With another year of major iOS evolution upon us, it becomes more and more evident that iOS is Apple's primary software platform for the mass market – both now, and especially in the future. Despite Apple showing a lot of positive evidence today of its commitment to the Mac, that legacy platform continues to demonstrate signs of morphing into a more niche option for a relatively small set of users – particularly professional users. Hundreds of millions of people use iOS every day on their iPhones, and Apple is making it easier for those same people to adopt iPads as their productivity devices. iOS 11 is the work of a company passionate about developing for iPhone and iPad, and excited about the future those devices will usher us into. How long the current pace of iOS development can keep up is anyone's guess, but it shows no signs of slowing down. If you belong to Apple's developer program, iOS 11 is available as a beta download from the developer portal. The public will be able to download it in beta form later this month, and it will see a worldwide release to all iOS users this fall.

The latest version of the Apple Watch's operating system features few major improvements, instead focusing on a variety of smaller updates that, taken together, add up to a solid release. watchOS 4 takes the tasks that the Apple Watch already does well and makes them better. It features new ways to receive proactive information, to track health and fitness data, and more. It also streamlines navigation in a number of subtle ways to require less user interaction, such as fewer button presses and app switches. Watch Faces Throughout the Watch's two years on the market, two main pieces of the product have seen continual change. On the hardware side, Apple has consistently updated its collection of available watch bands. And on the software side, each major update of watchOS has introduced a variety of fresh watch faces. Version 4 is no exception. Likely the most exciting watch face for the tech community is the Siri face. It features a complication that invokes Apple's digital assistant, but its main appeal is in the proactive content cards that Siri populates your watch face with. Relevant information about upcoming meetings, travel time estimates, passes from your Wallet, and more will appear throughout the day as needed – or at least, as needed according to Siri. The watch face displays two to three content cards at a time, and you can scroll through additional cards using the Digital Crown. And when you want to do something with one of those content cards, you can tap it to view more information or open the app it came from. If it truly proves itself to be proactively intelligent, the Siri face could make for one of the most significant alterations to the way Apple Watch is used to date, requiring little if any navigation of different apps, and instead simply doing all Watch interaction through the Siri face. But unfortunately, that's a big if. If you're looking more for aesthetic rather than functional value in your watch face, watchOS 4 also features a Kaleidoscope face and three faces featuring characters from Disney•Pixar's Toy Story. The former takes images from your library of Photos and turns them into interesting patterns, while the latter batch displays short animated scenes every time your watch face lights up. Fitness Apple continues its quest to make Apple Watch the ultimate health and fitness device, as evidenced in watchOS 4 by the attention given to the Workouts and Activity apps. Workouts has received a variety of updates. The first makes it easier to start a new workout; a single tap will do the job now. One update I'm excited about is the ability to set certain playlists to automatically start playing when you begin a specific workout; music playback can then be controlled without ever leaving the Workouts out – simply swipe left from the workout summary screen. If you need to run multiple workouts at once, you can do that while your first workout is running by swiping right and hitting the 'New' button that now lives alongside the existing 'End' and 'Pause' buttons. Swim tracking can now automatically detect sets and rests, so you'll have more detailed data at the end of your swim. There's a new workout category called 'High Intensity Interval Training,' so those doing high activity cardio workouts will receive more accurate data. Also, by default Do Not Disturb is now activated whenever you start a workout. A final update to Workouts won't be relevant until later this year, and even then it will only benefit a select number of users. Apple has worked with the makers of gym equipment to have workout data sync from their equipment to the Apple Watch. This special integration also means that starting or stopping a workout on the equipment will simultaneously start or stop it on your Watch. The equipment featuring this integration doesn't begin shipping this fall, but Apple notes that the partners it has teamed with provide 80% of existing equipment in gyms (presumably in the U.S.). The Activity updates are relatively minor compared to those in Workouts. The Activity app will now send more personalized notifications to update you on your progress for the day. One example of this is a notification at the end of the day that says you've almost closed your Move ring, and that taking a brisk 12-minute walk should wrap it up. Another type of notification will let you know when you're getting close to reaching a big achievement, such as topping your previous Exercise streak. Monthly challenges are another addition, encouraging you to one-up your activity numbers from the previous month. There are also nice new animated effects that help make hitting a goal or closing a ring that much more rewarding. Miscellany While there may not be many major updates in watchOS 4, there are quite a few small tweaks that add up to a better experience overall. Dock The Dock was a major new piece of watchOS 3 last year, and this year the way it's organized has been changed. Rather than scrolling through your list of apps horizontally, all docked apps are now presented in a stack that you scroll through vertically – similar to how tabs work on an iPhone in portrait mode. For the longest time I had no idea you could even use the Digital Crown to scroll through docked apps in watchOS 3, and even now I still accidentally scroll the wrong direction frequently, so a vertical orientation sounds like just what I need. Music The Music app has received a redesign meant to make it easier to select the music you love using the Watch's limited interface. Like apps in the redesigned Dock, album art in the Music app now appears in a stack that you can vertically scroll through using the Digital Crown. Implemented here, the effect resembles flipping through records or CDs at a music shop. Besides the UI changes, Music now also works better when it's disconnected from your iPhone. Previously you could only sync a single playlist to the Watch, but now there is automatic syncing of several Apple-curated playlists, including My Favorites Mix, My New Music Mix, Heavy Rotation, and the new My Chill Mix. Apple News Apple has one notable app debut in watchOS this year: Apple News. It displays news headlines, and if a headline looks interesting, you can take one of two actions on it: either read a brief summary of the story on your Watch, or save the full story for later reading on your iPhone or iPad. Although bringing News to the Watch seems like somewhat of an odd choice for Apple, it makes more sense when considering the abilities found in the new Siri watch face. News headlines fit in perfectly among the other proactive information that face displays. Now Playing Last year in watchOS 3, Apple made the Now Playing screen more difficult to access than it had been before. In watchOS 1 and 2 you could get to Now Playing by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, but that changed with the advent of Control Center. Although it could be argued that Now Playing would have fit well in Control Center on a second page, similar to the multi-panel layout of Control Center in iOS 10, instead it was relegated to simply being an app in the Dock – and one without a complication at that. While watchOS 4 does not add audio controls into Control Center, it does at least make the Now Playing app more accessible with the addition of a complication. It's a small change, but that complication will undoubtedly receive a permanent space on my Watch face. Apple Pay Apple is adding person-to-person payments through Apple Pay as an iMessage app in iOS 11, and that functionality is available in watchOS as well. In the Messages app, below the Scribble option there is now an Apple Pay button. Pressing it asks you how much money you'd like to send the person, then all you have to do is double-click the side button to complete the payment. Flashlight A minor new addition to Control Center this year is a flashlight, which essentially just lights up the screen with a bright white light. There have been a number of times I've wanted a flashlight on my Watch before, so this is a win in my book. Pushing the Vision Forward Apple Watch has seen a lot of software changes in its short lifespan. Its first couple versions lacked real focus, instead adopting a more iPhone-inspired approach of "It can do everything!" The company shifted gears last year with a complete rethinking of watchOS in version 3, and that new foundation is being built on here. There's nothing revolutionary in watchOS 4, but that's okay, because last year set the Watch on a new and focused path. Apple has settled on a vision for the Watch's existence, and that vision fits well with the way I, and many other people, use their Apple Watch every day. watchOS 4 focuses on enhancing the Watch's ability to serve as a source of glanceable information, a fitness tracker, and a device that, paired with AirPods, can untether you from the iPhone. It may not bring the most glamorous improvements, but watchOS 4 pushes the Watch forward in all of these key areas. Revolution isn't needed every year, but evolution is – and that's exactly what Apple has delivered. watchOS 4 will release publicly to all Apple Watch users this fall.

The iPad experience has always been mixed: mostly wonderment, but also a nagging feeling the device was being held back. On the positive side, iPad apps have been various degrees of revolutionary - within a few revisions, Apple’s tablet was what I used for most of my music-creation, reading, email, and games-playing. But I want more – for the iPad to replace my iMac for everything from coding websites to writing articles. In part, this is down to it affording a great sense of focus (unlike a desktop with its many windows screaming for attention), but also because it’s mostly so lovely to use. Mostly. Because the iPad’s unfortunately long been rubbish at some mundane but vitally important stuff. HALF-BAKED The iPad got the means to display two apps at once, by way of Split View in iOS 9. But the app picker for selecting or switching the second app seemed like it was cobbled together the night before the keynote, after which point development was abandoned. The lack of a decent file manager has long been similarly frustrating, forcing various services and apps to awkwardly fill the void. Apple’s Document Picker. Dropbox. Box. Google Drive. Keeping track of iPad files is like a part-time job in itself. Then there’s the inexplicable lack of drag and drop between apps in Split View, on a touchscreen tablet that couldn’t be more ideally suited to dragging and dropping content with an actual human finger. Instead, you get horribly fiddly selection/copy/paste, at odds with Apple’s entire history, given that it popularised drag and drop (and elegant computing interfaces) in the first place. As Apple’s iOS 11 demo concluded, I got a sinking feeling. Surely that wasn’t it? Surely Apple wasn’t going to let the iPad languish for another year? Perhaps I’d got a bit too excited by Federico Viticci and Sam Beckett’s fictional iOS 11 video, which it suddenly turned out was impossible to will into reality. And then Apple did it anyway. DOCK IT TO ’EM In a few minutes of – by Apple’s standards – blazingly fast keynoting, Apple exec Craig Federighi followed up the new iPad Pro’s intro by smashing away the last low-hanging fruit from the iPad experience, with the relish of a particularly fired-up baseball star going for the mother of all home runs. We got a new Dock, which can be stuffed with far more apps than the old one, and that acts as an app switcher accessible from anywhere – not just a Home screen. Drag an app from the Dock to the side of the display and that triggers Slide Over, which can quickly be converted into the two-up Split View. Nice. For managing documents, there’s Files, a kind of reimagined Finder that in some ways betters its macOS predecessor. You can still tag things, create and nest folders, and drag documents about. But also Files recognises modern computing being reliant on the cloud. In a somewhat un-Apple-like manner, you’re not restricted to iCloud Drive either. You can stash Box, Dropbox, Google Drive and others as favourites, right in the sidebar, and a global ‘recents’ view provides an overview of files stored in all of those places. YOU’VE GOT THE TOUCH Drag and drop was next. A URL taken from Safari’s address bar to a message being composed in Mail? Done. An image, too? Easy. Multiple images from Photos added to an in-progress drag, led on a brief journey to the redesigned app switcher, and dumped in possibly quite startled fashion in another app? Oh yes. What then followed passed in a kind of haze. Something about flicking keys to access numbers and punctuation. Some new Pencil-oriented Markup stuff, with inline drawings, searchable handwriting, document scanning, and the ability to shoot a screen grab, scribble all over it, and share it – handy for smug people who regularly feel compelled to annotate the latest Guardian article on Twitter. I was already daydreaming about how file management and drag-and-drop features might revolutionise the iPad experience all over again. Which seems ridiculous until it dawned on me: those were the things that originally drew me to the Mac. So after pushing against Apple’s past for so long, it feels like the iPad’s finally gone home, embracing the spirit of the Mac, without slavishly copying it, while simultaneously heading towards a better future – it’s the best of all worlds.

Shares in the company climbed 12 percent in morning trade. In addition to the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), a government-led technology venture which extended the panel maker a lifeline last year, it has also approached other investment funds and is looking at capital and business tie-ups, the newspaper said. It added that Japan Display will appoint a new management team at its annual shareholders meeting later this month, and announce a new medium-term business plan by August. A Japan Display spokesman said that the report was not based on any announcement by the company. Japan Display has posted three straight years of losses, hurt by fluctuating demand for Apple's iPhones. The company was created in 2012 by INCJ, combining the display units of Hitachi Ltd, Sony Corp and Toshiba Corp as a way of rescuing the country's teetering tech industry. INCJ agreed in December agreed to provide up to 75 billion yen ($685 million) to help the company.

The show’s first episode is launching at around 9 p.m. PT Tuesday, exclusively on the Apple Music streaming-music subscription service. The company this week said it has 27 million Apple Music subs. The 10-episode show — designed to highlight Apple’s multibillion-dollar App Store business — features aspiring app developers vying for a chance to win venture-capital funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners. A new episode will be available exclusively on Apple Music each week on Tuesday evenings. Related Apple Music Sets ‘Carpool Karaoke’ Series Premiere Date After Delay Apple Music is set to bow original series “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” on Aug. 8, featuring a lineup of celebrity guests. The 16-episode show is based on the popular sketches from CBS’s “The Late Late Show with James Corden,” and Corden will appear in at least two of the segments. That show also is being released on a weekly cycle, with a new episode to be released each Tuesday. “Planet of the Apps” is produced by two TV veterans, Propagate’s Ben Silverman and Howard Owens. Will.i.am, Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow and tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk serve as executive producers and mentors on the show, which is hosted by Zane Lowe, a New Zealand-born DJ who is creative director of the Beats 1 radio station on Apple Music. Apple kicked off the “Planet of the Apps” series with a screening Tuesday at its Worldwide Developers Conference at the San Jose Convention Center. For now, Apple’s original entertainment strategy is geared toward reinforcing Apple Music, which starts at $10 per month. There’s no indication that Apple is looking to launch a full-bore, dedicated subscription-video service designed to compete with Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu — but that could change.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iOS 11 doesn’t just kill off old apps, it might leave your iPhone for dead Zach Epstein BGR News June 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple on Monday gave the world its first look at iOS 11, the company’s next-generation mobile operating system. In doing so, Apple showed iPhone and iPad users all of the exciting new features they’ll have access to this fall, once iOS 11 is released to the public. Of course, eager iOS device users also have the option to sign up for the public iOS 11 beta, or they can even install the developer beta right now quite easily, though that would be ill-advised since it’s quite buggy at this stage. New features such as a revamped Messages app, Siri enhancements, and a completely redesigned Control Center have users excited for iOS 11’s upcoming release this fall. But unfortunately, it’s not all good news. While Apple obviously chose to focus on iOS 11’s key additions during its WWDC 2017 keynote presentation, there are also some things eliminated by iOS 11 that many users are bound to be upset about. Don't Miss: The 11 most exciting new features coming to the iPhone and iPad in iOS 11 Following Apple’s WWDC keynote on Monday, we told you all about the most exciting new features coming to iPhones and iPads in iOS 11. There’s a whole lot to be excited about, and you can see all of the coolest new iOS 11 features right here. We’re particularly excited about the new Control Center and Apple Pay features, and we can’t wait to see what Apple does with augmented reality on the iPhone 8. Looking beyond all of the great new features Apple added to iOS 11, there are also some things that Apple removed. First, as was rumored ahead of Apple’s big event on Monday, Apple’s mobile platform will no longer support 32-bit apps beginning with iOS 11. That means older applications that haven’t been updated in years will no longer be able to run on iPhones and iPads with iOS 11 installed. Plenty of people still rely on old apps — even we use some old 32-bit apps on a fairly regular basis — so this will undoubtedly ruffle some feathers since many of these apps won’t be updated to 64-bit by their developers. Of course, the App Store is packed with newer apps, so users should be able to find alternatives in most cases. Much more of a fuss will likely be made over something else that Apple removed from iOS 11: Support for three different iOS device models. Apple is much better than its rivals at providing support in the way of software and security updates for legacy devices. iPhones and iPads continue to receive updates for years before they’re made obsolete. Still, Apple can only offer updates to older devices for so long, and three different devices are on the chopping block this fall. If you own an iPhone 5c, an iPhone 5, or a 4th-generation iPad, your device has reached the end of the road. It will continue to function come September, of course, but it will not receive Apple’s iOS 11 update or any subsequent updates. Device compatibility is listed on Apple’s iOS 11 preview page, and those three devices are absent. Interestingly, they’ve also been removed from Apple’s list of devices compatible with iOS 10, though they are all indeed supported.

The 10-episode "Planet of the Apps," an unscripted show with similarities to ABC's "Shark Tank," is part of an effort to add exclusive video programming to Apple's music streaming service to help attract new subscribers. The first episode will be available for streaming around the globe starting at 9 p.m. PDT on Tuesday (midnight EDT/0400 GMT). Hollywood has been awaiting the entry of deep-pocketed Apple into original TV series, a field crowded with award-winning dramas and comedies from outlets such as Netflix (NFLX.O) and Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) HBO. The first "Apps" episode will be free to anyone who wants to see it on iTunes and the show's website. Subsequent episodes will be released each Tuesday on Apple Music and available only to the streaming service's subscribers. On the show, developers try to interest celebrity mentors with a 60-second pitch on an escalator. The advisers help contestants build their products and prepare appeals for funding from Lightspeed Venture Partners, the first investor in Snapchat. "The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition," Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview. "Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what's involved. This really shows how that's possible." Apple's future programming plans include an adaptation of comedian James Corden's "Carpool Karaoke" segment from his CBS (CBS.N) show that will begin airing in August, as well as a documentary about Sean Combs in June and another about Clive Davis in a few months, Cue said. "Planet of the Apps" came from musician will.i.am, who with producer Ben Silverman had shopped the series to traditional TV players before approaching Apple. Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses. "I felt like this was a great way to show that app developers or business people are not just white dudes in suits, or white dudes coding," Alba said. In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept. Another developer feels overwhelmed by will.i.am's rapid-fire list of ideas. At the show's end, viewers are told they can download the apps from Apple's App Store. The show itself will be promoted on the Apple.com home page, on iTunes and elsewhere. "All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another," Cue said.

Apple unveiled its long-awaited HomePod at its annual developers conference taking place this week in the heart of Silicon Valley, enticing lovers of its products with a high-end offering in a market dominated by lower-priced devices from Amazon and Google . Analysts are yet to be convinced that HomePod will rock the smart speaker market the way iPhones came to rule the smartphone world and iPods dominated MP3 players. "If we are comparing this to Apple's past successes, it doesn't fit that model," said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. "This product is much more of a me-too offering." There was no overwhelming differentiation in HomePod, according to the analyst. But he saw a big negative -- it is more expensive. HomePod, infused with machine smarts by Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain. HomePod will take on Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. Amazon sells Echo devices for $179, and smaller "Dot" versions for $50. Google sells Home for $180, promoting the smart speakers with discounts. - HomePod's tune - Apple played up the rich speaker quality of HomePod, and synched it with the company's music service that boasts 27 million subscribers. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company's Siri team tuned the virtual assistant as a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a voice-commanded assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. "Apple's base should like it, because they are committed to the ecosystem," Enderle said of HomePod. "If you are paying the extra money because Apple is requiring you to do so to access your stuff, that is the Apple tax and it is the kind of thing that people don't like." HomePod combined elements of Echo and Sonos smart speakers, known for rich sound quality, according to Reticle Research principal analyst Ross Rubin. Apple lovers already tend to be "premium product buyers," and may not flinch at paying more for what they believe is a superior quality product, said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. - Just a glimpse - Apple senior vice Phil Schiller speaks during the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California on June 5 Blau suspected Apple only gave a glimpse at its vision for HomePod, noting its potential to be a command center for smart houses and to mesh with iPhones, iPads, online services and more. "We have to imagine there is going to be more there," Blau said. "Is it going to be an Echo killer? A Google Home killer? We are going to have to wait and see. Apple be saving some insights into HomePod for later this year when it is expected to unveil a tenth-anniversary edition of the iPhone. Since HomePod will not hit the market until December, it is unlikely to catch much of the year-end holiday shopping wave and post big sales this year, according to Blau. "I think, over time, they are going to do just fine in this category but it is going to take a while," the analyst said. "I don't think it will be the next iPhone," Blau said of HomePod, "but, Apple could gain share and be a leader." In a blog post Technalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell depicted Apple's latest product news as an affirmation that the company has not fallen behind competitors and is working to take advantage of potentially exciting new technologies. But O'Donnell also expressed skepticism on Apple's ability to dominate this new segment. "Yes, some songs may sound pleasing, but for true audiophiles who actually want to hear what the artist and producer intended, Apple's positioning of the HomePod as super high-quality speaker is going to be a very tough sell," O'Donnell said in a blog post.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Photos App For macOS High Sierra Gets Advanced Editing Features By Tyler Lee on 06/06/2017 18:07 PDT For many years, Apple has offered its customers its own option when it came to photo editing in the form of the Aperture app. However Apple later killed off the app back in 2015 in favor of Photos, which we guess was Apple’s way of streamlining photo storage, organization, and editing into a single application. However it wasn’t exactly ideal as Photos was lacking certain advanced features that professionals would use in their workflow, at least until now with the announcement of macOS High Sierra. In the next-generation update to macOS, Apple has also made some upgrades to some of its apps, such as Photos where the app will now have more advanced editing features for professionals who might have the need for it. As you can see in the screenshot above, it seems that Apple has made some pretty major changes to the way photos are edited in the app where it clearly looks like there are more features and options available to photographers. This includes Levels, Curves,  Definition, Sharpness, Noise, Selective Color adjustment, and more. In addition, Photos will now play nicely with third-party apps and allow users to open photos in other apps, such as Lightroom or Photoshop. Now whether or not the new editing tools in Photos will be on par with Lightroom or other photo editing apps remains to be seen, but given that it is a free bundled software with macOS, we guess it wouldn’t hurt for customers to give it a try.

We’ve seen how Facebook has tried to leverage their platform through Messenger, and now Apple wants in on it too. In a recent sighting on Apple’s Developer website, there is a section that outline an upcoming iOS 11 Messages feature called “Business Chat”. This feature was not mentioned during Apple’s WWDC keynote but according to its description, it basically provides a way for businesses to communicate with customers through Messages. Its description reads, “Business Chat is a powerful new way for businesses to connect with customers directly from within Messages. Using Business Chat, your customers can get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions on their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Customers can find your business and start conversations from Safari, Maps, Spotlight, and Siri.” Details are a bit scarce at the moment, but Apple is expected to shed more light on the feature during a WWDC session on the 9th of June, so it looks like we’ll get more details then.

The company’s TV premiere will go up tonight at 11 p.m. Central, although visitors at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference got to see the first episode of Planet Of The Apps earlier today. As previously reported, the series is a reality show about app development (as in programs, not mozzarella sticks or fried pickles, unfortunately). Beats 1 DJ Zane Lowe will serve as the host, while Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba, Will.i.am, and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk will act as judges and mentors. Besides basically serving as extra advertising for the company’s App Store, the hope is that the exciting world of Shark-Tank-but-for-cellphone-games will propel Apple into the lucrative content-creation world. Planet Of The Apes airs tonight; the first episode will also be available as a free download from iTunes. [via The Hollywood Reporter] Submit your Newswire tips here.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues HomePod first look: Apple’s at-home digital assistant was made with music in mind Macworld Australia Staff 7 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple has finally tossed its hat into the at-home digital assistant ring when, on 5 June, the company introduced the HomePod, a smart speaker that you control via Siri. While the device won’t be available until later this year, I was able to get an extra glimpse (but not a feel) of the new HomePod after Apple’s WWDC keynote wrapped up. The first thing that struck me when I saw the HomePod was that it reminded me of the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro is taller and more slender than the HomePod, but from a short distance, I though I was looking at a Mac Pro stuffed into fishnet stockings. HomePod certainly doesn’t look like any other digital assistant on the market and Apple’s emphasis on its use for playing music seems to have formed a key role in its design. While Google Home and Amazon Echo look like listening devices, the HomePod, which looks more like a audio speaker, could be more appealing to audio aficionados. It’s definitely an aesthetic that feels more home-friendly. The HomePod has a light at the top to indicate that it’s operational. The rumour mill had the ‘Siri Speaker’ outfitted with an actual screen – and this light sure isn’t that. I imagine that the light provides a visual cue to indicate that Siri is listening and/or responding. Since no demonstrations were being performed, the HomePods at the show were probably display units that weren’t really working. But they were plugged in and Apple does match the power cord to the colour of the main unit. Apple spent most of its time during the HomePod part of the keynote to talk about it as a music player, its seven tweeters, its ‘high-excursion’ woofers, its ability to sense a room and adjust its audio accordingly, and its integration with Apple Music. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to hear HomePod in action just yet. After all the talk about music, Apple covered the HomePod’s abilities as a digital assistant. Its six-microphone array is listening for your “hey Siri” command and waiting to do your bidding. But this was another feature that didn’t seem operational with the WWDC units – we’ll just have to wait and see how these features perform in real life. The HomePod will be available in December with a price of US$349.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues watchOS 4: Top 4 new features you need to know from WWDC Michael Simon 7 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News The Apple Watch might still feel like a new product, but we’re already on the fourth version of the OS. Apple’s latest features, announced Monday at WWDC in San Jose, are refinements rather than major improvements. Still, they bring some cool new ways to interact with our watches and add a little fun to the screen we see the most. Here are the things we can’t wait to try out:   Faces The main thing we care about when it comes to Apple Watch is changing how the time is displayed. While Apple still hasn’t opened up the API to third-party developers, it has created some fresh faces. First up is a Siri face, which taps into the AI’s proactive smarts to display information relevant to your day, including weather, upcoming events, tickets, news, photo memories, activity tracking and home control.   A trippy Kaleidoscope face shows a symmetrical pattern that changes throughout the day (insert High Sierra joke here). But the most fun of all have to be the ones based on three classic Toy Story characters, Woody, Jesse and Buzz Lightyear. Instead of using their arms to portray the hour and minute hands, the faces are fully animated and feature fun little vignettes when you activate them. To bedtime and beyond! Fitness Our Apple Watch is pretty much the only reason why we ever do anything that even resembles exercise and it’s getting even more fitness features in watchOS 4. In the Activity app you’ll now get daily words of inspiration and a boost at the end of the day to close your rings, as well as monthly challenges and full-screen goal effects. The Workout app lets you quickly tap to start a routine, features high-intensity interval training monitoring, automatically starts with your workout with a playlist and lets you add new multiple sessions on the fly. If you use high-end gym equipment to burn your calories, two-way data exchange will keep your metrics in sync. Apple has partnered with LifeFitness, Cybex, Matrix, TechnoGym, Schwinn, Star Trac and StairMaster to equip their machines with NFC readers that will seamlessly sync to your watch. Music If you use your watch to listen to music, you’re going to love watchOS 4. In addition to a new design that lets you literally flip through your songs and albums, the new app will bring some AI smarts that learns what you listen to the most. You’ll also have access to more of your favourite songs. You’ll be able to store more of them on your watch, and if you’re an Apple Music subscriber, the playlists it creates for you will automatically sync to your wrist. Flashlight How many times have you reached for your phone when you needed a flashlight in a tight spot? Now you’ll be able to tap a new flashlight icon in the Control Centre to turn your watch face into a digital torch, letting you see or be seen in dark places. Apple suggested it could act as a bicycle light for nighttime riding, for instance.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Apple AirPlay 2 adds whole-home audio for speakers Jared Newman 7 June, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News A new version of Apple’s AirPlay wireless audio technology will allow users to synchronise audio on multiple speakers throughout the home. Whole-home audio controls will become part of Apple’s Home app, which lets users control smart home devices in each room of the house. From a new ‘Speakers’ section, users can toggle music and adjust volume on a per-room basis. The Apple TV will function as a whole-home audio device as well, so users can launch music on the big screen – using either the touch remote or Siri – and have audio play on other speakers as well. To start, whole-home audio will work with Apple Music, but an API will become available for other music apps that want to support the feature. Apple says it has more than a dozen speaker partners on board to support AirPlay 2, including Bang & Olufsen, Bose, Marantz, Libratone and of course Apple’s own Beats brand. It’s unclear whether this will work with existing speakers or require new ones. Apple isn’t the first company to offer whole-home audio support. This feature has been a staple of Sonos speakers for years, and we’ve seen several other speaker makers offer their ecosystems, such as Yamaha MusicCast and DTS Play Fi. Google also offers multi-room audio between its Chromecast Audio dongle and several Chromecast-enabled speakers. Compared to those systems, Apple won’t have broad support for music services, at least not out of the gate. But it does have the advantage of offering the world’s most popular smartphone, with a built-in app and voice assistant as the remote controls. The whole-home update should be part of iOS 11, due out this spring.

Employees at Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer used as a supplier for a host of Apple products, revealed a treasure trove of iPhone 8 details on Reddit over the weekend. Three employees at the company answered questions in an 'Ask me Anything' session, shedding light on some of the iPhone 8 leaks we have seen over the past few months. According to the group, collectively using the name FoxconnInsider, Apple's next flagship device, which they repeatedly refer to as the 'iPhone X', will closely follow the design leaked by iDrop News. This features an edge-to-edge screen with dramatically reduced bezels, sat within a steel frame and an all-glass covering. iPhone 8/iPhone X will most likely resemble the middle phone: courtesy of iDropnews They also report that initial rumours and images of a rear-facing finger print scanner were incorrect, and that an original design featuring a fingerprint scanner embedded underneath the front facing glass remains the best solution. The insiders have suggested that Apple has faced significant issues with its fingerprint scanner, particularly when placed beneath the glass, and development on the smartphone has been delayed as a result. It is currently unclear exactly what this will translate to at release, but we're unlikely to see any major upgrades in this area. The AMA also confirmed that facial recognition technology and a retina scanner would feature in the iPhone's front-facing camera. Apple will also continue to use a Lightning port rather than the USB C featured in a number of news reports, and will feature wireless charging capabilities. The iPhone X will also come with 3GB of RAM, although details on storage remain unknown. Surprisingly, the employees also revealed that a refreshed iPhone 7 would appear alongside the iPhone X. The iPhone 7s will have some significant differences, including an all-aluminium body instead of the glass chassis on the iPhone X, and it will lack the wireless charging capabilities.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Will Apple's Second Bet on High-Fidelity Audio Pay Off? You probably forgot about the iPod Hi-Fi. Apple wishes it could. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jun 6, 2017 at 8:54PM The second time's the charm? Over a decade ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the iPod Hi-Fi, a large high-fidelity speaker that was clearly positioned to target audiophiles. The $350 device, which could be used as a stationary speaker plugged into a wall socket or a portable one using D-cell batteries, is one of Apple's most prominent flops, one that it would probably rather forget. The iPod Hi-Fi lasted a mere 18 months before Apple discontinued it. In the new Siri-powered HomePod, Apple is hoping it can redeem itself. HomePod starts at the same $350 price point as the iPod Hi-Fi. Image source: Apple. Lessons learned? It's probably worth remembering why the iPod Hi-Fi flopped in the first place, which may provide lessons for HomePod going forward. iPod Hi-Fi fell flat for a handful of reasons: Expensive relative to other comparable iPod docks at the time Awkward docking position for the iPod that was prone to accidents Exclusive compatibility with select iPods through the 30-pin dock connector Newer iPods and iPhones even required an adaptor for the same 30-pin dock connector due to different voltage requirements Image source: Apple. Needless to say, the market for home speakers has come a long way, as has the expectation of constant connectivity. Most of these reasons no longer apply, given the current state of both music streaming services and local wireless streaming technologies. That's where HomePod comes in, which is launching later this year at the same $350 price point as the iPod Hi-Fi. Compared to Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) immensely popular Echo, which starts at $180, that's a pretty hefty premium that Apple is now tasked with justifying to consumers. In no uncertain terms, Apple is again betting that high-fidelity audio is enough to differentiate the HomePod and warrant the premium. How much is high-fidelity audio worth to the average consumer? During the unveiling, Apple spent a lot of time discussing spatial awareness. Using a handful of sensors, HomePod can detect its location within a room by measuring acoustics, as well as whether or not there are multiple HomePods operating together, in order to dynamically adjust its audio output in a way that is optimized for the environment. Echo can't do that. Spatial awareness is one of HomePod's differentiating features. Image source: Apple. What's far more debatable is how much the average consumer values high-fidelity audio, and how much they're willing to pay for it. Apple said that comparable systems comprised of high-fidelity Wi-Fi speakers paired with a smart virtual assistant can cost anywhere from $400 to $700, which it used to justify the $350 price tag. For example, high-end wireless speakers like the Sonos PLAY:5 cost $500 and could be paired with a $50 Echo Dot for comparable functionality for a total cost of $550. Even if HomePod's audio quality is superior to Echo, which early impressions suggest is the case, that doesn't mean most people will pay for it. Meanwhile, Siri is behind Alexa in terms of smart home capabilities, so Apple is hoping that superior hardware can make up for deficiencies in software and services. The curve ball is that hardware is immutable, while software and services improve over time. Echo will never sound better than the day you bought it, but Siri can potentially catch up with smart home integrations over time. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

The iPhone maker has finally jumped into two of the hottest tech trends of the last two years — augmented reality and voice-activated speakers, with a promise to dominate these markets pioneered by its rivals. Two years after Amazon introduced its sleeper hit Echo device, and a year after Google Home, Apple now has the voice-activated HomePod, a high-end music speaker priced at $349 that will be powered by Siri. That often maligned but widely used artificial intelligence assistant is also getting an upgrade, though for HomePod, Siri's main task is clear: play music. Apple also unveiled a new augmented reality developer kit that would help Apple app developers integrate this technology that overlays digital images on the physical world, made popular by Pokemon Go. Facebook and Google have been showcasing such distorted reality tech at their own demos, with plans to revolutionize commerce and communication. Apple's entrance into augmented reality on iPhone could jump-start the industry that's mostly been a playground for games. The availability of AR technology on hundreds of millions of Apple's mobile devices has the potential to help make iOS  "the largest AR platform in the world overnight," CEO Tim Cook said. Apple has been playing catch-up on a variety of cutting-edge tech fronts, allowing competitors to take the lead on the next big computing platforms, all driven by artificial intelligence. In the case of both HomePod and ARKit, Apple is banking on fans of the brand potentially abandoning rival products in favor of whatever its in-house developers and independent developers create for the space.  "Today's WWDC announcements show that Apple is building the infrastructure for a whole new decade of engagement with AI (artificial intelligence at its core," Raj Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO of Localytics, who worked with Steve Jobs on the launch of the original iPhone.  "The last 10 years since the introduction of the first iPhone were focused on the mobile revolution, but the mobile innovation has now hit its plateau," he says. "AI really unlocks the power of what mobile offers. Now brands can take that data, make sense of it and interact with their users in real-time in a truly individualized way."  There were few wow moments, though, extending a trend in recent years of incremental refinements that keep loyalists happy but which fail to carve out huge new markets, like the first iPhones or iPods did.  Among the offerings: The ability to pay friends with Apple Pay. An iPad with a larger, sharper screen. How about an industrial strength iMac for $5,000? "What was in there for developers?" asked Holger Mueller, principal analyst at Constellation Research. "It's more WWDC — the D is for Demo. Or product demo."  Mainly, WWDC 2017 was just over two hours of jargon-filled tech-speak aimed not at consumers but rather developers, who are the lifeblood of any large technology company. These conferences, which include Google I/O and Facebook F8, are recruiting tools for companies to build hardware and software based on their computing platforms and products. The biggest pitch was left for the very last, when CEO Tim Cook announced the 7-inch, $349 HomePod, which ships in December. HomePod seems in many ways like an echo of existing products on the market, in everything from form to price. But where Amazon and Google are peddling a robotic home assistant, Apple leaned on its music roots with its pitch. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, announced HomePod by taking a shot at the quality of the speakers in competitors' products. Apple purchased Beats Electronics a few years ago, and is hoping to pull fans of Beats headphones and wireless speakers over to HomePod. Beyond using Siri as "a great musicologist," Schiller said HomePod users could ask Siri — which now has a more natural sounding voice and can translate up to five languages — about the weather, news and sports, as well as dictate a text message and activate appliances that use Apple's HomeKit technology. Apple finally made good on months of talk about the coming age of augmented reality with its new AR Kit, part of iOS 11 that is available now for developers and scheduled as a free software update for iPhone and iPad this fall.  The developer toolkit leverages iOS devices' built-in cameras, processors and motion sensors to overlay digital images onto the physical world. A demo of a steaming coffee cup next to a lamp on a table drew hoots and hollers from the developer audience, although the first vestiges of the technology are likely to emerge in gaming environments. As for when an iPhone will be able to deliver an augmented reality experience, the only hint at timing from WWDC was when a representative from director Peter Jackson's Wingnut AR studios showcased an AR gaming demo that he said would arrive later in the year. Some of the more meat-and-potatoes news zeroed in on making iPad, iMac and iPhone a bit easier to use. For example: — A new iMac Pro is menacing in sleek black with a 27-inch screen and technology that makes it the company's "most powerful Mac ever" and will be available in December for $4,999. — A new version of Apple Pay now allows person-to-person payments. — A do not disturb option for the iPhone eliminates distracted driving by making the screen go black and sending notifications that you're behind the wheel. — The smaller iPad Pro bumps up around an inch in diameter to 10.5-inches and the iPad lineup gets features such as searchable handwritten text, an effort to goose slowing sales. — Toy Story heroes Buzz, Woody and Jessie join Mickey and Minnie Mouse as Apple Watch faces. Experts anticipate that Apple will pull the covers off a significantly revamped iPhone at its annual event in September, likely named not the 8 but the X, or 10, in a nod to the 10th anniversary of the iPhone's debut in 2007. The main iPhone updates announced at WWDC were a single-screen Control Panel, a new feature that disables the phone while driving, and a redesigned App Store that makes navigating the site easier on a phone.  Machine learning was a repeated buzzword throughout the keynote. The Apple Watch now leverages its data-crunching power to automatically populate its screen with the day's most pressing events, while Photos features improved facial-recognition capability to create Memories of recently photographed events.  Apple also took the opportunity to trumpet its ubiquity to the 5,300 developers who attended WWDC from 75 countries (the event moved from its 15-year home in San Francisco to accommodate the larger crowd). Cook noted that Apple has 16 million registered developers, up 3 million in 2016 alone, and has paid out $70 billion to developers since the store opened in 2008.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) Credit: The Associated Press Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif., Monday, June 5, 2017. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) prev next         comments Apple replaced record collections with the iPod and earned front pocket real estate with the iPhone. Now it’s going after a bigger target: your home. The Cupertino, Calif., company announced Monday at its annual World Wide Developers Conference in San Jose the HomePod, a home speaker with Apple’s digital assistant Siri built into it. Similar to Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home — voice-activated, internet-connected speakers that play music, answer questions and provide information such as the news, weather, sports updates and metric conversions — the HomePod listens and responds to voice commands. Using the HomePod is like using Siri, without the need to tap any buttons. To get its attention, users simply say, “Hey, Siri.” At around 7 inches tall, the device is wrapped in a mesh fabric and comes in white and dark gray. Powered by an A8 chip — the same chip found in the iPhone — it is also spatially aware, modifying the direction of sound to suit its environment. Starting at $349, the device, which ships in December, is nearly double the cost of the Amazon Echo ($179.99) and more than three times the price of the Google Home ($109). The price tag isn’t surprising, according to technology analysts, who said Apple has always sold its products at a higher price point because it wants to convey that its gadgets are more premium than the competition’s. And while its competition has had a head start — the Amazon Echo launched in 2014 for Amazon Prime members and the Google Home was released last year — experts in voice and visual search said instead of being late to the party, Apple could raise the bar like it did for digital music players when it launched the iPod, or smartphones, as it did with the iPhone. “Voice is the next frontier for search and discovery, and there are lots of opportunities to leverage voice command within the home,” said Michael Levine, vice president of marketing at Photon, a firm that creates voice-based digital experiences. “It definitely puts a dent into Google Home.” During its developers conference, Apple highlighted the difference between the HomePod and the Echo, saying that while the Echo was “smart” compared to wireless speakers such Sonos’ offerings, its sound quality left much to be desired. The HomePod, in comparison, was the best of both worlds. “It’s a great dance they’re doing,” Levine said, because as powerful as Apple’s technology may be, Amazon remains the market leader and has a built-in market in Amazon Prime subscribers. Apple did not announce any partnerships for the HomePod on Monday, but Levine expects the company to throw around its weight to secure partnerships that give it leverage over Amazon. More than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than doubling from last year, according to the research firm eMarketer. Amazon just unveiled a version of the Echo with a camera, touch-screen display and video-calling capabilities. The new Echo Show goes on sale on June 28 for $230. Amazon also has the Echo Dot, a budget version of the Echo that starts at $49.99. Google, meanwhile, previewed new speaker features such as hands-free phone calling during its software conference last month. Microsoft also has announced its own speaker with Samsung’s Harman business; it will use Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant. Until Monday, that left Apple as the one of the few major tech companies without a home speaker offering. Although it was the first smartphone maker to come out with a digital assistant when Siri debuted in 2011, it hasn’t had a stand-alone assistant. For Apple, having one broadens the role that its software, services and gadgets play in people’s lives. It wouldn’t be the first time that Apple hopped on the bandwagon of a technology product popularized by a competitor. For instance, Apple initially resisted enlarging the size of the iPhone’s screen despite strong sales for larger-display phones made by Samsung and other rivals. But the company relented, and Apple’s larger phones have become hot commodities as more people have embraced having a bigger display to look at pictures and watch video on the devices. The HomePod is Apple’s first new line of products since the Apple Watch in 2015. The lack of a recent breakthrough device has periodically raised concerns that Apple has become too dependent on the iPhone and supported the theory that the company lost its knack for innovation when its co-founder Steve Jobs died of cancer in 2011. Although Apple Watch has emerged as the leader in its technological niche, it hasn’t become a smash hit like the iPhone or the iPad — at least until tablet sales started declining. With more and more companies betting on voice and visual search being the next frontier, the HomePod positions Apple as a major player in a burgeoning category. During Monday’s event Apple also introduced updates and improvements to its professional line of Mac laptops and desktops, and iPads. The company announced the new iMac Pro, Apple’s most powerful computer to date with a 27-inch Retina 5K display, which will go on sale in December starting at $4,999. It also announced a new 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro that’s faster and more powerful than existing models with more memory and storage, which will go on sale next week and start at $649. In addition to new hardware, Apple announced the new mobile operating system, bolstered augmented and virtual reality tools for developers, expanded Apple Pay to allow for person-to-person money transfers (similar to Venmo and Square’s Cash app), and revamped its app store. ——— ©2017 Los Angeles Times.  Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Legal Image Source: Håkan Dahlström Sting operation caught Apple misleading customers over right to repair Mike Wehner @MikeWehner June 6th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet It’s no secret that Apple isn’t a huge fan of the “right to repair” movement, or the laws that support consumers’ decisions to have their Apple hardware fixed by anyone but Apple itself. The company has been to court on the issue before, but recently released court documents pertaining to a right to repair case in Australia reveal that the company was caught red handed denying consumers repairs that were guaranteed under the country’s laws. Don't Miss: iOS 11 beta 1 is now available to download As Guardian reports, Australian officials, working undercover and posing as Apple customers, contacted all 13 Apple retail locations in the country and asked for iPhone repairs related to the now infamous Error 53 failure. “In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity … was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,” according to court filings. The responses went directly against what the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s protections provide, which should have covered the repairs in full. However, Apple has fired back, stating that the fake calls shouldn’t be counted against them because they were “hypothetical circumstances.” Apple’s Error 53 woes are largely behind them, with the company doing its best to clean up the mess it left by releasing an update to address the issue and replacing affected phones via outreach programs. Still, the “sting” operation and its findings aren’t a particularly good look for the company, especially when many consumers already see the brand in a not-so-flattering light in regards to consumer rights.

The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple’s technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. NO PLACE LIKE HOMEPOD The “HomePod” speaker unveiled at Apple’s annual developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple’s iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple’s own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod’s owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. “It will reinvent home audio,” boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google’s Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. APPLE VS. THE DRY SPELL The HomePod is Apple’s first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn’t been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company’s ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs’ last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad — all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company “can’t afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people’s homes to Amazon, Google and others,” said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That’s especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more “pervasive” way that’s less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it’s also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple’s assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) “This is the start of the AI wars,” he said. MACS, PHONES AND PAYMENTS Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality “experiences,” although the company didn’t announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple’s web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It’s part of Apple’s effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones.

During its Platform State of the Union keynote at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple told developers that macOS High Sierra will be the "last macOS release to support 32-bit apps without compromises." Starting in January of 2018, all new apps submitted to the Mac App Store must be 64-bit, and all apps and app updates submitted must be 64-bit by June 2018. With the next version of macOS after High Sierra, Apple will begin "aggressively" warning users about 32-bit apps before eventually phasing them out all together. In iOS 11, 32-bit apps cannot be installed or launched. Attempting to open a non-supported 32-bit app gives a message notifying users that the app needs to be updated before it can run on iOS 11. Prior to phasing out 32-bit apps on iOS 11, Apple gave both end users and developers several warnings, and the company says it will follow the same path for the macOS operating system.

Even annoying-as-hell Windows can often run 20 year old binaries. TWO DECADES ago. Right now the oldest binaries MacOS can run are from the PowerPC -> Intel switch era, circa 2006. Whatever macOS comes after High Sierra will probably obsolete 32 bit x86 binaries, which will pull the date even more forward. They don't seem to care about preserving the functionality of legacy software. Some apps will never be updated because the developers no longer care about it, went out of business, etc... This software is lost to time. This is even MORE the case on iOS where you can't even GET the software anymore. At least on macOS you can keep archives of old apps around. Rating: 34 Votes busyscott 2 days ago at 06:21 pm I'm digging the 64-bit only transition, I don't understand all the hate. If you don't like it, you're perfectly welcome to stay on the older OS, many of my production macs are one to two OS's behind because updates often break compatibility and it takes time for software to catch up. I know guys who are still rocking Snow Leopard in recording studio's because they have hardware interfaces that aren't supported by the devs anymore. So what? Buy new hardware or don't update the OS. Rating: 25 Votes Victor Mortimer 2 days ago at 05:41 pm Why? Why would they go out of their way to break backwards compatibility AGAIN? I'm still running a 10.6 VM so I can use some PowerPC apps that will never be upgraded. I'm still running SheepShaver so I can use Classic apps that will never be upgraded. Apple could have taken steps to avoid both of those problems. And now they're going to deliberately break 32-bit apps? This is really inexcusable. You want to know why I need more than 16GB RAM in a laptop? This sort of thing is a BIG part of why. Rating: 23 Votes mrr 2 days ago at 05:37 pm Sad.

[doublepost=1496796453][/doublepost] You must be new here? Apple has done this for decades. Part of reason Windows has had so much trouble is the complexity of decades of compatibility... No. Apple has NOT done this for decades. Do you have any idea how much work Apple put into making 68x00 binaries just work on PowerPC? And do you remember how incredibly seamless that transition was? Stuff JUST WORKED. You didn't even know it was a 68k binary running on your Mac in 1998. The Mac OS 9 to 10 transition was a pain, but Classic worked beautifully until Apple killed it in 2007. That's right, over 20 years of backwards compatibility for some apps, all the way up until 10 years ago with 10.5. So yeah, a decade of this is what we've had to endure. Windows has so much trouble because they use a monolithic database known as the Registry to store a LOT of things that shouldn't be stored in the same database. It was a horrible mistake, a workaround for limitations of their previous versions, and they never saw fit to stop using it for new things. If M$ had decided to contain that mess before XP, they'd have solved a lot of problems, if they'd decided to contain it before 7, they'd still be better off. But no, it's still used in 10.

Wow, you literally have no idea how technology works, especially if you think Macs should still run pre OS X apps. Phasing out old architecture makes the OS run smoother.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 7 June 2017 | MYT 7:30 AM Apple is great at gadgets, but it’s missing the future: opinion by shira ovide Even if Apple can no longer chart the course of technology, it is likely to remain hugely successful and valuable. — Reuters For the last decade, Job One for the wizards at Apple was figuring out how to make each year's edition of the iPhone more appealing than the last.  That's overly simplistic, but it's not too far from reality considering the iPhone generates nearly two-thirds of Apple's annual sales. Repeatedly creating an amazing slab of glass and circuits is what made Apple the world's most valuable company.  Those wizards are still toiling away, but their magic is not as relevant as it once was. It's clear technology's present and future is not about gadgets but about how technology can blend into the background to make life and work better.  The future belongs to technology that can warn people to leave early for a doctor's appointment if traffic is bad – or a car that drives itself to that doctor's appointment. The future belongs to technology that lets someone see virtual images of sofas in her living room so she can pick the best one. The future is technology that sifts through years of data to notify a corporate executive about an inventory shortage before it happens.  This future of smart software and computing woven into every molecule of life is coming fast. And Apple isn't ready for it.  That's a subjective assessment, but I'm not alone here. In the technology industry, it's conventional wisdom that Apple is weak in crucial areas such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence that are foundations for driverless cars, complex data predictions and computing that blends seamlessly into work and personal lives. Even the coolest iPhone ever made can't solve this existential problem for Apple.   This week, Apple is hosting 5,000 of its allies at an annual conference to outline the latest refinements to its products. Apple on June 5 outlined how the company's phones, computers, tablets, watches and web TV hardware are becoming smarter and more capable. Apple's message was the company is on the cutting edge of emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, and about how Apple is ushering in the future. Don't believe it.  One small example is a voice-activated home speaker that Apple introduced called “HomePod.” I'm sure it will be beautiful and have excellent sound quality, but that's not what these gadgets are about. A speaker isn't a speaker, just like a smartphone isn't a smartphone. These are all Trojan horses for the future of technology and how we interact with it.  Apple gets this, but it's not up to the task. Siri is good enough for many people, but the relative stupidity of Siri, iTunes and Apple's mapping app are a tech industry punchline. And it's hardly a joke. The feebleness of many of Apple's apps and software is a sign of how far the company is from the cutting edge.   In China, the wildly popular WeChat app lets people invest in stocks, pay for dinner, order a taxi and take a course on quantum physics all from a smartphone. In other parts of the world, Snapchat, Facebook and Microsoft – yes, Microsoft – are blurring the lines between the real world and the virtual in ways that could help doctors better learn surgical techniques or let people communicate in entirely new ways. Google's parent company and Uber are fighting in court over technology for driverless cars. Amazon is trying to reinvent how people learn about and buy products online and in stores.  Apple is practically nowhere so far in these emerging areas of technology.   Apple is hardly standing still, and it has the resources to try to future-proof the company. The company is spending more of its financial firepower than ever before – about US$11bil (RM46.90bil) in the last year – on developing new technologies. (The famously secretive company doesn't say what they are.) The company could surprise everyone as it has many times before, but it doesn't feel possible at the moment.  Even if Apple can no longer chart the course of technology, it is likely to remain hugely successful and valuable. Apple is the world's most profitable company, and it's doing smart things to squeeze more money from the hundreds of millions of people who buy its devices.  But financial power was never the point for Apple. Its history was about defining technology and waiting for everyone else to catch up.

Entertainment | 05 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (20) Apple Will Enter Smart Speaker Market in December with HomePod by Adam C. Engst With the announcement of the HomePod during the WWDC keynote today, Apple finally put the brakes on the endless speculation about whether the company would release a smart speaker to compete with Amazon’s popular Echo and its Google Home competitor. However, Apple didn’t just wade into the fray with a me-too product. In fact, during the announcement, the whole “smart” part of the “smart speaker” didn’t warrant mention until near the end. Instead, Apple focused its attention on the “speaker” features of the HomePod. Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller said that Apple has been working for years to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home, and to that end, the company first designed the HomePod to be a great speaker. It’s just under 7 inches (17 cm) tall and is covered in a 3-D mesh fabric. It features an array of seven beam-forming tweeters, each with its own driver, and precision acoustic horns that can direct sound in any direction. Bass comes from a 4-inch Apple-designed woofer that faces upward to move a lot of air, and software provides automatic bass equalization to avoid distortion as the volume increases. All this is powered by Apple’s A8 chip, which the company first used in the iPhone 6. It provides real-time acoustic modeling, audio beam-forming, and multi-channel echo cancellation. Since speakers live in different rooms with radically different acoustic properties, the HomePod has spatial awareness, in that it can detect its surroundings and adjust the music to match. It even knows if there’s a second HomePod in the room, and if so, it changes how it emits sound to provide the best possible listening experience. Apple is also using the HomePod’s processing capabilities and its array of six microphones to let you control it via Siri. Control what? Music, of course, and Apple assumes that you’ll have an Apple Music subscription. To that end, Apple has expanded Siri’s vocabulary when it comes to music. Plus, the HomePod will connect directly to Apple Music, so you won’t have to play music through another device, although we expect that will be possible as well. What about all the other stuff that people have become accustomed to asking of the Echo and Google Home smart speakers? Apple got to this at the very end, almost as an afterthought. You’ll be able to ask Siri for news, unit conversion, stock info, weather forecasts, traffic reports, sports scores, and more. You’ll also be able to send messages, make reminders, set alarms and timers, and control HomeKit devices. Apple emphasized the privacy aspects of the HomePod. Until you say “Hey, Siri,” all recognition happens only locally. Only after you utter that trigger phrase is any data sent to Apple, where it’s associated with an anonymous Siri ID. All communications are end-to-end encrypted. Why didn’t Apple plug the virtual assistant features of the HomePod more? We have a few theories: It’s possible that Apple’s research shows that what people do most with smart speakers is listen to music. That’s certainly been our experience. Many of the things these smart speakers can do are better done elsewhere or are trivial examples. They’re good at bar trivia questions like who won the Super Bowl in 1967, but how often do you really wonder about such questions? Although Apple would never admit this, it’s also possible that Siri doesn’t work as well as Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant technologies. Evaluating this would be difficult, and it’s likely that each has its own strengths and weaknesses. The HomePod will cost $349, which is a lot more than the smart speaker competition. The Amazon Echo Dot is $49.99, the Echo is $179.99, and the Echo Show is $229.99. The Google Home runs $129 but can be found for under $100. Apple instead suggested that we should compare the HomePod against the cost of quality Wi-Fi speakers, which are $300 to $500, plus the $50 to $200 cost of a smart speaker. It’s all about how you frame things. Regardless of why Apple chose to focus more on the audio quality of the HomePod than its Siri-driven smarts, we won’t be able to evaluate how well it does at either until it ships, which Apple promised for December 2017 in the United States, UK, and Australia. With other companies, that would be too late for the holiday shopping season, but since Apple sells so much directly, early to mid December should still work. Other countries will have to wait a little longer.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

I assume that by this statement that there was no indication beyond the Keynote as to whether the HomePod will support AirPlay from a Mac or iOS device. Certainly nothing about that was said during the Keynote itself from what I recall. I have to admit that I am not overly impressed with the HomePod. It would have to be pretty incredibly awesome sound and indispensable integration with the Apple ecosystem (and also support AirPlay...I don't have an Apple Music subscription and have no plan to ever get one as I had subscription services for music and software) for me to consider spending about $200 more for a HomePod than an Echo. And that does not even account for the fact that I am no where near an "audiophile". Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 09:59 Yeah, no indication, but it makes very little sense that it would work only with Apple Music. There are just too many situations where you might want to play audio that's not in Apple Music. I think the allure of the HomePod is twofold: the audio quality and the deep integration with the Apple ecosystem. Being able to set it up merely by holding an iPhone next to it is pretty neat, and you'll be able to send iMessages and control HomeKit devices. As to how it really competes with other products on quality and responsiveness, there's no telling until it ships. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 10:26 Since they also announced AirPlay 2 yesterday, I'm willing to bet that the HomePod supports that. I guess we'll find out more later this year. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-06 10:29 All my devices that are HomeKit compatible can also be controlled by my Echo. And it can controls some that are not HomeKit compatible. So, not sure how "killer" that feature is. Not sure if I would want to use iMessages. After enabling the new messaging feature in the Echo, I turned it off (with Amazon's amazing stupid implementation of only being able to do that by calling them) after I got a notification for a message a 3 am. Amazon definitely jumped the gun on the messaging/calling function...it seems to be a VERY beta status update if not even alpha status. They should have fleshed it out more (the Do Not Disturb is buried in the Alexa app and the requirement to upload ALL of my iPhone contact to Amazon's server as the only option is just stupid...I did not grant permission for that on my iPhone, so after enabling the messaging/calling it was effectively worthless). So, I will be interested to see if Apple's implementation with iMessages is better. And if they do not implement AirPlay or even just Bluetooth, then it is completely worthless to me. As I said, I have no intention of getting an Apple Music subscription. So, the jury is still WAY out for me. Time will tell. I will say it did cause me to think of some "Trash Can, the sequel" jokes however (it does like of look like a perforated, squat Mac Pro). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-06 10:56 I would be a bit surprised if it did not support AirPlay (in the form of AirPlay 2). It would frankly be stupid for it not to support it. But, then Apple does not always do the smart thing, so until I hear them say it or someone I trust hears them say it and reports it, I will remain at least a little skeptical. I would not put it past them to decide "hey, this is a good way to get people to sign up for Apple Music...only have the HomePod play music from Apple Music". It is the "lets lock them in to other services" mentality that Apple has employed in the past, albeit maybe a bit more extreme than past situations if they were to actually do it. Reply Kirby Krieger  2017-06-06 05:30 This appears to be aimed directly at Sonos. Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 10:30 >They’re good at bar trivia questions like who won the Super Bowl in 1956... Seriously? You know there was no Super Bowl before 1967 right? ^_^ I know it was just an example, but it popped me out of the article. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:59 Yeah, it was just a throwaway example in the middle of a marathon 12-hour writing day. Fixed! :-) But in fact, I didn't know that the Super Bowl started in 1967, and when I asked Siri just now, all I got was "Sorry, Adam, I couldn't find any scheduled games or scores matching your request." Clearly Apple should fix that response to say, "Sorry, Adam, but I can't answer that question because the first Super Bowl was in 1967." Interestingly, when I asked Google the same question, it gave me the score for the 1956 NFL championship game. That's pretty good, since the NFL championship was essentially the Super Bowl of the time, since the AFL wasn't formed until 1960, and the Super Bowl was intended to be the AFL/NFL championship game. But I had to research that on my own. Of course, while I find reading about the history of these things somewhat interesting, I can barely remember who won the Super Bowl this year because, well, I just don't care. :-) Personally, now that I try more bar trivia questions, I'm a little offended that Siri doesn't know anything about running. Ask "Who ran the first four-minute mile?" or "What's the world record in the marathon?" and all you get are Web results. Feh! Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 12:44 I should have caught this, since I'm a football fan, but yesterday was a bit of a circus. :-) Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 15:10 I hate when I ask her a question and she gives me the name of a nearby restaurant. Siri! It wasn't even a food related question! Bad Siri! Bad! Reply brian.workman  2017-06-06 15:12 Oh! And the more interesting question is "what did they call the Super Bowl trophy in the first few years?" Because it clearly wasn't the Vince Lombardi Trophy since he was still coaching then. But I digress. Reply tom powers  2017-06-06 19:32 From the wikipedia article on "vince lombardi trophy:" Even though [the Superbowl] is a national tournament, the award was initially inscribed with the words "World Professional Football Championship". It was officially renamed in 1970 in memory of NFL head coach Vince Lombardi, after his death from cancer. It was thus presented for the first time as the Vince Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl V when the Baltimore Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys 16-13. It has also been referred to as the "Tiffany Trophy" after the Tiffany & Co. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 13:25 I'd be interested in this device for playing music off my Mac or my iPhone/iPad to a living room speaker. I don't have/want Apple Music, so I'd be curious if this device will still work for what I'd like to do (AirPlay?). I'm not into any kind of home automation so can this be shut off entirely? Likewise Siri, can I chose to not enable Siri at all on HomePod? Finally, does HomePod use wifi or does it require Bluetooth? I try to keep BT off on all my devices. I'd like to know that I can talk to and use HomePod without having to turn BT on. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:13 I can't answer the other questions, but HomeKit automation is totally optional. You have to purchase and set up devices to use that. HomePod won't suddenly take over your light fixtures and toaster. :-) Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:42 I'd be more worried that by HomePod running HomeKit software (daemon?) it could open ports and listen on them thereby creating a possible vulnerability on my home network. Obviously my toaster from 1972 will always remain just fine. :)) Reply Craig Treleaven  2017-06-06 15:15 So what have we Canadians done that has so deeply offended Apple? We're now late to the party on all sorts of things, HomePod just being the latest. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 16:31 Seriously. Canada has more people than Australia by a good bit, so it must not be based purely on market size. Perhaps Australia is easier due to its proximity to China, where the HomePod will likely be made. Hopefully it will be only a short delay before worldwide release! Reply Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-07 12:44 The delay may have something to do with the radio certification process for wireless devices, which varies from country to country. Reply Craig Treleaven  2017-06-06 15:21 WWDC has an AirPlay 2 session on Thurs at 4:10 Pacific. Hopefully some questions will be answered there. Wonder if existing Airplay devices will be able to join the AirPlay 2 party with a firmware update or if new hardware is necessary. Would especially suck if the ATV 4 can't. Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:11 They confirmed that the Apple TV will act as an AirPlay 2 receiver.

Money Shows Opinion Opinion: Apple helps bring augmented reality to the masses 07/06/2017 Emma Brannam "The industry has been waiting for Apple to set the table," tech analyst Tom Mainelli says. Photo credit: Getty OPINION: Think of augmented reality and most people will picture Pokémon Go. Thanks to Apple and some Kiwis, that might not be the case for much longer. The tech giant has announced a new augmented reality (AR) tool for developers to help bring AR to the masses. "The industry has been waiting for Apple to set the table," tech analyst Tom Mainelli told me. "It makes it possible for the average consumer who owns vintage iPad or iPhone to experience AR and I think developers are really going to embrace this technology. It's a big move." He's right. It's the talk of the town this week at the WorldWide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, helped no doubt by an impressive display at Apple's keynote yesterday from Sir Peter Jackson's team WingNut Film Production. It unveiled a first look at what's in the works at its WingNutAR augmented reality division. The demo was shown off by WingNutAR creative director Alasdair Coull and featured a very cool sci-fi based aerial attack at a remote space outpost.   Sir Peter couldn't be at the event but he did release a statement. "Augmented Reality allows storytellers to generate digital creations that appear in the real world. I'm very excited about the endless creative potential of this new technology," he said. The plan is for WingNutAR to have its first commercial AR content available in the App store later this year.   Of course, it isn't just about gaming. Layering virtual images over real-life scenes can be used for other applications such as shopping or industrial design. The list is endless and Kiwi developers at the event are definitely excited. "For us there's huge potential because AR can be utilised in almost anything, anything you can think of where you can hold up a phone and place some additional information or graphics on the screen," said Nic Gibbens, co-founder of Wellington-based firm PaperKite, known for apps such as the All Blacks app and BPMe. "We're interested in anything we can do that enables peoples to have really extraordinary experiences." His views were shared by Karl Von-Randow, co-founder of Auckland's Cactus Lab and one of the men behind the popular app Camera+. He hasn't been that keen on AR up until now. "Previously when you've had to do AR you have to use a variety of third party tools. "Maybe I'm a little bit nervous that clients will ask us how to do AR apps now but now we'll know how to it."

HomePod, aided by Apple's Siri digital assistant, will be priced at $349 when it begins shipping in December in the United States, Australia and Britain, the tech giant announced at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. "We really believe it is going to take your home music experience to the next level," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said as he unveiled it. HomePod will take on lower priced Amazon Echo and Google Home, which have had momentum in the arena of voice-controlled speakers capable of controlling smart appliances, fetching content from the internet and more. It is designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service and can produce rich sound while tapping into the artificial intelligence power of Siri. Apple vice president Phil Schiller said the company's Siri team had tuned the assistant into a "musicologist" that learns the tastes of listeners and gets songs from the internet cloud. The speaker has the "power to rock the house," according to Schiller, and the aim is to make HomePod a potent assistant for news, messages, weather, traffic, home controls and more. HomePod capped a keynote presentation that included updates to Apple's iPad and Mac laptop lines, and upgraded operating software enabling augmented reality for iPhones and iPads. Analysts said Apple is playing to its strength in the music industry by focusing on sound quality and its catalog of songs. "Apple is smart to frame the HomePod as a music-centric and audio-centric device rather than just another smart speaker or another home for Siri," said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. "The fact that Apple is claiming to marry really great and smart audio with a smart assistant and cloud music service makes this device unique in the market." Some industry insiders, however, note Apple will be under more pressure to improve the computing smarts of its Siri software in the face of offerings from rivals Google and Amazon. Apple has given Siri new male and female voices, described as more natural and expressive, and added abilities such as translating English phrases into Chinese, French, German, Italian or Spanish. Apple said it is also using 'on-device learning' to enable Siri to take people's tastes into account. Amazon has dominated the connected speakers category since 2014 when it introduced its first Echo, which responds to voice commands and allows users to order goods and control connected appliances. A survey released last month by research firm eMarketer found Echo speakers held 70.6 percent of the US market, compared with 23.8 percent for Google Home. Cook also used the Apple keynote to show off new iPad and Mac computer models, as well as provide glimpses at coming versions of the software powering the technology titan's devices. Apple senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi said the next Mac operating system will be named "High Sierra" in tribute to the California mountain range. High Sierra features will include being able to stop unexpected videos from starting to play automatically when landing on web pages and "intelligent tracking prevention" that will prevent ads from following people about the internet. High Sierra will be released later this year as a free update, according to Federighi. Along with upgraded versions of iPad and Mac laptops, Apple unveiled an iMac Pro work station that had the computing built in behind the screen and was touted as the most powerful computer the company has ever made. Aimed at high-end design professionals rather than the home market, the iMac Pro is to begin shipping in December with a starting price of $4,999.

Is Threatening Facebook's Best Hopes for Messenger Monetization Business Chat is a direct challenge to Facebook's Messenger for Business. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jun 6, 2017 at 7:56PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) didn't talk about it at all during its WWDC 2017 opening keynote, but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) better be paying attention. The Mac maker has added a new section to its developer site that details a feature called Business Chat that will make its way into iMessage. It's pretty much exactly what it sounds like: Apple hopes to connect businesses to customers directly within the core Messages app. Here's Apple's description: "Business Chat is a powerful new way for your customers to get answers to their questions, learn about and purchase your products, and engage with your existing support channels. Integrated into Messages and discoverable through Maps, Siri, Search, as well as your own app and website, Business Chat helps you build persistent, long-lasting relationships with your customers." This precisely targets Facebook's best hopes for monetizing its growing Messenger platform, which now boasts over 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs). Apple Business Chat (left) vs. Facebook Messenger for Business (right). Image sources: Apple and Facebook. The social age of customer service Modern mobile consumers have increasingly turned to social media channels to interact with businesses or ask for free chicken nuggets, a trend that largely started on Twitter. Apple officially launched its own Twitter support account, @AppleSupport, early last year, but many businesses had already hopped on the bandwagon. Firing off a few tweets when you're seeking support is a whole lot easier than calling in and navigating an annoying phone tree. Facebook is a uniquely ideal platform for these types of interactions, in part because of its real-name policy that makes it easier for a business to know who it is interacting with. Anonymous Twitter trolls aren't worth paying attention to (in more ways than one). Facilitating customer support is also a key reason why Facebook is pushing so hard with Messenger chatbots, since automation will be utterly critical to scaling. Conceptually, sending messages to businesses on a unified platform has a lot of appeal, far more than the outdated model of seeing pop-up chat prompts when you visit a company's website, or being directed to a bloated support forum to dig up answers on your own. At what cost? Apple will detail its Business Chat plans further later this week when it streams a WWDC live session on June 9, but it remains to be seen if the company will outline the economics. Will Apple attempt to charge businesses for implementing Business Chat? Or will it offer Business Chat as a free developer tool that any company can use to integrate directly into iMessage with no fee? If Apple chooses the latter, since it has no need to monetize such an offering, we could be talking about really disrupting Facebook's burgeoning efforts to offer the exact same thing for a price.

Apple’s first foray into original content will debut later tonight, according to a report from Reuters. “Planet of the Apps” has long been teased by Apple, but the first episode will finally be made available for streaming tonight at 9PM PT/midnight ET. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover The first episode will be free for anyone to stream, but subsequent releases will be limited to Apple Music subscribers. Apple will release new episodes on a weekly basis, hitting Apple Music every Tuesday. The public debut follows a screening that will take place at WWDC tonight at 6:30 PT, so developers will get a brief jump on the rest of us. In an interview with Reuters, Apple’s Eddy Cue explained that Planet of the Apps centers around taking an idea and turning it into something real: “The question when you have ideas is how to take those to fruition,” Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, said in an interview. “Sometimes you may not know how, you might be afraid of what’s involved. This really shows how that’s possible.” The first two episodes of Planet of the Apps will show developers presenting applications for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack and facing struggles such as increased competition and pressure from investors. “Planet of the Apps” came from musician will.i.am, who with producer Ben Silverman had shopped the series to traditional TV players before approaching Apple. Will.i.am appears as a judge alongside entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk and actresses Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, who have started businesses. In the first two episodes, developers present apps for online shopping, campus safety and a school backpack. One team tries to adapt after Google announces a feature similar to its own concept. Another developer feels overwhelmed by will.i.am’s rapid-fire list of ideas. Planet of the Apps will be marketed heavily, according to Cue. The show will be advertised on the Apple.com homepage, in iTunes, and various other places. “All of our customers are going to be exposed to this in one way or another,” Cue said. A Twitter account with the “Planet of the Apps” handle has also gone live this evening, but it’s not clear if it’s the real deal or not.

Skipping the typical recap of the year in numbers, Apple employees went straight on to updates and new products. The day was mostly filled with operating system updates but there was surprisingly many product launches as well. Usually Apple only refreshes their Mac line and maybe touches on some niche products, like the Apple TV or Apple Watch, during the WWDC. This time around the audience consisting largely of developers – it is a developer conference after all – witnessed quite a few new devices. In addition to unveiling the new Mac Pro and even a completely new HomePod, the company unwrapped the new and improved iPad Pro. The smaller iPad Pro has grown from a 9.7 incher to a bigger and better 10.5 inch display. The size however has now budged as the company has managed to squeeze the bezels to incorporate the bigger display that hosts a new technology called ProMotion. The larger version has the same ProMotion display but sticks with the 12.9 inch panel. ProMotion is essentially Apple's marketing term for 120 hz refresh rate, which is nothing new in displays in general but is impressive in a tablet device. ProMotion actually goes a little bit deeper than that since it includes a dynamic refreshing which means that it adapts to the content. The contextual refresh rate allows the iPad Pro to keep the power consumption low while performing well when needed. The new displays are also a third brighter at 600 nits and support HDR video. Both new iPads feature a A10X Fusion SoC which has three performance driven cores and three lower clocked and less powerful ones for stand-by and other less power consuming needs. A10X Fusion includes a 12-core graphics chip which is 40 percent faster than the one found on A9X. The new camera in the iPad Pro is 12 shooter with a optical image stabilization for those having trouble holding the 1.05 (or in the 12.9 inch case 1.53) pound device steady. The new iPad Pro comes in three different memory configurations (64, 256, 512 GB) and the prices start at $649 (10.5") and $799 (12.9").

The Cupertino Goliath announced a multitude of platform updates, device upgrades, and even some new products. One thing that might have not caught everyone's eye as much, but yet is something most Apple users will be very familiar with, is the revamped App Store. Apple said the new App Store user interface will modify how people use the store and bring a new fresh look. Major changes to user experience means that there's a new style to the whole app which can be found from some of the company's other apps (including Apple Music) as well as their new website. The new App Store is divided into three tabs: Today, Games, and Apps. The first category introduces the user to exclusive premieres, recommendations, and new apps. Games are now also separate from other apps, which will bring more focus to the largest and most popular app category. In addition to the three main tabs, the store has Updates and Search tabs. "Every element of the new App Store is richer, more beautiful and more engaging," said Phil Schiller, Apple senior VP of marketing. One added functionality is the App Store in-app purchases that are available straight from the apps page. This means that users don't necessarily have to open the app to buy addons, upgrades and other in-app content. App Store update will be part of the iOS 11, launching for free this fall.

NewsSmart Living New Apple HomePod To Finally End Wireless Speaker Debate? Aaron. T. June 6, 2017June 6, 20170280 6 June 2017, WWDC – The new Apple HomePod is a slick riposte to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Now the question on everyone’s mind is ‘ What took them so long?’ At 17.2cm tall, the Apple HomePod wireless speaker is muscled by 7 horn-loaded tweeters facing outwards and and a high-excursion woofer that fires up – an unconventional design. It also features a glass LED-screen on top for volume and music controls. The HomePod can also sense the acoustics of your room relative to its position and automatically adjust itself to give you the best audio performance. It also knows when you’ve added another HomePod, so that multiple rooms can be served at once. The HomePod supports Siri and can serve as a powerful voice assistant, just like its rivals. It is perfectly synchronised with your Apple Music subscription and with Siri, giving you instant access to over 40 million songs – even learning your music preferences along the way. With Apple Music, it can intelligently interpret your questions in context. For example, if you’re listening to a rock band, you can even ask questions like ‘Hey Siri, who is the guitarist?’ When Siri is activated, the familiar Siri waveform appears on the screen so that you’ll know that its listening. It also works with Siri to bring you anything from News to Traffic Reports – at your command. The HomePod’s six-microphone array works in sync with special signal processing to ensure that it can hear you even while it’s playing music – even at full volume! Whenever you prefer, Airplay 2 streaming lets you stream anything you want from your Apple devices to the HomePod. The HomePod will retail for US$349 in White or Space Grey. It is available from December 2017 in the US, the UK and Australia, followed by the rest of the world. AppleHomePodsirismart homewireless speakers Aaron. T.

Clover HopeTuesday 4:20pm Filed to: Michelle Obama WWDC Obamas YAS 46 14 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image via Getty Michelle Obama, the FLOTUS America didn’t deserve, popped up for a talk at the Worldwide Developer’s Conference, the event where Apple unveils new products and where, this year, attendees were blessed to hear her inspirational words on topics like living your best life, memoir writing, and the power of female leadership. On Tuesday, Obama sat with Lisa Jackson, Apple’s VP of environment, policy, and social initiatives, who enviously described Michelle as “my friend.” Obama explained that while she and Barack are obviously hard at work on community initiatives, they’re also “decompressing” and trying to travel once a month. “We are now trying to see the world, actually see it and enjoy it and take it in,” says Michelle. Yes, we see. She also talked about the “healthy process” of writing her book. “I find myself for the first time really remembering and taking in feelings and emotions that I just buried,” she says, appearing warm, genuine and human. I know the topic of Michelle on post-White House life is getting old, but it’s nice to hear that she’s so delighted by the joy of being alone in a house again—“You wake up, no one’s in your house. No one!” she says. It’s also sweet when Jackson reminds her, “You are our first Black First Lady” and Michelle says, “I keep saying, ‘Oh! Yeah!’” I will never get tired of hearing her speak, sue me! It’s a soothing reassurance that life will be alright. Since this is a tech conference, Obama had some sage advice for the developers. “Fear consumes us, unfortunately. It’s an emotion that can be played on, to the detriment of us,” she says. “It’s an emotion we all fear. It just can’t consume you.” And, “Take time to know yourself.” Is this wisdom you should already know? Yes. Does it sound better coming from Michelle Obama, who does this effortlessly? Yas. Things are gonna be fine, you’re fine, everything’s fine. “People wanna come to me and ask me, ‘Well why isn’t my husband doing XYZ?’ And my question is what’s your husband doing?” Dear people with racists in your family: “If you wanna be a truth teller, if you’ve got an issue that you care about, but you can’t be truthful and persuasive in your own backyard, if you’re stepping over your grandfather, who has some interesting notions about the world because you don’t wanna stir up anything with him—You don’t wanna face your own family? Then how are you gonna have influence over anybody else?” says Obama. “People wanna come to me and ask me, ‘Well why isn’t my husband doing XYZ?’ And my question is what’s your husband doing in the environment, on education?” ::Crowd applause and tears over “Wtf is your dude doing?”:: Advertisement Advertisement Obama also kindly reminded the predominantly male leaders in tech that women are the decision-makers in life. “Women are in charge of everything. We do everything, we buy everything, we make most decisions in the household. Who are you marketing to? Who do you think is gonna use these apps?” she says. “If women aren’t at the table, then what you’re saying is you don’t really care about my dollar. You’re really gonna miss a lot of what I want because you just don’t know me. So you need me at the table.” Best of all, The Emotions’ “The Best of my Love” plays at the end and Michelle cannot help but dance.

She was introduced by Tim Cook himself before sitting down with Lisa Jackson, the former head of the EPA who now heads up social and environmental initiatives for Apple. Their hour-long discussion touched on Obama's post-White House life, diversity in tech and not falling down the stairs of Air Force One.   "Who are you marketing to? Who do you think is going to use these apps? If women aren't at the table, you're going to miss my dollar. Because you don't really know me," Obama said, according to clips of the talk posted on social media.   Obama urged the audience to make room for women and people of color in technology. Silicon Valley continues to struggle with diversity, a topic that was back in the spotlight Tuesday with news that Uber had investigated 215 harassment claims and fired 20 people. For more on this you can check out the CNN report here   Going by Tim Cook's Tweet today at the WWDC event, he's a true blue democrat through and through. I don't remember a group hug with Trump last year. In fact his staged look was that of death warmed over, as noted below. Ha! Maybe Michelle Obama will run for President in 2020 with Tim Cook as her running mate.

Elyse Betters7 June 2017Laptops Apple Beta now out for developers Final version due to release this autumn Adds support VR and AR content Also has improvements for Photos, Messages, and more Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment The next version of MacOS is official. While at its mostly-annual developers conference, Apple announced and previewed MacOS High Sierra, a major update to the MacOS Sierra operating system, which released last year for Macs. Although the update is not yet available for consumers to download and use, developers have access to a beta version now, and the public beta will be available for anyone to try next month. To help you get acquainted with the software now, we've rounded up everything you need to know about it, including its biggest features. Apple iOS 11: 11 new features coming to your iPhone and iPad Apple WWDC 2017: All the announcements that matter What is MacOS High Sierra? On 5 June, Apple previewed the next version of MacOS. It's called High Sierra. Many of the new features include behind-the-scene updates that will make your Mac seem faster and more secure. For instance, the new OS will allow for VR and AR content. Safari also got a number of improvements, including the ability block autoplay videos and stop advertisers from tracking you, among other things. What does MacOS High Sierra feature? VR and AR High Sierra will support virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). More specifically, High Sierra will support Mac hardware aimed at creative professionals who create VR and AR content. Apple even announced a new platform for developers, called ARkit, which will allow developers to create AR experiences for iOS devices. Furthermore, Apple's API for high-performance graphics, Metal, has been updated to Metal 2, which will give MacOS gaming a big boost. Metal 2 was described by Apple at WWDC 2017 as "tremendously fast" with "great optimisations and tremendous APIs". It offers up to 10X better draw call throughput. Remember, VR and AR apps need heavy GPU power. So, we're not surprised to hear that Apple is doubling down and also introducing Metal for VR. The Unity and Unreal engines are coming to the Mac as well, Apple said. And lastly, to complement all these new improvements, Apple confirmed that the HTC Vive will soon be compatible with Mac. The company is adding Steam VR support to High Sierra, making it possible to use a Mac to control virtual reality experiences - something that has been a PC exclusive so far. Now that the HTC Vive is compatible with Mac, we wonder if Oculus will follow suit. Safari Safari got a number of improvements, including the ability to block autoplay videos. Safari lets you customise preferences for specific websites, so going forward, it will let you turn off autoplay videos for a site. You'll also have the ability to give a site access to your location and set a default page zoom to a level of your choosing. But that's not all: you can stop advertisers from tacking you. Apple is basically going after the Google Chrome browser and its upcoming ad-blocking features. Apple's browser will have a new feature called Intelligent Tracking Prevention. It uses machine learning to find advertisers that track you, and then it deletes the tracking data they leave behind. So, if you buy a leather couch for your house on a site, you won't see ads for the couch on other sites. Safari in High Sierra will become the world’s fastest desktop browser, Apple also explained. It features 80-per cent faster JavaScript performance when compared to Chrome, which should help you surf the web in a much more speedy and efficient way. Photos The Photos app on Mac will offer the ability to edit Live photos with new effects that include Loop, Bounce, and Long Exposure. Loop is essentially GIFs. With it, you can edit Live photos into a repetitive loop. Long Exposure is a DSLR-like effect for motion blur, while Bounce reminds us of Instagram Boomerange. It lets you edit the action in your Live photos to play it forward and backward in a loop. Apple said its biggest area of refinement in High Sierra is in Photos. There's now a persistent sidebar and a view that has all of your imports in chronological order. Apple has also improved Faces, so when you put effort into categorising and naming people, that's now synchronised automatically across your devices. You can now open a picture in third-party apps from Photos. So, you can open a picture in Adobe Photoshop directly from Photos, and your edits save automatically as you go back-and-forth between the apps. But the coolest features are the new built-in editing tools. Photos already lets us make adjustments, but now we get pro-level tools such as a a curves palette for fine-tuning coloyr and contrast, a selective colour dropper, and new filters. iMessage and iCloud If you've ever set up a new Mac, you know some steps always have a few kinks. For one, if you don't restore from a backup, your Messages app will be bare. But not anymore. High Sierra is using iCloud to restore your message history so that all your old Messages will be available on your new Mac, meaning conversations sync across devices and only recent ones need to be stored locally. Speaking of iCloud, in a slide Apple quietly kept in the background of its keynote, we spotted the phrase "iCloud file sharing", which means we may also get Dropbox-type document sharing tool. With it, we could quickly chuck a link to someone. But that's not confirmed. Apple File System High Sierra will run Apple File System (APFS), which offers better performance and security than before. First unveiled at WWDC 2016, Apple said it would arrive to all of its products, from Apple TV to iOS. It supports far more files than ever, letting you put nine quintillion of them on a single volume. It also includes multikey encryption, which will also work in a unified way across all of Apple's devices. APFS is backwardly compatible with all of your HFS formatted drives. It also offers better throughput and faster latency, which is important if you're handling lots of files. The new advanced file system is "optimized for modern storage", Apple said, which includes fast SSDs and flash, Lightning, and USB drives. It will also easily adapt to future types of storage, Apple explained. APFS matters if you care about data. A file system is what organises all your data into files and folders you can access with a click. Video And finally, High Sierra supports a high-efficiency video coding (H.265 for short). So, newer devices will let you capture HD and 4K videos -- without taking up as much room on the device. The new system compresses video up to 40 per cent more the H.264, and it will stream video smoother, which will make the video-binging experience much more enjoyable on a Mac. When can you get MacOS High Sierra? A beta of macOS High Sierra is available now for developers. A public beta will be available in late June. Sign up here if you'd like to join and test out the latest features. The finished, consumer version of MacOS High Sierra is due to roll out sometime this autumn. Which Macs will run MacOS High Sierra? Check out Pocket-lint's separate guide on that for more information. But, in a nut shell, MacOS High Sierra will run on any Mac that currently runs Sierra, while any Mac made more than seven years ago is obsolete and will no longer be supported. Want to know more?

BUSINESS Apple's clever 'gut-punch' to rivals 7 Jun, 2017 10:17am 2 minutes to read × Apple just delivered a powerful blow to their competitors with one simple feature. Photo / Juha Saarinen news.com.au Share via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Bookmark this article Share on Facebook facebook Share on Twitter twitter Share via email email Share on LinkedIn linkedin Share on Google Plus google-plus Share on Whatsapp whatsapp Share on Pinterest pinterest Share on Reddit reddit × It was a big day for Apple and fans of the tech giant's consumer products. The company announced a string of new products on Tuesday morning including new desktop computers, new iPads, new laptops and an entirely new Siri-powered home speaker. There was also one announcement that largely flew under the radar but it's sure to provoke the ire of many while being praised by others, with one Twitter user calling it the "most important announcement Apple made today". The most important announcement Apple made today was built-in auto-play blockers in Safari. Mark my words.— Joshua A Fruhlinger (@fruhlinger) June 6, 2017 Apple is bringing an auto-play-video-blocking feature to its new Safari internet browser to be rolled out with its upcoming macOS High Sierra desktop operating system. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Not only that, but the update will also feature a new security measure that stops ad tracking technology from seeing where you go when browsing you're online. While the Safari update might be welcomed by some consumers it could have an impact on Apple competitors like Google and Facebook and publishers who generate revenue from autoplay video. This was a feature that was largely pushed into mainstream existence by the likes of Facebook and Google (owner of YouTube), which dominate online advertising. According to former Google design ethicist, Tristan Harris, as platforms like Facebook and YouTube compete for time spent on site, auto play on videos has become a crucial part of their model. "A huge portion of traffic on these websites is driven by autoplaying the next thing," he wrote in a recent essay about the tactics tech company's use to hold your attention. Apple's decision has been criticised for effectively disarming a considerable weapon employed by its competitors. Apple: "Safari update will let you stop auto play videos." Advertisers/Content creators: pic.twitter.com/5ozgz8IP7G— Nick Asolas (@NickAsolas) June 5, 2017 And with the disabling of ad tracking technology on top of that, Apple is seen as taking a huge swipe at the search engine giant. "SHOTS FIRED!" wrote one Twitter user. Meanwhile another referred to the auto-play-video-blocking feature as a "gut-punch" for publishers.

Yesterday was no exception with a refresh to the MacBook and iMac lines, a new HomePod speaker being unveiled, the iMac Pro getting a preview, and finally, Apple's latest 10.5-inch iPad Pro. But, that wasn't all, it appears the company also made some new accessories available as well. When Apple debuted its iPad Pro, one of the major criticisms of the device was that there was nowhere to store the accompanying Pencil stylus. Now, two years later, Apple has a solution - its brand new Pencil Case. This latest addition to its product line finally offers iPad Pro users a safe and secure way to store their Pencils. The Pencil Case comes in four different colors and retails for $29. For those that require something a bit more substantial and functional, there is also a Leather Sleeve for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro. Unlike the Pencil Case, the sleeve will keep the two items together, with the sleeve holding the iPad and a slot for Pencil storage. Both of the items mentioned above are currently available from the Apple Store.

As expected, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are among the devices getting the bump from iOS 10 to iOS 11, Apple’s brand new mobile operating system. We’ve been using the iPhone 6s iOS 10.3.2 update, the most up-to-date version of iOS 10, for a few weeks now and today we decided to make the jump up to the iOS 11 beta. The iOS 11 beta is pre-release software which means it’s unfinished. The current version of iOS 11 is stuffed with new features but there are problems plaguing testers on the first beta. We’ve already taken a deep dive into the iOS 11 beta’s prominent features and we’ve also offered some reasons to, and not to, install the software at this time. In this guide we’re focused on the iOS 11 beta’s performance on the iPhone 6s. These are our first impressions and if you’re on the fence about whether to download the first beta, they could help you make the right decision for you and your device. iPhone 6s iOS 11 Beta Installation Before we get into the iOS 11 beta 1’s performance, a few notes about the installation for those of you thinking about making the move. The download and installation were surprisingly fast. From start to finish, the whole process took about 10 minutes to complete on our AT&T iPhone 6s. We’ve seen complaints about installation issues (and even ran into some ourselves while trying to install the iPhone 7’s iOS 11 beta) so be careful, especially if you’re installing beta software for the first time. We recommend setting aside 20-30 minutes to complete the process. iOS 11 beta will log you out of iCloud and various other apps and services so you’ll need to spend a few minutes making sure everything is in order. Battery Life We’ve only spent a few hours with the iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta so we can’t speak about long-term battery life. What we can say is that battery life has been impressive in the short-term. We’ve heard complaints about severe battery drain but we haven’t seen any on our iPhone 6s. At least not yet. We’ve been using the phone virtually non-step for three hours and we haven’t noticed anything out of the ordinary. We’ve been using a mixture of LTE and Wi-Fi and a combination of apps and services including Injustice 2, the new fighting game from Warner Bros. Battery life issues are common iOS beta problems and they can come out of nowhere. If you start to experience issues on your iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus, take a look at our guide to fixing bad iOS 11 beta battery life. Connectivity We’ve spent time testing the iPhone 6s and its iOS 11 beta with several different routers and ISPs (Internet Service Provider). The device’s Wi-Fi connectivity is holding up at this point. Speeds are normal and we haven’t dealt with any dropped connections. We’ve also tested the iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta with several different Bluetooth devices including Bose QC35 headphones and the Bose Mini Soundlink speakers. Connections to those devices were fast and stable. AT&T’s LTE and 4G networks are working normally as well. Their speeds are normal for our area and we haven’t experienced any dropped calls or data issues when browsing the web. So far so good. Apps & Services Apps and services are notorious for being uncooperative with iOS beta software and iOS 11 beta is no different than past releases. During our short time with the iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta we’ve seen four core applications crash multiple times: Slack, Spotify, Chrome, and Asana. Apple’s new Podcasts app, Photos, Twitter, YouTube, and Soundcloud have crashed once each. That’s a complete 180 from our experience on the iPhone 6s’ iOS 10.3.2 update and a huge reason why some of you will want to avoid the iOS 11 beta. The iPhone 6s is our backup device. Installing iOS 11 beta on our primary device, the iPhone 7, was and still is out of the question due to app performance. If you rely on apps and services to get through your school day or your work day, you probably want to avoid the first iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta. Speed Some iPhone 6s users are complaining about user interface lag but iOS 11 beta is extremely fast on our device. Animations and transitions are fluid and we haven’t noticed any jaggedness when opening folders, opening apps, pulling up Control Center, or pulling down the Notification panel from the top portion of the screen. Moving around the interface feels as fast as it did with iOS 10.3.2 on board. Mileage will, of course, vary. Bugs & Other Problems Like many others, we’ve run into some pesky iOS 11 beta bugs. Here are a few early issues you need to be aware of: The Bluetooth toggle in Control Center is currently broken. Our iPhone 6s has randomly rebooted itself three times. Once, the lock screen showed our home screen wallpaper. These are nuisances, not game-changing problems, but we’re bound to find more as we dig further into the iPhone 6s’ iOS 11 beta. Should You Install the iPhone 6s iOS 11 Beta 1? If the iPhone 6s is your main device, avoid the iOS 11 beta for now. Apple is planning to release a public iOS 11 beta in a few weeks and we expect it will be a little more stable than the first developer beta. If you’re new to the beta process, we also recommend waiting for the first public iOS 11 beta to arrive. It’s free. All you need is a working Apple ID. If you have an iPhone 6s lying around, you might give the iOS 11 beta a shot. It has its fair share of problems but they’ve been manageable so far. If you’re on the fence, take a look at our walkthrough below. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 11 Beta & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 11 Beta If You Want to Improve the Final Version   1 / 10 Have you ever installed a new iOS update only to discover problems on board your device? If you've experienced frustrating iOS problems, you might want to give the iOS 11 beta a shot.  The iOS 11 beta lets you try out new features but it also helps Apple improve the software ahead of the release in the fall.  Your beta testing could prevent a major problem or a minor bug from appearing in the final iOS 11 release for your device.   If you're sick and tired of running into problems with iOS updates, do something about it. Download the iOS 11 beta and hunt for bugs.  If you find something, make sure you report it to Apple.    1 / 10 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Apple 9 Things to Know About the iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 Update Apple’s iPhone 5 iOS 10.3.2 update is small upgrade but tiny updates can have an eno… 06/07/2017 7 min read 5 Things to Know About the iOS 11 Update Apple’s next operating system is official and today we want to go over the most impo… 06/07/2017 16 min read New MacBook Pro: 6 Reasons to Buy, 3 Reasons Not To The new MacBook Pro is a great machine for many users, but for others, it is tough to use … 06/07/2017 7 min read Load More In Apple 1 Comment One Comment iPhone 6s iOS 11 Beta: First Impressions & Performance – iPHONEBiZZ.com 06/06/2017 at 5:03 pm […] Now that we’ve got a few hours of use under our belt we want to relay our first impressions of the iPhone 6s iOS 11 beta and its performance.

Mello Jr. Jun 6, 2017 3:53 PM PT New voices for Siri and peer-to-peer payments are among the new features in the next version of Apple's mobile device operating system iOS 11, previewed at the company's annual Worldwide Development Conference on Monday. "With the new operating system, Apple has doubled down on many of the applications it has developed for iOS," said Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at Reticle Research. "Much of the enhancement of the OS has come via those core applications versus general new functionality," he told TechNewsWorld. How Apple has improved Siri for the upcoming OS is an example of that. New Voice, New Sex With iOS 11, Apple has given Siri a voice that's more natural and expressive. What's more, a male voice has been added. "I like how Apple is underscoring the idea of 'more natural,'" said Tuong Nguyen, an analyst with Gartner. "Conversational interfaces are arguably the most intuitive way to interact with machines," he told TechNewsWorld. "Apple's competitors certainly agree, given the efforts and emphasis they've put on it." Parlez Vous Francais In addition, there's a translation function. You can tell Siri to ask, "What are the most popular dishes in your restaurant?" in Chinese, and it will ask the question in that language. Languages initially supported by Siri translate are English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. Siri's IQ also got a boost. "Siri not only understands your voice, it understands the context," Apple Senior Vice President for Software Engineering Craig Federighi said at WWDC. "It understands your interests. It understands how you use your device, and this allows it to ultimately understand what you want next." In iOS 11, Siri uses on-device learning to understand topics of interest to you so it can flag news items that might interest you, or make a calendar appointment based on reservation made on the Web. Paying Your Peers The Apple Pay mobile payment system gets an expansion in iOS 11. It will be able to make person-to-person payments through the iMessage app. "Apple Pay is the No. 1 contactless payment service on mobile devices, and by the end of the year, it'll be available in more than 50 percent of retailers in the U.S.," said Federighi. The new iOS expands its use of NFC technology. Up to now, NFC use has been limited to Apple Pay. With iOS 11, it also will read tags, which can convey information about a product to a device, or provide authentication. Adding that function helps the NFC market in a number of ways. For example, companies and developers working with tags no longer have to cobble together workarounds to accommodate iOS devices. "There are a lot of examples of applications that have been successful in Europe and Asia. where the Android market share is much higher," explained Paula Hunter, executive director of the NFC Forum. "Here in the U.S., we've had a lot of application providers hesitant to go full throttle with NFC, because a significant portion of the market is served by Apple," she told TechNewsWorld. Messages in the Cloud Apple's new OS will make it easier for developers to forge applications that tap into the camera and motion sensors in iOS devices to create augmented reality programs through ARKit. "Tim Cook excited the market a number of times last year by speaking about AR," Gartner's Nguyen said. "This announcements feels like more of an official endorsement-acknowledgement of AR as a tech everyone should be paying attention to." With iOS 11, Apple's Messages app will be integrated with iCloud. That enables all conversations to be synchronized automatically across a user's devices. In addition to be being convenient, the feature saves space on a device, because most messages will be stored in the cloud. iPad Gets Productive With the next version of iOS, Apple will add some desired productivity features to the iPad. For example, it has a new customizable dock that can be pulled up at the bottom of the screen with a finger flick to give you quick access to your favorite apps. "To someone trying to get real work done, I think some of the improvements to iPad iOS will be welcomed -- in particular, the new dock," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. "The new dock puts a new spin on multitasking, moving iOS closer to macOS," he told TechNewsWorld. On the other hand, for consumers who use their iPad Pros primarily for content consumption, the new features could make the devices seem a bit more complex than they're used to, Moorhead pointed out. Other productivity enhancements include an improved app switcher for moving between active apps, and a new feature for managing files -- not only locally and in iCloud, but on services like Box, Dropbox and OneDrive. Moving files, text and photos is easier, too, with a new drag-and-drop feature. Apple Pencil is more deeply integrated into the iPad with iOS 11. Inline drawing is supported, and the Notes app can be accessed from the lock screen with a tap of the pencil. Never Wanting Customers Apple supports two new media formats in the new iOS: HEVC for video and HEIF for photos. Both formats offer good quality and smaller file sizes. The company also improved its Memories app to identify photos in more ways -- by anniversaries, for example, or sporting events or birthdays. When the new iOS arrives next fall, developers need not worry about finding customers for their wares, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the audience at the WWDC keynote presentation on Monday. "Eighty-six percent of our customers are running iOS 10 and taking advantage of its capabilities. This blows away other platforms that suffer from horrible fragmentation," he said. "With iOS, developers can always target the latest capabilities and features of our latest operating system," added Cook, "and be confident that there's customers there for them." John P.

Smart watch: The revolution that didnt happen Posted on 7-Jun-2017 11:19 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett Apple makes money selling Watches. In 2015 Apple said it made more money from watches than any company except Rolex. By that standard Apple’s Watch business is a success. Imagine the reaction if anyone else had gone from nowhere to the number two watch market position in a couple of years. It remains an outstanding achievement. Yet, put Apple aside, and the smart watch sector doesn’t look good. There may not even be a worthwhile smart watch market beyond Apple. Almost no-one else makes money from selling smart watches1. Pointless smart watchIt’s hard to see the point of a smart watch. Even the best ones do little useful beyond collecting health information and sending notifications. Sure, health is important. But there are other ways to collect the data. As for notifications… well whoopee. There’s a fatal flaw in the thinking behind smart watches. They promise to be the most intimate computing device. Yet you need a phone to get any value from a smart watch. And phones are without question the most intimate devices. We live in an era when most people’s phones are rarely more than an arm’s length away. It’s not often you can’t reach your phone. This means the device on your wrist might spend most of its time just 100mm or so closer to your eyes, ears or brain than your phone. It’ll be even further from your heart. Phones are betterPhone have better screens, better speakers and better processors. Your phone can vibrate a notification if that’s important to you. It is in every respect a superior way of getting information from wherever to you brain. Yet, by definition, you must already have a phone if you own a smart watch. If you’re a solider on active service, or someone who climbs a rope for a living then a watch might be more practical communications tool than a phone. Otherwise, you’re kidding yourself. Few people are more productive or enjoy better lives because they have a smart watch. UglyAway from the sensible stuff. Smart watches are universally ugly. All of them are too big to be comfortable on a wrist. The screens are hard to read. If they speak to you the sound is often pathetic. Pushing screen buttons is challenging. Don’t take my word for it. In April Huawei deputy chairman and rotating CEO Eric Xu Zhijun told analysts he never wears a smart watch. That’s not remarkable, few sensible people do wear smart watches. However, Xu is boss of the second or third biggest smart watch maker. His company launched a new model about the time he made his statement. Huawei has been making smart watches since they first appeared. It may even have sold some. Companies that rely on smart watch sales are struggling. Fitbit has laid off staff this year. You might argue that Fitbit devices are not smart watches but activity trackers. Yet in January the company has tried moving into smart watches. It acquired another struggling smart watch maker, Pebble. Android smart watches are still bug-ridden, unreliable devices. I’ve yet to see one that isn’t embarrassing. It’s not just smart watches. The entire watch sector is in decline. Few people under the age of 40 wear any kind of watch. If younger folk don’t see the need for a Swatch, why would they turn to a more expensive, buggy alternative that needs to be charged every 12 hours? If you’re thinking this is a lot like the history of the phone market since the iPhone took off, you’d be right. ??Smart watch: The revolution that didn’t happen was first posted at billbennett.co.nz.

The feature, called "Do Not Disturb While Driving," will be part of Apple's iOS 11, a new version of the operating software for Apple mobile devices. Whenever the phone is connected to a car using either Bluetooth or a cable, or if the car is moving, the phone will withhold any notifications for things like text messages or news updates. If someone does text you while you're driving, the phone can respond with an automatic message telling them you're driving and can't respond just now. The iPhone screen will also be locked to prevent drivers from using many of their apps while driving. Passengers who are just riding, and not driving, will have the ability to disable the feature. Users will be able to see Apple Maps, Apple's navigation application, while driving -- though they will be unable to input destinations. Other navigation apps, like Google Maps, will also work, although not quite as easily. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, eight people are killed each day in crashes involving distracted driving. https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/06/ios-11-brings-new-features-to-iphone-and-ipad-this-fall/ Did you enjoy this article?

Apple Music hopes so Apple Music Jessica Alba, left, will.i.am, Gwyenth Paltrow and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk serve as advisors on Apple Music's "Planet of the Apps." Jessica Alba, left, will.i.am, Gwyenth Paltrow and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk serve as advisors on Apple Music's "Planet of the Apps." (Apple Music) Yvonne VillarrealContact Reporter “Planet of the Apps” is what would happen if “Shark Tank,” “The Voice” and “Silicon Valley” had a ménage à trois. There are roughly 2.2 million apps available for download in the App Store and Apple Music is hoping this new reality series about finding the next great one will have people tuning in. On “Planet of the Apps,” developers pitch their app ideas — on an escalator! — to a panel of celebrity advisors: actresses and businesswomen Jessica Alba (co-founder of eco-friendly product line Honest Company) and Gwyneth Paltrow (founder of lifestyle and e-commerce website, Goop); singer and businessman will.i.am, and entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Developers who move on to the next round receive mentoring from one of the judges. Participants then try to persuade Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm that was first to invest in Snapchat, to invest in them. Apps from developers featured in the series will receive premium placement on the front page of Apple's App Store. Planet of the Apps celebrates the world of apps and the talented people who create them. Planet of the Apps celebrates the world of apps and the talented people who create them. See more videos The 10-episode series will debut on Apple Music at 9 p.m. PT Tuesday — that’s right, in just a few hours, with hardly any notice or fanfare of its arrival. Or, as Paltrow describes it: “Beyonce-style.” Questions of when Apple would wade into the original programming space and challenge streaming companies such as Netflix and Amazon have long followed the company. Apple Music, the tech giant’s $9.99 a month music streaming service, presented an entry point by introducing music-centric video offerings from heavyweights like Taylor Swift and Drake in 2016. The company announced earlier this year its plan to more earnestly join the original programming space to help distinguish Apple Music from rival music streamers like Spotify and Tidal. Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services, says “Planet of the Apps” is a continuation of what’s come before by being squarely in line with Apple’s DNA, given that the company launched an app store in 2008. “Who could have imagined the cultural phenomenon that apps have become?” Cue said in a phone interview. “It's hard to imagine life without them, but the odd truth is that it hasn't even been nine years since the app store was launched.” Who could have imagined the cultural phenomenon that apps have become? — Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services The show’s debut comes a day after Apple announced an App Store redesign during a presentation at its annual conference for app makers. Apple aims to direct users toward new apps that may be worth trying or relevant to the day’s watercooler topics. The changes should be welcomed by app creators who’ve grown frustrated with the major challenge of getting noticed. And the show also may help remind Apple users to poke around the App Store. Apple generated more than $24 billion in sales from the App Store, Apple Music and other services during its last fiscal year. It generally takes a 30% cut of app purchases. The series hails from veteran TV producer Ben Silverman (“The Office,” “Jane the Virgin”) and producing partner Howard Owens, who are co-chief executives of Propagate, the production company teaming with Apple on the show. The pervasiveness of technology and the sometimes blind ambition of its creators were a perfect combination for TV, Silverman said in a phone interview. “We felt that the culture of apps was transforming our lives — how we eat, how we think, how we move, and how we listen to music,” Silverman said. “And more and more people are graduating from school or skipping school wanting to go right into the world of technology and app development because of the promise of the gold at the end of the rainbow and the opportunity to be somebody to change the world. And we thought there was a great show to be created in that space.” Apple Music Andrew Kemendo discusses evolving the business plan for his app, Pair, with advisor Jessica Alba.

(Apple Music) To make it more digestible to a mainstream audience, text boxes periodically appear on-screen to define some of the tech and business jargon that gets thrown around. And Silverman knew big celebrity names in the business world were key to bringing credibility to the series. Paltrow, a friend of Silverman’s, said she agreed to participate because she saw it as a way for Goop to reach a new audience. “I obviously had some trepidation about going into television,” Paltrow said. “It's a different relationship to be coming into somebody's living room every night, but I felt within the context of the world of Apple, it just seemed like it made a lot of sense.” “It was very overwhelming,” she said of the volume of ideas pitched during the series. “And, of course, I felt nervous about, you know — why am I judging some hard-core engineer? For the sake of the show, I can understand what people are trying to do and trying to achieve. But in the beginning it was a bit scary, to be honest.” "Of course, I felt nervous about, you know -- why am I judging some hard-core engineer? — Gwyneth Paltrow, a celebrity advisor on "Planet of the Apps" The first episode will be available for free on iTunes and planetoftheapps.com, with promotion on Apple.com. A new episode will be available exclusively on Apple Music each week on Tuesday evenings. An app for the show itself, which will feature bonus content among other things, will be unveiled in the coming weeks. “Planet of the Apps” debuts ahead of Apple’s adaptation of James Corden’s popular “Late Late Show” segment “Carpool Karaoke,” which was originally slated to be the company’s first series out of the gate. Apple had announced in February at the Code Media Conference that “Carpool Karaoke: The Series” would debut in April, but it’s now scheduled to debut Aug. 8. Asked if Apple has a quota or goal it hopes to reach with its original programming, Cue would only say, “We have a goal to hopefully create great shows.” Times staff writer Paresh Dave contributed to this report.

After all, with users loading up their devices with high-res photos, Live Photos, 4K videos, and an endless number of apps, it’s easier than ever to stretch the limit of even a 128GB device. Don't Miss: iOS 11 beta 1 is now available to download To help ease the strain, Apple with iOS 11 has introduced a new setting which provides users with more granular storage management controls. Specifically, iOS 11 now enables users to get a clearer snapshot of where their storage is being used up while also providing quick solutions help to clear up space. Originally brought to light by Ryan Jones, iOS 11 houses a revamped storage section that allows users to quickly identify and delete uncharacteristically large attachments from the Messages app. This is a welcome improvement from the current incarnation of iOS where users have to select individual conversations, check for attachments or images, and then delete them. This works well enough, but sometimes it’s not readily apparent what conversations are using up more than their fair share of storage. iOS 11, in contrast, streamlines the entire process. Yuuus. Even better! You can seriously triage storage AND recommendations. pic.twitter.com/7UO0PFxzhz — Ryan Jones (@rjonesy) June 5, 2017 Not only that, but MacRumors points out that iOS 11 will now give users some recommendations for clearing up space as well. All in all, the new storage features above are highly welcome, if not long overdue. Apple has made managing device storage much easier in recent years, but iOS 11 appears to give users more control over their devices than ever before.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple iOS 11 is hiding two game-changing new iPhone features Zach Epstein BGR News June 6, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Apple on Monday gave the world its first look at iOS 11, the company’s next-generation mobile platform that will power iPhones and iPads for the year to come. Well, it’ll power most iPhones and iPads but not all of them, since a few models will be left behind. Apple’s WWDC 2017 keynote was packed full of action from start to finish and there’s precious little question that iOS 11 was the star of the show. Sure, Apple unveiled its first brand new product line since 2015 and it already looks like a winner, but the company’s new mobile software is still the main draw of WWDC and it likely always will be. We’ve already covered iOS 11 quite extensively, and we highlighted the 11 most exciting new iPhone and iPad features coming in Apple’s new software this fall. In this post, however, we’re going to highlight two features in particular that will be nothing short of game-changers for Apple and its user base. Don't Miss: The 11 most exciting new features coming to the iPhone and iPad in iOS 11 Apple Pay Apple Pay itself was a game-changer for Apple, and for the general public in markets like the US where mobile payments hadn’t yet proliferated. Even today, Apple Pay continues to impress people — I still get fantastic reactions from store clerks almost every time I use my Apple Watch to pay for something. With iOS 11, however, Apple Pay takes a huge step in a new direction. Services like Venmo and Paypal’s copycat service offer users a quick, easy, and even social way to send money to each other. Rather than bother with paper currency and change, a few quick taps on any phone or tablet lets you pay your coworker back for the lunch he or she bought you. These services are great, but most people have no idea they exist. Apple Pay’s new person to person payment feature isn’t really anything new or novel in terms of tech. But Apple Pay integration in the Messages app will be largely responsible for popularizing this type of service. It’s just so easy… The new Apple Pay feature is integrated into Messages like an iMessage app. Tap the icon, enter a dollar amount, authenticate with Touch ID, presto. Better yet, if someone messages you saying that he or she is owed money, Messages will see the dollar amount and QuickType will pop up a shortcut allowing users to send payments in just a few taps. There’s also more to be gained for Apple. By integrating Apple Pay functionality into what is perhaps the most used iOS app on the planet, Apple is making this new person to person payment feature something of a Trojan Horse. Users who have never used Apple Pay in the past will now set it up and add their bank account details in order to enable the service. From there, it’s a very small step to using Apple Pay in stores to make purchases. Augmented Reality Read More Since I’m already an Apple Pay user, the second game-changing feature in iOS 11 is the one that has me more excited. That’s right, Apple is finally diving into augmented reality. AR isn’t exactly a new technology, but it’s certainly still in its infancy. In a nutshell, AR overlays digital content on top of physical objects to create a mixed reality experience. The most widely known example of augmented reality is Pokemon Go, which features a mode that lets players see virtual Pokemon creatures as if the characters are actually standing in front of them. The implementation in Pokemon Go is a bit elementary, but it has been a nice little intro to AR for millions of people. The same concept will be included in a much wider scale in iOS 11, and it will be dramatically enhanced and made available to third-party developers. “iOS 11 introduces ARKit, a new framework that brings augmented reality to hundreds of millions of iOS devices by allowing developers to easily build unparalleled AR experiences,” Apple said on its website. “By blending digital objects and information with the environment around you, augmented reality takes apps beyond the screen, freeing them to interact with the real world in entirely new ways. Like never before, games and apps can offer fantastically immersive and fluid experiences that are out of this world, yet virtually within it.” There have been rumblings surrounding Apple’s upcoming AR push ever since iPhone 8 rumors first began popping up last year. And that’s where things get really exciting. Apple’s tech allows the camera on an iPhone or iPad to quickly make a 3D model of a user’s surroundings, behind the scenes. Then, apps can place virtual objects on top of physical ones on the iOS device’s display. Here’s a video of Apple’s new AR capabilities in action: Virtual reality is and will always be a bit of a niche. It’s fantastic for gaming, design, and in some other areas, but it’s not something that will see widespread adoption for the average consumer anytime soon. AR, on the other hand, has countless mass-market use cases on phones, tablets, and even on futuristic smart glasses and contact lenses. Google Glass was a poor implementation that was years ahead of its time, but this type of product will indeed proliferate in the years ahead. Apple’s new AR push will be exactly what this exciting new tech needed to promote development and end user adoption. It’s exciting today, but just wait until Apple releases an iPhone 8 with enhanced 3D scanning features. Then, things get even more exciting down the road, when Apple’s smart glasses become a reality.

Apple Unveils 'HomePod' Speaker, 1st New Product in Years VOA News Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory June 07, 2017 08:12 Apple nodded to several up-and-coming technology trends, unveiling a new "smart'' home speaker and device features touching on virtual reality, online privacy and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The "HomePod'' speaker unveiled Monday is similar to devices from rivals, some of which have been on the market for years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. It is the first new device Apple has announced in almost three years. It unveiled the Apple Watch in September 2014. Apple "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others,'' said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive'' way that's less dependent on smarthphones, he said. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. The HomePod speaker is photographed in a a showroom during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose , California on June 5, 2017. /AP ◆ Keeping It Real with VR New iMacs unveiled Monday at Apple's annual conference for software programmers are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for development virtual-reality "experiences.'' But Apple is late to the game on VR. Samsung and Google already have VR systems centered on their smartphones. Facebook, HTC and Sony have high-end VR systems, too. Virtual reality has been described as the next big thing for decades. But so far, interest has been strongest among gamers, developers and hardware makers rather than everyday users. Apple's entry into the market could change this. Its entry into digital-music sales with iTunes, and into the smartphone market with the iPhone, upended those industries and gave them mass appeal. ◆ New iPhone Features New features coming to iPhones and iPads include messages that sync to Apple servers in the cloud. These devices will only keep the most recent messages in local storage. For photos, Apple is turning to a "high efficiency'' format to replace the widely used JPEG standard. Although the format is not exclusive to Apple, it's not yet clear how well the photos will work with non-Apple software and devices, which mostly use JPEG. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. ◆ Mac Gets an Upgrade Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the latest operating system for Mac computers. Called High Sierra, it recognizes more faces automatically, which should make it easier to organize photos, and will offer more photo editing tools. Safari, Apple's web browser, seeks to make users' online experience smoother and less annoying. It will allow users to automatically block auto-play videos by detecting videos that shouldn't be playing when you open a webpage to read an article, for example. The browser's new "intelligent tracking prevention,'' meanwhile, will use machine learning to identify and block digital-ad trackers in order to keep advertisers from following and profiling users. It will not block the ads themselves, though. ◆ Sizing up the iPad Apple is introducing an iPad Pro in a new size in an attempt to revive interest in its once hot-selling line of tablets. The new 10.5-inch model offers room for a full-size keyboard, something the 9.7 inch model couldn't. Yet it isn't as bulky as the 12.9-inch model. With consumers less interested in buying new tablets, Apple has increased its focus on designing tablets for professionals to do much of the same work that they usually perform on a laptop computer. It's also what Microsoft is targeting with the Surface Pro; a new model comes out on June 15. The new iPad Pro also comes with a better camera -- the same one found in the iPhone 7 -- along with more storage, a better display and faster refreshing of moving images. The new model starts at $649 and will start shipping next week. ◆ Watch the Watch Apple is also updating the operating software for its Apple Watch, including new watch faces, more personalized alerts that use machine learning to tailor information to you based on your routines and tastes. It also enhanced its workout app to, for instance, support high intensity interval training. It will also be possible to exchange data between gym equipment and the watch. In a nod to Amazon streaming fans, Apple is also bringing Amazon Prime to its Apple TV app. Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

Photo via Apple Apple’s comin’ for the Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Sonos’s product line with the HomePod, a voice-controlled smart speaker and home tech hub. Unveiled at yesterday’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)—Apple’s news feast for coders, software engineers, and the tech-obsessed—in San Jose, California, the HomePod got positive early reviews, albeit with a few caveats: Our sister site, The Verge, noted that “in a controlled demo, with specific songs designed to show off the HomePod’s strengths, we heard it do some pretty impressive audio tricks.” In other words, conditions for showing it off were optimal at yesterday’s demo. The “tricks” in question seem mostly to do with things like the quality of the bass output and using microphone technology to direct different elements of a song—say, its vocal line and backing piano—to different parts of a room for the optimal listening experience. It seems Apple is relying on the quality of the audio from its smart speaker to set it apart from what is quickly becoming a crowded and competitive field. Want to snag your own? HomePods—to be offered in “space gray” and white—will hit stores in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, this December and retail at $349.

This year, two phones and one tablet are getting the axe: 2012’s iPhone 5 and fourth-generation iPad, and 2013’s iPhone 5C. These iPhones and iPads are definitely slower than their newer counterparts, but this time around the compatibility cutoff has less to do with things like RAM or raw performance. These three gadgets are the last iDevices to use 32-bit processors (the Apple A6 in the iPhones, the A6X in the iPad); beginning with the iPhone 5S and the iPad Air in 2013, all of Apple’s iPhones, iPads, and iPods since have included 64-bit chips. iOS 11 will run on: The iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, SE, 7, and 7 Plus. The iPad Air and Air 2; the iPad Mini 2, 3, and 4; the fifth-generation iPad; and all iPad Pros. The sixth-generation iPod Touch. These newer 64-bit iDevices running iOS 11 will also lose their ability to run older 32-bit software, something Apple has been warning developers about for nearly a year. In the short term, dropping this old hardware and software can free up valuable RAM and storage space for new features. In the long run it could even allow Apple to build processors without 32-bit backward compatibility—the space that would’ve been spent on those transistors could also be used for other things. The final version of iOS 11 will be released this autumn, and as usual Apple will issue a series of betas to developers and to the general public starting today.

One aspect of the new mobile OS that wasn’t talked about during the keynote was a new “Core NFC” framework that could expand near-field communication features for Apple devices beyond just its mobile payments support. The change in how iOS makes use of NFC is detailed in a documentation webpage for the beta version of iOS 11, and it was reported by Engadget earlier today. (Apple did announce on stage yesterday that its upcoming watchOS 4 release would let the Apple Watch communicate with supported gym equipment using NFC.) NFC is currently only used for mobile payments on iOS As it stands today, NFC is used on the iPhone solely to transmit payment requests between a mobile device and a card reader. This is because Apple restricts how the chip is used at a system level within iOS. With the new Core NFC framework, however, Apple could let third-party developers make use of NFC in novel ways, or it could simply expand NFC functions beyond Apple Pay for use in its own apps and services. The documentation page says, “For example, your app might give users information about products they find in a store or exhibits they visit in a museum.” As Engadget points out, there are more useful NFC use cases that go beyond holding your phone up to a museum exhibit or movie poster to get bombarded with an ad. You could make use of “tap-to-pair” functionality for linking Bluetooth speakers and other accessories to your iPhone, something Android allows and a big workaround to obnoxious wireless pairing woes. Apple could also let the iPhone’s NFC chip support transit passes or workplace keycards. You could imagine Apple releasing a general-purpose app, or build new features into the existing Wallet app, that let you manage NFC data exchanges as if they were just like airline boarding passes, movie tickets, or coupons. Of course, this is all speculative. But it’s promising news for those eager to turn their iPhone into a kind of one-stop-shop for all their mobile wallet and authentication needs. If Apple can get developers and others — even companies trying to promote new movies and attractions or even just sell ads — to come onboard, NFC could take on a larger role in the iOS ecosystem.

Bozoma Saint John on Leaving Apple for Uber & Being a Woman of Color in Corporate America 6/6/2017 by Adelle Platon FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of UBER Bozoma Saint John Following her rock-star appearance at the 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple's global head of consumer marketing, Bozoma Saint John, immediately became one of the most vibrant faces of Apple Music and increased its presence, along with Beats, in pop culture. Noteworthy accomplishments from the marketing exec -- whose 20 years of experience have included stints at PepsiCo and Spike Lee's SpikeDDB -- include working on the viral Taylor Swift and Drake workout spots as well as the Ava DuVernay-directed ad starring Mary J. Blige and actress Taraji P. Henson. The streaming service also bulked up its membership to 27 million paid subscribers since its June 2015 launch during her three-year tenure. Now, the marketing queen is tackling a new journey as the chief brand officer for car transportation and food delivery mobile service Uber. On the day the San Francisco-based company announced her hiring (June 6), Saint John spoke with Billboard about her decision to leave Apple Music, the importance of diversity in the workplace, and how she plans to conquer her role at Uber. What attracted you to this opportunity at Uber? That's a heavy question to start. [Laughs] I'm just excited. I think Uber is in an exciting space right now in the world. The brand is one that certainly has a lot of potential, and for me, a marketer who enjoys pop culture and spaces that are really growing and exciting, I want to be a part of evaluating and changing and shaping a brand that is really important to pop culture. So here I am. How did you feel about leaving Apple Music? I love Apple Music. I helped build Apple Music. It will always be a very, very big part of my life and part of the journey. But it's time to do this. What are some of the skills you learned at Apple Music that you plan to apply to your job at Uber? That's a really good question. I feel that all of my experiences across my entire career, whether they were working with Spike [Lee], being on Madison Avenue, Pepsi, Apple, Beats, all of it is about pop culture and honing the skill and the craft that's connecting both messages together. So I plan to bring that fully to Uber, because obviously, heading up all the brand momentum and the storyline for Uber means that I have to find a way to connect all of the pieces of pop culture to this very important service. And so that's really what I'm going to be focusing on. When you say pop culture, do you mean music as well? Oh yeah, all of it -- music, movies, fashion, art. You worked on many music projects while at Apple Music. What is the accomplishment you are most proud of? I am really proud of the work that we all did together at Apple. Launching Apple Music and having it grow to the size that it is now is something I will always be proud of. That, in and of itself, is a monumental task. To me, those are accomplishments I carry with pride. What would you consider to have been your biggest challenge in that role? There's certainly lots of challenges. The business continues to constantly move and change. It's a very fluid type of conversation, always, with [launching] a service that you have to explain to people and bringing it to the forefront in a way that is easy and tangible. I don't think of anything really as a challenge. It's more of an opportunity to change the way that consumers interact with something. It's the same thing I want to do here [at Uber] too. Uber has an alliance with Spotify that allows users to be backseat DJs. How do you plan to incorporate your musical connections at Uber? We all know this: Music is such a fundamental part of life. I want to make sure that we're connecting all of those same emotional inputs that we have with music in this service. This might be funny, but I think Uber is magic; you look at the products, and it's literally magical. So for me at this point, it's about taking what is a service that people actually love to use and crafting the right brand story that connects that to what can be the future vision for what Uber is going to be. When you did an interview with Billboard at last year's Women in Music event, you cited your daughter as an inspiration. Did she factor into your decision to leave Apple Music and join Uber? Oh absolutely. And thank you for asking that. That's actually really important to me. I think more than anything, there's always a lot of talk about diversity and women and the role of women in corporate, and there are lots of stats and things rolling around. But to me, I come home and look at my daughter every day. She is the one that I answer to, and I want her to see me achieving in a way that inspires her as well. So it's not just for me that I do this; it's so I can be a beacon for her as she grows and develops and looks at the world. I want her to see that it's possible. Being a black woman in America and the world and in corporate situations is something to be celebrated. So all of those things are a factor when I think about what I do with my career and how I behave in the world. Does the presence of minority women at a company weigh into your decision about working there? I wouldn't say it helps weigh in on the decision, but I do think it's important. I think diversity and having women and people of color in key positions is really important. Obviously, I've been a black woman my whole life. I don't have have any other experience. [Laughs] I think I can contribute in major ways. To have the opportunity to do that is really important and I think more should be given those roles and opportunities. What kind of narrative do you hope to build around Uber? Well, we're gonna get started on that. Quite frankly, we haven't yet begun the work of getting the strategy together. But in the meantime, I can say that my track record has always been the human story and putting people first. I always think that's the best way to go, so when I look at the story of Uber and what has been told already, I feel like the best place to start is with people. Drivers are very important, riders are obviously very important, [so it's about finding] what the connections are between those two and how we can present it to the world in a way that will connect all of those things together in a very human way. Was there a particular Uber campaign that really resonated with you? I wouldn't say a particular campaign, but I know what the potential is. I think my own personal experiences with Uber are something that I feel like we could tell; sometimes, it's like focus group of one. You get your own experience and go from there. Actually, a little over a year ago I was at SXSW and there was an Uber driver that I actually shared an amazing moment with. There was this guy who was ready to see Iggy Pop, and he was telling me about how excited he was and really needed to save his money to go see him. Incidentally, I was on my way to a meeting with Iggy Pop; I told him that and, of course, he jumped up and was excited -- we literally had to pull the car over. I said, "Well, you wanna be my date? You want to come with me?" Literally, he parked the car and we went in together. It was great. So to me, it's almost full-circle. I'm sitting here a little over a year later and talking about how to bring those stories to life -- that's part of what I want to do, which is that the stories and the daily connections and the journey are really important. And I want to be able to communicate that. What are you going to miss about the music world? Honestly, I don't think I am missing anything. I don't plan on leaving anything behind. I haven't actually thought of it that way. I'm bringing it all with me. It's a lot to unpack, but believe me, I'll be doing all of that. During the past few months, Uber has dealt with backlash that's sparked a campaign against them. What steps do you plan to take to turn the company's image around? Well, again, I do feel like the company has been so focused on growth -- it's grown so dramatically over the last few years. The leadership team and the business has been focused on growing it. The fact that this is the first time for an appointment such as [my role] is really important and it's telling of the future of where Uber wants to go. So I plan to help craft that vision in where and how and how much of the story that will be told. From a marketing standpoint, is there something you're excited about doing that you haven't done in your previous roles? See, that's the challenge. I wake up and think about that every day -- that's what really ticks for me, keeps me going. What can I do today that either hasn't been done before, or [how can I] take an old thing and evolve it into something else? It's part of what makes me a change agent -- that I'm never satisfied with the status quo. I want to change things constantly, so I'm excited to get my hands into it, roll up my sleeves. What do you hope to bring to the table at Uber? I don't know -- I think that's the beauty of it, right? It feels like the Wild Wild West. We're pioneers, and I am ready. I've got the tools. I'm ready to go and set out on this and see what is to come. That's the excitement of getting into this space, which is that I really don't know what exactly we're going to be trying to overcome. I'm certainly very versed in the path, what the challenges are, so I'm going in with eyes wide open. But I'm also giving myself the permission to be nimble and quick and change things as quickly as we need to. And by the way, I have the full commitment and confidence of the leadership team that I'm going to be able to do that -- and that's also part of the reason why I am excited. It's like, listen, we're going to need to do things. It's going to be fast. It's going to be hot. I bring as much passion and excitement to this job as I have to every other job I've had, so I'm gonna need the trust and faith to move what I need to move -- and that's what I plan to do.

It seems like just yesterday we were excited about the prospect of an app store, or the ability to select and copy text. At this week's WWDC keynote, Apple revealed a host of updates and upgrades to iOS, including many longtime requested features. You'll have to wait until spring to upgrade your iPhone or iPad with the official final version of iOS 11, or in the coming weeks you can weasel your way into an early developer version of the new OS, if you're brave enough. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Apple's mobile software is about to get its next big overhaul.  Apple Maps Do you mostly use Apple Maps to get to the shopping centre? In iOS 11 you'll be able to keep using that app to find Supre, or Myer, now that Maps is introducing 3D maps to help you navigate your local shopping centres, starting in major cities first, with others to follow, similar to the train info rollout. The same goes for airports, with indoor maps now available in iOS 11 for major hubs around the world, and more to follow later on. Related Content Apple unveils smart speaker, new Macs iPads and HomePods impress as Macs play catch up If you're one of the few who actually uses Apple Maps while driving, iOS 11 will finally introduce speed limits and lane guidance warnings for easier navigation while on the road. And like with Google Maps, Apple will finally be introducing a one-handed zoom option, although there are no details yet on how it will work. Redesigned Control Centre and Notification Centre Advertisement iOS 11 will streamline Control Centre, putting all of the options in a single screen, including playback and AirPlay controls. It will also include an improved vertical slider design for the brightness and volume controls. The Notification Centre and lock screen will also be merged into a single screen under iOS 11, basically requiring users to scroll up or down to jump to notifications, instead of sideways. Siri upgrades In addition to visual improvements and more expressive male and female voice options, in iOS 11 Siri is getting improved translation skills, including English to Chinese, Italian, German, French and Spanish, with more languages en route. Siri will also attempt to learn, on a per device basis, what a user is interested in, or needs, based on their location, or information they have already asked for. Messages and peer-to-peer Apple Pay payments iMessage remains one of the best mobile messaging platforms out there (assuming your friends and family all have iPhones), and while a dedicated app store and stickers didn't quite revolutionise that app, you can now use Apple Pay via a new iMessage app, with TouchID fingerprint authentication, to quickly send payments (encrypted end-to-end) to someone you're chatting with. Using iCloud, iOS will now ensure your iMessages remain perfectly synced across all of your devices, and Apple continues to push its stickers feature with a redesigned app drawer that makes them easier to access. But does anyone even still use those? Apple Music Apple set its sights on Spotify with Apple Music, and while it hasn't toppled the popular streaming service just yet, under iOS 11 Apple Music will finally let you creep on what your friends are listening to, or you can set all that to private if you're ashamed of your Hanson obsession. (You shouldn't be.) Apple Music will also have a Shared "Up Next" playlist so your friends can see what's queued up at a party and make their own contributions to the mix. Augmented reality While not immediately available to users when they upgrade to iOS 11, Apple is introducing a new backend tool for developers called ARKit, allowing them to take advantage of an iPhone or iPad's camera, sensors, gyroscopes and other hardware to create and improve augmented reality experiences made popular by Pokemon GO, before we all stopped playing it. Camera and Photos Borrowing a card from Instagram, the iPhone and iPad's camera apps will be getting new photography filters under iOS 11, including a long-exposure effect for Live Photos for capturing dreamy, smeary images of things in motion, which should be perfect for waterfall photography enthusiasts. Live Photos can also be trimmed, and users can specify which frame of the short video can be used as for the still image. To help maximise the storage space on your iPhone or iPad which can't be expanded, iOS 11 is also introducing a new HEIF compression scheme, shrinking images better than JPEG can, with less compression. The same goes for video, with a new HEVC video codec. HomeKit and AirPlay 2 In addition to adding wireless speaker support to Apple's Home app, HomeKit will introduce AirPlay 2 to control your audio hardware that supports multi-room playback, including the Apple TV. But not Sonos, at least for the time being. Apple CarPlay Do Not Disturb It's hard to make Apple CarPlay exciting, but under iOS 11 using your mobile devices in the car will get a little safer, by not letting you use them. Taking advantage of clever Bluetooth and Wi-Fi doppler effects to detect when you're in a moving vehicle, CarPlay will automatically lock down your phone, giving you nothing but a blank screen to stare at. An auto-reply option for Messages will also be available under iOS 11, letting others know you're not ignoring them, but are busy driving. iPad Dock, App Switcher and Keyboard improvements iOS on the iPad brings some additional improvements that won't make their way to the iPhone, sadly. This includes the ability to cram even more app icons to the iPad's dock, which can be accessed at any time, while any other app is open. The new iOS 11 iPad dock will also attempt to guess what apps you might need next, providing a suggestion at the end of the bar. The iPad's new App Switcher now looks a lot like the one found on OS X, allowing users to drag and drop clipboard contents, images or other files between open applications in split-view. It would be nice to have on the iPhone, but the limited screen real estate would make things simply too tiny to see when all your apps were tiled across the display. What could be the best improvement made to the iPad's UI under iOS 11 is the new QuickType functionality that allows punctuation, alternate characters and even numbers to be accessed from one keyboard by simply using small gestures atop each key. It seems extremely useful, and hopefully Apple will eventually include it on the iPhone's keyboard, even if just the horizontal one, eventually. Improved iPad Apple Pencil support The Apple Pencil was designed to go hand-in-hand with the monstrous iPad Pro, giving artists, designers and engineers a more authentic feeling of sketching on paper. But Apple is now expanding what the Pencil can be used for on the iPad, in standard apps such as Mail, Safari, screenshots and Notes with mark-up that allows users to easily make hand-drawn annotations In Notes, iOS 11 will now even use machine learning to translate and index hand-written notes so they can be searched, or copied and pasted as editable text. And it will serve as a rudimentary scanner, automatically straightening and converting documents captured using the iPad's camera. Files app After a decade of updates, Apple is finally giving iOS a dedicated File Manager app called Files — at least on the iPad. But it won't be as robust as Finder is on OS X, as the iPad's core file structure will still remain hidden to users. Files seem more useful as a central place to find or delete files for when your device runs out of storage space. But Files also has access to stuff you've stored on iCloud, and other online storage options including Dropbox, Box and Google Drive, so you don't need to hop from app to app to find a document you need, which is potentially the most useful feature of the new Files app. Explore the smart design, breakthrough science and awe-inspiring tech shaping your future at Gizmodo Australia.

Scroll down for videos  The terrifying faces may look like creatures from a horror movie, but these digital images were actually generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Pix2pix project has unleashed a new tool that analyzes portraits and fills them in with colors and textures using a technique called generative adversarial networks (GANs) HOW DOES IT WORK?  Users are presented with an input box and an output box and are prompted to draw a face in input, select process and in seconds, the AI will reveal its version of the sketch. Pix2pix used GANs to train its algorithm, which is a method to help the technology work towards a solution to a problem by judging how accurate its results are and the repeating them until they are correct. One component of the AI is drawing, while the other determines whether the result is deemed 'real' or 'fake' and if fake, the sketching factor keeps adding until it gets it right. The tool, which was designed by Dutch Public Broadcaster NPO, was fed thousands of images of one of its anchors, Lara Rense. Users are presented with an input box and an output box on the website. They are  then prompted to draw a face in input, select process and in seconds, the AI will reveal its version of the sketch. And although the original may not have been anything to look at, the AI's result seems to be a thing of nightmares. However, many AI systems have attempted to create their own art and it seems they have all had the same results. MotherBoard explained that this is because machine learning was designed to classifying existing image, not make new ones. But it seems, according to the popular Tumblr prostheticknowledge, the tool does work if you are able to draw a flawless image in the input box.

'It shows some of the unreasonable effectiveness and strange inner workings of deep learning systems.' 'The unique characteristics of the human voice are learned and generated as well as hallucinations of a system trying to find images which are not there.'

'We used state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to generate new faces,' the Nightmare Machine website says. 'Then, we dropped a hint of scariness onto the generated faces in the spirit of Halloween. 'Now, we wonder: which faces are scarier?' Visitors to the website can rate whether an image they see is scary or not, and help the AI to learn. Each time someone votes for an image as scary, the algorithms learn to consider the qualities of that image as fear-inducing qualities - and the same goes for non-scary' images. Every time a vote is cast, the AI learns more about what humans consider a scary image. With enough input from people around the world, the AI could generate the sum of human fears. TURN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS INTO DEEP DREAM NIGHTMARES  Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognize photos. The results were a terrifying and fascinating mix of random animals, eyes and psychedelic shapes spotted in everyday images. And a few weeks later, developers created an app that lets you transform your own photos and GIFs into Deep Dream nightmares. Called Deep Dreamer, the tool was built by Realmac Software based in Brighton and is only available for Mac users. The company specialises in Mac software and has not revealed plans to roll it our for Windows user.  Any photo or GIF can be dragged into the tool, or opened from the File menu, and a series of tools lets users tweak how the finished photo, or 'dream' will look. These range from an impressionist painting style, to looking for eyes, animals and a dream described simply as 'trippy'. The number of 'dreams' and iterations can be tweaked to dig deeper into the image and Google's code, resulting in more obscure and surreal images. Once the refinements have been selected, users click 'Start dreaming' and the image begins to change on the screen. A progress bar sits at the top and a notification is sent when the 'dream has finished'. Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Guest Mobile AR could hit $60 billion by 2021 thanks to Apple and Facebook Tim Merel@DigiCapitalist June 6, 2017 3:30 PM The mobile AR platform war kicked off at F8 with Mark Zuckerberg’s proclamation that “we’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform.” That simple sentence transformed what had been a one-hit wonder in Pokémon Go into an epic battle between Facebook, Apple, Google, Tencent, Snap, Alibaba, Baidu, Samsung, Huawei and more. Apple’s announcement of its ARkit for iOS this week as “the largest AR platform in the world” took the mobile AR war to the next level. They’re fighting over a market that could hit over a billion users and $60 billion revenue globally by 2021 (as detailed in Digi-Capital’s new Mobile Augmented Reality Report). Software is eating the (mobile AR) world While folks were distracted by the prospect of an iPhone AR being launched by Apple, Facebook changed the game fundamentally by launching its mobile AR Platform. But Apple secretly had its own mobile AR software plans brewing ahead and countered with ARkit for iOS. So where mobile AR hardware from Apple, Samsung, Huawei and others could deliver an installed base over 400 million users by 2021, Facebook, Tencent, Apple, Snap and others could drive a mobile AR software user base in the hundreds of millions next year, and billions by 2021. Mobile AR software platforms could deliver over 4 times the number of users of dedicated mobile AR hardware. All about that base Some folks might be incredulous at these sorts of numbers. So let’s look at hard data on installed bases and conversion rates for the major players to get a sense of scale. Facebook’s AR platform could be rolled out to Facebook Messenger’s 1.2 billion monthly active users, WhatsApp’s 1.2 billion MAU, and Instagram’s 700 million MAU. While it’s tempting to add these numbers together, significant overlap means that is too aggressive (i.e. Facebook doesn’t have 3.1 billion unique MAU). It’s more conservative to think about either Messenger or WhatsApp as a starting point for the number of unique users Facebook could try to migrate to its AR Platform. And Facebook knows what it’s doing when migrating users to new features. 15 percent of WhatsApp users use Status 10 weeks after launch, 29 percent of Instagram users use Stories less than a year after launch, and 54 percent of Instagram users use Direct 4 years after launch. Now that’s a growth curve. But let’s not forget that Apple is expert when it comes to converting existing users to new software, with 86 percent of Apple’s nearly 700 million iPhones installing iOS 10 a year after launch. That’s a pretty compelling prospect for the rollout of ARkit. Tencent has 846 million MAU for WeChat, and migrated 61 percent of them to use Moments every time they open WeChat 5 years after launch. While Tencent hasn’t formally announced its AR platform yet, it battled Alibaba in the mobile AR market earlier this year. Of Snap’s 300 million MAU, they’ve migrated 45 percent to Stories 4 years after launch. Snap doesn’t describe Lenses as mobile AR yet, but it’s still fighting a head-to-head battle with Facebook and Apple over mobile AR. And this is before considering LINE, Kakao, Snow, Baidu and more. The platforms entering the mobile AR software market have billions of users. They’re great at migrating them to new features. If hard data is anything to go by, the only user numbers that make sense for mobile AR software platforms are big ones. Hard wearing We’ve been saying for the last 2 years Apple is the best placed tech company to drive AR, and an iPhone AR has been part of our mobile AR forecasts since late last year. Likewise we anticipate Samsung, Huawei and others launching their own AR enabled smartphones (whether using Google Tango or something proprietary). With phone replacement cycles at 2½ years and high-end phones anywhere between 1/3 and 2/3 of smartphone sales (depending on manufacturer and geography), range-topping AR phones could deliver an installed base of at first tens and then hundreds of millions in a few short years. But mobile AR hardware will not be a distinct market from mobile AR software, and it might also be a much smaller one in terms of users for the next few years. Also the mobile AR software platforms could migrate seamlessly to new mobile AR hardware, making the user base of mobile AR hardware platforms a subset of mobile AR software platforms (except for Apple, where it’s basically the same thing). Both hardware and software players could win in mobile AR, but how (and how big) they’ll win might look very different. Phoning it in Facebook’s mobile AR Platform and Apple’s ARkit for iOS may have kicked things off this year, but the inflection point for mobile AR software revenue might take time as the mobile AR developer ecosystem spins up. Similarly even if Apple, Samsung or Huawei launch new mobile AR hardware before the end of the year, mobile AR hardware’s inflection point could take a year or so to get here. So mobile AR revenue could stay below $10 billion through 2018, with an inflection point around 2019 seeing dramatic acceleration to a market worth more than $60 billion revenue by 2021. The revenue drivers come down to installed bases, use cases and unit economics, but what that revenue might look like could be different to what folks expect. It’s not all Pokémon Go Pokémon Go was the catalyst for mobile AR last year, but the bulk of mobile AR revenue could be in sectors other than games. Over 80 percent of mobile AR revenue could come from mobile network data, eCommerce sales, advertising, consumer (non-games) apps and enterprise/B2B sales. You might have noticed that hardware isn’t listed here yet, and there’s a reason for that. Until Apple, Samsung or Huawei launch mobile AR hardware, we don’t know if their AR phones will shorten phone replacement cycles to stimulate sales, or enable premium pricing to grow revenue per unit. Until there is hard data from mobile AR hardware launches, a revenue neutral stance for hardware is the most conservative approach. Mobile AR could generate huge spikes in mobile network data usage, as developers take advantage of the new features and leverage the cloud to keep things lightweight and fast. A tsunami of data means that the telcos could take a quarter of mobile AR revenue to fill the data pipeline. What isn’t clear yet is whether this will be new money from premium pricing, or cannibalization under existing data plans. Mobile network leaders need to think long and hard about how to make mobile AR data revenue a profit driver, not a loss leader. eCommerce sales (goods and services, not in-app purchases) could take more than $2 of every $10 spent on mobile AR. Alibaba, Amazon, eBay and a range of new startups will be able to sell stuff to folks in totally new ways. While some of this might cannibalize existing eCommerce, mobile AR eCommerce could take another bite out of the total retail market. Adspend looks set to take more than $1 of every $10 generated by mobile AR, with Blippar the first mobile AR advertising unicorn. New native advertising formats are emerging to leverage the medium and the location based data supporting it. Google and Baidu have great opportunities here, given their wealth of data and maps platforms. Non-games consumer apps, enterprise/B2B and games each look set to take around $1 of every $10 of mobile AR revenue. Where Pokémon Go has largely inspired copycats so far, these three sectors hold massive opportunities for incumbents and startups alike to launch totally new types of apps to take advantage of everything mobile AR has to offer. Lastly, location based (i.e., theme park), mobile network voice and video could also generate significant revenues from mobile AR, but on a smaller scale. The augmented sun rises in the East Combining our forecasts by sector and region indicates that Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, others) could take just under half of mobile AR revenues globally, with North America and Western Europe each taking about a fifth. So where modern VR kicked off in the US and migrated to Asia, mobile AR looks more balanced with major players like Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu joining Facebook and others on the global stage. Mobile AR rules Mobile AR could become the dominant AR/VR market for the foreseeable future, as it solves the 5 major consumer challenges for AR (hero device, all-day battery life, mobile connectivity, app ecosystem, telco cross-subsidization). Together with backing from major global consumer platforms like Facebook, the inflection point for AR/VR might now be within sight. Zuckerberg is right, but it isn’t just the camera. The phone is the first (software) and second (hardware) augmented reality platform. And that’s a one-two punch you either get to throw or get knocked out by.

Yet as well as the building itself, he also wanted to bring back Silicon Valley's past with thousands of trees creating what is now called Apple Park. Now, the incredible lengths Apple went to in making his vision a reality, from buying a Christmas tree farm in Nevada to buying so many local trees it caused a shortage, have been revealed. Scroll down for video  From buying a Christmas tree farm in Nevada to purchasing so many local trees it caused a shortage for other construction projects, the incredible lengths Apple went to have been revealed. Here, the finished Park is shown, with some on the 9,000 trees being planted. While the office itself boasts elaborate glass canopies, a two-story yoga room, a 4,000 person café with four-story glass doors, and even patented pizza boxes to prevent food from getting soggy, the parkland surrounding it is just as impressive.  David Muffly, the expert dubbed 'Apple's tree whisperer' has revealed the incredible lengths Apple went to in a bid to fulfil Steve Jobs vision - even buying a Christmas tree farm in Nevada. Muffly said the biggest challenge was finding enough trees, especially as the number rose from Jobs' original 6,000 to the current goal of 9,000.  When Jobs presented his plan to the Cupertino City Council in June 2011, he said that Apple would add to the 3,700 existing trees for a total of 6,000 - but this proved impossible, so new trees had to be brought it.

Share this article Share Jobs hoped to recapture the lost feel of an area that was once mostly open spaces and fruit orchards. 'The landscape design of meadows and woodlands will create an ecologically rich oak savanna reminiscent of the early Santa Clara Valley,' Apple said in its original proposal.  'It will incorporate both young and mature trees, and native and drought tolerant plants that will thrive in Santa Clara County with minimal water consumption.  'The thoughtful and extensive landscaping will recall Cupertino's pre-agricultural and agricultural past.' Planners meticulously mapped how the trees would look as they grew. Here, the plan shows them after a year Plans for the exterior of the Apple campus, showing the huge number of plants and trees. In fact, the number rose from Jobs' original 6,000 to the current goal of 9,000.  The most problematic area was finding larger trees on the perimeter to present a green border around the new HQ. After looking at redwoods at some abandoned Christmas tree farms up on Skyline, the search widened. 'I sent all my little tree elves to help me, telling them we need big trees we can transport to the site,' he told Steven Levy of Backchannel. 'Next thing I know we're finding these in two abandoned Christmas tree farms in the Mojave Desert, Yermo, and Adelanto. Who knew there were Christmas tree farms in the Mojave?'  Apple actually bought the Yermo site, according to Levy. HOW APPLE PRESERVED THE TREES ON SITE 800 of the healthiest and most attractive trees were 'boxed' so they could be stored in a corner of the construction site  Apple's tree strategy involced first preserving the best trees already on the site for replanting later. According to planning documents, Apple removed 3,616 trees from the land before construction could begin. Muffly and his team  selected and stored 800 of the healthiest and most attractive of those trees and 'boxed' them so they could be stored in a corner of the construction site.  A report from the city's consulting arborist, Michael Bench, included photos of a couple of trees from the site being readied for transplantation to these large boxes, and revealed how they were moved. The pain painstaking process was revealed in an October 2013 report. 'The pipes are driven under the root ball using a pneumatic hammer.  'A large I-Beam will be bolted to these pipes on the 2 sides where they extend past the root ball.  'When it is time to transplant the trees, cranes will affix cables to the I-Beams to lift and move the tree.  'The root balls are being irrigated and will continue to be irrigated on a regular schedule for up to 5 years.'   The project is estimated to cost a staggering $5 billion (£4 billion), and it isn't hard to see why; stunning new images reveal the unimaginable attention to detail at work in the nearly completed 'Apple Park' campus, giving rise to everything from specially crafted door handles to a 'building that breathes.'  Breathtaking new photos appearing in the June issue of Wired, which appeared on newsstands on May 23, revealed a close-up look at some of the features that will set Apple's campus apart from all the rest. Back in 2011, just before his death, Jobs addressed the Cupertino City Council to speak of 'a pretty amazing building,' Wired reports. 'It's a little like a spaceship landed.' APPLE TRIGGERS CALIFORNIA TREE SHORTAGE  Developers working on San Francisco's new Transbay Transit Center train station are having a hard time getting trees for the new 5.4-acre green rooftop City Park.  Patrick Trollip, the lead landscaper on the transit project, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Apple has become their biggest obstacle because the company keeps buying all the trees at landscaping centers along the coast.  'Buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat business.  'And it's been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple has been buying up 3,000 trees for its new Cupertino headquarters.  In a cluster of East Bay nurseries, Apple has been growing more than 4,600 trees, which are nestled in large, wooden boxes When Greenspan and Trollip found a tree they fancied they would 'tag it' with a locking yellow tag, so that nobody else — like Apple — could get it.  Eventually all the tagged trees were moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the transbay project team leased 4 acres.'    'Could we have cut a corner here or there?' Cook told Wired when asked about the obsession with detail. 'It wouldn't have been Apple. And it wouldn't have sent the message to everybody working here every day that detail matters, that care matters.  'I revere him,' Cook says. 'And this was clearly his vision, his concept. Our biggest project ever.' The futuristic campus will soon be welcoming its first employees, who will be greeted by swathes of artificial hills, a mini-forest that will eventually contain 9,000 drought-resistant indigenous trees, and a 'breathing building' powered by 805,000-square-feet of solar paneling. This room-sized mock-up of the planned Apple HQ was released in November 2013 before executives submitted their plans to the council. Pictured is an artist's impression, showing the huge number of trees The parts of the multi-storey car park that will be on show, according to this image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in THE OBSESSION WITH DETAIL INSIDE 'APPLE PARK' Construction on Apple's futuristic campus has been estimated to cost roughly $5 billion. Apple has specified every part of the project with rules for contractors, and features include:   'Breathing building' that uses soffits beneath the canopies to inhale, and shafts to exhale warm air - as Steve Jobs hated air conditioning and fans Artificial hills and a mini-forest of 9,000 native trees, all drought-resistant with hopes they can 'survive a climate crisis' with some hand picked by Jobs 100,000-square-foot Fitness and Wellness Center (including a two-story yoga room made of distressed stone to look like Steve Jobs favourite Yosemite hotel) Canopies (fins along the glass) on every floor to help the building 'breathe'  A cafe with four-story glass doors that will open up on nice days so employees can eat outside 'Pods' designed for the many different activities that will take place within its walls, from work and collaboration to socializing 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater  805,000 square-feet of solar panelling 755-foot tunnel adorned with thousands of tiny white tiles Shock absorbers to withstand earthquakes Offices panelled with 'custom timber veneer' from recycled wood - and guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages Patented pizza boxes to keep food from getting soggy Contractors were told no vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass  According to Wired, the campus will also have a 100,000 square-foot Fitness and Wellness Center – and, this will contain a two-story yoga room built from distressed stone from 'the right quarry in Kansas,' to mimic the stone at Jobs' favourite Yosemite hotel. Inside the circular building, each floor will be lined with fins called 'canopies,' which will be equipped with soffits on the under that will allow the Ring to 'inhale' air. And, shafts placed elsewhere will allow it to exhale warm air to the outside, Wired reports.  With elaborate glass canopies (pictured left), a two-story yoga room, a 4,000 person café with four-story glass doors, and even patented pizza boxes to prevent food from getting soggy, Apple's highly-anticipated 'mothership' could soon bring the dream to life. The door handle, designed by Apple and Foster + Partners (right) is used on both sliding doors and pivoting ones, and is believed to have gone through dozens of protypes. The final version is designed to be integrated into the doorframe with no visible bolts. The building will have a massive four-story atrium as its café, with four-story glass doors that will open up on nice days so employees can eat outside. The Apple Park café will make use of Apple's patented pizza box, as well, which the firm is believed to have been trialing at its existing campus.  All door handles in the building are custom designed from Apple and Foster + Partners – and, whether a sliding door or pivoting, they'll all have the same kind of handle. There have been several prototypes, with some that were 'long and barely protruding,' and others that are 'tighter and less forgiving,' according to Wired. And, the staircases are sculpted from thin concrete that's 'the perfect white.'   The Apple campus will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Pictured is the most recent image of the site, taken on January 13 APPLE'S PATENTED PIZZA BOX  The building will have a massive four-story atrium as its café, which will have four-story glass doors that will open up on nice days so employees can eat outside. The Apple Park café will make use of Apple's patented pizza box, as well (pictured) In 2012, Apple published a patent for a special food container that requires no assembly before use, and will minimize storage space. It would have several uses, including the storing and transport of food 'in any shape and size,' from eggs and fruits to meat products, or to store got foods such as pizza. And, it could prevent pizza from becoming soggy. 'In one embodiment, the elevated portion can take the form of concentric rings that elevate the pizza from the bottom surface of the container,' the patent explains. 'Elevating the pizza from the bottom surface ensures that any steam that is emitted from the bottom of the pizza can flow away from the bottom of the pizza. 'Allowing such steam to flow away from the bottom of the pizza prevents moisture from becoming trapped between the pizza and the bottom surface of the container and subsequently reabsorbed by the pizza causing it to get soggy.' The building will be home to scores of glass-encased 'pods' designed for the many different activities that will take place within its walls, from work and collaboration to socializing.  Jobs' vision of the campus saw harmony between nature outside and the building itself, and to ensure the right flora would be perfect, he sought out tree expert David Muffly. The idea was to use indigenous plants that could withstand drought and even a climate crisis.  Breathtaking new photos appearing in the June issue of Wired , on newsstands May 23, have revealed a close-up look inside Apple Park Earlier this year, a flyover of Apple's mothership revealed work on Campus 2 is nearly complete. The incredible drone images also reveal the astonishing attention to detail of the site. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. Apple hopes that the campus will be finished by spring this year.   Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project.   More than $1 billion (£800 million) was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley.  Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company,' she said.

There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around. The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies.  The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.  The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut'. The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn't reach, and on-site recycling.

This image shows work progressing on the site, with the outer ring almost complete The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Francisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut' An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.  Technology companies have long favoured generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description.  The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees.  The new campus will be located at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, which is part of the world-renowned Silicon Valley. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules, including no vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass.  What was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics Pictured is the cafeteria housed in a huge atrium. There are 59 skylights along the roof, allowing natural light to come inside, while giant glass doors open to let fresh air in Apple Campus 2 will additionally have underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site can be covered in trees And guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages.  The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. 'With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,' he said.  'You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.'  The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product Drone footage taken above the site reveals the vast extent of the construction, with hundreds, if not thousands of lorries and diggers involved Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms.  Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products.  The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But Mr de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example Architects working on the building say that many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Much of the construction time has been spent in placing small tiles along the walls of one of the access tunnels 'They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,' Mr de la Torre said. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies Technology companies have long favoured generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. Pictured left is Apple's current Cupertino campus Covering 175 acres, Apple's 'Campus 2' headquarters will replace its current offices at 1 Infinite Loop (pictured) 'The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple,' the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm.  'We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before,' the former construction manager said.  Signage also required a delicate balancing act, as Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency.     This image is an artist's impression of what the Apple Campus 2 will look like from above when its complete. The site will be surrounded by a man-made forest featuring 7,000 trees. It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 per cent asphalt Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-coloured walls to add to the building's natural-looking design (pictured). The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff. Pictured are artist's impressions During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four storeys would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light (pictured). Pictured is an artist's impression The cafeteria will additionally feature an outside dining and picnic area (pictured).

Fiji Time: 2:15 AM on Friday 9 June Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Apple introduces innovative speaker Reuters Wednesday, June 07, 2017 APPLE Inc on Monday introduced the HomePod, a voice-controlled speaker that can make music suggestions and adjust home temperatures, taking aim at Amazon.com Inc's Alexa feature and Echo devices. The move is the first into a completely new area by Apple for more than two years as the world's most valuable technology company looks to make up for a dip in iPhone sales and new ways to get customers to use more of its money-making apps and services. Apple's Siri assistant will be integrated into the $349 speaker, and can make music recommendations that pair with the company's Apple Music service, send text messages, check news and sports scores and control compatible home gadgets like lightbulbs and thermostats. HomePod users may initially be constrained by Siri's lack of capabilities as compared to Alexa, which also boasts the ability to order millions of Amazon products as well as food from restaurants like Domino's. Apple is expected to announce plans this week to make its Siri voice assistant work with a larger variety of apps, but initial changes were expected to add just a small number of capabilities. The HomePod speaker stands just under seven inches (18 cm) tall and is covered in fabric mesh that ill come in white or gray. A computer processor will tune sound to the room and beam specific parts of music, like a singer's voice, toward the listener. Apple will begin shipping the HomePod to the United States, Britain and Australia in December. The speaker, while expected by some industry watchers, marked Apple's first new product announcement since the Apple Watch in September 2014. As a music-playing device, it will also be a challenger to Sonos, whose wifi-controlled speakers are used by many smartphone users for home entertainment. The Cupertino, California-based company said Siri, which also competes with Alphabet Inc's Google Assistant, will now work across devices. A new Siri interface on the Apple Watch will also blend users' calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked, the company said.

Problem Solving | 07 Apr 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (7) Colonel Mustard in the Library with the Shift Key by Adam C. Engst I love a good mystery… as long as it has a solution. The case of the Library’s changing modifier key had me stumped for a while, but thankfully, our buddy Rob Griffiths figured it out. Starting with OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple hid the home folder’s Library folder (~/Library) to prevent users from meddling in it and causing trouble (see “Dealing with Lion’s Hidden Library,” 20 July 2011). We’ll ignore for the moment the question of whether this was a good move. To access that folder, you had to hold down the Option key and choose Go > Library in the Finder. If you were sufficiently irritated by having to do this, as many of us were, there was a Terminal command you could run to reveal the ~/Library folder within Finder windows permanently. (Remember, there are multiple Library folders in macOS; ~/Library is the one in your home folder. Oddly, Apple leaves /Library and /System/Library visible, even though users should never mess around in them.) In OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple pulled back a bit on pretending that we users weren’t capable enough to work in ~/Library, adding a Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window for the home folder. That checkbox appears only when your home folder is displayed in the frontmost Finder window, and if you’re in column view, you might need to select a folder inside the home folder. When that checkbox is selected, ~/Library appears in Finder windows, but Library does not appear in the Go menu unless you hold the Option key down too. In macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple made it so that checkbox adds Library to the Go menu too, and in 10.12.3, also added a keyboard shortcut — Command-Shift-L. However, Sierra is also where things started to get funky. For many people, including me, the old Option key trick stopped working in Sierra. That wasn’t a problem for me because I had permanently revealed my ~/Library folder long ago and seldom used the Finder’s Go menu. But I did notice that Option had stopped showing the Library menu item, and when Kirk McElhearn wrote a blog post about how the key had changed to Shift in one of Sierra’s minor updates, I was pleased to discover that, indeed, the Shift key now worked to show the Library folder in the Finder’s Go menu. I didn’t explore further because Kirk’s solution worked fine for me, and it solved Tonya’s confusion over the loss of the Option key trick as well. Thinking I was sharing a neat little trick, I mentioned it briefly in an email message to Take Control readers. Little did I realize the can of worms I was opening. Several people replied to say that Shift did not work for them, and Option still did. Lauri Reinhardt, who does support for Take Control, tested before passing those messages on to me. She found that, while the Shift key worked initially, after she toggled the Show Library Folder checkbox in the View Options window, Shift stopped adding Library to the Go menu, and Option started working again. Nothing she could do would make the Shift key work anymore. I confirmed that Shift still worked on both my iMac and my MacBook Air, toggled the checkbox on my iMac, and found exactly what Lauri had. A new test account showed that Option really was still the right key, but why had it been Shift for a while? Madness! I was stumped, so I tracked backward from Kirk’s post to Michael Tsai’s initial Twitter thread and then followed a link to a post by Rob Griffiths that explained the situation. Rob’s discovery was that relaunching the Finder (Control-Option-click its Dock icon and choose Relaunch) puts the Finder in a weird state where the Shift key takes over from the Option key. I was able to reproduce that as well. Doubly weird — this state persists across restarts! It’s a bug, and Rob reported it, so we hope Apple will fix it in a future macOS update. My suspicion is that this weird Finder state, which may date back to the Sierra betas, can be triggered in ways other than relaunching the Finder. Quitting or force-quitting the Finder from within Activity Monitor doesn’t seem to do it, but I can imagine other scenarios that might leave the Finder in an unusual state — a kernel panic, for instance, or a loss of power to the Mac. Over years of usage, it’s easy to see something like this happening to many people. Regardless, the practical upshot of this minor mystery is as follows: Sierra Power Users: If you’re running Sierra and you want ~/Library to be visible in Finder windows and in the Go menu, select your home folder, choose View > Show View Options, and select Show Library Folder. Regular Sierra Users: If you don’t mind getting to ~/Library via the Go menu in Sierra, open the Go menu and press the Option key to reveal the Library menu item. If the Option key doesn’t work, use the instructions in the previous bullet to show and then hide the Library, after which Option should work. OS X Users: Those using 10.7 Lion through 10.11 El Capitan should either use Option with the Finder’s Go menu or enter this Terminal command to make ~/Library show up in Finder windows permanently. chflags nohidden ~/Library/ Finally, why might you want to work in ~/Library? Lots of reasons, but in 2012, Ted Landau wrote an article for Mac Observer about the top six reasons to visit the Library folder. It’s old but remains essentially correct. Still, as Ted says, don’t mess around with files in ~/Library if you don’t know what you’re doing — you can cause real problems. Always make sure you have a backup first!   READERS LIKE YOU!

Adam Engst   2017-04-11 09:46 Strange. Nothing wrong with it that I can see. steve12  2017-04-10 21:22 Don't forget about Command-Shift-Period. That's the finder's one size fits all show/hide hidden files toggle. For me it's easiest to keep the hidden out of site until I need something, then reveal them all do my thing, then hide them again. Lester  2017-06-03 11:36 As far as I know, Command-Shift-Period works only for "Open" and "Save" dialog boxes, doesn't it? Years ago I found a script you can save as a Service to have this shortcut working in all Finder's windows. Adam Engst   2017-06-05 12:09 No, it works in the Finder too. Give it a try! Lester  2017-06-06 12:37 Of course I did before posting. I'm on 10.11.6 and it doesn't work at all (and it never did with previous System versions back to Snow Leopard). Furthermore, all Google matches confirm it does work only in Open or Save dialog boxes. As I wrote, I use an Automator script to do the trick in Finder's regular windows. I trashed it, relaunched the Finder etc. but Command-Shift-Period doesn't work without the script. I wonder how you make it... Adam Engst   2017-06-06 18:37 The fact that it works in the Finder must be a new feature in 10.12 Sierra then.  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

Now if you were looking for some official iPad Pro accessories, Apple appears to be more than pleased to oblige. The company has since officially announced new leather sleeve accessories for the iPad Pros. Unlike the previous iPad Pro offerings, these are sleeves for your tablet, so if you’re more of a sleeve kind of user and prefer this style of protection, then this could be for you. They will be available in Saddle Brown, Taupe, Midnight Blue, and Black color options. It also comes with a slot in which users can keep their Apple Pencil to prevent it from getting lost. However if you prefer a standalone accessory, in addition to the leather sleeves for the tablet, it also appears that Apple finally has an answer to how users can keep their Apple Pencil and this comes in the form of the Apple Pencil Case. The leather sleeve for the iPad Pro is priced at $129 while the Apple Pencil Case will retail for $29 and is expected to begin shipping out in the next 1-2 weeks. Filed in Apple >Tablets.

The company has been pushing for 64-bit apps for a while now, but with iOS 11, it seems that Apple will be making their biggest push because it looks like the update will be leaving behind some older iOS devices. For the most part Apple has been pretty good about updating its older devices to the latest version of iOS. However with the announcement of iOS 11 and the shift towards the 64-bit architecture, it means that devices like the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and the 4th gen iPad will be left in the dust and will not be getting the update. Like we said, this shouldn’t really come as a surprise since this is the direction that Apple has been headed towards for a while now, so for those who are still hanging onto their older iOS devices, perhaps it’s time for you guys to make the upgrade, or at least make peace with the fact that you won’t be seeing iOS 11. That being said, these older iOS devices will continue to function just fine with iOS 10.3.2 or whatever the last version of iOS 10 will be, but don’t expect to use the latest features of iOS.

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 6:18 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Michelle Obama tells Apple developers: You're missing out on my money unless you include more women    Wednesday, 7 Jun 2017 | 8:43 AM ET | 00:44 Michelle Obama was asked on Tuesday to "preach" about the role of women and tech — and she delivered. Obama spoke to coders and entrepreneurs at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, in a conversation with Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives. The former first lady, accomplished lawyer and humanitarian touched on the business implications of excluding women — who are often heads of household spending — from decision-making. Mark Wilson | Getty Images Michelle Obama, then first lady "Who are you marketing to? Who do you think is going to use these apps? If women aren't at the table, you're going to miss my dollar. Because you don't really know me," Obama said, according to clips of the talk posted on social media. Thirty-two percent of Apple's employees worldwide are women, while 22 percent of employees are underrepresented minorities, according to Apple's website. The industry as a whole also struggles with hiring underrepresented groups: In a StackOverflow survey of 64,000 developers this year, 88.6 percent were male and 74.5 percent were white. It's something that Apple is trying to address. The company donates to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, National Center for Women & Information Technology and the National Society of Black Engineers, according to its latest shareholder proxy statement. show chapters 'Apple's really good at firing up the hype machine'    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 9:28 PM ET | 02:15 Obama said that looking at hiring workers in their 20s and 30s is too late. An advocate for women's education, Obama argued that changes must be made to the educational system, especially by college-age people who can be role models for the "next generation." "That's when I look to the fellas around the room and say, 'Are you ready? Are you ready to share your spot at the table?' Then make room," Obama said. She said her husband, former President Barack Obama, took the duty of role-modeling very seriously when managing his staff. "Barack, he knew more, he worked harder; if there was something that had to be done, he was going to do it faster, stronger," Michelle said. "He was always modeling for his team. .... We always had trouble with people who managed up. They were good in front of us, but you hear about how they treated interns or their own staff. When we felt that energy, we eliminated it." Michelle Obama said that building a trustworthy, diverse staff is not only important for politicians — it's also key for entrepreneurs. "If somebody is up here pretending they got here on their own, they're lying," she said. "Make sure that communication is open for the people on your team. You have to surround yourself with people who reflect your values. You have to be really true to them and honest with yourself on whether we're living those values. You have to be that person even when no one's looking."

Digital Trends Home > Home Theater > ‘Me too!’ With the HomePod… ‘Me too!’ With the HomePod, Apple’s legacy of audio innovation is dead By Ryan Waniata — Updated June 6, 2017 8:46 pm Subscribe Share Apple Monday at Apple’s WWDC 2017 there were plenty of new updates, upgrades, and even some shiny new toys for Cupertino nerds worldwide to ogle during CEO Tim Cook’s exhaustively long presentation. But the big-ticket item, Apple’s highly anticipated new smart speaker, was saved for last. Dubbed the HomePod (not the Apple Speaker) Apple’s new device boasts voice-activated smarts, Wi-Fi integration, and Homekit functionality to manage everything from your drapes to your door lock. Apple’s tagline for the HomePod is that it offers “The chance to reinvent the way we enjoy music in the home,” but there’s an obvious problem with that claim: The way we enjoy music in the home has already been reinvented, and it wasn’t by Apple. Apple’s audio products feel like cash grabs, not innovations. The HomePod is a direct descendant of Amazon’s popular Echo smart speaker, and the Google Home. Its rounded design and omnidirectional driver configuration also borrow from hordes of other wireless speakers, from Sonos to Samsung. Even its “spatially aware” feature has been around in wireless speakers for years. The HomePod is not an innovation. It’s a reluctant realization by Apple that, “yes, there’s a market for that,” and “yes, we should probably get in on it.” It’s the latest in a long line of signals that the maker of the iPod has other priorities now. It’s safe to say, Apple is no longer a music innovator. The road to conformity Like the HomePod, many of Apple’s latest audio products have been copycats. That’s not to say we don’t enjoy Apple’s contributions to the world of audio — it offers competitive, sleekly styled products, many of which garner positive reviews. But they feel like cash grabs, not innovations. Apple is more concerned with keeping up than standing out. Apple’s most obvious copycat in recent years is its streaming service, Apple Music. Instead of building its own service, Apple reluctantly jumped into streaming after the writing was on the wall (and iTunes sales were plummeting). The service was a salvage job, mashing iTunes into Beats Music via Apple’s $3 billion Beats Electronics acquisition. It stands as a basic clone of Spotify, Deezer, and other on-demand services, right down to its price points, music resolution, and algorithm based music discovery tools. The bravest thing Apple did with Apple Music was to hire DJ Zane Lowe to run Beats 1, a 24-hour live radio service. Other than that, the only reason to use Apple Music instead of Spotify is a familiar one: You really like Apple. If you thought Apple’s new AirPods were a revelation, we’re sorry to tell you that Apple was at least a year late to that party, too. Sure, the AirPods have a few intriguing features like the ability to automatically stream to one bud at a time, and they hold a connection better than a lot of the early competitors. But that’s no longer the case. From Bragi’s The Headphone to Jabra’s Elite Sport, there are plenty of better sounding alternatives to Apple’s AirPod available. In fact, the best thing the AirPods have going for them is, at $160, they still have a relatively low price point for their class — if you don’t mind the golf-tee look. Of course we’ve seen this kind of cloning from multiple other companies — electronics companies (rightly) tend to jump on the trends. But this is Apple we’re talking about. It’s supposed to lead the way, not follow. Mediocre components It’s not just a lack of new product ideas that have hobbled Apple’s place in the audio world. Some of it is plain old cheaping out. In the years since Jobs and Co. created the iPod and the iPhone, Apple has seemed content to rest on its laurels as opposed to competing with other portable audio devices. Meanwhile, many of its competitors have forged ahead. LG’s V20, the HTC 10, Sony’s Xperia phones, and many other phones pack impressive internal components like high-resolution digital-to-analog converters and quality headphone amplifiers for a premium sonic experience. The V20, for instance, packs a 75-stage analog volume control, as well as a Sabre ES9218 DAC from renowned premium chipmaker ESS Technology, whose chipsets also sit in premium audio devices like Astell & Kern’s astonishing portable players and Yamaha’s top-tier Aventage receivers. Xperia and HTC devices are also aimed at high-resolution playback. Sony relies on powerful components and software like the company’s Clear Audio+ technology, while the HTC 10 even boasts a built-in woofer and tweeter. Apple has yet to partner with any high-end chipmakers like ESS (that we know of, anyway). Instead of working on sound performance, the company appears more interested in pushing thinner phones and proprietary technology like its Lightning digital connection. Which leads to my final point. Pulling the plug(s) Apple’s choice to dispense with the headphone jack may be the best argument that it still innovates — but in this case, it’s the kind of innovation many audio fans would just as soon go without. While it’s true that Lightning headphones can, in theory, offer a higher quality signal via 24-bit digital connection, there was simply no good reason to pull the jack at this point when it comes to sound quality and user convenience. It’s easy to forget this is the house that Steve Jobs built. Though the move has forced some third-party companies to push ahead with Lightning connections and personal DACs that outperform Apple’s included adapter, it has been a net negative for premium audio fans and audiophiles. Apple’s internal amplifier has never been accused of offering high-end sound, but with the jack gone, things are worse. Audiophiles are now forced to make some serious concessions (and/or investments) to stick with Apple. Do we dump our best cans for a new, high-quality pair equipped with a Lightning connection, such as Audeze’s Sine or EL-8 Titanium? Do we look for a third-party Lightning DAC or wireless Bluetooth receiver to plug in our legacy cans? Or do we simply hold onto our iPhone 6 and 6S models, in the vain hope that Apple may reconsider its fervent quest for ever thinner devices? So far, we’ve chosen the latter. Apple It’s not just the iPhone, either. Home studio veterans and basic audio fans alike have watched as Apple has continued to remove peripherals, one port at a time, from its once-mighty MacBook. First it was the Firewire connection (both 400 and 800), which is still a mainstay in many legacy digital interfaces. Then went the HDMI. Then USB. At present, there’s nothing left on a MacBook to plug into save a few proprietary Thunderbolt ports and, thankfully, a headphone jack. How long before that gets the boot? The road ahead By now you may be saying, “So what? Why does it matter if Apple is pushing the envelope?” And we get that. After all, this is the multi-billion dollar company that shoehorned a U2 album into 100 million iPhones – not exactly the actions of a trendsetter. These days, it can be easy to forget this is the house that Steve Jobs built. The company that created the iPod and iTunes, whose very name is the same as the Beatles’ recording label, and whose desktop computers started a home-studio revolution back in the age of the floppy disk. We still love our current Apple products, and though the HomePod’s $350 price point seems shockingly high, if the speaker does what Apple claims and “rocks the house” with zero distortion — and tacks on great functionality — we’ll gleefully give it a great score. But make no mistake; Apple no longer puts music and sound innovation first. It is a follower. Let’s hope the company will break its streak soon and give music lovers something truly inspirational — iPhone 8, we’re looking at you, kid.

Instead of treating Surface as a side project, Microsoft went all-in, debuting three Surface Pro updates and multiple new models, like the Surface Book, Surface Laptop, and the Surface Studio. Frankly, the Studio is a system that’s of no consequence to most PC owners. While the Surface Pro and Book move 2-in-1 design forward in a way that’s applicable to everyone, and the Laptop provides a unique take on education devices, the Studio’s intent is focused. It’s not even for professionals, as a group, but is instead for creative professionals – artists, designers, animators, photographer, video editors, and so on. That makes the Studio a niche. It’s not for everyone – if the design didn’t tell you that, the base price of $3,000, and as-tested price of $4,200, should make that clear. But let’s be honest: You’ll end up wanting it anyway. Would you look at that? Apple has enjoyed a stranglehold on high-end, all-in-one desktop design for years, maybe decades. Until now. The Surface Studio shrieks premium from the moment it’s taken out of the box, in a way even the Surface Pro and Book have never achieved. The display, and its hinge, have a lot to do with this. Aside from its technical excellence, which we’ll address later, the massive 28-inch PixelSense touchscreen cuts an impressive profile. The 3:2 form factor means it’s closer to a square than most large displays, and strikes a nostalgic cord. This is how computer displays used to look before they all decided to emulate HDTVs, a move that not everyone thinks was beneficial. The screen also has slim bezels, and a very thin profile, both of which make the Studio look thoroughly modern. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Behind the screen is Microsoft’s geeky “zero-gravity” hinge, a feature that the company seemed proud of at the unveiling keynote. While a hinge may not seem exciting, it’s rather important here, because the Studio’s touchscreen is meant to be used at a variety of angles. It might be left upright for typical desktop use, set at an angle for standing use, or leaned at a steep tilt for use as a virtual drafting table. Design: Art Director’s take The Studio screen tilts but doesn’t come close to lying flat. At first, that felt odd. But our Art Director told us it’s for the best, saying “the degree of tilt works, because you can’t really work with a flat table.” He also praised the hinge, saying it stayed in place while he used it, and felt as natural as a drafting table. The hinge makes this possible by allowing movement with just one finger while also providing enough resistance to keep the screen in place when a user is writing. And it does exactly that. The entire screen can be moved from its steepest incline to bolt-straight with a fingertip, and back again. Yet it’s also stiff enough to keep in place while touching, or even drawing on, the screen. Move below the hinge, to the computer itself, and…there’s not much to say. Everything inhabits a small, elegant, non-descript base that’s about 10 inches wide, 9 inches deep, and a bit more than an inch tall. It’s subtle. Which is perhaps for the best, as it keeps attention focused on the Studio’s sweet, sweet pixels. Plenty of USB, and an SDcard too Though the base is small, it has room for four USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet jack, a Mini-DisplayPort connection, a headphone jack, and a full-sized SDcard reader. The lack of USB Type-C support feels a bit old-fashioned, as it does on the recently updated Surface Book with Performance Base, but it’s good to see a card reader and plenty of USB ports available. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Wireless connectivity is the usual combination of 802.11ac with Bluetooth 4.0, but there is a bonus. The Studio has Xbox Wireless built in. While the Studio is not designed to be a gaming system, this will help if you want to sit back with an Xbox One controller and play a game, or connect to your Xbox One console. The best display we’ve seen yet The Studio comes with a unique 28-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 4,500 × 3,000. That works out to about 13.5 million pixels, which isn’t as many as Apple’s iMac with Retina, but quite a bit more than a 4K display, which has 8.2 million pixels. The Studio packs 193 pixels into every inch, while the Apple iMac with Retina crams in 220 pixels per inch. Display: Art Director’s take Our Art Director was in love with the display, saying he found it “incredibly clear, the best Windows display I’ve seen.” The high pixel density, combined with excellent color accuracy, makes the Studio eligible for color-critical work right out of the box. Frankly, it’s hard to see a difference in clarity. Fine text and detailed images can look aliased on close inspection, while they’ll look perfectly smooth on the Retina display. But you must be searching with a skeptical eye to notice. There’s more to a display than pixel density, of course. And that’s where the Studio shines. Our testing recorded a maximum contrast ratio of 1,010:1, which is excellent for a monitor. Dell’s Ultrasharp P2715K monitor, with 5,120 × 2,880 resolution, had a contrast ratio of 620:1.  Samsung’s U32D970Q, a favorite of ours, had a contrast ratio of just 460:1. Even Dell’s new 8K monitor, the UP3218K, has a contrast ratio of just 650:1. Microsoft hasn’t pulled any tricks to accomplish this. The display’s maximum brightness of 464 lux is higher than average, but its black levels are deep and inky, which gives images a realistic sense of depth. Color is great, too. The Studio hit 100 percent of sRGB, and 91 percent of AdobeRGB, while delivering a default color accuracy reading of 0.97. An error of less than 1 is generally unnoticeable to the human eye, so that’s impressive, even if it doesn’t quite beat the most accurate monitors we’ve tested, such as Samsung’s U32D970Q, HP’s DreamColor Z32x, and Dell’s UP3218K. The accuracy is backed up by a gamma reading of 2.2, which is dead-on ideal. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends And the Studio has a trick most monitors don’t. Users can switch between the sRGB and DCI-P3 color space with the tap of a button in the Windows 10 Action Center. We’d like to see even more color space options, but as it stands, it should prove a useful feature for Studio’s target audience. On balance, when all the pros and cons are tallied, the Studio has the best computer display we’ve ever seen. Its contrast is the best you’ll find without an OLED display, something that’s only available on laptops for now, and color performance is excellent. Everything adds up to an outstanding experience. Drawing on the Studio looks natural and lifelike, with bold yet realistic colors. And while this PC isn’t designed for movies or gaming, its provides amazing detail to both. Civilization VI looked like a painting come alive. The speakers are there, just Speakers are bundled into the Surface Studio. And as you might expect, they’re not great. They do the job you’d and can be quite loud at maximum volume. Yet a muddy quality predominates, and becomes worse as volume comes closer to maximum. Also, like every all-in-one sound system we’ve ever heard, stereo staging is a problem. There’s just not enough space between the speakers to generate convincing stereo sound. Users who aren’t too discerning will be fine with what’s bundled here. Anyone who cares about audio quality will want headphones or external speakers. The Studio’s quad-core is a mobile chip, but still pretty quick The base Surface Studio comes with an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM. Our review unit, the most powerful model, arrived with a Core i7-6820HQ processor and 16GB of RAM. The processor model might cause geeks to raise an eyebrow, since it’s from Intel’s mobile lineup, rather than its desktop stable. In our graph, we pit the Studio against a broad selection of possible alternatives ranging from the Surface Book, which might be used as a highly portable workstation, to Origin’s ridiculous Millennium with 10-core Intel processor, which is the bleeding edge of modern hardware. Performance: Art Director’s take Day-to-day use seems to be the Studio’s forte. Our Art Director loved how it felt, saying “In Photoshop and Illustrator, it’s great. I like it better than systems I’ve used in the past.” He did note a weak spot in graphics power, though, saying “it’s in a weird spot in GPU performance, because it doesn’t quite fulfill high-end needs, but is also faster than what most users need.” As you can see in the results, the Surface Studio came in at the lesser end of this spectrum. In Handbrake, for instance, it cranked through encoding a four minute, 20-second long 4K trailer in just over nine minutes. That’s not bad, and way quicker than the Surface Book. But it’s also a few minutes longer than the AVADirect Avant, a system we tested with a Core i7-6700K processor. What about Apple’s iMac with Retina? We did not review the 2015 refresh, but Geekbench 3 scores of that model are widely available. The base model, which has a Core i5-6500 processor, can reach a single-core score of around 4,000, and a multi-core score about 12,000. These numbers suggest that even the base level iMac with Retina can keep pace with our tricked-out Studio review unit. Apple has a slight edge. What should you make of this? Well, it depends on what you plan to do with your system. The Studio’s performance will prove adequate for any photo editing, digital art, or document work, but it might feel lackluster if you’re doing a lot of video editing. This all-in-one is built for work, but it’s not a top-tier workstation. A cutting-edge device with last year’s hard drive Our performance critique continues – and becomes more severe – with the hard drive. All Surface Studio models come with a hybrid drive which combines a mechanical disk (2TB, in our review unit) with a solid-state cache. The cache dynamically decides which data to store based on how the system is used. In theory, that makes the system as responsive as an SSD, without sacrificing storage capacity. Ouch. As you can see, the hybrid drive just can’t keep up with solid state drives. The Origin Millennium was ten times quicker in read speeds. Even the Avant, which had a humble (by modern standards) SATA-connected SSD, was several times quicker than the Surface Studio. We can see this being an area of definite concern for certain users, as the drive’s modest performance could put a crimp on certain workloads. Video editing again seems a prime suspect, as 4K editing can task a drive’s write speeds. To its credit, the hybrid drive usually did its job. Most apps loaded so quickly that passersby thought the Studio in fact had an SSD, and a fast one, at that. But our design team saw the bad side of it, and noted that some applications, like Adobe Premiere and After Effects, took a long time to load. That could become an annoyance if your work requires frequent use of numerous programs. The elder GTX 980M performs While the base Surface Studio comes with Nvidia GTX 965M graphics, our review unit had the upgrade to GTX 980M graphics. We panned the Studio at its reveal for the use of GTX 980M graphics, which are a generation behind the GTX 1080. For reference, the AVA Direct Avant in the graph above had a GTX 980 Ti desktop video card. The Surface Book Performance Base, on the other hand, was equipped with the same GTX 965M found in the base model Studio. Gamers will scoff at the Studio’s 3DMark score of 7,985, which is barely better than the new GTX 1050 Ti, a $140 add-in graphics card any desktop can fit. On the other hand, there are few comparable all-in-ones, with the exclusion of a few gaming-oriented systems like the Origin Omni. And Digital Storm Aura. The next-quickest competitor is Apple’s iMac with Retina, but the Radeon chip it uses is quite old, and in past tests its Fire Strike score hovered around 6,100. The GTX 980M, elder though it may be, is impressive hardware in this category. Dialing it in Desktops rarely ship with interesting peripherals, but the Studio is obviously an exception. It made waves not only because of its huge, beautiful touchscreen but also because of the Dial, which promises a new form of tactile input that works alongside touch or Pen input. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The Dial looks and feels like you’d expect. Its closest analog is the knob on old stereos, or most modern receivers. It’s chunky and, thanks to haptic feedback, can provide a degree of discrete “click-click-click” feel as you rotate it or tap it. While it can be used anywhere within Bluetooth range of the Studio, its standout feature is how it work when placed physically on the screen. A radial menu appears around the dial, providing access to custom functions. In a paint app, for example, it can offer an easy way to shift through a color palette. With an audio or video editor, it can be used to warp back and forth on the editing timeline. Dial: Art Director’s take Our Art Director didn’t share Microsoft’s enthusiasm about the dial. He said “it’s cool, but seems kind of like a novelty,” because of minimal app support. The Dial also, at times, became a distraction. “In a way, the dial feels like it takes you away from the screen,” concluding that he’d “probably set it to the side, most of the time.” You might be thinking – doesn’t a scroll wheel already do this? Yes, to a degree. But the Dial is designed to work with the Pen. A designer sketching out a new project won’t have easy access to the mouse, or the scroll wheel, but the Dial can be placed in reach. And it offers customization. Developers can adapt their program to it, making useful tools accessible. Or, if the Dial is used in Windows or outside a supported app, it summons a variety of options ranging from volume, to screen brightness, to apps. These functions can be changed however you desire in Dial’s settings. The Dial sounds great on paper, and is fun to use at first. Yet we quickly discarded it. App support is limited, and there’s no point to it unless you plan to use a supported app frequently. Add-in the $100 price tag, and the Dial starts to look like an innovative but unnecessary doohicky. What else is in the box? While the Dial is an add-on, the Studio does come with a keyboard, mouse, and Surface Pen. Then Pen is the same as found with the Surface Pro and Book. We’re familiar with it, and have come to like its design. Some DT staffers find it a bit too chunky, but most have no complaint, or have more severe complaints about other stylus options. It feels responsive when paired with the Studio, and it attaches magnetically to the flanks of the screen when it’s not being used. The keyboard and mouse, while basic, do the job asked of them. Most people should find them comfortable to use. You’ll find few options on either of them, so you will need to pick up a third-party peripheral if, say, you need five buttons on your mouse. But the Studio isn’t really about mouse use, and we think most users will find the bundled option is adequate.

While this is normal for computers, the high price of the Studio underscores how inadequate this typical warranty can feel when purchasing an expensive system. And it should be noted that some potential alternatives – such as an enterprise desktop from Dell, HP, or Lenovo, paired with a Wacom or other brand of large touchscreen device – can lead to better warranty terms. Our take Falling in love with the Studio is easy, and it happens at first glance. The beautiful display, elegant design, and featherweight hinge make for instant appeal. But the Studio isn’t for everyone. It’s a specific type of PC, for specific users. Careful consideration is warranted before you lay down a few grand. Is there a better alternative? From a distance, the Surface Studio has many competitors. Most PC all-in-ones could be an alternative, and Apple’s iMac is an obvious point of comparison. Yet most of these more traditional systems aren’t a real alternative. Many, like the iMac, lack a touchscreen. Almost all lack stylus support. Dell’s Canvas, teased at CES, is perhaps the Studio’s closest peer — but it’s not out yet. The rumormill suggests it will arrive this summer, but until then, the Studio remains unique. Traditional all-in-ones are only half the competition, however. Another choice is a computer connected to a large Wacom or Yiynova device. A high-quality, 27-inch Wacom Cinteq with touch and stylus support will set you back at least $2,000 on its own, and that’s if you get a deal. Suddenly, the Studio doesn’t look so expensive. The DT Accessory Pack Logitech MX Master Wireless Mouse $65.25 WD 1TB Black My Passport Portable Hard Drive $59.99 Datacolor Spyder5ELITE $199 How long will it last? Hardware is one of the Studio’s pain points. The timing of its release forced Microsoft to use Intel Core processors that will soon be outdated, and the company also went with last-gen Nvidia hardware and a hybrid disk drive. These slightly outdated components may limit the Studio’s appeal over the years. The hard drive will seem positively ancient in five years, and the graphics solution may quickly fall behind. At least the screen is unlikely to get old. It’s way ahead of the curve in pixel count, color, and contrast. It won’t look outdated until OLED monitors are widespread, and that advancement has continued to sweep the PC world at a glacial pace. Should you buy it? Only if you’ll use it to its potential. It’s tempting to see the Surface Studio as a fancy all-in-one, and to use that as justification to buy it. You could, and I’m sure you’d be happy. But this PC has a laser-like focus on creative professionals, and their needs. If your work or passion falls outside that realm, you’ll be better served elsewhere, and probably for less. For its target audience, though, the Studio is a revolution. No major PC manufacturer has ever focused on the needs of creative professionals with the dedication Microsoft displays with the Studio. Until now, these users have made do with expensive add-on displays that, while certainly effective, lack any sense of elegance. Everyone who tries the Studio is going to love it. But only artists, photographers, and designers need it.

Our favorite transforming homes Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: After much anticipation, Apple unveiled its newest additions to the iMac lineup during its 2017 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), giving us a closer look at the company’s high-end iMac Pro and the newly-revamped iMac. How does the new iMac differ from the previous generation when it comes to hardware, software, and other extraneous features. Let’s take a look at the latest hardware upgrades. Hardware 21.5-inch 27-inch Dimensions 17.7 inches X 20.8 inches X 6.9 inches 20.3 inches X 25.6 inches X 8 inches Processor 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz)Configurable to 3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz) 3.8GHz quad‑core Intel Core i5 (Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz) Configurable to 4.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 (Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz) RAM Configurable up to 16GB or 32GB  Configurable up to 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB Display 1080p or Retina 4K display Retina 5K display Resolution Up to 4,096 X 2,304  Up to 5,120 X 2,880 Storage  1TB Fusion Drive (Configurable to 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB SSD) 2TB Fusion Drive (Configurable to 3TB Fusion Drive or 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB SSD) Graphics Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB of VRAM Radeon Pro 580 with 8GB of VRAM Wireless  Wi-Fi: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networkingIEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology  Wi-Fi: 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless networking IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible Bluetooth: Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology Operating System  MacOS High Sierra  MacOS High Sierra Price  $1,099 – $1,499+  $1,799 – $2,299+ The iMac lineup had been languishing for almost two years, and its discrete GPU options were definitely starting to show their age. Given Apple opted to include mobile-grade graphics chips in the last iteration of the iMac, they didn’t exactly stand the test of time. Thankfully, this has changed with the latest generation of the all-in-one machine. At the WWDC 2017 reveal, Apple chose to focus on GPU hardware updates, and a modest albeit welcome CPU upgrade. The 21.5-inch iMac now comes standard with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 GPU with 64MB graphics cache. The 4K 21.5-inch iMac boasts the new AMD Radeon Pro 555 and 560 options with up to 4GB VRAM. The high-end 5K 27-inch iMac has added AMD Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 options with up to 8GB VRAM. The 21.5-inch model has up to Up to 32GB RAM, and the 27-inch model will have up to 64GB. The Radeon RX 580 is AMD’s best graphics card for the mainstream market. The card is in essence a tweaked version of AMD’s 2016 Polaris chip. With a base speed of 1,257MHz and a boost speed of 1,340MHz, this card is an economical way of supporting high-end VR headsets on the iMac. However, after the SIGGRAPH convention in July, the RX580 will no longer be the fastest AMD graphics card available, as AMD is set to unveil its new Radeon RX Vega cards. In addition to nimble new GPUs, Apple has now finally implemented Intel’s 7th-gen Core processors across the board. The iMac update features up to a 4.2 GHz clock speed, up to 4.5 GHz with Turbo Boost. It will also latest support twice the memory of its predecessor. Apple’s Fusion Drive will also now come standard on all 27-inch configurations, as well as the 21.5-inch iMac. Finally, the new iMac will come with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, meaning the latest iteration will support both an external display and drive enclosure. VR One of the highlights from the WWDC unveiling, was the news that the latest iMac line will support virtual reality systems. This was handled in true Apple keynote fashion, complete with a casual real-time movie scene composition in the Star Wars universe featuring a Darth Vader vignette. Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, announced a Thunderbolt 3-based external graphics card enclosure supported by the latest macOS update High Sierra. With the latest moves and upgrades, the full line of all-in-ones will finally support virtual reality through the HTC Vive. Oculus Rift support is not available yet. Apple also announced an update to Metal, Apple’s advanced graphics technology. This optimized version, Metal 2, will work alongside latest macOS upgrade and utilize machine learning, as well as Apple’s language comprehension and facial recognition tools to improve overall performance, and aid developers in pushing existing hardware to its limits. Apple stated that High Sierra will receive software packages geared toward encouraging VR development on MacOS. A preview of High Sierra was released to developers at WWDC 2017, and the public beta version is planned for June. The free update will be launched later this fall. Display The latest iMac will feature the most vivid iMac display to date. Apple has greatly improved both the brightness of both its 4K and 5K displays. This overhaul has improved color support with 10-bit dithering, and increased color gamut support, allowing the iMac to display up to one billion colors. These upgrades make the latest display 42 percent brighter than the previous iMac. This enhanced display, alongside the GPU upgrades, will give users the most “true-to-life” viewing experience on the iMac to date. MacOS High Sierra At Apple’s annual developer conference, the company also announced general additions and upgrades to latest macOS, High Sierra. Check out our full overview of the new operating system for all the details. iMac Pro One of the juicier moments from the iMac segment was the surprising iMac Pro announcement.  This model will be available with a vibrant Retina 5K display combined with a stabdard 8-Core processor, upgrade to a 18-Core Intel Xeon processor. It will also support latest AMD Vega graphics hardware, 10-gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and up to 128GB of memory, making the unit the most powerful and capable Apple desktop to date. The company even drew up a fancy graphic just for the occasion, to depict the new thermal design and dual centrifugal fan system aimed at keeping all of this added power in check. The general exterior design isn’t too dissimilar from the previous generation, but the iMac Pro will come in Space Gray. The iMac Pro is slatted to go on sale in December. The announcement handled the iMac Pro with rather broad brush strokes, but we expect to find out more about the device in the coming months. Availability and pricing For the entry-level 21.5-inch iMac, pricing starts at $1,099, $1,239 for the 4K 21.5-inch iMac, and $1,799 for the 5K 27.5-inch iMac. At WWDC 2017, Apple announced that the iMacs will be available starting June 5. The entry-level iMac Pro will start at $4,999, and will be available starting in December. Registered Apple Developer Program members can purchase the External Graphics Developer Kit for $599. This kit includes a Thunderbolt 3 external PCI expansion chassis, AMD Radeon RX 580 graphics card with 8GB VRAM, and USB-C hub.

That said, it's a minor change. The notebook now starts with a 1.8 GHz processor. It had started with a 1.6 GHz processor. That means it should be a little bit faster than it was before. But that's it. You wouldn't be able to discern this from Apple's site, but the processor is still from Intel's fifth generation, known as Broadwell. We're currently on the seventh generation, Kaby Lake. Kaby Lake isn't a massive jump from the generation of Intel chips that came between (Skylake), but it is faster, stronger, and more efficient with battery life than what the MacBook Air is using. This is why Apple updated its MacBook and MacBook Pro lines this week to include the new chips this week. View photos Screen Shot 2017 06 06 at 2.42.16 PMMore (Don't let the low price fool you.Apple) More importantly, it's in better shape to last going into the future. Buying a laptop is a multiyear investment. The MacBook Air may run perfectly fine for most to start, but it's not going to be as capable over time. And it doesn't help that you can't upgrade it after purchasing, a restriction Apple puts on every Mac laptop. It's understandable that the MacBook Air looks appealing. It's the MacBook Air! It has always been good. Macs are known for quality, and the Air is the only model that starts below $1,000. But it's not a good value. Everything beyond the processor bump is the same as before. To run through the high-level reasons that that's mostly a bad thing: The display is rough. It has a resolution of 1440 x 900, for one, meaning it's not sharp enough to watch videos in full HD (1080p), and it doesn't give you as much room to have multiple windows onscreen. There are laptops half the price that pack more pixels. That display is also a TN panel. It's a good TN panel, but TN as a technology is neither as colorful nor as easy to see at an angle as the best displays that use the alternative IPS tech. It is terrible compared with what you'd find on a MacBook and MacBook Pro, both of which use IPS and are richer-looking for it. There are no USB-C ports. It's a bit of a mess now, but USB-C is faster and more widely applicable across device types than traditional USB. More importantly, it's where the majority of smartphones, laptops, and other non-Apple consumer devices are headed. That the Air has older legacy ports is great at a time where dongles are more and more prevalent, but the ideal laptop has connectors for both the present and the future.  The design is dated. Nobody will say the MacBook Air is a burden, but the best laptops in this price range are now slimmer and lighter, making the "Air" name something of a misnomer. Devices like the Dell XPS 13 also have far smaller bezels around their displays, letting you see more at once. To be clear, the MacBook Air still does plenty right. It's well-built, its keyboard hits the right point between slim and responsive (even more than Apple's newest laptops), it gets an excellent 10 to 12 hours of battery, and it has the fantastic Apple-made trackpad. If you absolutely need macOS, you could maybe justify buying it. View photos macbook airMore (Flickr/Matthew Pearce) But for the price it takes to get a decent configuration — at least $1,199 to get a respectable 256 GB of storage — you can do better. MacOS isn't like iOS; it's good and it has its devotees, but there isn't that much you can't duplicate with Windows 10. There's nothing on the level of iMessage, which keeps people tethered to their iPhones. If anything, Windows is the stronger platform for things like gaming. Beyond that, it seems clearer than ever that Apple would prefer you to buy something else: It has already killed off the 11-inch MacBook Air. The 12-inch MacBook is slimmer and lighter. The company on Monday cut the starting price of the 13-inch non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro, which is thinner than the Air and nearly as light, down to a more competitive $1,299. Apple also announced further updates to its iPad Pro line and detailed several upgrades to iOS 11 that would make it work a bit more like a Mac. More and more, that's the entry-level "laptop" that Apple wants to position beneath the MacBook and MacBook Pro. If symbolism is worth anything, the MacBook Air update got exactly one sentence at the tail end of Apple's press release announcing its Mac updates this week. It also doesn't have a "new" label at the top of Apple's Mac page, despite the upgrade. All told, even with the slight processor boost, the MacBook Air is still fundamentally a laptop from 2015 with a design from 2010. It was a wonderful general-consumer laptop for a remarkably long time, but it stood still as the years passed. Even if its enduring popularity seems to have persuaded Apple to make some update, the company appears ready to move on. You should, too. If you can't scrounge up the cash to buy a MacBook or MacBook Pro, consider an HP Spectre x360 or Lenovo Yoga 910 instead.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Michael Liedtke and Barbara Ortutay. Updated June 6, 2017 9:57AM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple WWDC HomePod Speakers Alexa Amazon Echo Digital Assistant Google Home Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers -- the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. No Place Like HomePod The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual [WWDC] developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Apple vs. the Dry Spell The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad - all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. Macs, Phones and Payments Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © 2017 Associated Press syndicated under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Offspring Apps How Apple's New Speaker Compares to Sonos and Echo Patrick Lucas AustinTuesday 6:00pm Filed to: Apple HomePod WWDC 2017 WWDC Music Streaming Apple Music 130 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Apple’s HomePod is the company’s latest new gadget, packing a smart assistant, smart home hub, and multi-room audio speaker inside an overpriced, rounded package. At $349, HomePod certainly pummels the smart home speaker market on pricing. Amazon’s Echo costs $180, while Sonos’ Play:1 is $199. Google Home is $129. All of them are spying on you, in one way or another. Better sound, dumber assistant The Homepod isn’t being pushed on consumers as a voice assistant or even a smart home hub. Apple’s banking on this thing sounding damn good, and hoping the rest will fall into place. Among its competition, HomePod seems to have the best audio setup of the bunch. Inside are 7 tweeters and a 4-inch subwoofer, and HomePod supposedly adjusts its audio performance based on its placement in the home. The Echo has never received high marks for its audio quality, with its single tweeter and subwoofer, while Sonos’ lineup is the preferred multi-room setup for coastal liberal elites and company bathrooms everywhere. Apple's New HomePod Looks Fine as Hell It’s game-time! Apple just announced its long-awaited take on a smart speaker, completing the smart …Read more Want to create a multi-room audio setup that honors your Palo Alto overlords? That’ll run you $700. That’s closer to a thousand dollars than it is to zero dollars, so I hope you love listening to tunes. You can achieve the same multi-room audio experience with two Sonos Play:1 speakers, all for under $400. Advertisement Advertisement The company’s self-awareness concerning Siri’s shortcomings is evident based on how they describe it on the HomePod page: “Because it has Siri, HomePod can hear and answer questions in the most popular categories. Timers. Clocks. Measurements. Translations. News. Sports. Weather. Traffic. And general knowledge. It’s great at the things you want to know, and do, in your home.” That description of what Siri can do pales in comparison to the skills Alexa boasts thanks to its Alexa Skills Kit, an API for third-party developers to integrate the assistant into their apps. HomeKit plays catch up to Alexa’s ubiquity HomePod also doubles as a smart home hub, the latest HomeKit-friendly hub besides the Apple TV (and your iOS device). That means you won’t need your phone every time you want to turn on your smart lights and cue some music—just scream into the void “Hey, Siri!” With a six-microphone array, it should hear you. Sponsored Ditching your phone for always-on smart home control is great, but not unheard of. It’s basically what the Echo does best, and Amazon’s head start means it already has a foothold in the home automation market, however nascent it may be. Amazon’s site is full of Alexa-enabled devices, and its compatibility with smart home hubs like Samsung’s SmartThings means Apple’s already playing catch up. It won’t be a huge gap to close, however. Companies like Ecobee and Belkin have added or are adding support for Apple HomeKit through the addition of hubs or software updates. Spotify (or Amazon, or Tidal, or Google Play, or Pandora) fans need not apply Right now HomePod only supports its own music streaming service, Apple Music. Apple’s press release for the HomePod put into question the future of streaming music from your personal library. I reached out to Apple in order to clarify what can and can’t be played on the HomePod, but never heard back. Advertisement I wasn’t expecting Apple to come out of the gate with support for Amazon or Spotify music streaming, but I certainly was hopeful, especially after the company announced, in the same presentation, support for Amazon Video on Apple TV. What I was expecting was something about playing music from your personal library. There’s no way Apple would prevent users from streaming their own tunes to the HomePod, but they did get rid of Magsafe on their MacBooks, so anything is possible. Aside from looking like a concept design for what became a murderous artificial intelligence, the HomePod is pretty cute, if not a little bland. It’s a 7-inch tall round speaker with a microphone array used to listen to your demands. To recap: Apple’s $349 HomePod has a less capable assistant than Amazon, is compatible with fewer music platforms than Sonos, and is more expensive than Google Home. Good thing it comes in two colors! It’s out in December, so who knows what’ll happen between now and launch day? Ready your wallet.

The Do Not Disturb While Driving function is a part of the iOS 11 operating system, revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California yesterday. Users can choose to turn on the feature, which would then automatically withhold alerts and notifications when the phone senses it is in a moving vehicle. "When you finish that first drive we're going to suggest, 'hey how about we activate do not disturb while driving?'," said Apple's senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi during the keynote. "And when we do, instead of seeing all those notifications, we have this new user interface for you." The slideshow behind him showed an iPhone with a black screen. While it is illegal to use a mobile phone while driving in most countries, statistics show an increasing number of motorists admit to using one anyway, exposing them to heightened risk of accidents. The feature may prove popular with drivers who want help blocking out these distractions. In addition to blocking notifications, it gives users the option of sending an auto-reply to contacts listed in their favourites to explain their delayed response. Do Not Disturb While Driving uses either a Bluetooth car connection or the Doppler effect over Wi-Fi to know when the device is in a moving vehicle. Other features of iOS 11 include a new augmented-reality platform, ARKit, for developers to build experiences based on the iPhone camera. Updates to Siri will make the voice assistant more powerful, integrating machine learning to provide more personalised information to users. The big hardware announcement from yesterday's event was the arrival of Apple's smart speaker, Homepod, a rival to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference continues until 9 June 2017.

MacBook 2017 vs MacBook 2016: what’s changed? By Kevin Lee Laptops   Third time is a charm for the best MacBook yet Shares While the new iMacs and iMac Pro might have gotten the lion’s share of attention from WWDC, the new MacBook saw a few important updates. It might look the same between the identical chassis and screen, but Apple has seriously upgraded the storage, added twice the maximum memory capacity and introduced 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel processors with this refresh.  This is also the first 12-inch Retina MacBook to feature an Intel Core i5 processor (in a way). Here's what's new with the MacBook 2017 versus last year's model, and whether it's worth an upgrade. Design If you’ve seen a MacBook in the last two years, the 2017 model will look very familiar to you. This is the third time Apple has reused the ultra-slim MacBook chassis since it was first introduced in 2015, and it honestly hasn’t lost its luster. It might not be the thinnest or lightest laptop in the world since that crown has been taken by so many Ultrabooks, but this is still an incredibly portable package. Just like its predecessor, the 2017 MacBook weighs 2.03 pounds (920g) and measures 0.52 inches (1.31cm) at its thickest point. Display The 12-inch Retina Display also remains exactly the same, not that we’re complaining.  The on-board 2,304 x 1,440-resolution display is much sharper than the Full HD, 1080p panels we typically see even on 13-inch laptops. Hardware Like the rest of the freshly updated Mac lineup, the MacBook 2017 sees the introduction of 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processors.  While the early 2016 version of the MacBook came with Intel Core m3, m5 and m7 processor options, the 2017-edition has different CPU choices: an Intel Core m3 to start succeeded by a Core i5 or Core i7 processor. The latter chips should be a big step up in power. However, Apple notes the processor clock speed starts at 1.2GHz with Core m3, making 100MHz jumps upward in the Core i5 and i7 options.  This likely means that these Core i5 and i7 chips are actually Core i5-Y and i7-Y CPUs that launched with the Kaby Lake generation, meant to succeed the previous Intel Core m parts while maintaining much of the same power profile as before. Apple also claims to have integrated solid-state storage (SSD) that’s twice as fast, though only benchmarks will prove that promise. Lastly, the maximum memory capacity has been doubled from 8GB to 16GB. Price Prices for the 2017 MacBook remain the same as last year, with the starting Intel Core m3 configuration coming in at $1,299 (£1,249, AU$1,899). Compared to the equally-priced base model of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, you’ll get twice the amount of storage with the same memory capacity (albeit, running at a slower frequency) and a lower-power processor.  The higher-end Intel Core i5 configuration starts at $1,599 (£1,549, AU$2,349) and comes with a 512GB SSD, but otherwise shares the same specs as the base model.  Upgrading from there to an Intel Core i7 processor will cost an additional $150, £150 or AU$150 on top of the aforementioned starting price for the Core i5 model. Should you buy one? If you’ve been on the fence about getting a MacBook since 2015, this is the most powerful and fastest iteration yet. While last year’s models only saw a processor refresh bump, the increased memory capacity (and memory speed) and two times faster storage are some hardy upgrades for this ultra-portable laptop.  Although it might not be the lightest or thinnest machine anymore, it’s hard to resist Apple’s pixel-perfect display and impeccable craftsmanship. If you're still rocking the 2015 version, this is as good a time to upgrade as any. And, if you've been on the fence to buy your first MacBook, this is the best time to buy regardless.

In this article we run the rule over the new 10.5-inch model; for more details read New iPad Pro launch: UK release date, price, features, specs. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 Design & build quality This new model of the iPad Pro comes with 10.5-inch screen - something we've not seen before on an iOS device. In effect, this iPad replaces the old 9.7-inch Pro model, and squeezes the larger screen into a chassis of the same size by making the bezels thinner. Colour options The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro gets the Rose Gold (pink) colour option that was previously limited, in iPad land, to the 9.7-inch Pro model. So that's four choices: silver, gold, Rose Gold and Space Grey. Tech specs Let's look next at the internal specs in the new iPad Pro. Processor As expected, the new iPad Pro 10.5 features a modified version of the A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7, called the A10X Fusion. The A10X Fusion chipset has six CPU cores: three high-performance cores and three efficiency cores for improved battery life. It also features a meaty twelve-core GPU. Apple predicts 30 percent faster CPU performance than the A9X chip in the first-generation iPad Pro models, and 40 percent faster graphics performance. Obviously we'll test this out in our labs once we've got hold of a review sample. Display As hinted at in a recent update to Apple's Xcode software, Apple's next-generation iPad Pro feature an upgraded 120Hz display. (For reference, existing models of iPhone and iPad max out at 60Hz.) The higher the refresh rate, the more frames the display can process every second: a 60Hz display can process up to 60 frames per second, while a 120Hz display can offer double the amount at 120 frames per second. It's why some PC gamers opt for a 144Hz display. The new iPad also gets the newer True Tone display that was featured on the 9.7in Pro but was denied to the 12.9 when it launched. The 10.5-inch Pro has a resolution of 2,224 x 1,668, at Apple's iPad-standard 264 pixels per inch. A few more details: the display offers 600 nits brightness, can display HDR video, and dynamically adjusts the refresh rate depending on what you're looking at. This could be key to preserving battery life. Cameras The new iPad Pro comes with a 12Mp rear-facing camera with f1.8 aperture, six-element lens and a quad-LED True Tone flash. The front-facing camera has a rating of 7Mp and the Retina Flash feature where the entire screen lights up to serve as a makeshift flash. This is the same camera setup as the iPhone 7; it's a bit better than the 9.7-inch iPad Pro (12Mp and 5Mp respectively) and a lot better than the old 12.9-inch Pro (8Mp and 1.2Mp, and no flash). Storage capacity Apple has bumped the storage options again. The new iPad Pro models start at 64GB as a baseline, with options to get 256GB or a mighty 512GB. That's the most storage offered with any iOS device to date. Touch ID The new iPad Pro, pleasingly, gets the second-gen version of Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner, rather than the first-gen version seen in previous iPads. This has been a bit of a bugbear for us, since second-gen Touch ID has been around for a while - it first appeared in the iPhone 6s, but was ignored by the iPads that followed it - until now. Second-gen Touch ID is quicker and more reliable than the original version. Read next: How to fix Touch ID Battery life There seems to have been a balance achieved between the more powerful chipsets and more advanced displays, and the new power-saving features: Apple says the new iPad Pro models will offer the same 10-hour battery life as the last generation. Obviously we'll be testing that in our labs just as soon as we can get hold of review samples. Launch date The new iPad Pro was announced at WWDC 2017 on 5 June, and is available to order right now. You can buy the new iPad Pro here. UK price The iPad Pro very much isn't the bargain offering we got earlier this year in the form of the iPad 2017, which starts at a highly tempting £339. We reckon the next iPad will start at around £570 to £600.

The MacBook Air is the laptop you see in coffee shops, libraries, offices, and student digs all over the world. Apple might have forgotten it in favour of the sharper-screened 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro and dinkier 12-inch MacBook, but the masses still love the lightweight, entry-level Air. Apple isn’t calling its most recent MacBook Air update a “new” model, but to distinguish it from its otherwise very similar Early-2015 MacBook Air we’ll call it the Mid-2017 MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro also saw a minor update, getting a processor bump to the Kaby Lake chipset. Read more: New MacBook Pro release. A new model of the 12-inch MacBook was also announced, again getting faster Intel processors. Read more: New MacBook release Apple hasn’t changed the Air much at all since it wowed the laptop world in 2010 with its sharp, wedge-shaped case – which still looks great, in our opinion. There were some minor processor and port changes in 2015, but since then the only real updates have been upticks on the processor speed and a welcome doubling of the default memory (from 4GB to 8GB). It’s still available in just the one silvery colour, unlike the 12-inch MacBook (Silver, Space Grey, Gold, or Rose Gold) or 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro (Silver or Space Grey). MacBook Air 2017: processor, graphics and RAM 2017’s changes are limited to the faster processor. Everything else remains the same from the most recent 2015 model, which used the same Intel “Broadwell” processor as the 2017 Air. MacBook Pro models have used later “Skylake” and most up-to-date “Kaby Lake” processors, so if you need the fastest speeds from a Mac laptop you should look to the Pro range (from 2.3GHz to 3.6GHz chip speeds). That said, for most of us, with our browsing, streaming, social and office needs the MacBook Air should be fast enough. The 2017 model’s Intel Core i5 processor gets a small speed bump from 1.6GHz to 1.8GHz. When we’ve speed tested the new Air we’ll let you know what that does to performance, but we can say for sure that it wouldn’t be worth upgrading from the 2015 model to the 2017 Air. If your Air is older than the 2015 model - and you still love the form factor - then an upgrade might be worthwhile. You’ll also get faster graphics (the 2017 Air uses the same Intel HD Graphics 6000 chip, which replaced the 2014 Air’s HD Graphics 5000), and 8GB RAM as standard. When buying the new Air you can upgrade to a 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor. Apple also offers a feature called Turbo Boost. In technical terms this over-clocks the processor to push to greater speeds. If enough power is available and the temperature is at a safe level Turbo Boost will 'over-clock' the core and enable it to work faster. The standard 1.8GHz i5 processor can be pushed to 2.9GHz. The custom option 2.2GHz i7 processor can reach 3.2GHz via Turbo Boost. Basically, you should go for the fastest processor if you want, and if possible Turbo Boost will push it as far as it can. But remember that if speed is really vital to you, you should look to the MacBook Pro range. MacBook Air 2017: storage The only difference between the two MacBook Airs you can buy in 2017 is the storage capacity. In the old days we’d have called this the “hard disk” but the Air has always boasted much-faster “solid-state” SDD drives. The choice you get (as standard) is either 128GB or 256GB, but you can also double the maximum on-board storage to 512GB for £150 ($200). We’d recommend you go for as much storage as you can afford if you plan on storing music, images or video. But if your laptop is used mainly for browsing and light document work the 128GB should suffice. MacBook Air 2017: ports and slots The new Air features the same side ports as the 2015 model. You get: Two USB 3 ports (up to 5Gbps) for the usual peripherals. One Thunderbolt 2 port (up to 20Gbps) for adding a larger display or faster external hard drive. MagSafe 2 power port – still the best in our opinion, and much missed on the newer 12-inch MacBook, which uses its single USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) port for power and peripherals, and so requires a £69 ($69) Multiport Adapter if you need more than one at a time. SDXC camera card slot 5mm headphone jack If you have lots of standard USB peripherals then the Air supports these out of the box. The MacBook and MacBook Pro models require newer USB-C accessories or £19 ($19) adapters. It boasts the same great 802.11ac Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible) as the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro. MacBook Air 2017: screen The MacBook Air’s screen is a 13.3-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen display with a resolution of 1,440-x-900 pixels and a pixel density of roughly 128ppi (pixels per inch). It’s not as crisp and smooth as the Retina screen you’ll find on the MacBook or Pro models. http://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/what-retina-hd-display-are-they-worth-money-apple-3466732/ In comparison, the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro has a 2,560-x-1,600 native resolution at 227ppi. The Air’s display isn’t a bad screen, but Pro users might find it a little fuzzy in comparison to the Retina. The Air screen does use less power, though, and contributes to the lower overall cost. MacBook Air 2017: price The MacBook Air is the cheapest new Mac laptop you can buy, starting at £949/US$949 for the 128GB model. The 256GB Air is priced at £1,099/$1,199 – so you pay an extra £150/$200 for the larger capacity. Add a further £150/$200 and you get 512GB of storage in the custom build option. The 8GB of RAM isn’t upgradeable, but the processor is, as explained above: pay £135/$150 more for the 2.2GHz i7 processor. You can buy all of these models of the MacBook Air direct from Apple here: MacBook Air on Apple Store. MacBook Air 2017: installed software and apps You get a ton of great Apple apps, including the likes of FaceTime for free video calls with other Apple devices, and the office apps (Numbers spreadsheet, Pages page layout, and Keynote presentations), plus photo archiving, movie making and music making and listening apps. Photos; iMovie; GarageBand; Pages; Numbers; Keynote; Siri, Safari; Mail; FaceTime; Messages; Maps; Notes; Calendar; Contacts; Reminders; Photo Booth; Preview; iTunes; iBooks; App Store; and Time Machine (backup). MacBook Air 2017: specs 8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 3MB shared L3 cache (Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz); with custom option of 2.2GHz Intel Core i7 processor (Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz). 8GB of 1,600MHz LPDDR3 RAM 128GB, 256GB or 512GB PCIe-based flash storage 3-inch, 1,440-x-900-pixel display Intel HD Graphics 6000 11ac Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n compatible); Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: 2 x USB 3; 1 x Thunderbolt 2; 1 x SDXC card slot; 1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Stereo speakers Dual microphones 720p FaceTime HD camera Full-size backlit keyboard with Ambient light sensor, and Multi-Touch trackpad 54-watt-hour battery: Up to 12 hours wireless web browsing (claimed) Dimensions: Height: 0.3-1.7cm (0.11-0.68in) Width: 32.5cm (12.8in) Depth: 22.7cm (8.94in) Height: 1.35kg (2.96lb) For buying advice related to the current Apple laptop range, read our Best MacBook buying guide and Best cheap MacBook deals articles. You can also see our one-stop guide to the best place to buy any Mac. OUR VERDICT The 13-inch MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop, starting at £949 (US$999). It might lack the super-sharp Retina screen of the Macbook and MacBook Pro models but its display and performance is fine for most everyday uses. It boasts enough USB ports and other slots to make it more useful out of the box than the more limited, USB-C-only 12-inch MacBook or Pro. And its Wi-Fi is the same high standard as even the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro. If you need raw power go for the Pro. If you need the smallest Mac laptop there is, look at the 12-inch MacBook. But, all in all, despite it not changing much year after year we still love the MacBook Air for its design, price, size and features. Tags: Mac , Apple Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts 90+ new features shipping with iOS 11 this Fall Anthony Bouchard on June 6, 2017 42 Apple spent a lot of time demoing iOS 11 at the WWDC 2017 keynote, but in the interest of time, they were only able to show off some of the top features rather than everything that’s new. In this piece, we’ll outline a number of new features that Apple didn’t get a chance to show you at the keynote. Improvements for Siri One of the first things Apple took the stage for at the event was Siri, the voice assistant the powers our mobile devices. iOS 11 brings a host of new features for Siri, including: Two new voices – male and female A more fluent-speaking voice Type your queries to Siri instead of talk Improved jokes and personal expression Several new music-related commands Language translation Improvements for the keyboard Because typing on iPhones has always been a bit of a pain point, Apple is making typing faster and easier with these keyboard improvements: One-handed typing on iPhone Swipe up on keyboard keys to input numbers, symbols, and punctuation Password auto-fill for apps Enhanced switch control typing Improvements for the Messages app Apple has been changing the way you use the Messages app since iOS 10, and now things are about to get even better in iOS 11 with the following new features: Redesigned app drawer Business chat preview Share URLs with 3D Touch Invite family to use iMessage Send money via iMessage Improvements for the Photos app With photography being one of the main interests behind the iPhone’s incredible camera, it’s only obvious Apple would add new features to the Photos app to compliment your beautiful shots. The new stuff includes: Live Photo loops Live Photo bounce Live Photo long exposure Animated GIF support Improvements for the App Store The App Store is being completely redesigned in iOS 11 to bring things up to speed with the modern world we live in. Andrew goes hands-on with everything that’s new in the video below: Subscribe to iDB on YouTube Improvements for the Maps app Although navigation had a bit of a bumpy start on iOS at first, Apple has been ironing out the kinks and bringing its Maps app up to par with Google maps. Here’s what you can expect from the Maps app in iOS 11: Indoor maps for large malls Lane change guidance Indicate current speed limit Illustrate entrances to landmarks in China Zoom with one hand Traffic camera alerts in China Improvements for Safari Safari is the main web browser on your iPhone and iPad, and now you can expect even more useful features out of it, including: Siri can suggest articles based on your browsing activity Switch tabs with a 3D Touch gesture View flight statuses Find word definitions in Safari Convert metrics in Safari Do math in Safari Safe browsing in China Improvements for iCloud Since a lot of your data gets pushed from your iOS device(s) to iCloud, Apple is keeping iCloud up to date with new features as well. You can expect the following new features in iOS 11: iCloud remote backup iCloud family storage plans iCloud family Apple Music integration iCloud file sharing Access iCloud files inside the new Files app Unified iCloud Drive trash Improvements for the Notes app Apple spent a lot of time refining the Notes app in iOS 11, so you can expect all of the following great features to follow: Use Apple Pencil on iPad Lock screen to instantly open Notes Inline drawing – text wraps around drawn images Document scanning Pin notes of importance Insert tables in notes Improvements for the Mail app Since almost everyone gets emails, it’s also worth noting what comes new in Apple’s stock email client: Add inline drawings to your emails Top Hits during email searches Improvements for the News app Apple’s News app is a great place to see all your curated news lists. The following new features are being brought to the app in iOS 11: Siri suggests News topics based on your interests View a daily section of the best news-based videos Personalized Top Stories feature News videos now appear in the Today page New Spotlight tab Improvements for the Camera app Apple is also bringing a slew of new features to the Camera app in iOS 11, such as: New photo filters that bring out skin tones and more New compression technology reduces photograph file size Enhancements to Live Photos Improvements for the Podcasts app The Podcasts app has been completely redesigned in iOS 11. Andrew goes hands-on with the redesigned app in the video below: Subscribe to iDB on YouTube Improvements for Spotlight When you want to find something on your iPhone in a jiff, you use Spotlight. iOS 11 brings a number of improvements to Spotlight, including: View airplane and airport information Improvements for Apple Pay With Apple Pay increasing in popularity, Apple is expanding on the feature with more flexibility for its users. Among the new features related to Apple Pay are: Person-to-person money sharing Apple Pay Cash card securely stores received money for spending Transfer Apple Pay Cash to bank account or spend it online/in stores Stronger security Apple is beefing up the security of its operating system to keep you and your family safe. Among the changes coming in iOS 11 are: SMS fraud protection Enterprise network security features Wi-Fi password sharing New Accessibility features To make the iPhone usable for everyone, Apple has enhanced the Accessibility features in iOS 11, including: Automatic device setup Streamlined family setup PDF accessibility Spoken/braille captions for video Redesigned inverted colors mode Expansion of braille editing WebRTC support VoiceOver descriptions for images Use a 3D Touch gesture for Lookup Volume HUD doesn’t cover full-screen videos anymore New miscellaneous features on iPad Apple went above and beyond for iPad users with iOS 11 by adding a bevy of new features for all of Apple’s tablets: Support LED flashlight on 9.7-inch iPad Pro Dock-based App Switcher Better Split View multitasking Drag and drop Better support for Apple Pencil New HomeKit features With HomeKit products being all the rage these days, Apple is expanding upon its HomeKit features in iOS with the following upgrades: Set up occupancy and duration triggers for HomeKit accessories Tap to set up HomeKit devices Better international language support With iPhone being a worldly-popular device, Apple is making it more accessible for all of the different forms of communication found around the world. Among what’s new are: English input for Japanese Romaji keyboard Kannada, Malayalam, and Oida keyboards English on 10-key Pinyin keyboard Portuguese/English bilingual dictionary Russian/English bilingual dictionary Hindi dictation Arabic system font Improvements to Apple Music As Apple Music continues to gain traction in the Music industry, Apple continues to add new features, like: Create user accounts to connect with others View other users’ most-played music and playlists Support for Apple’s HomePod AirPlay 2 for improved music controls Redesigned Control Center interface Apple has completely re-thought the Control Center interface to look more modular and has added all new toggles and shortcuts, as well as a way to customize what does and doesn’t appear there. Andrew goes hands-on with the new Control Center in the video below: Subscribe to iDB on YouTube Native screen recording We’ve been able to record our screens with QuickTime on our Mac for a while now, but for the first time, you can now do it right from the device itself thanks to a new button in Control Center. Emergency SOS mode Apple Watch users are familiar with SOS mode, which helps you get in contact with emergency personnel and emergency contacts when things go wrong. Apple has brought this useful feature to the iPhone in iOS 11. Better Lock screen notifications Apple is redesigning the way you get to notifications on the Lock screen in iOS 11 by letting you easily filter between recent and missed notifications. All you have to do is drag down from the top of the screen like a cover sheet. Do Not Disturb while driving Apple is taking a stance against texting while driving by empowering users to use special Do Not Disturb features while driving. These features will automatically keep your phone from receiving notifications when you’re moving at a driving speed and will notify anyone who tries to contact you that you’re busy driving automatically. The feature is optional; but recommended. Better Wi-Fi and cellular information Apple is giving users more detailed information about their Wi-Fi and cellular usage statistics. New features include: Updated Status Bar cellular signal indicator More advanced Wi-Fi analytics Carrier-based cellular data usage Display phone number caller ID as Apple ID in China Snap Live Photos during FaceTime You can now capture Live Photos during a FaceTime call. Both you and the person you’re communicating with will receive a notification when you snap a photo and it gets saved to the Photos app. Scan QR codes It’s been a long time since the introduction of QR codes, but Apple is finally adding native support for QR-code scanning in iOS 11. More screenshot and Markup features When you take a screenshot on your device, iOS 11 will present you with many more options laid before you, such as Markup editing and sharing tools. Since we take screenshots to, more or less, show someone how to do something, this will be incredibly useful. Annotate PDF files in iBooks If you’re reading PDF files with the iBooks app, iOS 11 will allow you to annotate those files to your heart’s content. Move multiple app icons at once You used to have to put your iPhone into ‘jiggle’ mode to edit and move apps on the Home screen, but with iOS 11, you don’t even have to do that. Moreover, you can move multiple apps at one given time by selecting them during the moving process. Apple enables NFC for third-party apps We thought it might never happen, but Apple has opened NFC chip access for third-party developers who want to make apps to support Near Field Communication. This opens the door to new features like NFC-enabled tags or opening NFC-based doors, etc. Redesigned Calulator app Apple has also redesigned the Calculator app in iOS 11 with a more classic look. This includes a new app icon, as well as circular calculator buttons. Wrapping up There are many other features hidden in iOS 11, but as you can see, even the preliminary list of features is quite impressive to say the very least. iOS 11 will launch alongside macOS High Sierra and watchOS 4 this Fall as a free upgrade for all users. To see if iOS 11 is compatible with your device, we recommend reading our compatibility list. Since there are so many features baked into iOS 11, it’s probably likely that we missed a few. If we’ve missed anything major, please feel welcomed to leave a comment below to discuss any new features you find most interesting. Are you excited to install iOS 11 this Fall?

Still waiting on jailbreak for 10.3.1., or 10.3.2. Don’t really care for any of the apple junk, still like jailbreak tweaks better, way better. Abhinav Chaudhary An API for app store is also coming for tweak development, now on iOS 11 you can install tweaks from app store itself. ConduciveMammal I’m not sure what keynote you were watching, but a lot of these were mentioned, many of which were even demoed. Anthony Bouchard A lot of these were, and then a TON of them were not. We just mixed them altogether for your convenience so you don’t have to jump between two different posts. Full disclosure. JohnS Makes sense, but when 28 of the 102 new features listed in this article (almost 30%) were featured on stage maybe a better title would be “100+ new features in iOS 11”? Anthony Bouchard Fair point, I apologize for the misleading headline. JohnS No worries! Thanks for taking the time to post this, it’s an impressive list and I’m really looking forward to whatever lists you guys can come up with for MacOS and WatchOS too! I figure if they didn’t even have time to mention that you can now choose between two home screen layouts on the watch for instance I’m sure there’s lots of cool stuff to unearth! (For those that haven’t seen it here’s the grid and list views) https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/89c2e2d234342b7862e1851c2d34fd2c308169fe0f50d7dd8be79e2eb7dcd98e.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d43c12dbe239bf66421a030a622a21d10fb371738981f009579293889e4ed0dd.png Anthony Bouchard We published a macOS version of the post earlier today that I hope you will find helpful Mike M. Powell I can see that new “DnD Driving” feature probably came from that family that tried to sue them in the past. JohnS It’s almost a complete clone of the DnD Driving feature that Windows Phone has. Still, I think it’s a great idea and am glad to see it here as well. Rowan09 Yep because if i text and drive and get in an accident, it’s Apples fault. Only in America. Rechain You can also save GIF files to photos app now and watch them animated + upload to Twitter for example and they work. Before GIF changed to still pics when saved on to iPhone’s photo app. JohnS I mentioned this on another comment thread. To me this is one of those “IT’S ABOUT TIME!” features. I don’t know how many times I’ve wished that Apple would do this and is one of my top 5 new features of iOS. David Gow That NFC sounds great no digging in my pockets for my keys to find my work fob now I’ll just pull my phone out Kaptivator IF its not already in hand. Tony Trenkle Jr. A lot of these WERE mentioned during the keynote. And there is no 9.7 inch iPad Pro anymore. So are you referring to just the “iPad”? Also the NFC 3rd party should be a bigger deal. Is that like how it was used on android? Or differently? Anthony Bouchard Some of these were, a LOT of these were not. And there may not be a “new” 9.7-inch iPad Pro, but there is still a such thing as one, as people are holding them and using them as we speak. See our compatibility list: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/06/05/can-your-device-run-ios-11/ JohnS I wonder if all the naysayers from the “Control Center Gets Major Redesign in iOS 11” comment thread will get onto this article and complain that iOS 11 has almost no new features, is the smallest yearly update ever, and isn’t a quality update too? Thanks for this list BTW. Even this one is missing several new things but it goes to show just how rushed this WWDC was. David Pomerleau Can you explain what’s different w lock screen notifications? Anthony Bouchard Refer to Apple’s website for an animation. It will show you. Rafael Nunes Until release Apple will say 590 new features, the 90 you said above and the 500 others it’s gonna be new emojis or emojis redesign. Lol They should revamp the lockscreen with more info instead of put everything on the Apple’s Google Now. Sailor_V90 I can make notes private and have them require a password/Touch ID but I still can’t do it with pictures?! Rowan09 Apparently you shouldn’t take dirty pictures. Tom Johnson DARK mode is out also. Ghaith Al Hami Reinstall app https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7584beeafd14fc5fb67eb422ddfecca426eef1fe91482c7c0be76bbf8da6968b.jpg tranhieu ARKit and CoreML not support Objective-C, is it right? :D Woah screen recording Jay “Updated Status Bar cellular signal indicator” What is updated about it. Besides it not being circles it looks to be reverted back to the old style… Mr_Coldharbour Agreed. That’s what it used to look like prior to iOS 7. Granted, I hated the iOS 7+ redesign, but have grown fond of it, it’s rather unique since every other mobile OS uses the conventional cellular bars. I wish Apple would keep the circles. Jay Yes I agree 100% wplantz My guess is this change is to make room for the speaker grille inline as rumored for the bezel-less iPhone 8 (or whatever it will be called). Mark S Staying on 9 until a real jailbreak is released. Cerberus The Wise I wish. Probably never going to happen again though. Abhinav Chaudhary Spent my whole yesterday to find any way of downgrading to iOS 9 or even iOS 8 just for that stable and golden jailbreak. Rowan09 Apple is really paying attention with IOS. I like these added features and the ability to record your screen is great. They need to fix it when in landscape though because it doesn’t look right.

While tvOS was missing, we learned later that Apple will be announcing tvOS 11 tomorrow, although a developer preview is already available. But if you don't have a paid developer license, you'll no longer have to wait until the fall when it's released to the public. Alongside the usual iOS and macOS public betas, there will now be one for tvOS 11. While the website doesn't say when it will be available, it will presumably be later this month like its iOS and macOS counterparts. While Apple hasn't formally announced the update yet, we can get a peek at what's coming from the developer preview release notes. tvOS 11 will contain automatic light and dark appearance switching, home screen sync, right-to-left language support, notification support, and a number of under-the-hood improvements. The final version of tvOS 11 will likely ship this September, around the same time as iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and watchOS 4. As with the previous version, it will only be available for the fourth-generation Apple TV.

Apple's HomePod speaker is a depth charge dropped into the ocean where Google Home and Amazon Echo sail. At $349, it's not going to dominate the voice assistant world. But for Apple to achieve its goals, the HomePod just needs to keep the waters rough enough to make its competitors seasick. There are a bunch of weird things about Apple's HomePod announcement. First, Apple doesn't like to announce products six months in advance. And while the iPhone and iPad are expensive, they're not double the prices of rivals. The HomePod is also being sold as a music device above all else rather than virtual assistant. One interpretation is that Apple isn't going after competing voice assistants but the midrange, wireless multi-room speaker market; the domain of companies like Sonos, Bose, and Logitech. Yes, those companies have $200 options, but the Sonos Play:3 costs $299, and the Bose SoundTouch 20 costs $350. Those companies have been slow to adopt the kinds of flexible voice capabilities we've seen on Echo and Google Home, and they tend to appeal to a higher-end consumer who thinks the Amazon and Google products look and sound cheap. But I think Apple's strategy is a little trickier than that. The midrange speaker market is in fact ripe for disruption, and I think Apple's correct to assume that people who have expensive speakers probably have an iPhone. But by announcing the HomePod six months in advance, Apple's also trying to draw developer attention away from Alexa and Google Home, making sure that it's in second, not third place in the eventual war of the voice assistants. Second place is a very comfortable place for Apple, because it's focused on profit share rather than market share. In a battle between Apple and Amazon, it's easy enough to see a repeat of the iOS/Android war, where Echo speakers eat up the bottom end of the market while Apple reaps profits at the top. Amazon actually wouldn't mind this, as (like Google with Android, but not like Android phone makers) its business isn't dependent on making a profit from hardware. Developers Can Only Handle 2 Platforms Platforms need developers, and we've seen over and over that the tech world is capable of supporting two—not three—platforms in most areas. On the desktop, it's Mac and Windows, not Linux. On phones, it's Apple and Android, not BlackBerry 10 or Windows Phone. On high-end tablets, increasingly, it's Windows and iOS, with Android shunted down to the low end. Sure, the third platform often manages to hang on as a niche, but the two major ones dominate the market. Developers just don't seem to have the resources to split their attention more broadly. Right now there are three players in voice assistants: Apple, Google, and Amazon. Apple is coming late to the game, but it understands the value of not being third. And as it implied by focusing on music in its presentation, SiriKit is way behind the competition in attracting developers right now. Related Apple HomePod vs. Amazon Echo vs. Google Home: Smart Speaker Showdown Apple HomePod vs. Amazon Echo vs. Google Home: Smart Speaker Showdown Apple needs to get SiriKit into the conversation and to make sure Google and Amazon don't lock down voice-assistant developers, which could definitely happen in the next six months. By announcing the HomePod now, Apple throws a bit of confusion into that community; should developers keep their powder dry? Google is likely to suffer more than Amazon from this, because Amazon has a lot of third-party partners and an already vibrant developer community. Look at our list of Alexa skills versus our list of Google Home voice actions: Google is just getting started here. Google's speaker also sounds better, and costs more, than Amazon's hot-selling Echo Dot, putting it in a little more danger from Apple's higher-end product. This doesn't mean that Apple's HomePod is going to be a best-seller. Sure, it could be the next Apple Hi-Fi, an expensive audio accessory that ends up being overlooked for better third-party products. But it keeps the waters roiled, and keeps the Google/Amazon duopoly from fixing in place. When developers can only focus on two platforms, that means at least Apple has a chance.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint SAN JOSE, Calif. – One of Apple's greatest strengths is timing. The company that is hailed for innovation does not often invent things first — it didn't create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use. On paper, Apple is aiming to pull the same trick with a device called HomePod. The $349 gadget — which Apple unveiled on Monday at its annual developer conference and will begin shipping in December — is inspired by the Amazon Echo, the smart speaker that houses Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa. Apple's version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It's very pretty; it's about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room. Yet the reinvention that matters here isn't about a single device — it's larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself. For some time now, Apple has faced questions about its growth and what rabbits it can pull out of its hat next, especially as rivals including Google, Facebook and Amazon appear to have gotten the jump on it with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and augmented reality. The Apple iPhone remains the most profitable computing device in the world, and Apple's immediate future looks sunny, but its long-term outlook has begun to look partly cloudy. In a world that seems to care less and less about beautiful hardware and more about services that help you from afar, over the air, without your ever having to touch a machine, Apple risks becoming an anachronism. HomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That's because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner — cloud services and AI, for instance. Marcio Jose Sanchez &#x2022; AP The $349 HomePod speaker will begin shipping in December, but more is at stake than the success of a single device. But here's the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: "machine learning," "deep learning" and "computer vision." Subtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow's intelligent machines — whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance. This shift doesn't mean that HomePod will succeed, or that Amazon's device is in trouble; the Echo has momentum that will be difficult to curb. In broad strokes, the HomePod seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, "Hey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen," and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it's playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions — setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices. HomePod also lacks a lot that the Echo has perfected. For now, it seems bound to Apple's ecosystem. Apple said that it connects to its own subscription music service, but declined to specify whether it would let you play songs from Spotify or other services, or whether there was a way for third-party developers to create additional voice-activated functions, which is one of the best features of the Echo. Alexa can order an Uber for you; HomePod may ask you to try using your phone. And obviously, HomePod lacks the Echo's deep integration with Amazon's online store, which, to many users, is a killer feature: Running out of dish soap? Alexa will order it for you, but Siri can't. Yet many of these are omissions that you would expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics. If you are a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon's speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can. Apple showed off other computationally difficult features on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting. For example, Siri will now translate languages. Best of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac — one would learn that you are traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use. There was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It's also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world. If you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn't expect it to beat Google in an AI contest anytime soon. But it doesn't need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive — it's got to invest just enough in the AI-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There's no mistake, now, that it's doing so.

The smaller of the two Pros ditches the 9.7-inch screen, which dates all the way back to the original iPad, for a 10.5-inch panel that fits into a chassis only 10.6mm (0.42”) taller and 4.6mm (0.18”) wider than the outgoing model thanks to smaller bezels. The expanded all-aluminum chassis increases weight by 7% or 32 grams, just enough to notice if you’re familiar with one of the recent models. The larger 12.9-inch Pro—first released at the end of 2015—finally gets some attention too. After missing out on the new hardware introduced with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro last year, the big Pro has been brought up to parity with the new 10.5-inch Pro. Both the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch LCD panels are new for this generation and share the same specifications. The 264ppi panels can display more vivid and lifelike colors by extending color coverage well beyond the sRGB standard with DCI-P3 gamut support. And because iOS supports ColorSync, Apple’s color management system, the Pros’ wide-gamut panels maintain color accuracy by respecting the source material’s target gamut (no overly-vivid, neon colors when viewing sRGB content, for example). Both models also support Apple’s True Tone display technology that adjusts the display’s white point based on ambient light. The idea here is for the screen to replicate what happens to a white sheet of paper under different lighting conditions. If you read a printed book in an incandescent bulb’s warm light, the page will reflect that light and appear warmer, more yellow. True Tone does the same thing, reducing the LCD’s blue output and shifting the white point to appear warmer. Matching the display’s output to its environment is supposed to reduce eye strain, but True Tone can be disabled if it’s not to your liking. Apple claims both displays can hit 600 nits peak brightness, which is impressive for tablets. We previously measured the 9.7-inch iPad Pro at 520 nits and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro at 427 nits, so this should bring a noticeable visibility improvement in bright light, especially for the big Pro. Both panels are also fully laminated to the cover glass and use an improved antireflective coating to further improve visibility and diminish eye strain by reducing screen reflections. The improved coating was first used on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and after comparing it side by side with the iPad Air 2, I was really impressed with how well it works.

The standard refresh rate doubles from 60Hz to 120Hz, which should help UI animations appear more fluid. It also reduces the Apple Pencil’s latency, making inking smoother with less lag. Driving a panel at 120Hz increases power consumption (panel and SoC), however. To help reduce the impact on battery life, the refresh rate is adjusted down to 24Hz or 48Hz when displaying content that would not benefit from the faster refresh, such as reading an ebook or Web page, for example. Under the display is an Apple A10X Fusion SoC that comes with additional CPU and GPU cores compared to the A10 Fusion SoC used in the iPhone 7. Instead of 2 performance CPU cores and 2 efficiency cores, the A10X Fusion uses 3 of each. It also doubles the number of GPU cores, which makes sense considering it needs to drive a lot more pixels at a higher refresh rate. Apple claims a 30% improvement in CPU performance and a 40% faster GPU compared to the Apple A9X SoC used in the previous generation. It’s still not clear how much RAM the new Pros have. It’s probably safe to assume that the 12.9-inch model still comes with 4GB, but does the 10.5-inch model stick with 2GB like the 9.7-inch Pro? Considering all of the new multitasking features and visual elements in iOS 10/11, a bump to 4GB is certainly justified, although, Apple tends to be frugal with RAM. Internal storage capacity doubles, with the least-expensive models packing 64GB of NAND.  The next two storage tiers jump to 256GB and 512GB, which makes these iPads a bit more competitive with other ultraportable devices targeted at professionals. The extra space is also essential if you plan to use an iPad for less ‘Pro’ purposes such as watching TV shows or movies, which eat up space quickly. The cameras on iPads have always seemed like an afterthought, with Apple using iPhone leftovers a generation or two old. Because tablets typically are not the first device people reach for when shooting photos and video, camera hardware is an obvious place to save money. This is not the case with the new iPad Pros, however, which receive the biggest camera upgrade since Apple first added cameras to the iPad 2. Both the front and rear camera modules are shared with the iPhone 7. That means a 7MP FaceTime HD camera on the front that supports automatic HDR imaging, wide color gamut photos, and 1080p video recording. You can also use the iPad’s display as a flash. Around back is a 12MP camera with 1.22µm pixels, OIS, Focus Pixels (PDAF), a 6-element lens array with a large f/1.8 aperture, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It also supports automatic HDR imaging and wide color gamut photos and uses OIS and EIS for stabilizing video. The new Pros come with 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO Wi-Fi that offers a peak theoretical throughput of 866Mbps. Like previous iPads, there’s Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + LTE cellular variants. The cellular-enabled models get a new Category 9 LTE modem with up to 450Mbps on the downlink. There’s also support for 25 LTE bands and an embedded Apple SIM. The new iPad Pros look like, well…iPads. The aluminum shell is visually indistinguishable from earlier models and still has a Lightning connector on the bottom, a 3.5mm headphone jack and power button in opposite corners at the top, volume buttons on one side, and an Apple Smart Connector on the other. The proprietary Smart Connector transfers both data and power to optional peripherals such as external keyboards. There are also 4 speakers—2 on the top and 2 on the bottom—that provide better sound than the mono speakers on older iPads and are less prone to being covered by your hands when holding it in landscape mode. The 12.9-inch Pro looks the same as the previous version from the front, while the 10.5-inch Pro has noticeably narrower bezels along the sides of the display. The physical home button includes an upgraded Touch ID sensor (same as iPhone 7) that’s 2x faster. Both the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros are available for preorder and will begin shipping mid June. Unlike the iPhone 7, Apple is not offering any new color choices for the iPads, so we get the familiar Silver, Space Gray, Gold, and Rose Gold. The Apple Pencil can be purchased separately for $99, and Apple offers its Smart Keyboard for $159 and $169 for 10.5- and 12.9-inch models, respectively.

Reply Cygni - Tuesday, June 06, 2017 - link While the move from 2 to 3 performance cores is interesting, the bigger news and bonus is going to come from the 3 little cores. They won't help peak performance numbers like the "30% faster" claim is going for, but they may really help battery life. In my view, we are past the days of gigantic performance improvements in each generation of SoCs in the tablet/mobile space. We are entering the area where performance improvements come with real battery hits as the relentless pace of die shrinks has absolutely begun to slow noticeably. The real question Apple likely asked itself wasn't how much performance they could get in the product, but where is the sweet spot. This easily could have been a 4+4 design. Competitors have already shipped 4+4 designs... but is that worth the battery cost? Is it worth the die size? Are people really using that in an iPad package? Reply damianrobertjones - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link That wouldn't happen... what will they change in the next release? Carefully planned, marketed, released times cale to ensure max $$$$. This is business after all and you wouldn't want to give the consumer anything that might stop that flow. Reply Santoval - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link Apple's CPUs are much wider (6-issue), so it makes much less sense to move into a 4+4 big.LITTLE configuration. Being wider, they are also more power hungry, so power consumption would go through the roof. The 3+3 design will most likely used in the next iPhone as well, unless they go for a 2+3 one (3 little cores) to save power. Α10X should also be clocked lower than A10 and A9X, probably around ~2Ghz. Reply melgross - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link The more cores there are, the weaker they are. There's just only so much room on the chip. It's why Apple's cores have been about twice as powerful as the same gen designs from other vendors. I imagine, this time round, Apple found benefits from three cores - or, as with the A8X, when they also had three cores, going to a new process hindered them from doing bigger cores, and next gen they'll go back to 2 cores again. Reply name99 - Wednesday, June 07, 2017 - link I don't think it's likely that space forced the switching between 2 and 3 cores; my guess is it's more a process of learning and exploration. Remember that (a) these SoCs are designed some years in advance of when they ship, and who knows how late in the process the number of cores has to be decided (b) the cores are basically tiny compared to the die as a whole. The entire CPU complex takes up like 15% of the die, compared to ~50% for the GPU. It probably seemed plausible in the past that two cores was appropriate for iPad software, but that that calculation has changed as iOS has grown up, now allowing two apps (plus PiP) to have UI simultaneously, with three apps (plus PiP) in iOS 11. My guess is that three cores for iPad is the new standard going forward, not an aberration. (The A8X was, I suspect, a compromise resulting from some disagreement --- some saying "let's try it and see, and we'll learn a few things about going beyond a dual-core system", some saying "it's a waste of area"; with the A9X the argument for learning was no longer valid; but by A10X the value of the extra cores, given the direction of iPad software, had proven itself.) We can compare with desktops where the most recent study a few years ago suggested that for most purposes the appropriate number of cores was three (up from two about ten years before that...) Intel dual-core with hyper-threading kinda matches that, hence that's what we see as the standard issue CPU in most consumer computers.

Whereas the design was previously incredibly dated and hard to use, the new design is more akin to that of Apple Music and the current iTunes app on Mac and PC. Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover The new iTunes web design features larger images and more information about artists and their music. Apple touts the new design as an “Apple Music Preview,” with several links and buttons to jump directly into iTunes or the Music app on iOS. There’s also an option to start an Apple Music free trial on the new page. Previously, the interface was touted as an “iTunes Preview” rather than Apple Music. With the new Apple Music web design, users can easily listen to song previews, read editors’ notes and artist biographies, preview videos, and much more. As you can see below, the design overhaul is rather drastic, but long overdue and will be familiar to anyone that has used Apple Music or iTunes in the past.

The 2017 Law School Rankings: The Finest In Fact-Based List Making Technology DISCO Announces New Artificial Intelligence Platform For eDiscovery Boasting the latest in machine learning capabilities, DISCO has big plans for changing eDiscovery. By Joe Patrice Jun 6, 2017 at 2:05 PM Shares161 At its latest glitzy product unveiling, Apple introduced the world to the HomePod, a Siri-enabled speaker/home assistant to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Unfortunately, they turned Siri into an ominous reflection of the most famously deadly housekeeping artificial intelligence of all time. Nothing salves those technophobic fears like knowing your Apple is going to lock you out of the house someday. Meanwhile, the legal industry saw a different artificial intelligence unveiling from CS DISCO, opening up its DISCO AI platform for the general use of all DISCO customers. It’s an AI product launch with a mercifully less murderous overtone than Apple’s. On the other hand, listen to the Bee Gees for about five minutes, and perhaps the name DISCO will evoke just as much bloodlust. DISCO’s new AI platform harnesses “the latest advancements in both machine learning and cloud computing” to streamline the eDiscovery process. That’s a fancy way of saying that DISCO has a tool that’s going to start learning alongside the reviewers, taking the human input and integrating it into its own read of the documents, opening up new efficiencies. Working in the background during the normal course of a review, DISCO AI displays Tag Predictions — a suggested tag with a score from -100 to +100, indicating the likelihood that the tag should be applied to the document by a human — in real-time. The results seen during the limited availability phase of DISCO AI are impressive. The platform’s ability to correctly predict the likelihood that a tag should or should not be applied to a document is consistently in the 85% to 95% range, even with as few as 50 examples and data sets as small as 2,000 documents. That’s a tremendous tool for document reviews and a marked improvement over many of the technology-assisted-review systems of yesteryear. Assuming the long-term goal of a platform like this is to learn enough through a sample set that lawyers are confident allowing the AI to perform a first pass of large amounts of data, the capacity to actually learn from reviewers in context rather than take a clunky set of instructions is invaluable. Lawyers aren’t programmers, after all, and those attorney-generated lists of relevant terms deliberately fed into programs always left something to be desired. DISCO AI’s accuracy vis a vis human reviewers — upwards of 95 percent — is undeniably worth touting, but anyone who’s ever worked on a big review knows the other side of the coin is a far bigger danger. With the DISCO AI platform, quality control is able to say “here are documents that don’t have the X tag that AI expects should have that tag — is there something systematically wrong with one specific reviewer?” While that might not seem as sexy as some of the other applications of this system, it’s hard to undersell the practical importance of that service. Because, let’s face it, some lawyers are dumb. While the opportunity to see tag predictions in real-time provides a useful “driver assist” to a reviewer, helping them accurately tag documents by flagging key issues, this function can also be shut off to prevent reviewers from relying too heavily on the system’s predictions (or lack thereof). It’s all adaptable to the type of review required. “I am excited DISCO AI is bringing deep learning to ediscovery, which I anticipate will dramatically improve the speed and accuracy of document analysis and minimize traditional review,” stated Gordon Calhoun, Partner and Chair of the Electronic Discovery, Information Management & Compliance Practice at Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard & Smith LLP. “Deep learning neural nets have the potential to take us beyond text data, allow us to better understand the evidentiary value of the cocoon of data that surrounds us and use the IoT as a virtual witness in the courtroom. I expect these advances will transform many other areas of the practice of law, as well.” I guess when I said earlier that DISCO AI aims to streamline the eDiscovery process, I should have said that DISCO AI aims to streamline the eDiscovery process… for now. Because as Calhoun points out, there’s nothing stopping DISCO from applying this technology to any number of legal processes — on either the litigation or transactional side.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software It took less than a day for bloggers to convince themselves WWDC was a disaster Yoni Heisler @edibleapple June 6th, 2017 at 5:31 PM Share Tweet During Apple’s WWDC keynote yesterday, Tim Cook and a slew of Apple executives introduced a number of new software and hardware initiatives, including a peer-to-peer payment feature via Apple Pay, a brand new iMac Pro, a sleek new 10.5-inch iPad, refreshed notebooks across the board, a brand new augmented reality platform, and a premium-oriented home speaker dubbed HomePod, just to name a few. All in all, Apple’s WWDC event this year was solid from start to finish, though perhaps not the most exciting WWDC event we’ve ever seen. Nonetheless, Apple introduced enough new software and hardware to get developers and iOS users alike excited for the future of Apple’s ecosystem. Indeed, the augmented reality demo was particularly enthralling. Predictably, though, it didn’t take long for critics and naysayers to start chirping about how Apple has lost its luster, with some even trotting out the same old tired lines about how Tim Cook isn’t the visionary that Steve Jobs was. Don't Miss: iOS 11 beta 1 is now available to download An example: try and digest this blurb from Christopher Versace over at Forbes. While we tend to be Apple devotees when it comes to the hardware and its ease of use, our view is this year’s WWDC is it was one largely filled with refinements and incremental additions. Not entirely surprising, given the fact that Apple is now led by an expert operations manager, Tim Cook, and not a visionary like Steve Jobs. As we see it, Apple will either need to bring in some visionary expertise, or perhaps, and more likely, use its war chest of $20 billion to buy some vision in the form of acquisitions, but that’s another story. This is a curious take because Tim Cook was never supposed to be the second coming of Steve Jobs. Yes, he’s an operations guy, but he’s still the man who Jobs tapped to take Apple to new heights. And sure, Cook may not be as dynamic as Jobs, and he may not be the visionary that Jobs was, but there’s no denying that Apple has absolutely thrived with him steering the ship. It’s almost comical that some critics, in the same breath that they praise all things Steve Jobs, bemoan Jobs’ choice of successor. Further, Tim Cook may not be Steve Jobs, but no one is Steve Jobs. Jobs was an incredibly unique individual who possessed the rare skill of being able to anticipate how the tech landscape was going to unfold. To expect Cook, or any one for that matter, to live up to Jobs’ standard is absurd. Indeed, one of the key pieces of advice that Jobs told Cook was that he shouldn’t fall prey to “What would Steve Jobs do?” syndrome. As to the WWDC announcements themselves, they were admittedly incremental in some regards, but that’s how Apple actually operates more often than not. It doesn’t roll out wild new ideas on a consistent basis. On the contrary, it refines and polishes its existing hardware and software lines, continually offering users more bang for their buck. Versace himself concedes this point: The problem as we see it is Apple is trapped inside a near yearly refresh rate that makes it challenging to deliver breakthrough features each and every year. Even the new iOS name, iOS 11, is uninspiring. And yet, the urge to criticize all things Apple is so great that even the iOS 11 name itself can’t escape derision. The crazy thing is that Apple’s WWDC event, in the eyes of some, is already being viewed as a failure. This is mind-boggling given that such critiques aren’t even giving Apple’s new software and hardware an opportunity to hit the marketplace.

This year's WWDC keynote disappointed those who were hoping for a substantial MacBook Air refresh, but Apple did update the processor on its venerable ultraportable, signaling that it's not dead yet. However, a simple processor upgrade might not be enough to outshine Microsoft's new Surface Laptop. The first thing you notice about both laptops is their similar sizes. Now that the 11-inch MacBook Air is gone, Apple has left us with a 13.3-inch model that weighs almost exactly 3 pounds and starts at $999. Compare that to the $999 Surface, which has a 13.5-inch display and is just a bit lighter, at 2.83 pounds. Neither one will add much of a burden to your handbag or backpack, but you don't have the option of making that burden even lighter and smaller by sacrificing some screen real estate. Name Microsoft Surface Laptop Apple MacBook Air (2017)   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $999.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% Editor Rating Processor Name Intel Core i5-7200U Intel Core i5-5250U Processor Speed 2.5 GHz 1.8 GHz Operating System Windows 10 S Apple macOS Sierra RAM 4 GB 4 GB Storage Capacity (as Tested) 128 GB 128 GB Graphics Card Intel HD Graphics 620 Intel HD Graphics 6000 Screen Size 13.5 inches 13.3 inches Resolution 2256 x 1504 1440 x 900 Storage Type SSD Flash storage Weight 2.7 lb 2.96 lb   Read the Review Read the Review While both displays are about the same size, the Surface packs in many more pixels. Its 2,256-by-1,504 resolution is better than Full HD, and much easier on the eyes than the 1,440-by-900 screen the MacBook Air offers. If you're looking to replace an older MacBook Air, you've never used a higher-resolution display, and you don't care about touch screens, then you might be satisfied with the Air's resolution. Otherwise, the touch-enabled Surface is the clear winner here. It's What's Inside That Matters Under the hood, both laptops offer Intel Core i5 processors. In the Air's case, you get a 1.8GHz dual-core Core i5, with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz. That's better than the 1.6GHz Core i5 that used to power it, but not as good as the seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core i5 or Core i7 from which you can choose to power your Surface. Still, the processor's generation doesn't matter as much if you're not going to be taxing it with intensive video editing or native-resolution gaming—the Air and the Surface will handle the usual ultraportable tasks like video streaming and word processing. The Surface can be configured with 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB of RAM, while the Air's only choice is 8GB. Both offer 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of solid state storage, and even though macOS and Windows have slimmed down over the years, you'll probably want to opt for one of the more expansive SSDs if you don't rely exclusively on streaming video and audio and store all of your data in the cloud. The lack of USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Air isn't surprising since it's an older design, but they're sorely missing on the Surface, which was just announced last month. How Long Can They Go? One of the most important aspects of an ultraportable is battery life, and that's where things get a little tricky. Apple promises 12 hours of web browsing or video playback from a local (iTunes) file, while Microsoft boasts that the Core i5-powered Surface can last for up to 14.5 hours of video playback. We haven't had a chance to conduct our own battery tests on either laptop yet, so we can't offer final judgment on those claims. Assuming they hold up, the difference between 12 hours and 14.5 hours isn't going to matter much if you're using your machine around the office all day. But the Surface would offer a clear edge on a flight from New York to Hong Kong, for example, especially if you're crammed into economy class with no power and counting on your laptop to entertain you. They've Got Style As for style, the MacBook Air looks much the same as it has for many years. It's an extremely svelte machine, and one that arguably ushered in the ultraportable market in which the Surface and others now compete. If you're a fan of the bezel-less design that's all the rage on ultrabooks like the Dell XPS 13, however, you'll likely be put off by the thick aluminium border surrounding the Air's screen. The aluminium-clad Surface looks svelte, too, albeit without the Air's taper from back to front. Its bezel appears a bit thinner than the Air's, and it offers four color options: Burgundy, Platinum, Cobalt Blue, or Graphite Gold. Other Surface models have been plagued by uncomfortable keyboards, but we didn't have any problems with the touchpad (which supports multi-touch gestures) or chiclet-style keyboard during our brief hands-on time with the Surface last month. Which One's the Winner? If you remove screen resolution from the equation and overlook the Air's age (two big assumptions, admittedly), the Air and the Surface appear more or less equally worthy of lightening your wallet. Related The Best Ultraportable Laptops of 2017 The Best Ultraportable Laptops of 2017 The ultimate tiebreaker, then, comes down to the operating system, and that's where the Air has a clear edge, since, like all modern Macs, it can run both macOS and Windows. Sure, you'll need to buy and install a copy of Windows 10 separately, but you will need to upgrade the Surface to Windows 10 Pro if you want to run third-party apps. It comes with Windows 10 S, which limits you to apps downloaded from the Microsoft Store. So for most people, the Surface Laptop versus MacBook Air debate is superseded by the Windows versus Mac debate. Put that way, a simple processor upgrade may be enough to keep Apple fans from jumping ship.

When he isn't writing about games, you'll probably find him slapping the bass to his favourite 80s tunes. Apple has updated the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but does that mean you're going to need to buy Smart accessories? While we know that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro has been phased out by Apple and replaced with the new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is still sticking around with some upgraded hardware. Apple was quick to announce at the WWDC keynote that consumers would be able to pick up a Smart Cover and Smart Keyboard for its new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, but where does that leave the 12.9-inch iPad Pro? If you're looking to upgrade your first generation 12.9 Pad Pro to the newer generation, will you need to buy your Smart Cover or Smart Keyboard again? It's the same old Smart Cover and Smart Keyboard Good news! If you already have a Smart Keyboard or Smart Cover for your first-generation 12.9-iPad Pro, they will work seamlessly with the new generation. In fact, since the physical size of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro is unchanged, nothing has changed on either the Smart Keyboard or Smart Cover, and you can order them right now! Apple Smart Keyboard If you plan on doing any extensive writing on your iPad Pro, the Apple Smart Keyboard is the most versatile option: It folds up into a neat package and protects your iPad's screen when not in use, but unfolds into a full soft keyboard package when you need it. See at Apple Smart Cover The Smart Cover protects your iPad's screen when you're not using it and acts as a foldable kickstand when you are. It's available in both white and charcoal gray colors, and you can buy it right now! See at Apple Which 12.9-inch iPad Pro accessories do you already have? Let us know in the comments below!

Apple has a lower valuation than 9 of the 11 major market sectors. It's not clear why investors don't value Apple shares in the same way they do the rest of the market. John Melloy | @johnmelloy Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 5:26 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The technical case for an Apple rally    Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 3:47 PM ET | 03:18 Even after a 33 percent surge to about $800 billion in market value this year, Apple's shares appear cheap going by the most widely used method to value stocks: the price-earnings ratio. In fact, if you applied the same P/E ratio to Apple as the rest of the stock market, the technology juggernaut's shares would be 19 percent higher, according to calculations by Bespoke Investment Group. Applying the same multiple as rest of the S&P's tech sector gives Apple an estimated value more than 30 percent higher than where it is right now, according to Bespoke. Source: Bespoke Investment Group "Apple (AAPL) has had quite a run, but it's still on the cheap side relative to the broader market," says the Bespoke report. "If AAPL had the same P/E ratio as the S&P 500, it would have a share price of $184, while a multiple similar to the technology sector would translate to a price of $211." But alas, Apple closed Tuesday at $154.45 a share with a trailing P/E of just above 18. The S&P 500 currently has a trailing multiple of 21.6 and the technology sector trades for a trailing P/E of 24.7. "AAPL has a lower P/E ratio than nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors," the Bespoke report added. So why are investors willing to pay more per earnings for stocks that, on average, are going to grow profits at a slower pace than Apple? That question has plagued Apple investors for a while. It didn't always use to be this way. During the last bull market, Apple traded at a P/E ratio in the high 30s. The multiple collapsed with most other stocks during the housing crisis, but then retook that multiple above 30 as the latest bull market began. Apple trailing P/E, 15 years Source: FactSet But then something happened. Apple began hitting its stride with successful recurring models of the iPhone and in the process began accumulating an unprecedented amount of cash. In 2012, it declared a dividend, something growth stocks that wanted to stay in the good graces of growth managers didn't do. Investors began treating the shares as an asset class because of the company's sheer size and cash hoard. A safe place to park money even. The cash reached a record $256.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter of this year. But it's not like the company stopped growing, or will stop in the near future. Bespoke points out that Apple will increase earnings by 15 percent over the next one year, according to analysts' estimates. It's possible investors just don't know how to value a company with this much cash and earnings power because they've never seen something like this before. Its market cap is the largest in the world of any public company. Despite this, UBS did some analysis last month and found incredibly that investors still "underown" Apple. The stock makes up 1.3 percent of global active managers' portfolios, on average, according to UBS. Yet its average weighting in global benchmarks is 2 percent, UBS shows. It's unclear what the company or Wall Street analysts can do to get investors to value Apple in the same way they do other stocks. Some speculate it's not up to them, but President Donald Trump and Congress. A repatriation tax break would free up the majority of that cash position collecting dust overseas to be brought back to the U.S. and used by Apple for R&D, takeovers and capital distribution. For now, the stock remains in a valuation purgatory.

Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, confirmed the tech giant is co-operating with the UK Government to provide information which can help security services and their investigations. Reuters 3 Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the tech giant is providing information to the UK Government “We have been co-operating with the UK Government not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks,” he said. “I cannot speak on detail on that. But in cases when we have information and they have gone through the lawful process we don’t just give it but we do it very promptly.” Following the London Bridge terror attack, Prime Minister Theresa May said that technology companies must stop being a “safe space” for terror suspects.

Her comments prompted a defiant response from Facebook, with the web giant declaring that it wants to be a “hostile environment for terrorists”. Getty Images 3 It comes after the London Bridge attack on Saturday which saw three terrorists (pictured) mow down pedestrians before knifing revellers at random EPA 3 Mr Cook said the tech giant has co-operated with UK authorities in providing information when requested Seven people were killed and 48 injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians before stabbing punters at nearby bars and restaurants in London Bridge on Saturday night. May confirmed the attack wasn’t connected to the suicide bombing in Manchester a fortnight ago and the atrocity at Westminster in March. But, the Tory leader said a “new trend in the threat we face” has emerged and called for “important” changes. Apple has previously been criticised by the Government for its approach. It uses end-to-end encryption across many of its services, which it says it does in order to protect user privacy. The company was also involved in a stand-off with the FBI last year over gaining access to the locked iPhone of a terror suspect. We pay for your stories!

While the iPad will receive many terrific (and much-needed) big-screen features (see “iPad Pro Gets More Professional,” 5 June 2017), the rest of iOS 11 focuses on UI refinement, artificial intelligence, and developer capabilities. Regardless, some big changes are coming when iOS 11 is released this fall. Control Center and Lock Screen -- Whenever you install iOS 11, the first big thing you’ll likely notice immediately is the new Control Center, which had ballooned to up to three pages in iOS 10. For iOS 11, Apple has compressed it back down to one page, in a grid that takes up more of the screen. Despite being squeezed into a single page, Control Center will offer more options than before. You’ll be able to 3D Touch a Control Center “platter,” as Apple called them, or presumably long-press it on devices that don’t support 3D Touch, to pop open a panel with more options. The other big front-facing change is that Notification Center is going away in iOS 11. Instead, you’ll be able to scroll through all of your notifications on the Lock screen. It wasn’t quite clear how you’d be able to see your older notifications without locking the device. Messages -- In iOS 11, Apple is finally fixing Messages with Messages in iCloud. Your messages will be synced across devices via iCloud, so you won’t have unsynced or jumbled messages. If you delete a message on one device, it disappears on all devices. Also, your older messages will be stored in iCloud so they won’t hog precious storage space on your devices. Of course, your messages will still be end-to-end encrypted to ensure your privacy. Apple is also redesigning the Message app drawer for iOS 11. The company introduced Message apps in iOS 10, but they’ve been underwhelming so far. A better-designed app drawer may make these mini-apps more accessible. That will also be key for a new feature coming to Apple Pay… Apple Pay -- Apple is becoming a financial services company of sorts, since Apple Pay will support person-to-person payments in iOS 11. To store the money you receive, you’ll have an Apple Cash Card in Wallet, and you can transfer money from it to your bank. Apple was a bit skimpy on details, but it seems that the primary way of making person-to-person transactions will be with a Message app that can send money via iMessage. Siri -- Siri will receive some major enhancements in iOS 11. In addition to new, more natural voices and a new look, Siri will now sync the data it knows about you between devices to better help personalize your queries. Siri is also getting smarter. Thanks to what Apple calls Siri Intelligence, Siri will better understand your interests and the contexts in which you are speaking. For instance, if you search for Iceland in Safari, Apple News will recommend articles about Iceland, and the keyboard will intelligently suggest related terms. Apple has spread this intelligence throughout iOS 11. For instance, Calendar can now extract events from Safari. This is one of those features that’s difficult to demo or describe, so we’re anxious to get our hands on it to see how it works in reality. Unhappy with the results Siri usually gives you? In iOS 11, Siri will offer alternative answers that you can choose by tapping the screen. Presumably, Apple will use this to tailor its recommendations. Perhaps the coolest new feature coming to Siri is translation. You’ll be able to say something like “How do you say what the most popular dishes in your restaurant in Chinese,” and Siri will speak what you said in Chinese. Apple emphasized that this is a beta feature, so we don’t quite have the Babel fish from “Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” yet. Finally, the SiriKit API for developers is gaining some new features, such as photo search, car controls, task management, and banking. That should mean that we’ll be able to use Siri to control many more apps than in iOS 10. App Store -- Apple is totally revamping the App Store in iOS 11. The old top charts seem to be gone. Instead, there are tabs for daily featured apps, games, and apps. Apple seems to be moving toward curating the App Store more. Apps featured in the Today tab will include short articles and how-to videos. Likewise, the other new tabs will feature highlighted apps every day. The idea seems to be to get users to check in with the App Store every day to see what’s new. That may be great for developers, but we’re horrified that Apple seems to think you should waste vast amounts of time browsing the App Store for new apps daily. Developers will appreciate the App Store’s new “phased releases,” which roll out a new or updated app slowly instead of all at once. That’ll be especially welcome for developers whose apps require a lot of server resources. Camera -- Have you noticed that the file sizes for photos are growing with each new iPhone model? Apple is tackling that with two new technologies: HEVC H.265 video compression and a new image format called HEIF. Apple claims that HEVC compression can cut the size of videos by half. HEIF, or High Efficiency Image File Format, is a new file format standard that will replace JPEG for iOS photos. Apple claims that images in HEIF will be easy to share with others, but we’re waiting to see how well that pans out. Portrait Mode for the iPhone 7 Plus is also getting some much-needed enhancements: improved image quality, better low-light performance, and optical image stabilization. Photos -- The Memories feature that Apple introduced in iOS 10 is getting smarter and better able to identify different objects and people, but the change you’re most likely to notice is that Memories in iOS 11 will be able to switch from landscape to portrait orientation. But the most impressive new stuff coming to Photos in iOS 11 is all the things you’ll be able to do with Live Photos. You’ll be able to trim and edit Live Photos, pick a different key photo, and create loops. You’ll even be able to reverse the directions of loops if you want a bounce effect. But perhaps the coolest new feature with Live Photos is being able to combine all the frames together to form a long exposure shot. Maps -- As always, Apple’s Maps is playing catchup. Maps in iOS 11 will inform you of speed limits and offer lane guidance — standard features on most standalone GPS units. However, more interesting is that Maps will begin offering indoor maps of large places like malls and airports. Support will be limited to a small number of major cities at first, but that will hopefully grow over time. CarPlay for the Rest of Us -- Even Apple admits that CarPlay hasn’t been widely adopted, so that’s why the most interesting new automotive feature will be available to all iOS 11 devices: Do Not Disturb While Driving. When your iPhone detects, either via Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi Doppler effect, that you are in a car, it will shut off notifications to your phone. You’ll be able to set an auto-reply text message in case anyone messages you, which the sender can break through by stating that the message is urgent. You can also turn off Do Not Disturb While Driving if you’re riding in a car instead of driving. We strongly hope this feature will help cut down on the number of accidents caused by texting and inappropriate iPhone use while driving. HomeKit -- Apple’s home automation platform will gain some more capabilities, but the key thing Apple wanted to discuss is the new AirPlay 2 protocol and its integration with HomeKit. If you have multiple AirPlay 2 enhanced speakers, you’ll be able to use the Home app to broadcast music throughout your house. A number of manufacturers have signed on to produce AirPlay 2-compatible speakers, and we presume Apple’s own HomePod will do so as well. Apple TVs running tvOS will also be able to act as AirPlay 2 receivers. I hope this musical HomeKit integration will let me do things like play a song in response to an event or even sync my lights to music. Apple Music -- Remember Ping? Or Apple Music Connect? Well, Apple just won’t give up on the dream of a social music experience, so Apple Music in iOS 11 will let you see what your friends are listening to. We hope you can turn that feature off; there’s a reason each of Apple’s previous attempts in this area has failed. Apple is also offering developers an API for Apple Music, so developers of apps like Shazam can tie into Apple Music. It will be interesting to see what developers do with that. Behind the Curtain -- WWDC being a developer conference, Apple announced some new technologies that could lead to new, exciting apps. The two most interesting ones for end users are Core ML and ARKit. Core ML is a developer framework to make machine learning readily available to developers. Developers can use it to handle things like face detection and tracking, text detection, object tracking, palm rejection, and barcode scanning. Apple claims that with Core ML, iOS image recognition will be six times faster than with Google’s Pixel phone. ARKit is a framework to help develop apps using augmented reality, which mixes the real and virtual worlds. The example most people are probably familiar with is Pokémon Go, which lets players capture and battle with pocket monsters around the world (see “What the Heck Is Pokémon Go?,” 17 July 2016). Apple even demonstrated how ARKit will make Pokémon Go better by showing that a thrown pokéball will bounce around on a real-life sidewalk. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi also showed how an ARKit app lets him place virtual objects on a table. And Alasdair Coull, head of director Peter Jackson’s Wingnut AR studio, showed off an entire battle overlaid over the auditorium. AR is an interesting technology, but it has yet to find a killer app. Pokémon Go seemed to be the app, but its luster has quickly faded. However, if Apple ever did develop a car, AR could be an essential technology. Where is iOS Going? -- iOS 11 has no marquee feature, but that’s not really a problem. As with many recent iOS releases, iOS 11 instead provides a series of refinements, many of which should improve the user experience in real ways. We’ll be poring over the beta releases in the next few months to find and share the most useful of these changes. If there is one central thread, it’s that of artificial intelligence, as Siri becomes more robust and better integrated throughout iOS and independent apps. It’s clear that, for Apple, this is a year to establish the building blocks necessary for whatever comes next in technology.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Jay  2017-06-06 02:15 DND in car: It's not easy to confirm someone's a driver in a car. You could just as easily be on public transit, air (as long as devices can be on), or even riding in a skyscraper elevator, besides just being a passenger in a car. People will learn to keep DND off. Drivers already have the choice to not respond to texts or calls and check them later. Making it another toggle for DND is no different than silencing the device and putting it away. If it's acceptable for a driver to have messages read aloud by a passenger, or to talk to another person in the car, then it's no appreciable difference to engage in the same activity via carplay or Siri by handsfree device or BT connection. Often enroute messages or calls are received about changes in plans, updates to arrival ETAs, and the like. What IOS devices might do is record video of what's happening in the car at the time of communication, and either interpret that activity (and limit it) or save +/or cloud upload for forensic analysis. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 11:45 The simple fact is that too many people use their iPhones when driving now, despite the fact that there are plenty of ways of NOT using them. So I think it's a very good move on Apple's part to build in an optional technology that could prevent much of this use. We'll see how good it is about detecting actual car use, but connecting to a Bluetooth car system or moving horizontally at car-like speeds should be possible to detect with decent accuracy. And Apple was very clear about how there's an override for passengers, plus a way for people to break through the cone of silence for urgent messages. So I think it's an entirely positive feature, at least based on what we know now. Reply dshelbyd   2017-06-06 12:16 The new feature that stuck me as "killer" from the perspective of iOS productivity is the file manager. I hope that it will provide expanded options to solve the "Where can I put this?" or "Where did it go?" questions. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:23 I really like what I'm hearing so far about iOS 11. Refine things, but don't add to the feature bloat. Focus on adding iPad features that specifically leverage those devices' larger size and their use while improving already sufficient functionality on the iPhone side. This sounds like Snow Leopard for iOS and I really like that. I read elsewhere about the option to use Siri 'silently', i.e. by typing/reading. I would appreciate that a lot as I currently don't want to use (loud) Siri. Can anybody confirm? I enjoyed reading about improvements to Photos too. Any idea if users will get some kind of control over what 'special' albums get displayed? I'm not interested in groupings such as People, Selfies, Screenshots, etc. But iOS 10 offers no way to hide these. Any changes with iOS 11? Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:09 Yes, it appears that you can type to Siri in iOS 11. I'm super excited about that! Not sure about the albums yet. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:36 Thanks, Josh. If you type to Siri, will she also reply silently, i.e. with text on the screen? Reply Robert Morrison  2017-06-06 18:57 The feature is designed as an accessibility feature for people with low or no hearing, so I would assume that the feature supports fully silent use. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 19:20 Great. Thanks, Robert. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:16 (cont.) I think the Maps improvements are awesome. Speed limits and lane guidance are two of the three remaining features I preferred about my expensive GPS app (offline maps being the third). But since I so much prefer Maps' graphics and its audio directions to my GPS app, I've been anxious to switch to Maps for driving full time. Looks like it will finally happen with iOS 11. :) Any idea about other Maps improvements? Trails in national parks for example still seem to be much better represented in Google Maps? Any news if Apple is also improving walking/transit instead of just focusing on roads and driving? Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:10 I would imagine other improvements are happening continuously at the back end. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:21 (cont.) Finally, while I understand where Apple is coming from by disabling old 32 bit apps, it does mean I will lose my beloved encrypted notes storage app Firebox. Can anybody make good suggestions for a secure encrypted notes app? I know Notes offers encryption, but my understanding is these encrypted notes get sync'ed over iCloud and I'd prefer using a totally local encrypted storage on a single device of my own (even if that means no cross-device syncing). I don't trust loading my most secret information up to iCloud - encrypted or not. Especially not these days - FBI, Patriot Act, circumventing privacy rights, etc. (I back up to my Mac too, not iCloud). Reply Josh Centers   2017-06-06 16:10 You can store notes in Notes locally. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 16:39 That's true. But can I mix locally stored notes and iCloud-synced notes? For simple stuff like grocery lists I don't mind syncing to my other devices over iCloud. In fact, I use it a lot. In my notes list, I only see one available iCloud account. Reply Robert Morrison  2017-06-06 19:04 Yes. The "folder" of notes can be on iCloud or on your device. You can't mix messages within a folder, but entire folders are what they are. Also, moving notes between categories with different storage settings have been difficult historically. Try making a new folder and it should ask whether you want it to iCloud sync. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 20:00 Now I see. Thanks! I had to activate the "on my phone" account first in settings. Then I can create notes only on the iPhone. I suspect I can then create an encrypted note on that account to keep it local to the device. Reply gastropod  2017-06-07 18:26 If you store locally, is there any way to get them out as Notes files (packages?), and move them to Notes on a different device? Thanks Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:42 Any idea what kind of iPhone/iPad hardware will be required for HEVC/H.265 hardware encoding support? VLC on iOS can obviously do more formats than those built in to iOS, but you really notice the battery life take a hit when things aren't hardware accelerated. Edit: I just noticed Apple had originally advertised using HEVC on iPhone 6 for FaceTime. Does that indicate an iPhone 6 should be able to do hardware decoding of HEVC material under iOS 11? Reply Minus van Baalen  2017-06-07 05:10 Upgrading or not? This is going to become a dilemma! There are more downsides than andvatages for me it seems (there are quite a few 32-bit apps that I use on a daily basis). What is Apple's policy regarding security updates for older iOSs? Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 10:00 With iOS, Apple hasn't provided security updates for older versions at all, as far as I can remember. So you'll want to upgrade at some point for security reasons. Reply Simon  2017-06-07 17:21 Has there been any indication so far that iOS 11 might allow prioritization for wifi networks like macOS does?

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Thinks Its Smart HomePod Will 'Reinvent' Home Audio By Michael Liedtke and Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: JUNE 06 2017 Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers -- the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. No Place Like HomePod The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual [WWDC] developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Apple vs. the Dry Spell The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad - all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. Macs, Phones and Payments Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Anthony Caruana Jun 7, 2017, 7:30am ⋅ Filed to:  apple Australian Stories developers Share At yesterday's WWDC keynote, Apple announced updates to almost every piece of hardware in their product catalog other than the iPhone and iPad Mini. You'd almost think it was January 2009 at the Macworld Expo, when Apple used to give the keynote and announce new hardware to keep the fan-boys excited. But given WWDC is a developer conference, was there anything announced yesterday for developers other than shiny new computers? It turns out that there was something announced for developers. But with all the hooplah around the new iMac Pro with its "kick ass" Space Gray finish, Kaby Lake updates for almost every computer and the new HomePod it was easy to gloss over some new developer tools. One of the drivers for all that new hardware is support for VR, or virtual reality. At a couple of points during yesterday's keynote, the ability to develop VR based applications and to use VR inside other applications was highlighted. For example, there's enough processor grunt in the new devices to allow a designer to edit spherical video in an augmented reality environment. Apple's update to Metal, their programming interface for taking advantage of GPUs, will now support VR. It was also announced that Valve will be bringing the Steam VR, and Unity and Unreal Engine will be bringing their VR tools to the Mac. iPad developers will also be able to take advantage of drag and drop in their apps (I can't believe I'm writing that drag and drop is a feature in 2017!). And they have finally added a file management system into iOS (another "I can't believe it's a feature moment for me). There wasn't much news about other Apple platforms other than mention of HomeKit working with the new HomePod. Although watchOS is getting a nice spruce up, HealthKit didn't rate a mention. Are you a developer creating software for Apple's platforms? Was yesterday a good day or bad day when it comes to news for Apple developers?

Chris Jager 07 Jun 2017 11:30 AM Foxtel has announced a revamped high-definition video streaming service dubbed Foxtel Now - and it's priced competitively with Stan and Netflix. With subscriptions starting at just $10 per month, it's a far cry from the company's prohibitively expensive Pay TV offerings. (In fact, it's actually cheaper than Netflix's HD tiers which start at $11.99.) But what do you actually get for your ten dollarydoos? Does Foxtel Now include Game Of Thrones? Do you still need to add a bunch of additional packs to make it worthwhile? We take a look at the prices, inclusions and your frequently asked questions. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Apple Thinks Its Smart HomePod Will 'Reinvent' Home Audio By Michael Liedtke and Barbara Ortutay PUBLISHED: JUNE 06 2017 Apple is hoping a new smart home speaker will strike a chord with music lovers -- the latest test of the iPhone maker's ability to redefine markets originally staked out by its rivals. The trend-setting company also is putting new twists on existing products as it delves deeper into virtual reality and a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning. The moves announced Monday escalate Apple's technological battle of wits with Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook. These giants are battling over still-emerging fields that are expected to turn into technological gold mines, much the way personal computers and smartphones became moneymaking machines in previous decades. No Place Like HomePod The "HomePod" speaker unveiled at Apple's annual [WWDC] developers conference is similar to rival devices that have been released during the past two years. Like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the HomePod will play music while also helping people to manage their lives and homes. Siri, a digital assistant that has been on Apple's iPhone since 2011, will be voice activated to respond to requests for information and other help around the house. Unlike those other smart speakers, Apple is positioning the HomePod primarily as a way to listen to and discover new songs and artists. Making the most of it will require a subscription to Apple's own music streaming service, which runs $10 to $15 per month and has attracted 27 million subscribers so far. The company is casting Siri as a music connoisseur that will learn and cater to the tastes of the HomePod's owners, as well as answer questions about the songs as they are played. "It will reinvent home audio," boasted Apple CEO Tim Cook. The speaker will sell for about $350 in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Amazon sells the main version of the Echo for $180; Google's Home speaker goes for $130. The Echo, released in 2015, and Google Home, released last year, were the first entrants in a promising market. The research firm eMarketer says than 35 million people in the U.S. are expected to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, more than double its estimate from last year. Apple vs. the Dry Spell The HomePod is Apple's first new gadget in nearly three years, following its announcement of the Apple Watch in September 2014. Although that product came out after other smartwatches hit the market, it quickly outshone competitors, according to industry research firms. Still, the Apple Watch hasn't been a smash hit, fueling worries that the company's ability to transfix customers had waned after the 2011 death of co-founder Steve Jobs. During Jobs' last decade, Apple introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad - all huge commercial successes that both reshaped daily life and swamped previous digital music players, smartphones and tablets. Analysts said the smart home speaker market is ripe for Apple. The company "can't afford to yield valuable real-estate in the heart of people's homes to Amazon, Google and others," said Geoff Blaber, research analyst at CCS Insight. That's especially important because people are starting to access information, entertainment and search in a more "pervasive" way that's less dependent on smartphones, he said. But it's also possible that the HomePod could expose Siri as less capable than Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana, Blaber said. (Many reviewers have suggested that the current incarnation of Apple's assistant already trails competitors in key respects .) "This is the start of the AI wars," he said. Macs, Phones and Payments Apple had plenty of other announcements. New iMacs released Monday are getting better displays and graphics capabilities. Apple said that makes the Mac a great platform for developing virtual-reality "experiences," although the company didn't announce any consumer VR products. Safari, Apple's web browser, is getting new features aimed at online annoyances. It will block videos that start playing automatically, for instance, and can also prevent ads from following and profiling users. It will not actually block ads, though. Apple also introduced a new version of its business-oriented iPad Pro at an intermediate size with more storage, a better display and an improved camera. It's part of Apple's effort to entice professionals with tablets that can handle many tasks previously reserved for laptops. New features coming to iPhones and iPads, meanwhile, include marginal improvements such as syncing messages to Apple servers in the cloud, saving storage space on phones and tablets. Apple also laid some groundwork for augmented reality, the projection of digital features onto real-world surroundings, by giving app developers tools for incorporating AR into their products. Apple is also bringing the ability to send money to friends or other people through its payment service, Apple Pay. So far, the service has limited payments to purchases of products and services from companies and other organizations. The free software update for mobile devices, iOS 11, is expected in September, when Apple typically releases new iPhones. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Monday's launch was also unusual by Apple standards. The Cupertino tech giant's WWDC is traditionally more focused on its software. As expected, Apple also unveiled new operating systems for its iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV products. But this year, Apple took the opportunity to announce not just a smart speaker, but also a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, a professional-centric iMac Pro all-in-one desktop computer, as well as updated versions of the iMac and MacBook Pro computers. However, the star of the event was the HomePod. With Apple's virtual voice assistant Siri built into it, this smart speaker for homes is in direct competition with voice-activated speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up "Just like with portable music, we want to reinvent home music," said Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook of the HomePod, which can link up to digital tunes from Apple Music, a subscription music streaming service. Like the Echo and Home, Apple's HomePod not only plays music with a voice command, but can also answer users' questions and provide information like news, weather updates and sports scores. And, like the other smart speakers, the HomePod can link up with smart devices in the home, such as connected light bulbs, so a user can control them with a spoken command, like switching them on or off. More than 35 million people in the United States are predicted to use a voice-activated speaker at least once a month this year, according to research firm eMarketer. Mr Frank Gillett, principal analyst at research firm Forrester Research, said: "Home speaker devices have become an important host for virtual assistants like Siri. If Apple had not done this, its customers would embrace Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant." Alexa and Assistant are the digital voice assistants of Amazon and Google, respectively. At around 17.8cm tall, the HomePod is wrapped in a mesh fabric and comes in white and grey. The speaker is powered by an A8 chip - the same chip found in the iPhone 6 - and lets the device learn its position in a room and optimise itself to deliver an immersive music listening experience, according to Apple. "It is the biggest brain inside a speaker," Apple's marketing honcho Phil Schiller said in the WWDC keynote address. The HomePod has seven beam forming tweeters and an upward- facing 10.2cm woofer for improved audio output, said Apple. But at US$349 (S$480) in the US, the HomePod is nearly twice as expensive as the Echo (US$179.99) and three times the price of the Google Home (US$109). While the HomePod's price point, compared with the competition, is a "steep barrier", Mr Gillett noted that Apple has put a much more robust processor in the device. "They seem to be using it to drive superior user experience, sound quality and privacy," he said. Both the Echo and Home are not available in Singapore, and the HomePod will not be coming to the Republic any time soon as well. The HomePod will be available only from December starting in the US, Britain and Australia, before reaching the rest of the world next year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been under pressure for letting its Mac computer lineup fall seriously behind the competition. When the company did finally update its MacBook Pro laptops, it faced complaints from creative professionals over decisions like ditching legacy ports for USB-C and adding the costly OLED Touch Bar. Source: Apple At WWDC, Tim Cook & Co. announced a new iMac lineup with updated CPUs, better displays and enhanced graphics capabilities. The company also kept its promise for an iMac Pro, unveiling the most powerful Mac ever released — stuffed inside a space gray iMac enclosure. New iMac Models Aimed at Consumers Apple didn’t change the look of the new iMac lineup, but its iconic all-in-one PC is thoroughly improved to take on modern tasks like virtual reality. Virtually every component has been upgraded, led by the move to 7th generation Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) “Kaby Lake” processors. Graphics and storage are faster, the display is brighter and the new iMac models support double the RAM. For power users, new 4K iMacs get discrete Radeon Pro video cards from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The high-end 27-inch 5K model is equipped with a Radeon Pro 580 with 8GB of RAM — enough horsepower for VR content creation. All new iMacs also get a pair of new USB-C ports, but Apple is not repeating its MacBook Pro mistake — legacy ports including USB 3.0 remain, so dongles are not needed to use existing peripherals. Key Improvements for New iMac 7th generation “Kaby Lake” Intel Core CPUs Retina displays 40% brighter than previous generation, support for 1 billion colors Double the RAM support (up to 32GB on 21.5-inch models, 64GB on 27-inch) Fusion hybrid drive standard on all 27-inch models, optional SSD storage is twice as fast as previous generation Graphics performance 80% faster than previous generation Dual USB-C Thunderbolt ports, plus four USB 3.0 ports, SD card slot and Ethernet remain iMac starts at $1099, 4K iMac at $1299 and 27-inch 5K iMac at $1799 New iMac Pro Meant to Silence Critics The real star of the new iMac lineup is a beast of an all-in-one that won’t be available until December. In April, Apple executives met with the press in a rare session where they apologized for misreading the needs of their professional users. As part of that session, a new Mac Pro was promised for 2018, along with an all-new model called the iMac Pro for late 2017. Apple kept its promise, showing off the new iMac Pro at WWDC 2017. The iMac Pro is a 27-inch iMac, clad in dark space grey instead of the usual silver aluminum. It’s packed with desktop workstation-class components and a new cooling system to keep the heat down.

Elyse Betters6 June 2017Laptops Apple Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple has announced a new version of MacOS. But can your Mac run it? While at its mostly-annual developers conference in San Jose, Apple showed off MacOS High Sierra, a major update to the MacOS Sierra operating system announced last year. Apple tends to update the software powering its Macs every year, and 2017 is no different. Except, instead of unveiling an all-new version with its own name, Apple announced it simply chose to refine and perfect Sierra. So, with that, we get High Sierra. And Apple has some good news for those of us who own older Macs. Unlike some of Apple's other major software updates, the new release of MacOS will support older hardware. That is, it will run on any Mac that currently runs Sierra. Last year, Sierra dropped support for several 2007, 2008, and 2009-era Macs, so it's welcomed news to hear that's not the case again. Here's everything you need to know about High Sierra, including the full list of supported machines. Apple iOS 11: 11 new features coming to your iPhone and iPad Apple WWDC 2017: All the announcements that matter What is MacOS High Sierra? On 5 June, Apple previewed the next version of MacOS. It's called High Sierra. Many of the new features include behind-the-scene updates that will make your Mac seem faster and more secure. For instance, the new OS will allow for virtual reality and augment reality content. Safari also got a number of improvements, including the ability block autoplay videos and stop advertisers from tracking you. Apple's iCloud service will also now remember your messages, among other things. Check out Pocket-lint's High Sierra piece for more information. The software is now available for developers and will be released to the public this autumn. It'll be free to download and use. Which Macs will run MacOS High Sierra? Here is the official list of supported hardware: MacBook: Late 2009 or later iMac/iMac Pro:Late 2009 or later MacBook Air: 2010 or later MacBook Pro: 2010 or later Mac mini: 2010 or later Mac Pro: 2010 or later In other words, anything made more than seven years ago is obsolete and will no longer be supported. Anything else you need to know? Not all features in MacOS High Sierra will work on older hardware. For instance, 4K HEVC content will need a Mac with a sixth‑generation Intel Core processor or newer. We'll keep you posted when we learn about other exceptions. When can you get MacOS High Sierra? A beta of macOS High Sierra is available now for developers. A public beta will be available in late June. Sign up here if you'd like to join and test out the latest features. The finished, consumer version of MacOS High Sierra is due to roll out sometime this autumn.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam    Apple Goes Long On Augmented Reality Ian Henderson 5:16 PM 06/06/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP At the latest Worldwide Developers Conference held in San Jose, California, Apple revealed that it is betting big on augmented reality (AR), the nascent field of technology that uses the latest advances in camera and graphics technology to integrate the digital world into the real world. Several top players in the tech industry are looking toward the AR industry as the next big platform in a post-smartphone world, and with its release of ARKit, software that makes it easier for app developers to create AR apps (think Pokémon GO), Apple took a large lead in this emerging field. CEO Tim Cook has expressed notable interest in the field, dubbing it “extremely interesting” and referring to it as “something we’re doing a lot of things on behind [the] curtain.” Cook mentioned that Apple has been investing considerably in both virtual and augmented reality and that the tech giant remains committed to the field’s development “for the long run” as he believes that it is” a great commercial opportunity.” Over the past year, Apple has executed a number of acquisitions of virtual and augmented reality companies, substantiating his remarks. The company hopes that the development of the AR market will help combat shrinking iPhone sales, as the company reported declining sales of the world’s most popular smartphone for the second straight quarter.

Story continues below This fall’s release of iOS 11 will not support the iPhone 5 or 5C, any iPhone 4 models, nor the fourth-generation iPad. Without the new operating system, the devices will not be eligible for the latest software and security updates, leaving phones vulnerable to glitches and hacks.

But just in time, Apple will also be releasing its newest model, the iPhone 8, as the new operating system phases out the older models. This isn’t the first time older devices have been left behind by iOS updates. The iPhone 3G got stuck with iOS 4. First generation iPads and the iPhone 4 were last compatible with iOS 7. The iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 will be stuck with iOS 9. The new iOS brings with it some fun new features. Shutterbugs will have the ability to create Boomerang-style “live photos,” and more image filters at their fingertips. Apple’s built-in AI assistant Siri will be “more helpful,” with a more “natural” voice. Siri’s new features include being able to translate words and phrases into other languages and the ability to use your recent web searches — for say, songs or movies — to auto-fill your typing.

The new iPhone 7s won’t have one of the iPhone 8’s best new features Chris Smith @chris_writes June 6th, 2017 at 4:18 PM Share Tweet Apple will launch three new iPhones this year, including the redesigned iPhone 8 and “S” versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 8 is expected to introduce a few exciting new features, like an all-screen design, a fingerprint sensor placed under the glass, and an even faster 10nm A-series processor. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7s models are expected to retain the same basic design of their predecessors, including the old home button. Now, multiple independent reports say the more “boring” 2017 iPhones will be missing another key iPhone 8 feature. Don't Miss: iOS 11 is hiding two game-changing new iPhone features Foxconn employees took to Reddit over the weekend to share various details about Apple’s upcoming products, including the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, the HomePod speaker and Apple’s AR glasses. Some of those predictions already turned out to be accurate — Apple on Monday unveiled exactly the iMac Pro design that Foxconn employees described — while others have proved to be false. The leakers have now said the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will not be made of glass, and instead have metal enclosures just like their predecessors. They said the phones will have aluminum unibody designs, and they will not support wireless charging. One of the reasons for making the iPhone 8 back out of glass is to enable wireless charging. The leakers did say the iPhone 8, which they refer to as iPhone X, will have a glass body. A new report from Digitimes on Tuesday reinforced this idea. The iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s will likely have aluminum shells, the report suggests. Specifically, Catcher has supposedly been awarded the contract for two of the new iPhones set to launch in the second half of the year, which should help with its bottom line during the period. Aluminum cases will not work with wireless charging, so you’ll have to buy the more expensive iPhone 8 for that feature. At least if these reports pan out, we’ll get to hear Jony Ive say the word “aluminum” for one more year.

We've gone through the document and highlighted the differences for you below... CHANGED in Introduction (Old) If your app looks like it was cobbled together in a few days, or you're trying to get your first practice app into the store to impress your friends, please brace yourself for rejection. We have lots of serious developers who don't want their quality apps to be surrounded by amateur hour. (New) The App Store is a great way to reach hundreds of millions of people around the world. If you build an app that you just want to show to family and friends, the App Store isn’t the best way to do that. Consider Ad Hoc distribution or the Enterprise Program. If you’re just getting started, learn more about the Apple Developer Program . ADDED to Before You Submit If your app no longer functions as intended or you’re no longer actively supporting it, it will be removed from the App Store. Learn More about App Store Improvements . ADDED 1.1.7 to 1.1 Objectionable Content 1.1.7 App Store Reviews: ● App Store customer reviews can be an integral part of the app experience, so you should treat customers with respect when responding to their comments. Keep your responses targeted to the user’s comments and do not include personal information, spam, or marketing in your response. ● Use the provided API to prompt users to review your app; this functionality allows customers to provide an App Store rating and review without the inconvenience of leaving your app, and we will disallow custom review prompts. ADDED to Section 1.4.1 in 1.4 Physical Harm ● Apps must clearly disclose data and methodology to support accuracy claims relating to health measurements, and if the level of accuracy or methodology cannot be validated, we will reject your app. For example, apps that claim to take x-rays, measure blood pressure, body temperature, blood glucose levels, or blood oxygen levels using only the sensors on the device are not permitted. ● Apps should remind users to check with a doctor in addition to using the app and before making medical decisions. CHANGED 1.4.3 in 1.4 Physical Harm (Old) 1.4.3 Apps should not encourage illegal or excessive consumption of drugs or alcohol; or encourage minors to consume drugs, alcohol, or tobacco; and facilitating the sale of marijuana isn’t allowed. (New) 1.4.3 Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed. CHANGED 1.4.5 in 1.4 Physical Harm (Old) 1.4.5 Apps should not urge customers to use their devices in a way that contradicts safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or physical harm to people. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging. Review device documentation . (New) 1.4.5 Apps should not urge customers to use their devices in a way that contradicts safety documentation for Apple hardware, risking damage to the device or physical harm to people. For example, apps should not encourage placing the device under a mattress or pillow while charging or perform excessive write cycles to the solid state drive. Review device documentation . ADDED to 2.3.2 in 2.3 Accurate Metadata If you decide to promote in-app purchases on the App Store, ensure that the IAP Display Name and Description are written for a public audience and that your app properly handles the Purchase Intent API so that customers can seamlessly complete the purchase when your app launches. CHANGED 2.3.3 in 2.3 Accurate Metadata (Old) 2.3.3 Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in page, or splash screen. (New) 2.3.3 Screenshots should show the app in use, and not merely the title art, log-in page, or splash screen. They may also include text overlays and show extended functionality on device, such as Touch Bar. CHANGED 2.3.7 in 2.3 Accurate Metadata (Old) 2.3.7 Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 50 characters and should not include terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time. (New) 2.3.7 Choose a unique app name, assign keywords that accurately describe your app, and don’t try to pack any of your metadata with trademarked terms, popular app names, or other irrelevant phrases just to game the system. App names must be limited to 30 characters and should not include prices, terms, or descriptions that are not the name of the app. App subtitles are a great way to provide additional context for your app; they must follow our standard metadata rules and should not include inappropriate content, reference other apps, or make unverifiable product claims. Apple may modify inappropriate keywords at any time. CHANGED 2.3.8 in 2.3 Accurate Metadata (Old) 2.3.8 Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion. (New) 2.3.8 Metadata should be appropriate for all audiences, so make sure your app and in-app purchase icons, screenshots, and previews adhere to a 4+ age rating even if your app is rated higher. For example, if your app is a game that includes violence, select images that don’t depict a gruesome death or a gun pointed at a specific character. Use of terms like “For Kids” and “For Children” in app names is reserved for the Kids Category. Remember to ensure your metadata, including app name and icons (small, large, Apple Watch app, etc.), are similar to avoid creating confusion. CHANGED 2.5.1 in 2.5 Software Requirements (Old) 2.5.1 Apps may only use public APIs. Learn more about public APIs .

Keep your apps up-to-date and make sure you phase out any deprecated features, frameworks or technologies that will no longer be supported in future versions of an OS. CHANGED 2.5.2 in 2.5 Software Requirements (Old) 2.5.2 Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code, including other iOS, watchOS, macOS, or tvOS apps. (New) 2.5.2 Apps should be self-contained in their bundles, and may not read or write data outside the designated container area, nor may they download, install, or execute code, including other apps. Apps designed to teach, develop, or test executable code may, in limited circumstances, download code provided that such code is not used for other purposes. Such apps must make the source code provided by the Application completely viewable and editable by the user. CHANGED 2.5.9 in 2.5 Software Requirements (Old) 2.5.9 Apps that alter the functions of standard switches, such as the Volume Up/Down and Ring/Silent switches, or other native user interface elements or behaviors will be rejected. (New) 2.5.9 Apps that alter or disable the functions of standard switches, such as the Volume Up/Down and Ring/Silent switches, or other native user interface elements or behaviors will be rejected. For example, apps should not block links out to other apps or other features that users would expect to work a certain way. Learn more about proper handling of links . CHANGED 2.5.11(ii) in 2.5 Software Requirements (Old) Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for. (New) Ensure that the vocabulary and phrases in your plist pertains to your app and the SiriKit functionality of the intents the app has registered for. Aliases must relate directly to your app or company name and should not be generic terms or include third party app names or services. ADDED 2.5.12 in 2.5 Software Requirements 2.5.12 Apps using CallKit or including an SMS Fraud Extension should only block phone numbers that are confirmed spam. Apps that include call-, SMS-, and MMS- blocking functionality or spam identification must clearly identify these features in their marketing text and explain the criteria for their blocked and spam lists. You may not use the data accessed via these tools for any purpose not directly related to operating or improving your app or extension (e.g. you may not use, share, or sell it for tracking purposes, creating user profiles, etc.) CHANGED 3.1.1 In-App Purchase in 3.1 Payments (Old) If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP. (New) If you want to unlock features or functionality within your app, (by way of example: subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use in-app purchase. Apps may use in-app purchase currencies to enable customers to “tip” digital content providers in the app. Apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than IAP. (Old) Any credits or in-game currencies purchased via IAP must be consumed within the app and may not expire, and you should make sure you have a restore mechanism for any restorable in-app purchases. (New) Any credits or in-game currencies purchased via IAP may not expire, and you should make sure you have a restore mechanism for any restorable in-app purchases. CHANGED 3.1.2(a) Subscriptions in 3.1 Payments (Old) 3.1.2(a) Permissible uses: If you offer an auto-renewing subscription, you must provide ongoing value to the customer. While the following list is not exhaustive, examples of appropriate subscriptions include: new game levels; episodic content; multi-player support; apps that offer consistent, substantive updates; access to large collections of, or continually updated, media content; software as a service (“SAAS”); and cloud support.

CHANGED 3.1.3 in 3.1 Payments (Old) 3.1.3 Content-based “Reader” Apps: Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as educational apps that manage student grades and schedules), provided the app does not direct users to a purchasing mechanism other than IAP. (New) 3.1.3 “Reader” Apps: Apps may allow a user to access previously purchased content or content subscriptions (specifically: magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, video, access to professional databases, VoIP, cloud storage, and approved services such as educational apps that manage student grades and schedules), as well as consumable items in multi-platform games, provided that you agree not to directly or indirectly target iOS users to use a purchasing method other than IAP, and your general communications about other purchasing methods are not designed to discourage use of IAP. CHANGED 3.2.1 Acceptable (vi) in 3.2 Other Business Model Issues (Old) Approved nonprofits may fundraise directly within their own apps using Apple Pay, provided those fundraising campaigns adhere to all App Review Guidelines.

Additional information shall be provided to App Review upon request. Nonprofit platforms that connect donors to other nonprofits must ensure that every nonprofit listed in the app has also gone through the nonprofit approval process. Learn more about becoming an approved nonprofit . CHANGED 3.2.2 Unacceptable (iv) in 3.2 Other Business Model Issues (Old) Unless you are an approved nonprofit , collecting funds within the app for charities and fundraisers. Apps that seek to raise money for such causes must be free on the App Store and may only collect funds outside of the app, such as via Safari or SMS. (New) Unless you are an approved nonprofit or otherwise permitted under Section 3.2.1 (vi) above, collecting funds within the app for charities and fundraisers. Apps that seek to raise money for such causes must be free on the App Store and may only collect funds outside of the app, such as via Safari or SMS. CHANGED 3.2.2 Unacceptable (vi) in 3.2 Other Business Model Issues (Old) Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not force users to rate the app, review the app, download other apps, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, or use of the app. (New) Apps should allow a user to get what they’ve paid for without performing additional tasks, such as posting on social media, uploading contacts, checking in to the app a certain number of times, etc. Apps should not require users to rate the app, review the app, watch videos, download other apps, tap on advertisements, or take other similar actions in order to access functionality, content, use the app, or receive monetary or other compensation.

Moreover, your app may not require payment or indirectly monetize access to the Apple Music service (e.g. in-app purchase, advertising, requesting user info). (New) 4.5.2 Apple Music (i) The MusicKit APIs let customers access their subscription while using your app. They are intended for simple music playback by Apple Music subscribers. Users must initiate the playback of an Apple Music stream and be able to navigate using standard media controls such as “play,” “pause,” and “skip.” Moreover, your app may not require payment or indirectly monetize access to the Apple Music service (e.g. in-app purchase, advertising, requesting user info, etc.). Do not download, upload, or enable sharing of music files sourced from the MusicKit APIs, except as explicitly permitted in MusicKit documentation. (ii) Using the MusicKit APIs is not a replacement for securing the licenses you might need for a deeper or more complex music integration. For example, if you want your app to play a specific song at a particular moment, or to create audio or video files that can be shared to social media, you’ll need to contact rights-holders directly to get their permission (e.g. synchronization or adaptation rights) and assets. Cover art and other metadata may only be used in connection with music playback or playlists (including App Store screenshots displaying your app’s functionality), and should not be used in any marketing or advertising without getting specific authorization from rights-holders. Make sure to follow the Apple Music Identity Guidelines when integrating Apple Music services in your app. (iii) Apps that access Apple Music user data, such as playlists and favorites, must clearly disclose this access in the purpose string. Any data collected may not be shared with third parties for any purpose other than supporting or improving the app experience. This data may not be used to identify users or devices, or to target advertising. ADDED 4.6 4.6 Alternate App Icons Apps may display customized icons, for example, to reflect a sports team preference, provided that each change is initiated by the user and the app includes settings to revert to the original icon. All icon variants must relate to the content of the app and changes should be consistent across all system assets, so that the icons displayed in Settings, Notifications, etc. match the new springboard icon. This feature may not be used for dynamic, automatic, or serial changes, such as to reflect up-to-date weather information, calendar notifications, etc. ADDED 4.7 4.7 Third-Party Software Apps may contain or run code provided by third party developers (e.g. HTML5-based games), as long as the code is not offered in a store or store-like interface, and provided that the software (1) is free or purchased using in-app purchase; (2) only uses capabilities available in a standard WebKit view; your app must use WebKit and JavaScript Core to run third party software and should not attempt to extend or expose native platform APIs to third party software; (3) is offered by developers that have joined the Apple Developer Program and signed the Apple Developer Program License Agreement; and (4) adheres to the terms of these App Review Guidelines (e.g. does not include objectionable content; uses IAP to unlock features and functionality). You must provide an index of third party software and metadata available in your app upon request. CHANGED 5.1.1 Data Collection and Storage (i) in 5.1 Privacy (Old) Apps that collect user or usage data must have a privacy policy and secure user consent for the collection. This includes—but isn’t limited to—apps that implement HealthKit or other health/medical technologies, HomeKit, Keyboard extensions, Apple Pay, Stickers and iMessage extensions, include a login, or access user data from the device (e.g. location, contacts, calendar, etc.). (New) Apps that collect user or usage data must have a privacy policy and secure user consent for the collection. This includes—but isn’t limited to—apps that implement HealthKit or other health/medical technologies, HomeKit, Keyboard extensions, Apple Pay, Stickers and iMessage extensions, include a login, or access user data from the device. Your app description should let people know what types of access (e.g. location, contacts, calendar, etc.) are requested by your app, and what aspects of the app won’t work if the user doesn’t grant permission. CHANGED 5.1.2 Data Use and Sharing (i) in 5.1 Privacy (Old) Apps cannot use or transmit someone’s personal data without first obtaining their permission and providing access to information about how and where the data will be used.

Apple’s new Apple Pencil Case The Apple Pencil Case is a leather sleeve that protects your Apple Pencil when you aren’t using it. You can choose from four colors: Saddle Brown, Taupe, Midnight Blue, and Black. Instant gratification fans, however, won’t be happy. The earliest you can get one is June 14th if you order from Apple’s web site, and they won’t be in the company’s retail stores until June 19th. The Apple Pencil Case is priced at US$29.

I tried a couple of options for “clips” but eventually settled on this folio design from STM with a pencil “slot” which: protects the iPad, can be used as a stand, holds the Apple Pencil securely in transit, allows the Apple Pencil to sit on top the slot while using the iPad such that it doesn’t roll off the desk, and… the slot is positioned such that the cap is held in the slot by the iPad magnets while the pencil is charging. https://www.stmgoods.com/atlas-ipad-pro-case June 7, 2017 at 11:32 EDT PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

John Martellaro @jmartellaro 6 minute read Jun 6th, 2017 3:26 PM EDT | Analysis At the WWDC 2017 keynote, Apple gave us a sneak peak of the new iMac Pro, but now what does this all mean for the design of the next Mac Pro? iMac Pro. Image credit: Apple. It’s likely that the drop-dead gorgeous new iMac Pro that Apple revealed in the WWDC keynote was originally intended to replace the 2013 Mac Pro. That fits with Apple’s recent decision to get out of the display business and focus on the iMac Pro as its flagship for professionals. But the professional community of Apple customers begged to differ. They wanted a clearer commitment in terms of expandability, more RAM, more horsepower than an Intel Core i7, higher end graphics, and the ability to add their own displays. That’s been a heated subject from October 2016, when a new Mac Pro wasn’t announced until this year’s WWDC. Now that we’ve had a sneak peek at the glorious new iMac Pro, what are the implications for the future Mac Pro that Apple has committed to? What will it cost? Will it go beyond the limits of the iMac Pro? Or will it be an equivalent system, but simply headless? How does Apple see the new Mac Pro fitting into the lineup and into the professionals thinking? To get a handle on this, I asked several noted corporate professionals to tell me what they thought of the iMac Pro. Implicit in that is the notion of how that iMac Pro will inform the design of the future Mac Pro. Most of the feedback below also addresses that. At the end, I sum it all up. The Professional Responses Neal Pann, an architect with Dahlin Group Architects Planners wrote me: It’s about time that Apple focuses again on the pro market and that includes the market for BIM (Building Information Modeling) modeling and VR. The new iMac Pro begins to address the needs of that user and keeps macOS in the conversation as at least an option. It’s going to force the application developers of CAD/BIM  programs to push their own software to take advantage of the new hardware in ways that they haven’t been able to do before on the Mac platform. [One] concern I have is the lack of support for Nvidia graphics with the new iMac Pro. There are a number of high end graphics applications for rendering and modeling that require Nvidia’s CUDA architecture and not having the option to support that in the upcoming iMac Pro is a deal killer for some. Rick Allen with Globeflex Capital, L.P. said: I am very intrigued and want to try first hand. My first thought was “This was the new Mac Pro.” The mea culpa meeting with the five journalists was a damage control move. I have a couple of issues with the machine. First is no user replaceable parts. Even though the RAM is in sockets, ATP podcast confirmed there is no door to get at it and so makes it very hard to get 3rd party ram upgrades…. Another question is the issue of Heat dissipation. 8 to 18 core Xeon processors are big and have greater TDP than [Core] i7 processors. I hope the cooling solution in that very slim case is up to the task. I hope that it’s not another “thermal corner” as was mentioned with the current Mac Pro. On the GPU front, Radeon Vega architecture is looking very promising. Yet a lot of professionals want CUDA support from nVidia. The now allowed external Thunderbolt 3 enclosures would help with this. nVidia recently released CUDA drivers for Pascal series cards so you could put a GTX 1080TI or Titan Xp in an external enclosure, yet I am puzzled why Apple and nVidia are seeming at odds these days. They used to work together. Anthony Frausto-Robledo, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of Architosh wrote: I am very impressed with what I see thus far. This shows real commitment to Apple’s pro Mac customers and this machine is a beast for an all-in-one. I’m almost scared of what Apple has plans for in the new modular Mac Pro they said they are committed to bringing to the market sometime in 2018 or later. Clearly, the VR news is also extremely exciting and will make Mac based architects elated! Next page: More expert feedback. The different kinds of pro users.

I only hope that Apple goes back to what I consider a Pro machine. User replaceable and upgrade-able parts are a must. I seriously love the iMac pro from a design perspective. I hope they come through with the new Mac Pro redesign in a big way. June 6, 2017 at 3:38 EDT PM vpndev June 6, 2017 John, maybe you could fix the “front wench” typo before somebody calls you out for being sexist 🙂 June 6, 2017 at 4:07 EDT PM John Martellaro June 6, 2017 vpndev: Fixed! June 6, 2017 at 4:31 EDT PM pjs_boston June 6, 2017 Hey John, Great article! I agree with all of your points. My take is that the new iMac Pro will satisfy 99% of technical and creative pros who use a Mac. The remaining 1% is split between two camps: One is a small, very vocal group of Apple enthusiasts who want a Mac that they can tinker with and turn into their own personal hot rod. The second even smaller group are those professionals who truly need to crack the case and add buss level expansion cards to for specific applications. The second group is ever shrinking as Thunderbolt 3 enables new external expansion possibilities. As such, the new Mac Pro is like a super car. It will be a ‘halo’ product to keep the enthusiasts singing Apple’s praises. It will exist primarily for brand management. June 6, 2017 at 4:57 EDT PM mrmwebmax June 6, 2017 + John, Excellent article as always. As a professional in the web development and graphic design fields, I always opted for a Mac tower and loved the G4’s pull-down side latch for access to all of the internals. It was great for replacing a blown hard drive, adding more RAM, and other tinkering. Then I got an early 2008 iMac, fully-loaded with 3.06GHz Intel Core Dup, 4 GB RAM, and a decent-sized hard drive. I am still using it today, albeit with twin 3 TB LaCie external FireWire 800 drives to take the place of my long-since blown internal drive. It is without a doubt the best Mac I have ever owned, and after nine years of serious service, the best value by far as well. That brings me to the iMac Pro. I agree that many creatives — like myself — are looking for a Mac that gets out of the way, that doesn’t need tinkered with, that just works. In that respect the iMac Pro is my ultimate dream machine. I’d love to see it chew through a Cinema 4D rendering, and can’t help but wonder how many years of useful service such a machine would bring to my work. For a smaller minority of pros, yes, only a tower with swappable graphics cards, memory, storage, etc., will do, but I believe that the pool of such users is indeed shrinking over time. That said, as pjs_boston wrote, the new Mac Pro can be a halo product for the entire Mac line. Like the Corvette in the window enticing Chevy Cruise buyers into the dealership, it should be the latest and greatest computer of them all, a niche machine to serve that special niche of users who need the best of the best, including upgradeability and configurability. For most of the rest of us creative professionals, though, the new dream machine is definitely the new iMac Pro. Just plug it in, turn it on, and get to work. Time to start saving my pennies…. June 6, 2017 at 6:24 EDT PM GraphicMac June 6, 2017 The only thing about the iMac Pro that makes me shake my head is the obvious lack of a “door” to upgrade the RAM. But even at that, anyone that can afford a $5,000 STARTING price, probably is in a position to not care that Apple charges a high premium for the RAM upgrades and will happily pay for it.

It’s a way to directly contact business via iMessage, and it will be fully baked into the system. Here’s what we know so far. Business Chat Business Chat will be introduced this Friday in a WWDC session, so right now we just know basic information. It will work across Apple’s devices like iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch, but not the Mac. Apple customers can start a conversation with a business from Safari, Maps, Spotlight, and Siri. Apple’s example of a customer interaction in iMessage. Competing platforms like Facebook and Twitter are already doing something similar. Facebook rolled out Messenger bots that businesses can have, along with its new M assistant. Twitter has new customer service tools like custom profiles, quick replies and its own chat bots. Details Instead of looking up a business on Google and getting contact information there, Apple seems like it wants to slowly wean you off of the search giant. Business Chat will be fully integrated with Apple Pay, Calendar and iMessage. In the example Apple provided, you could ask a business for help in buying a product in iMessage, then use Apple Pay to buy it. We’ll add to this article on Friday to address anything else Apple announces.

Tim Cook armstronged him Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company has helped UK officials investigate terror attacks, while reiterating his dismay over US plans to quit the Paris agreement on climate change.   "We have been cooperating with the UK government not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks," Cook said during a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday. "I cannot speak on detail on that. But in cases when we have information and they have gone through the lawful process we don’t just give it but we do it very promptly."   A third attack in the UK in less than three months has put more pressure on technology companies to prevent their products and services from being used by violent extremists. Cook didn’t specify which attacks led to the company’s cooperation. Apple’s high privacy standards and tough encryption have been criticised by law enforcement officials and the company clashed last year in court with the FBI over the issue.   Cook said on Monday that Apple’s encryption is misunderstood. "It doesn’t mean no information. Metadata exists and that’s very important for building a profile," he added. "The reality is that cyberattacks on people and governments, these affect your safety and security." Cook also said he didn’t join any of US President Donald Trump’s business advisory councils because he thinks those groups aren’t "terribly productive."  “It wasn’t about not wanting to advise on something that we thought should be heard,” he added. Cook said he will continue to advise the president on matters that are important to him and the US, such as the Paris climate accord. Trump decided last week to pull the US out of the pact.   “He didn’t decide what I wanted him to decide,” Cook said of the president. “He decided wrong. It’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided.” Cook spoke after Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, where the company unveiled a new internet-connected speaker called HomePod and updated its Siri digital assistant to wed users more tightly to its growing slate of products and services.   Apple also rolled out augmented reality tools for developers, and showed off new AR features that use iPhone cameras. This technology superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world.   "The area I’m personally excited about is AR," Cook said. "This is profound. As we get the developer release out we’ll be the largest AR platform in the world."   The new iPhone, due later this year, is expected to have several new AR features, while people familiar with the situation have told Bloomberg that the Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses that may use AR.   Cook said smartphone growth and innovation are "in the early stages."   "The things that drive quantum leaps is core technology. When I think of all the things that are going to change I think we’re just getting started," he added.

When I think of all the things that are going to change I think we’re just getting started," he added. Bloomberg Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Apple helped UK investigate terrorist attacks, says Tim Cook 'We have been cooperating with UK govt on some attacks besides law enforcement matters', he added Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company has helped UK officials investigate terror attacks, while reiterating his dismay over US plans to quit the Paris agreement on climate change.   "We have been cooperating with the UK government not only in law enforcement kind of matters but on some of the attacks," Cook said during a Bloomberg Television interview on Monday. "I cannot speak on detail on that. But in cases when we have information and they have gone through the lawful process we don’t just give it but we do it very promptly."   A third attack in the UK in less than three months has put more pressure on technology companies to prevent their products and services from being used by violent extremists. Cook didn’t specify which attacks led to the company’s cooperation. Apple’s high privacy standards and tough encryption have been criticised by law enforcement officials and the company clashed last year in court with the FBI over the issue.   Cook said on Monday that Apple’s encryption is misunderstood. "It doesn’t mean no information. Metadata exists and that’s very important for building a profile," he added. "The reality is that cyberattacks on people and governments, these affect your safety and security." Cook also said he didn’t join any of US President Donald Trump’s business advisory councils because he thinks those groups aren’t "terribly productive."  “It wasn’t about not wanting to advise on something that we thought should be heard,” he added. Cook said he will continue to advise the president on matters that are important to him and the US, such as the Paris climate accord. Trump decided last week to pull the US out of the pact.   “He didn’t decide what I wanted him to decide,” Cook said of the president. “He decided wrong. It’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided.” Cook spoke after Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, where the company unveiled a new internet-connected speaker called HomePod and updated its Siri digital assistant to wed users more tightly to its growing slate of products and services.   Apple also rolled out augmented reality tools for developers, and showed off new AR features that use iPhone cameras.

Vishal Mathur Apple Watch. Artificial intelligence is the buzzword with almost all things tech these days. And Apple is also getting its say in the matter. It was Apple that started the entire virtual digital assistant craze with the Siri on iPhone, many years ago. But while Siri improved incrementally, it was overtaken by rivals such as Google’s Assistant, and faces competition from Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana too. It isn’t to say that any one of these is the definite winner just yet—in fact, far from it—but the battlelines have been redrawn. Apple is now using machine learning more than ever before. Be it on the Apple Watch faces, photos for face recognition and more. Developers will get a new set of APIs (application programming interface) to be able to integrate these in their apps. It really is game on now. Apple says as many as 375 million iOS devices use Siri every month, globally. Once iOS 11 rolls out and you install it on your iPhone or iPad, the virtual assistant Siri will leverage the power of deep learning techniques, to add new features to its offerings and learn user preferences constantly. In fact, whatever it learns on one device will also be synced to all other Apple devices that you may own, so that the same experience is available across. There will now also be multiple suggestions to your queries, to better suit the kind of personality sketch Siri draws up about you over time. It is not just the phones and the tablets. Siri will leverage the same AI learnings and capabilities to work on the HomePod smart speaker. The ability to talk to you and respond, the ability to curate an Apple Music playlist for you, and the positional awareness to modify sound output, all come from different types of machine learning and AI techniques. All iPhones and iPads running iOS 11 will also get the refreshed Photos app, with machine learning to identify events, memories and more. The use of artificial intelligence, particularly for sorting photos based on time and date and even events is something that will be the most used AI prowess, for most consumers—who would mind the magic of having a friend’s birthday party pictures getting sorted automatically, without the Photos app having any context or data provided by the user? AI will also allow users to do new visual tricks with Live Photos that they click, including a long exposure blur effect or a bounce effect clip. It is a fact that iOS 11 will be integrating AI deeper within multiple apps and facets of the software, more than ever before. It is not about one app, but smarts that are spread across multiple apps that users tend to access regularly.

On Tuesday, Uber announced it had hired Bozoma Saint John, the head of consumer marketing for Apple Music, who stole the show at Apple's developers conference last year, as its chief brand officer. Saint John has the hard task of turning Uber into a brand that people love as much as Apple. "Quite frankly, what has happened in the past is nothing that I can control, but I do think there is a real opportunity for the future of Uber and what the vision is going to be," Saint John told Business Insider in an interview on Tuesday morning. "Having a real seat at the table to be able to do that is really important at this moment in time." Saint John's success Saint John is a marquee hire for a company that has struggled to tell its story and has landed in a mountain of trouble as a result. In January, more than 200,000 customers deleted their accounts after public backlash over its actions during a taxi strike in New York related to President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration. Many of those customers turned to Lyft, Uber's main rival in the US, which they saw as friendlier. When asked what she thought the Uber brand is today, Saint John said there wasn't one. "It's a magical product," Saint John said. "People love to use it." That isn't the same, though, as knowing the story of the company and what it stands for — that's what Saint John is tasked with telling. She said one of the most powerful parts of Uber's story was the people and drivers who are the soul of the company. Part of her job will also be to represent the company — an image refresh the company could need, given that Fortune magazine's latest cover features a quote from Uber's CEO saying he isn't an "a--hole." "It's grown so quickly in such a short amount of time — and leadership and others have been so focused on growing the business — that this very moment is about changing the image of Uber and crafting what that brand story is," Saint John said. "That hasn't been done yet."

Saint John was global consumer marketing head at Apple Music and iTunes. Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 4:14 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Uber snags chief brand officer from Apple Music    Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 4:49 PM ET | 01:18 Bozoma Saint John — an Apple executive who has played a prominent role in recent product launches — is leaving Apple to become chief brand officer at Uber. "Boz has a long track record of successfully creating emotional connections between people and the products they love," Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a statement to CNBC. "Her creativity and deep understanding of consumers will allow us to build the same love and appreciation for Uber's brand as we've built for Uber's service." TechCrunch previously reported Saint John's move to Uber, citing a tip and multiple sources at Uber. Axios previously reported Saint John's departure from Apple, but not her new role at Uber. Saint John, one of the few executives at Apple who has an active social media presence, has become one of the most prominent faces of the company. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Saint John, who served as global consumer marketing head at Apple Music and iTunes, is leaving Apple at a crucial time. Apple Music, which launched two years ago, has seen a quick expansion, hitting 27 million subscribers and seeing new original content and app integrations. Her new employer, Uber, is under even more pressure, fielding accusations of gender bias and sexual harassment, run-ins with drivers and conflicts with regulators. Uber has also recently hired management academic Frances Frei as senior vice president of leadership strategy, according to Recode.

Tech Search Search boutique hotelsThe Original Hospitality Disrupter On LeadingThis Is How Occidental Petroleum’s CEO Led Through a Crisis Donald TrumpPresident Trump’s Aides Are Urging Him Not to Fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions Comey testimonyWhat to Expect From James Comey’s Testimony Apple Here’s Everything to Know About Apple’s New Venmo-Killer Leena Rao Jun 06, 2017 Apple is beefing up its mobile wallet with the addition of a Venmo-like payments service that lets users send money to each other, the company announced on Monday at its annual WWDC developer conference. The new payments service is part of Apple Pay, a mobile wallet Apple debuted in 2014 that lets users pay for items in stores, online and in apps using stored credit and debit cards. Users authenticate all payments by pressing their finger on Apple's iPhone and iPad home button. The new payments service is similar to Venmo, the PayPal-owned payments app that has become popular with younger users to make small, cashless transfers, such as paying a friend for dinner, using a mobile phone. PayPal has said Venmo is one of its fastest growing services, with Venmo processing more than $17.6 billion in payments in 2016, up 135% from the previous year. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Apple's newest service lets users send money directly to their friends, family, and other contacts stored in iMessage. The feature will be released as part of Apple's newest version of its mobile software, iOS 11. One big differentiator with Venmo is that Apple's payments service only allows users to send money to others who have an iPhone or iPad. Users will not be able to send money to people who have Android devices. Within Apple iMessage, users will see a line of app icons along the bottom of every message. One of these will be the Apple Pay icon, which users can select and then set an amount they would like to pay. Users can also choose which of their accounts to send the money from. After hitting send, users must authenticate the payment by pressing their finger on their devices' home button. People who receive payments will see the amount added to their Apple Pay account. That money can then be used towards any Apple Pay purchases in apps or in stores. If the recipient doesn't have an Apple Pay account, Apple will prompt them to create one. Another key differentiator between Apple Pay's iMessage-based service and Venmo is that users don't have to make these payments through a separate app, like with Venmo. Venmo's app includes a social feed of what friends have paid for, which PayPal has said is a popular with users. For more on Apple, watch: For Apple, payments are just another way to make its messaging app more useful, not more social. As Gerald Granovsky, senior vice president for financial firm Moody's explained, Apple is playing catch up to PayPal. "But its real goal is to cement loyal users for life," he said. [Monday's] introductions will add a lot more stickiness to Apple’s loyal base." Apple also doesn't have the burden of having to make money from payments by taking a cut of every transaction. The technology giant made $215 billion in revenue in 2016 alone through the sales of its products like iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads. PayPal on the other hand, has been trying to make money from Venmo by charging merchants fees to use the service to accept payments. Square Cash, another rival service, has also attempted to make money from its payments service by charging merchant fees. Meanwhile, PayPal and Venmo don't want to appear fearful of a new competitor, even if that rival is among the world's largest companies. A PayPal spokesman said in a statement: "As the world’s leading open digital payments platform, we welcome any developments that help people move away from the awkwardness of cash."
