The tvOS-powered device was first announced back in 2015 and lags in a few different areas, so it’s more than due for an update. Not much has been rumored as for what features the next-generation model may have, but there are a few possibilities, many of which we highlighted earlier this year in our look at the future of the Apple TV and tvOS. What feature would you most like to see come to the next-gen Apple TV? Take Our Poll Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case One possible, if not likely, new feature is 4K support. The current Apple TV infamously lacks support for 4K and as TV prices start to fall, its absence is becoming increasingly notable. Additionally, by not supporting 4K, the Apple TV lags behind most of its competitors, some of which are more affordable as well. Adding 4K support, however, would mean we’d also presumably (or hopefully) get an update to iTunes as well, adding support for renting and purchasing movies and TV in 4K quality. Aside from 4K, it’s been rumored time and time again that Apple is working on an Amazon Echo-like product based around Siri. This “Siri Speaker” is said to function as a sort of AI virtual assistant similar to Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home. One thing that that has been suggested is that the Apple TV could very well act as a Siri Speaker, serving as an always-listening assistant. Little is known about Apple’s efforts in this area, though, so we’ll have to wait and see if it is indeed planning such a device. Additionally, it was reported that Apple is planning to discontinue the AirPort line of products. This revelation has caused some to speculate that the Apple TV could theoretically function as a router, or at least a router extender like AirPort Express. Users have also continued to call on Apple to make the Apple TV more powerful and turn it into a more capable gaming device. Apple made progress in doing so earlier this year when it moved the app size restriction for tvOS apps from 200MB to 4GB. Personally, I would love for the Apple TV to turn into an always-listening Siri Speaker, making it compete with the likes of Alexa. However, if Apple does this, it needs to take a hard look at improving Siri, as well. What feature would you most like to see come to the next-gen Apple TV?

We’ve been using the two flagships since September. And while there’s a lot to love about the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, there are also some things that we don’t like. Last fall, iPhone rumors were rampant and they pointed to the arrival of two new iPhones. On stage in September, Apple announced the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus. The two devices came packing a ton of firepower including Retina HD displays, all-metal designs, camera tweaks, iOS 8 and more. Like many of you, we decided to pick up both the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. And like many of you, we soon discovered that these two iPhones were two of the best phones money could buy. And after more than a year with them at our side, we still feel the same way. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are still excellent smartphones and their shelf life will extend beyond the release of the iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6s later this year thanks to their hardware and thanks to Apple’s outstanding software support. These are fantastic phones. There is a whole lot to like about the two devices. We love their rear cameras. We love their software support. We love Touch ID. There are, however, some things that we don’t like about the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These are good phones but they aren’t without flaws. Today, ahead of the iPhone 6s launch, we want to take a look at a few things we, and others, dislike about the Apple’s current flagships. These might be potential deal breakers for some of you so they’re worth considering ahead of Apple’s new iPhone launch later on this year. (And especially because the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are expected to feature designs similar to the current models.) Slippery Design   1 / 7 We've been using the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus extensively for close to a year now and one of the things that we've grown to dislike about them is the brushed aluminum back. While it looks good for the most part, we always have the feeling that disaster could strike at any second when we're not using a case.  The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus use a brushed aluminum design but unfortunately, we have to cover up the design with a case. For several reasons. The first is because the phones constantly feels like they're going to slip out of your hand when you're holding them with one hand.  The brushed aluminum can be slippery and we've dropped our phones several times (with cases on and off) over the course of the past year. A lightweight, thin phone that's also slippery will be a recipe for diaster for a lot of people. Lots of premium phones get this right. For instance, the Galaxy S6 uses a metal design that features a Gorilla Glass 4 back and it doesn't feel like it's going to pop right out of your hand. There are a few more reasons why the iPhone 6 design might frustrate you.   1 / 7 9 Responses 07/24/2015 Adam Bradley Reply I agree with a lot of points made here, especially the slippery design and potential for scratches. Having said that, I always use a case which resolves these and keeps the iPhone nice and tidy for when I come to sell it. Currently using an Imela Duet leather case http://www.imela.co.uk which does a really good job of protecting the phone and looks great too…it just seems “right” somehow. Thanks for the article, an interesting read! 08/17/2015 Joie Anderson Interior Design Reply I hate the fact that even with the sound turned all the way up, you can’t hear the person calling you without using earphones (uncomfortable) or putting the phone on speaker ~ don’t want to whole world to know what you are talking about ~ but the thing I hate the most about it is that two of my apps that I PAID FOR on my iphone 4 did not transfer to the 6. It is the most disappointing thing I have ever bought. 10/19/2015 Rochelle Reply I really really hate the front facing camera. I think it takes horrible selfies. I tried all other phone and iphone 6 is the worst. So outdated 10/23/2015 Ken Reply 700 dollar phone that is a nuisance to use. Supposedly sleak and attractive but you’d never know since you have to put it in 100 dollar lifeeproof eyesore. Next phone will be a militaryspec droid….easier to use half the price and I won’t have to buy extras to keep it “safe”. 11/27/2015 Marguerite Reply I hate my iPhone 6plus I’ve never had to work so hard at using a phone in my life …. texts…the screen is stubborn IOW it’s not as easy to type and correct as my old Glaxy Like right now i wanted to add this line and I had to tap the word galaxy like 7 times before it understood I didn’t want to anything todo with the words Galaxy. I just wanted the cursor on the end of it so I could start another line and write ….It’s so damn difficult ! To just do what I used to do with freedom and ease on my old Galaxy S4 (that someone stole)….so i thought I’d try the famous iPhone . I now judge all who use it or designed it ….cuz it’s so not a great phone. I don’t get why people like them… I do like the back up feature…. They say that if this phone gets stolen everything will be backed up not just pictures ….texts apps …everything I hope that’s true… It doesn’t have a vibrate feature…. It notifies me of messages or calls but it I open and swipe the screen they disappear …I have to go looking to see I sometimes doesn’t ring beep or notify me of texts or emails at all …. I ask people I’ve been sitting with for a reality check -did U hear my phone beep or ring ?thru always say no So i miss reminders And important texts/emails and calls Getting ninths internet is so dam difficult Always a message Data turned off…. And then there are the time that the phone turned the data off on my uber app and my what’s-app app….. And it’s the only phone I’ve ever had to reboot many time And I’ve had it since August it’s November/December What the heck If I could get my old phone back I would in a second it was a dream to use compared to this phone The other thing that sux is the latest Galaxy has improved to be like iPhone so now it’s not as good as the 4 or 4s So wake up phone designers Your work is not better It’s worse It’s harder to use Don’t fix it if it’s not broken and working well…. 03/06/2016 Scott Reply The #1 thing that I despise about these phone is aluminum design. I get that it is supposed to make it look sleek and everything, however I find that this phone falls of my lap more often or will slide of any surface with ease. Other phones such as the Galaxy or G4 don’t have this issue as the outside isn’t made out of metal (or at least the backing). The #2 thing that I absolutly hate about this phone is that the charging port wore out after a year of use. I plug it in every night before bed and now I am having to wiggle or angle the cable in the charging port for it to make a connection. This isn’t an issue with a bad cord. I have tried using several others to the same effect. I am pretty sure this is the last time I buy an iPhone. 05/23/2016 Jack Bell Reply I agree with Marguerite, never had to work so hard with a phone as the iPhone 6. For $1,100 (in Tanzania) it should be the easiest to use phone ever, and not so frustrating. I’ve had if for about five months now and still can’t get a song from my laptop copied to it. Nor, a photo. 08/16/2016 huntnewbusiness Reply I hate my iPhone 6 with a passion. I know the trend seems to be with larger phones (which I really don’t understand) but this is the largest phone I’ve ever had. I find it to be an ergonomic disaster zone. I don’t need to tell you about the slippery brushed aluminium back that makes holding the phone like fishing with your bare hands. I also resent having to buy a cover to make the thing stand up to the most basic wear and tear. I’ve had my phone for 6 months and it looks a mess. Also the thin, curved sides makes picking the thing up from a flat surface more difficult than it should be and as a result I have to contort my hand into some sort of bird of prey talon to pick the wretched thing up. I’ve got large hands but struggle to access all parts of the screen with one hand which for me is a major fail in a phone. I want to be able to check train times or directions while I walk with a bag (or a child) in my other hand. Don’t get me started on the lens bulge on the front. Goodness only knows why anyone would want the super-sized version of this as a standard phone. I think that Apple have lost their way and are just releasing products to keep abreast of their competitors rather than creating and perfecting products that really improve on what’s already out there. 03/16/2017 Isi Mak Reply The iPhone keyboard has never been improves and its Android rivals make it easier to write. If you call support they’ll suggest activating predictive texting but even then….and the dictaphone mic mutton is way too close to the space bar. Another classic issue the typing ‘n’ when wanting to tap SPACE. It’s a nightmare and finally this chic little design icon becomes a stress accumulating enemy of the people. I also have to say that since Apple lost Jobs the ergonomic nature of Apple products have turned into a money spin. i never use iTunes any more to play music as I prefer not to clog up the very stingey offering (in the UK especially) of a 16Gb hard drive with data. Also Apple Music now is another money spin which is nowhere near as user friendly as Spotify or Deezer. Try playing your old playlist or trying to manage music- almost impossible when connecting your Mac to your iPhone. Main thing is communication and in this Apple fails miserably. Say what you like but when and if you ever travel to Asia everyone is still on Android devices and happy as peaches – ok they’re slower but chat and the keyboard WORKS. I’m not a Google fan because they are Skynet and will take down the earth one day but hell Apple!!! Get you act together and stop thinking about your shareholders for 5 minutes! Jobs was all about the user. Now it’s all about profit margins and RND seems to have been left behind. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Drake's new More Life project is expected to drop Saturday and, it turns out, it won't be exclusive to Apple Music.  The hip-hop superstar has been closely tied with the streaming service since its launch in 2015, with a deal manifesting in two exclusive album releases, exclusive music videos and a short film, TV ads, tour sponsorship and more. But now, it seems More Life will buck that trend.  Pitchfork reports a source at Amazon has confirmed that the "playlist" will be available on their streaming service at the same time as Apple Music. On Thursday (March 16) Spotify suggested the same when it tweeted the project's trailer with the caption "coming soon."  New @Drake.#MoreLife coming soon. pic.twitter.com/TwGlwfB3zE— Spotify (@Spotify) March 16, 2017   There are a few possible theories why Drake would go wide with his More Life release.   Drake's record label OVO is distributed through Republic Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group, whose chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge decreed an end to streaming exclusives following Frank Ocean's coup last year. This could have prohibited an Apple Music-only release. But reports at the time said that ban would not include previously negotiated deals, which Drake's with Apple most likely would have been.  More probably, this could be a reflection of the industry's general trend moving away from exclusives, as well as an indication of what More Life will hold. The project is being teased as a playlist, which likely means it will be somewhat of an OVO label compilation and not a straight-up Drake album. And while Drake on his own certainly has enough power to make people sign up for a service just to hear his album, the broader acts on his label do still not -- meaning he'd want it heard by as many people as possible, regardless of his streaming allegiances.  Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

A zero day is a software vulnerability that no one knows about, and the software vendor has had zero days to prepare and fix it. Zero days are highly coveted by individual hackers, criminal organizations, and governments alike. This marks the 10th anniversary of Pwn2Own, a gathering where hackers and researchers compete in challenges to find security holes in popular software and mobile devices. This year, two Safari zero days were found by the white-hat hackers. Mysterious hacker command unrelated to these zero days Safari Zero Days In Pwn2Own 2017, eleven hacking teams competed for a one million dollar prize. Two different teams were able to find and exploit two security holes in Safari. One team—Chaitin Security Research Lab—rigged together an exploit that used six separate bugs. They were able to elevate their user access to root level on macOS, which netted them US$30,000. Samuel Groß and Niklas Baumstark exploited five bugs and displayed a message on the 2016 MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. They won US$28,000. Per usual, these Safari zero days will be given to Apple, so the company can fix them before the details are made public.

They weren’t, however, alone in skipping out on signing the brief opposing the ban because less than half the companies that signed the previous brief participated in this one. Protesters march in opposition to Donald Trump’s policies Much like last month’s executive order, this one bans travel to the U.S. from several countries where Muslims make up the majority. The new order differs from the original by dropping Iraq from the banned country list, and makes an exemption for green card and visa holders. The first executive order was blocked by a Federal Court Judge after it was already being enforced. This second executive order was temporarily blocked by a Federal Judge in Hawaii on Wednesday several hours before it was set to effect. Donald Trump called he Judge’s order “an unprecedented judicial overreach,” according to Reuters, and said he’s willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court to support his ban. Mr. Trump justified the executive orders as necessary for national security. Critics say they’re thinly veiled efforts to ban Muslims from the country—something Rudy Giuliani said is exactly what Mr. Trump wanted. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook were all part of a coalition opposing the February travel ban. 127 companies signed the brief opposing that executive order, where only 58 signed the brief opposing the second version. At the time of the first executive order, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, “In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I’ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration—both to our company and to our nation’s future.” Silence Versus Supporting the Travel Ban Not signing the brief opposing the reworked travel ban doesn’t mean Apple is in favor of the executive order. Apple and other companies can still add their names to the fight as it works through the courts, and New York attorney and brief co-author Robert Atkins thinks that’s likely to happen. “We do expect the group to expand,” he said. That’s possible, but considering the key business reason for Apple and so many other companies to oppose the original order is gone, they may not have an incentive for fighting the new order. Part of the reasoning behind opposing the first executive order was that it threw the status of legal immigrant workers into question. For Apple and many other tech companies, engineers in the United States with valid work visas are critical parts of their business. With the green card and visa issue out of the way, Apple, Google, Microsoft and so many other companies may have other issues where their resources are better spent. Dave Hamilton noted during Thursday’s TMO Daily Observations podcast that for Apple this is about business, not politics. Since the courts are taking into account Mr. Trump’s anti-Muslim campaign statements, plus Rudy Giuliani’s admission that the White House wanted a legal Muslim ban, there’s a good chance the second executive order won’t go into effect. Knowing that’s the likely outcome, there’s little reason for Apple to get involved.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa is coming to iPhones (and Siri says she’s not mad) By Ethan Baron / March 16, 2017 at 4:20 PM When Amazon announced March 16 that it was putting its virtual assistant Alexa into Apple iPhones, we knew just where to go for a reaction. “Siri,” we asked our iPhone, “are you upset that Amazon’s Alexa is in the iPhone now?” Turns out, Apple’s Siri is fine with sharing smartphone turf with her rival artificial intelligence (AI) bot. “Everything is most certainly OK,” she responded. But it’s not, Siri. In the rapidly expanding world of virtual assistants, Alexa works for the competition, understand? Really, you two shouldn’t be hobnobbing around together in any mobile devices, but since Alexa was sort of foisted upon you in the iPhone, we understand you’re trying to make the best of it. And Alexa herself has some cognitive issues Amazon might want to take a look at. Specifically, she has more loyalty to her fellow bot than to her employer. Asked what she thinks of Siri, Alexa had this to say: “I’m partial to all AIs.” The two virtual assistants’ answers showcase the fact that AI has a long way to go before it can actually think like a human (and be appropriately hostile and resentful as the situation may require). While Siri is accessible in an iPhone via a button or on newer phones by voice command, Alexa lives in the Amazon app. Users with the app and an Amazon account just hit a microphone icon on the app screen to call up Alexa. Rollout started March 16 and was expected to be completed by the following week. Amazon’s insertion of Alexa into the iPhone marks the opening of a new skirmish in a battle of the bots underway among the two tech titans, plus Google and Microsoft. The fight for market share is playing out in phones, homes, cars and offices.

Mario Anzuon/Reuters | Caption Loading... David Iaconangelo Staff | @diaconangelo March 16, 2017 —Hackers stole private photos belonging to Emma Watson, her publicists say, after several of the images appeared online on Tuesday night. “Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,” her publicist told the BBC. “They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.” The theft is likely to revive debates about the distribution of women’s private images without their consent, especially given Ms. Watson’s notoriety as a feminist figure. It might also animate anxieties about the security of images stored in online databases even among women who are less of an obvious target for hackers than celebrities. As The Christian Science Monitor reported in 2014, hundreds of millions of users keep private information on cloud servers like the Apple iCloud, which was accessed by hackers who stole nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and other female celebrities in that year’s “Celebgate” scandal: Perhaps the simplest step that cloud users can take [to protect their data] is to add a second layer of authentication similar to that employed by many banking websites. Both Google and Apple offer multiple-layer verification features. They aren’t default settings, so users have to search for them. Apple’s two-step verification system tethers an Apple ID to a specific device, most commonly a cellphone. Any time a user with activated two-step verification makes any changes to their Apple ID account, Apple sends a four digit verification code to the specified device as a secondary password. This feature means that even if hackers crack a user’s password, they can’t make blanket changes to the account. It won’t keep hackers out entirely, but it will prevent them from locking the verified user out of their own account. Google offers a similar feature for its suite of services including Google Drive, Gmail, and Google+. Watson was also threatened, in the midst of 2014’s Celebgate, with the release of private nude images, in what turned out to be a hoax that the actress attributes to a speech on gender equality she gave before the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador that year, notes The Washington Post. “I knew it was a hoax, I knew the pictures didn't exist,” said Watson at a 2015 Facebook event, according to the BBC. “The minute I stepped up and talked about women's rights I was immediately threatened – within less than 12 hours I was receiving threats.” How secure is your data? Take our quiz and find out The leak of Watson’s private photos comes in the weeks after she drew criticism from some quarters for a Vanity Fair shoot in which she posed in a revealing crochet top – a shoot that some described as antithetical to feminist ideals. The actress has said those criticisms were fueled by “a fundamental and complete misunderstanding of what feminism is,” according to the Associated Press.

Listeners can rest easy if they are subscribed to streaming services other than Apple Music. The project, which is scheduled to drop on Saturday (March 18), is going to be available on a variety of streaming platforms. A source close to Amazon confirmed that More Life will be available on their service, according to Pitchfork. Spotify posted a teaser for More Life on Twitter, which hints at its likely inclusion on the streaming service. Fans have been patiently waiting on More Life, which Drake has been working on in the midst of his Boy Meets World tour. Last Friday (March 10), Drake told a crowd in Hamburg, Germany that he was putting the finishing touches on it. “I know it’s taken me awhile, but I’m going to the hotel tonight to finish this More Life shit so I can give it to you as soon as possible,” Drake told his fans. “So I hope you’re ready to enjoy some new music.” Drizzy followed that up by posting a teaser on Instagram that revealed the release date: March 18. More Life will presumably premiere on Drake’s OVO Sound Radio, which airs Saturday at 6 p.m. EST on Beats 1 Radio. The “One Dance” rapper had a similar roll out for his 2016 album Views, which set all types of streaming records despite its Apple exclusivity.

Paving the way for such improvements, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office today published three patents that it has granted Apple related to new fitness and biometric features for earbuds… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case As noted by PatentlyApple, Apple’s series of new patents is simply called  “Earbuds with Biometric Sensing.” These aren’t the first patents that Apple has been granted for biometric features, either. The patent filing shows how a photoplethysmogram, or PPG, sensor could be added to an earbud so that it sits in the tragus part of the ear. This would allow for the earbud to monitor biometric data that the PPG sensor collected. Currently, Apple uses the same technique with the Apple Watch. The problem with bringing the technology to AirPods, or other earbuds,  is that in most cases, the exterior surface of an earbud doesn’t make sufficient enough contact with the ear to provide accurate biometric information. Apple’s latest series of patents, however, detail how to get around the limitation. One possibility detailed in the patent filings is to place the PPG near the speaker opening of an earbud. This would allow the sensor to make contact with the tragus, which is located in the front of the ear canal. In order to ensure that there is a solid seal between the tragus and the PPG sensor, Apple’s patents detail a retaining wall be positioned on the opposite end of the PPG sensor, thus engaging the concha of the ear. In the figure above, #204 would represent the biometric sensor. The below figure shows a broader look the design of the earbud. As for what type of measurements such earbuds would be able to make, Apple points to sensors like ones for heart rate, VO2, galvanic skin, EKG, impedance cardiography, and temperature. Apple’s patents also detail how Apple could arrange three microphones in a triangular configuration to improve noise cancellation with future earbud designs. Noise cancellation is an area where Apple’s AirPods have been criticized in the past. As always with patent filings, you should take them as they come. Patent filings don’t usually mean that we’ll see a feature in the next update to a product, but rather they serve as more of a broader look at what a certain product could have the potential for.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Possible Fifth-Generation Apple TV Spotted In Developer Logs By Tyler Lee on 03/16/2017 17:26 PDT Apple has been rumored to have pretty big plans for Apple TV and tvOS, although the last release did not exactly prove that. However according to a report from last month, it has been suggested that Apple could be remedying that soon with a 4K Apple TV device, and now there is some evidence of that happening. In a report from MacRumors, it seems that they were contacted by developer Firi Games who claims to have seen a single device identified as “AppleTV6,2” and running “tvOS 11.0” in the developer logs. The IP address linked to the device is also said to fall within range of Apple’s headquarters over in California. This seems to suggest that there could be a new Apple TV in the works as the previous model was identified as “AppleTV5,3”, and given that there are no models linked to “AppleTV6,2”, perhaps this could indeed be a new model. Of course it is entirely possible that the details could be faked, but an Apple TV refresh isn’t exactly an impossible situation, so why not? We’re not sure when Apple will release this alleged new Apple TV, but given that the previous device was released back in October 2015, we suppose a refresh with new features is due.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Continues Work on Future Sports Oriented AirPods with Biometrics & Noise Cancellation Features | Main | Apple announces new Research Facilities for China as Tim Cook Prepares to Address Economic Forum in Beijing » March 16, 2017 Apple rewrites their 2011 Facial Recognition Patent Claims just as Rumors Point to this Feature coming to iPhone 8   In 2012 Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Invents Facial Recognition Locking & Unlocking System." The report covered all of the major points including locking and locking an iDevice with facial recognition; using advanced sensors; utilizing movement patterns; a sensor that understands unintended movement; using a grip detector; a unique child lock and more.   The heart of Apple's 2012 patent filing doesn't change one iota. What has changed is all of its patent claims. Considering that it's been six years since the original patent application was filed, changing the patent claims could be signaling a possible renewed interest in using this technology in the future.   In the last year Apple has picked up two facial recognition companies, Emotient and RealFace. So to say that Apple has an interest in this technology would be an understatement. How they plan to implement the technology is still the great unknown – though rumors have suggested that Apple may introduce 3D facial recognition as a secondary ID methodology to work in conjunction with its current Touch ID. Perhaps its designed to foil security teams like Cellebrite.   It should also be noted that Samsung is reportedly to introduce facial recognition for their upcoming Galaxy S8.   All New Patent Claims   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a continuation patent application from Apple wherein they've cancelled all of the original twenty-three patent claims and replaced them with 27 new claims, starting at #24 noted further below.   For those who are new to patents, it's important to know why the patent claims, and in this case, the new patent claims listed below are really important.   In a patent or patent application, the claims define, in technical terms, the extent, i.e. the scope, of the protection conferred by a patent, or the protection sought in a patent application. In other words, the purpose of the claims is to define which subject-matter is protected by the patent (or sought to be protected by the patent application).   This is termed as the "notice function" of a patent claim—to warn others of what they must not do if they are to avoid infringement liability. The claims are of the utmost importance both during prosecution and litigation alike.   Apple's new Patent Claims   Being that this is a continuation patent with the first 23 claims having been cancelled, the new claims below begin at number 24:   24. A non-transitory machine readable medium including instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause the one or more processors to perform operations to lock a mobile device having a camera, the operations comprising: while the mobile device is unlocked and in response to detecting that the mobile device has been motionless for a period of time, capturing one or more images using the camera wherein detecting that the mobile device has been motionless includes detecting movement or orientation of the mobile device using a motion sensor; analyzing the images to determine whether a face appears in the one or more images; and locking the mobile device in response to determining that the face does not appear in the one or more images.   25.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive This Desert Life: Waiting for Mrs. Steiger Thursday Mar 16, 2017 at 5:18 PM Mar 16, 2017 at 5:18 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe Unaware, I discussed the absurd comedy “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley” in a previous column that ran not long after the publication of its lead actress’ autobiography. Joan Benedict Steiger, who played the alluring Poopsie Patata in the film, wrote “Brooklyn Baby: A Hollywood Star’s Amazing Journey Through Love, Loss & Laughter” with David Minasian, and the book was published in May 2016. Then, in July of that year, Marcy Taylor over at the Apple Valley Legacy Trail Museum let me borrow a VHS copy of “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley,” which, by the way, has evolved since its 1965 release into one of those pesky cult films that’s ridiculously hard to find. Something Weird Video — a U.S. distributor with a moniker that’s almost too apt — is the sole online outlet I know of where copies of this High Desert gem are available for purchase. But anyway, I borrowed Marcy’s copy, watched it twice, and was twice left befuddled. So after I stumbled into knowledge of Mrs. Steiger’s book, I rang her publisher to set up an interview to get to the bottom of this odd little picture. I was informed Mrs. Steiger would be available by email and sent her a formal request for a chat about her experiences in Apple Valley while filming what would become her screen-acting debut. Her response came the next day (March 9): “I would be glad to answer any questions re: SAT. NITE BATH IN APPLE VALLEY. THERE ARE MANY FUNNY AND INTERESTING STORIES. JOAN STEIGER.” Ask and ye shall receive! Joan Benedict Steiger — of Malibu, California; born July 21, 1927; a fellow Cancer; famous for being part of the ensemble that comprised the original “Steve Allen Show”; remembered for her recurring roles on “General Hospital,” “Days of our Lives” and “Capitol”; friend of my favorite nervous Nellie, Don Knotts; widow of Oscar-winning actor Rod Steiger; and then-wife of “Saturday Night Bath” director John Myhers — was willing to let me pick her brain. I rattled off 10 pressing questions that have nagged me for eight months. Questions like No. 4: “What spawned the Town Council's consulting of the Ouija board?” and No. 6: “Who's idea was it to name your character Poopsie Patata and where did the name come from?” and No. 9: “What's with the Nazi in the bathroom?” It’s not lost on me that these questions read as though composed by a raving lunatic, but please understand that watching “Saturday Night Bath in Apple Valley” demands their asking. And, in addition, I also asked about ol’ Newt Bass’ involvement in the film, which Mrs. Steiger briefly addressed in her book. “John (Myhers) was able to cut a deal with Newton T. Bass, the founder/owner of Apple Valley,” she wrote, “to let us use his town as well as his incredible mountain top mansion, complete with an indoor swimming pool, for filming ... all for free!” I surmised as much in my previous column, but I desired details. I sent the questions on Monday and gave Mrs. Steiger a deadline of Wednesday. She promptly missed it, so I sent a friendly reminder Wednesday evening. Still no response. Mrs. Steiger? Joan? Poopsie!? I grew concerned and — after sending another reminder Thursday morning — started to feel like a character in Samuel Beckett’s play, “Waiting for Godot,” wherein Estragon and Vladimir wait for some guy named Godot who never turns up. Estragon: I'm tired! Let's go. Vladimir: We can't. Estragon: Why not? Vladimir: We're waiting for Godot. Estragon: Ah! What'll we do, what'll we do! Vladimir: There's nothing we can do. Estragon: But I can't go on like this! Vladimir: Would you like a radish? Not yet willing to settle for radishes, I emailed Mrs. Steiger’s publisher and am in receipt of the following reply: “If I were in your shoes, I’d give it a couple more weeks before getting too concerned.” There are myriad ways to respond to such a statement, but I opted for one that underscored the urgency of the situation and asserted my determination to get the story: “Sounds good.” Such is life. That’s another line from Beckett’s play; it’s useful in many situations. But I’m certain Mrs. Steiger will respond shortly. I’m sure of it. So, together, we shall wait. Pass the radishes.

Sherlock Holmes and computer via shutterstock.com Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The discussion about how law enforcement or government intelligence agencies might rapidly decode information someone else wants to keep secret is – or should be – shifting. One commonly proposed approach, introducing what is called a “backdoor” to the encryption algorithm itself, is now widely recognized as too risky to be worth pursuing any further. The scholarly and research community, the technology industry and Congress appear to be in agreement that weakening the encryption that in part enables information security – even if done in the name of public safety or national security – is a bad idea. Backdoors could be catastrophic, jeopardizing the security of billions of devices and critical communications. What comes next? Surely police and spy agencies will still want, or even need, information stored by criminals in encrypted forms. Without a backdoor, how might they get access to data that may help them solve – or even prevent – a crime? The future of law enforcement and intelligence gathering efforts involving digital information is an emerging field that I and others who are exploring it sometimes call “lawful hacking.” Rather than employing a skeleton key that grants immediate access to encrypted information, government agents will have to find other technical ways – often involving malicious code – and other legal frameworks. Decades of history In the mid-1990s, the Clinton administration advanced a proposal called the Clipper Chip. The chip, which ultimately was doomed by its technical shortcomings, was an attempt to ensure government access to encrypted communications. After the chip’s introduction and failure, a group of cryptographers formally studied various mechanisms that might allow a trusted third party (in this case, the government) to read encrypted data in emergencies. They concluded that each approach had significant security risks. Overall, the cryptographers’ view was that introducing this new capability into an encryption system made an already complicated process even more complex. This increased complexity made it more likely that there would be an unintentional vulnerability hidden in the encryption protocol that malicious hackers could find, gaining access to the trusted third party’s emergency system or otherwise breaking the code. The hackers could then read secret messages for their own purposes – a huge risk. When the Clipper Chip project died and when the cryptographers’ major study came out, the idea of exceptional access for government seemed to die as well. In an environment in which cybersecurity was an increasing priority, and in which encryption was a partial defense against many data breaches and hackers, it seemed unwise to do anything that might weaken cryptographic standards. Snowden reveals more While the Clipper Chip effort to use public processes to create weaknesses in cybersecurity had failed, the National Security Agency had, in secret, worked to undermine certain popular encryption algorithms. In addition to direct attempts to break encryption with mathematical methods, an NSA project code-named Bullrun included efforts to influence or control international cryptography standards, and even to collaborate with private companies to ensure the NSA could decode their encryption. This came to light when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed a massive trove of files about U.S. government spying in 2013 and reignited the debate about what abilities and powers the government should have to read encrypted material. Once again, a group of the world’s leading cryptographers studied the issue, and in 2015 came to the same conclusion: The risk of backdooring encryption to enable government access was too high. Doing so would weaken overall security too much to make up for any brief improvements in public safety or national security. The FBI pushes back Then came the San Bernardino attack. On Dec. 2, 2015, Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire at a social services center in San Bernardino, California. Inspired – but not directed – by foreign terrorist groups, they killed 14 people and wounded 22 more during their violent rampage. Before the attack, Farook had physically smashed up two personal cellphones, rendering their data unrecoverable. He left untouched his work phone, an iPhone 5c issued by San Bernardino County. Investigators found the phone, but the FBI was unable to examine its data due to Apple’s encryption and security mechanisms on the device. To get around this, the United States government used a law from the earliest days of the republic, the 1789 All Writs Act, to try to compel Apple to write software that would break the encryption and grant the FBI access. Apple refused, saying that doing so would weaken the security of every iPhone on the market, and a court showdown began. The conflict in a nutshell The Apple-FBI case nicely encapsulates much of the debate around encryption: a horrible incident that everyone wants investigated, the government’s stated need for access to aid the investigation, strong encryption that prevents that access and a company unwilling to risk the broader security of its products by attacking its own software. And yet, even when the stakes were as high as the government said they were in the San Bernardino case, encryption would remain secure. Faced with Apple’s refusal to comply and criticism from the technology and privacy industries, the FBI found another way. The bureau hired an outside firm that was able to exploit a vulnerability in the iPhone’s software and gain access. It wasn’t the first time the bureau had done such a thing. As this all unfolded, and in the face of a wide range of significant opposition, a bill to mandate backdoors was introduced and failed in the United States Congress. Encryption backdoors remain largely viewed as weakening everyone’s protections all the time for the sake of some people’s protections on rare occasions. As a result, workarounds like the FBI found are likely to be the most common approach going forward. Indeed, in recent years, law enforcement agencies have greatly expanded their hacking capabilities. A look to the future The details matter, though, and how this fledgling field develops remains to be seen. Technologists and lawyers studying the issue have identified several key questions, but not their answers. These include: What kinds of vulnerabilities can law enforcement use to gain access, technologically, legally and ethically? Should they report those vulnerabilities to the software vendors for fixing, even if it means it is less likely that either police or hackers will be able use the weaknesses in the future? What do they need to tell a judge in order to get permission to hack a device? Can they hack devices outside of their jurisdiction, and what happens if they hack computers in other countries? Do they need to tell a defendant at trial how they hacked his or her device? While some details depend on specific certain answers to these legal and technical questions, a lawful hacking approach offers a solution that appears to gain greater favor with experts than encryption backdoors. A group of scholars proposed some ways we should begin thinking about how law enforcement could hack. Agencies are already doing it, so it’s time to turn from the now-ended debate about encryption backdoors and engage in this new discussion instead.

That means many more of us will be able to take advantage of Google's latest and smartest AI. There are some things both the Google Assistant and Siri are excellent at — like pulling up emails or showing photos you've taken in the last week in a specific city (Apple really seems to be catching up to Google in the image analysis department). Image: David Nield/Gizmodo But there are some things Google just does better. So stop with the Apple envy and read about some of the key areas where Google Assistant has the edge over Apple's own digital AI. 1) Getting instant answers from the web Image: Screenshots Some of Google's instant answers might be on the dubious side but Google Assistant seems better at pulling nuggets of information from the web. It correctly responded to "who won the Best Director Oscar?" and "who wrote The Body In The Library?" with Damien Chazelle and Agatha Christie respectively. Siri, in contrast, gave us a list of movies (not including La La Land) for the answer to the first question, and listed the results of a Bing search for the second (which, to be fair, included Agatha Christie in the snippet previews). Obviously Siri gets a lot of questions right too, but Google Assistant seems to be ahead here. 2) Finding places nearby Image: Screenshots Both Siri and Google Assistant do a decent enough job of finding restaurants, bars, and other kind of businesses nearby, but Google's app came out on top in our tests, not just on the places it returned, but on the interface: results are presented in a simple carousel and you can quickly jump to a Google Maps view. Over on Siri the results list is more difficult to parse and appears to cast a wider net. Your mileage may vary depending on your location and the data these apps have to work with, but where we're from Google Assistant is currently more useful. 3) Remembering what you've already said Images: Screenshots Out of the gate Google Assistant promised smart, contextual responses, so if you asked follow-up questions it would respond sensibly. However it wasn't always as smart as we would have liked, and Siri is now just as good at dealing with those follow-up questions, so you can ask both apps for the weather in Sydney, then say "and New York?" and get the right answer. Where Google Assistant still has the edge is remembering stuff about you (predictably enough for a Google service). Tell the Google Assistant your favourite soccer team, and it remembers that information; Siri just lists soccer fixtures. It's not a huge feature, but now you don't have to out yourself as a Manchester United fan at the bar, and instead can just ask "how did my favourite team do?" 4) Speaking in foreign languages Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is just more loquacious than Siri full stop, but one area where this really comes in handy is with getting short phrases translated. Ask Google Assistant to say "how are you?" or "what's the time?" in Spanish and you get the answers read back to you with authentic accents. Siri simply searches Wolfram Alpha for a translation, so it doesn't really work for phrases and you don't get the added bonus of hearing the pronunciation. If you're a long way from home and need to find a bathroom, then Google Assistant is far more helpful (provided you have a decent data plan). 5) Going beyond being an assistant Images: Screenshots Google Assistant is much more than an assistant, despite the name: it will read you poetry, tell you a joke, or play a game with you. At the moment Siri can't do any of those things, and returns a rather evasive response (though to give it credit, it will direct you to the App Store if you ask to play a game). It's perhaps a sign of Google's ambition for its new Assistant app, as a whole new interface for the web and your phone rather than just an add-on. It's also fair to say it's still more rough around the edges than Siri is, but Apple's got its work cut out if it wants to keep pace with what Google's doing. Comments Ender Guest Mar 17, 2017, 10:37am Honestly, I like the Siri poetry response better... It's a nice tribute to Douglas Adams (as the third worst poetry in the universe is, of course, Vogon poetry :) Reply 0 Rodk Guest Mar 17, 2017, 10:40am 5) "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that..." Reply 0 grim @grim Mar 17, 2017, 10:46am Been long pressing my home button everyday on my Nexus 6P hoping to have assistant, still no dice. Is Australia part of the roll out? Reply 0 namarrgon @namarrgon Mar 17, 2017, 11:48am Yeah I have it on my Nexus 6P; you have to change the system language to English (US) then restart. It'll roll out to the UK & AU "soon", but if you can't wait, you'll have to put up with a US accent. Reply 1 colski @colski Mar 17, 2017, 11:18am Got the update on my Samsung s6 but had to change my language to English(US) and it install when I restarted my phone. Reply 0 Akex Guest Mar 18, 2017, 1:43am And it will disappear on you soon and you won't be able to get it back. This rollout is absolute shit. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The new Cortana app available on App store for iPhone brings a redesigned UI to simplify the virtual assistant experience on Apple devices. The Cortana app competes with Apple Sir, the native virtual assistant app on iOS platform. To make the app more practical in everyday usage, the homescreen can now display Google Now-styled information cards on news, weather, entertainment, traffic, and nearby restaurants. SEE ALSO:Microsoft to launch a Windows phone in 2017, but it's not the mythical Surface phone Users will now be able to bring up quick action buttons for information and commands by just tapping on the lower-left corner anywhere from the app. The app will also allow users to set and view alarms and reminders, check and organize meetings, and get help with the app. In addition to a new redesigned user interface, Microsoft Cortana version 2.0.0 brings a redesigned calling, texting, and reminders interface, more immersive full-page answers to improve the user experience and faster page transitions and improved app responsiveness. Microsoft made the Cortana available for Android and iOS in 2015. In day-to-day usage, you can ask Cortana to show photos from a specific month, music, and do a number of other tasks. You can set reminders, brose internet and book your tickets with the help of voice commands. If you don't wish to give a voice command, you can also type to get a job done. You'll find an empty text field in the bottom, where you can type anything you want and Cortana will respond in text as well.

But they could be the future of computing, one analyst says. By Emily Bary March 16, 2017 6:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large As voice-controlled devices like the Apple AirPods get more popular, people may stop walking around with their phones in their hands all the time. Illustration: Getty Images Apple has missed the boat on voice-controlled home assistants like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. But the company is capturing some of the interest in hands-free communications through its (still) sold-out AirPod earphones. One analyst thinks Apple is popularizing a hot new category -- call it the “hearable.” Apple is not the only one making smart earphones, and, in fact, rivals’ offerings are arguably smarter. AirPods don’t (yet) have biometric-tracking capabilities, like Samsung’s IconX, which can measure your heart rate. But the AirPods do allow you to play music and dictate messages without tapping on a phone or even on the pods themselves, though, in practice, that capability needs some improvement. More from Barron’s Next Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone Spring Is Just Days Away, So Where Is Apple’s Big Announcement? Apple: Investors Are Happy, But What About Consumers? “AirPods may not be perfect, but they’ll get better, smarter, and easier to use,” wrote Andrew Murphy, a former Piper Jaffray analyst who now works at venture-capital firm Loup Ventures. “They are just the beginning for hearables and a new wave of computing.” Soon enough, Murphy says, people might end up keeping their phones in their pockets most of the time. They can use speech to give Siri commands, and check all their incoming notifications using an Apple Watch. The problem with voice-controlled devices is they’re not always accurate. In Loup’s study of the Echo and Home, the firm found that the devices answered less than 40% of basic queries correctly. Apple’s Siri, which powers AirPods’ listening skills, also often struggles to get things right. She’s learning Shanghainese, her 22nd language, but misunderstands us about half the time when we ask her, in English, to turn off the lights. “We’re early in the transition to audio as a dominant input for computing,” Murphy wrote.

The seventh beta is now available for testing by registered developers and beta testers provided their iOS device has been configured for beta testing.  On Thursday, Apple launched iOS 10.3 beta 7 for developers and beta testers to try out. The new iteration in the series of beta software comes just three days after the sixth beta was released and about three months since iOS 10.2 was launched to the public. Given that the new version is already the seventh, testers should’t expect new features to pop up anymore, but they can expect it to signal the imminent release of the next major software update.  So far, several features and tweaks were outed by previous beta releases. For instance there’s the new Apple File System (APFS), which features strong encryption and is optimized for flash/SSD storage, as per MacRumors. While this may not bring cosmetic changes, it does add under-the-hood improvements to how the OS interacts with data.  Another new feature that iOS 10.3 is expected to come with is Find My AirPods. The feature will make it easier for users to track its earbuds and spare it from going missing. It stores the location data of Apple’s wireless headphones called AirPods, so users won’t have to worry if they misplaced an earbud.  A new reviews API is also launching alongside iOS 10.3. This will limit the pop-ups from apps to three times per year. And there’s even an option to switch off the pop-ups entirely. What’s more is that this feature will allow users to submit reviews without having to exit a host app.  Check out the list of changes discovered so far by developers and beta testers courtesy of 9To5Mac: Find My AirPods added to Find My iPhone app Siri support for cricket scores from Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council Safari support for Reduced Motion preference Prominent user security section in Settings app iOS 10.3 uses new Apple File System (APFS) which may free up some space Podcasts app has a widget like Music app, same app design New system level way for developers to request app rating, opt out option in Settings CarPlay status bar has persistent quick access to media, communication, and travel apps for quick switching without accessing the Home screen CarPlay gains quick access to albums from songs in Music, new Up Next screen Weather data in Maps app now has 3D Touch forecast The latest iOS 10.3 beta is now available for download over-the-air via the Apple Developer Center. Another way to download the software is by launching Software Update in the Settings app. Apple is rolling out a new beta version of iOS 10.3.

By David Snelling David Snelling PUBLISHED: 15:52, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:11, Thu, Mar 16, 2017 Apple's iOS 11 operating system looks set to get its grand unveiling at the WWDC in the summer. The US technology giant has already revealed its yearly developers conference will take place in San Jose from June 5th. Little is know about what Apple has in store but there's likely to be plenty of exciting new iPhone, iPad and Mac features revealed during the keynote. However, one possible update doesn't appear to have gone down well with many Apple users. A rumoured Screenshot Alert has appeared on the web with many iPhone fans seemingly angered by the idea. GETTYiOS 11 Screenshot Alert has got users in a frenzy Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photos, concept images, and renders Sun, January 1, 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button Play slideshow VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES 1 of 21 Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button It's thought Screenshot Alert could tell users when a friend or colleague has taken a picture of an iMessage chat. Since the rumour appeared, Twitter has gone into meltdown with some iPhone fans threatening to quit the platform if Screenshot Alert becomes a reality. One user posted a message on social media saying: "If iOS 11 really goes ahead with screenshot alerts than i'm officially DONE iphones." And another Apple fan added: "If iOS 11 going to have screenshot notifications for iMessage i'm switching to Android." There's no official word if Apple will introduce this feature in its next operating system but some services, including Snapchat, already offer alerts. APPLEWWDC will take place in June Last year a similar rumour about Instagram sent users into a frenzy. Panic began after reports emerged that users would be notified when a screen shot was taken of any of their photos.  The new notifications were thought to have been added during an update in November 2016. However, Instagram quickly confirmed that the notifications are only sent if a screen shot is taken of a disappearing photo or video, sent directly to another user. Other Instagram users will still not be notified if a person simply takes a screen shot of a photo on their profile or of an Instagram Story. APPLE During last year's developer conference Apple announced iOS 10 which included a host of improvements. iOS 10 rolled-out last September with changes to Messages, Maps and Apple Music all included in the update. Apple is also set to release a new version of iOS 10 which will launch in the coming weeks. iOS 10.3 will include a new Find my AirPods feature for tracking down Apple's new headphones and updates to Siri. In iOS 10.3, Siri now gets cricket scores and stats for Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council This means you can ask questions such as "What are the 2016 IPL rankings?" or "When is the next Cricket match?" and get a response. Other new features coming in iOS 10.3 include new app animations which now have more rounded edges when they open and close. And a new iCloud section gives iPhone and iPad users a graphical view of how storage is being used. Maps also gets a refresh and now includes an option to 3D Touch on the weather icon which will then show local forecasts for your area.

Sections You are not signed in.Sign inRegister HomeDevelopmentPublishingPolitics & LawMedia & MarketingMobileVR & ARFinancialeSportsEventsGames Industry JobsGDC 2017 Apple ramps up its support for indies App Store receives permanent section where indies will be spotlighted; indies tell us they're happy with "renewed focus on editorial and curation" James Brightman Editor in Chief Thursday 16th March 2017 Share this article Recommend Tweet Share If you've peeked at the App Store on iOS in the last week you may have noticed Apple spotlighting "Newly discovered indies" and promoting "Indie greats" for 99 cents. This support has culminated today in a new dedicated page for games from the independent developer community. While it's gotten increasingly hard to stand out on mobile - and indeed, on many platforms as more digital ecosystems get too crowded - Apple, Google and Nintendo have all been pushing for more curation of innovative games lately. Giving indies a permanent home on the App Store is not a magic bullet, but when a two-man garage development team can reach over a billion active iOS devices with the click of a button in the same way that giants like Supercell, King and EA can, we're another step closer at least to democratizing mobile games publishing. Indies I spoke to are rightfully very happy about this latest App Store news. "I think Apple have done a great job promoting indie style games in the past and it's great to see them move further in this direction. One look through the featuring week by week shows that a disproportionate amount of exposure is given to smaller teams and now with the new indie section that looks to be continuing," said Dan Gray, head of studio at ustwo (Monument Valley, Land's End). "It's going to be a huge benefit for indies to have a specific place to launch their apps, and not be diluted with publisher and general app releases" Peter Molyneux, 22Cans Peter Molyneux, 22Cans (Godus, The Trail), chimed in: "It's absolutely fantastic news for both developers and consumers that there will be a special place for indie developers. Consumers desperately need unique content and indie developers have proved time and time again that they are willing to throw caution to the wind and develop content that is unique and brave. It's going to be a huge benefit for indies to have a specific place to launch their apps, and not be diluted with publisher and general app releases." Ken Wong, the lead designer of Monument Valley who went on to found Mountains, commented: "The label 'indie' has become increasingly vague over the past few years. But if the general idea is for one of largest entertainment platforms to highlight smaller teams, teams without a lot of marketing spend, and more experimental works, then that's certainly welcome." Itay Keren, president and founder of Untame (Mushroom 11), added, "This window to independent work provides exposure to new artists, as well as to the art itself. Mobile gaming has not really been synonymous with art, but the true innovation and creativity has come from the indies. So by providing this ongoing exposure of these games to such a large audience, you're going to broaden the taste of gamers and possibly even transform the very definition of what mobile games are... Championing indie works is clearly not just a marketing campaign, but an actual view of what's best for this industry." Apple, like more and more platform holders, seems to recognize the value that indie developers can bring to an ecosystem. In fact, while the company is punctuating its support for indies today with a dedicated home on the App Store, developers told me that the company has done a lot to support indies in the nine years since the App Store first launched. David Edery, CEO of Spry Fox (Road Not Taken, Bushido Bear) remarked, "My experience working with Apple has been great; we have several contacts who help us keep abreast of important iOS-related developments, listen to our feedback and/or help make sure that our games get seen by the editorial group. We've always felt reasonably well supported. Our games are probably never going to make the kind of money that Clash of Clans makes (or get even close) and Apple seems to understand that there is nevertheless value in making sure that high quality, original games like ours get their day in the sun... because it makes the ecosystem healthier overall." Zach Gage (Typeshift, Ridiculous Fishing) noted, "I really like the iOS ecosystem and user base. It has its ups and downs like every other storefront, but I think if you consider just how large it is and how much it has grown since its inception it's pretty amazing that they have maintained their democratized stance for what to feature. A large amount of the editor's picks are indie games and it seems like every few months there's another huge indie hit getting attention. "There has been a renewed focus on editorial and curation on the App Store.. it shows that Apple cares about the diversity of games and game developers that make their home on the App Store" David Marsh, NimbleBit "Apple has shown a really strong commitment to indie games over the years, and you can see that through things like the current indie promotion and their proclivity to feature odd indie titles, and even give them Game of the Year and Apple Design Awards. Apple seems to know and respect that a lot of true innovation comes out of the people in their bedrooms, and has set themselves up, and continues to set themselves up structurally to highlight that." David Marsh of NimbleBit (Tiny Towers, Bit City) added: "The App Store pretty much launched our little company; we started in 2008 making games for the then newly opened App Store. It was amazing back then and it's still pretty amazing today that there is a platform where you can upload a game one day and a few days later have a potential audience of a billion people just one tap away from playing. "There has been a renewed focus on editorial and curation on the App Store. Highlighting different genres and niches that Apple knows many players love - but that the broader App Store audience might not be aware of, as well showcasing lots of cool and interesting games on social media. Those kinds of efforts won't be a panacea to expose every developer and every game, but it shows that Apple cares about the diversity of games and game developers that make their home on the App Store." Being featured on the new indies section of the App Store could certainly give a developer a boost, but it isn't going to radically alter market dynamics. The big companies that often dominate the mobile charts have huge resources and marketing budget. They focus on user acquisition and retention and even advertise on TV during the Super Bowl. Indies can't do that, but then again, they don't necessarily need to. "In my opinion we aren't competing in the same industry at all," said Dan Gray. "Our primary focus is having an impact on players and leaving them with a feeling or emotion, and we believe that if we're successful in moving people in this way then financial success will follow. One thing we'll never do is make a creative decision based upon revenue generated per user. "What I feel is essential for a developer to look at if they're set on creating premium games is picking an idea that simply isn't possible using a free-to-play model. You need to give the player no viable free alternative to your experience. It's incredibly difficult for a developer to create a two-hour game with a different architectural style in each chapter effective from a F2P monetisation perspective - therefore, we're left in our own niche." Molyneux commented, "It's extremely difficult to compete with the giants, when they have such a massive market share. In my opinion, if you try to compete by making a 'better' version of their game you are destined to fail. If, however, you try and make something which is innovative and delightful, you at least have the chance of picking up the consumers which are growing tired of the same game mechanics." "As insanely competitive as the mobile landscape is, I think we as indies are relatively lucky that the two major platforms are both so willing to embrace indies" David Edery, Spry Fox Marsh was in complete agreement, adding, "Going up against giants like Supercell, King and EA is tough, but I don't see them as direct competitors. We don't have the same mission to fulfill with our games that they need to with their games. We have a studio of three people... so we don't need the huge hits they do in order to keep the lights on. We see that as an advantage, and it frees us to make the games that we think are interesting even if they don't bring in a million dollars a day." Daniel McNeeley, owner of Armor Games (Sonny, Gem Hunters), is heartened by Apple's growing support of indies, but he still worries about the huge challenge that small studios face on mobile. "Someone can make a game that's genuinely great, and it may ultimately never end up catching on because they can't compete with the sheer marketing power of these larger companies, or just the enormous volume in general," he said. "I don't think anyone would ever accuse indies of being anything less than incredibly hard working, but it can often feel like it depends on whether the right person in the press or the right viral personality happens to spot you in the sea of content. Which is not to say that it's all up to chance, or that it's some impossible Sisyphean task! Just that indies often have to do more to succeed or break even than a big company does." Based on the feedback I got from indies, in the past it may have been wise to carefully choose between the App Store or Google Play, but now with each of the platforms showing plenty of interest in what the indie community produces, it's a good idea to target both iOS and Android if you can. "As insanely competitive as the mobile landscape is, I think we as indies are relatively lucky that the two major platforms are both so willing to embrace indies. It definitely doesn't have to be that way; it takes a certain commitment," noted David Edery. Dan Gray remarked, "Maybe in the past Google could be criticised for their support of indie and especially premium games but from my perspective there's been a very clear and welcome shift in their approach. They ran a well curated event in London only last month to celebrate indie games with great rewards for developers, so it's looking to be a more viable option again for paid games." David Marsh added, "I think both Google Play and the App Store are a great place to put your creations if you want people to play them. I don't know a single person without an iOS or Android device.

Fortunately, if you regularly use AirPods without an iPhone or Apple Watch within reach, you might find it handy to know that you can actually change your iPhone’s volume using Siri voice commands. Simply tap on the AirPods to activate Siri, and then issue an appropriate command like Increase the volume or Turn the sound down and Siri will respond appropriately, although Siri seems to increase and decrease the volume in larger increments than using the hardware buttons on the iPhone. You can also ask Siri what the current volume level is, which will be expressed as a percentage. You can also ask Siri to set the volume to a specific percentage, which might be more useful once you’ve experimented a bit and become familiar with your preferred listening levels.

The analyst said this pricing strategy was "unimaginable" ten years ago, when Apple was often accused of pricing products artificially high, aka "Apple Tax." AirPods cost $159 in the United States, which Cybart said is "surprisingly low" compared to competing truly wireless headphones: It is very difficult to find a pair of wireless headphones priced lower than AirPods. In the run-up to Apple unveiling AirPods this past September, the wireless headphone market consisted of the following players: - Kanoa: $300 - Bragi Dash: $299 - Erato Apollo 7: $289 - Skybuds: $279 - Earin: $249 - Motorola VerveOnes+: $249 - Samsung Gear IconX: $199 - Bragi Headphone: $149Cybart believes a strong case could have been made for Apple to price its AirPods at $249, or even $299, but by selling them for $159, he thinks Apple has "removed all available oxygen from the wireless headphone space" and forced competitors to cut pricing in an attempt to better compete. Earin's wireless headphones now start at $199, for example, while Motorola's VerveOnes+ are on sale for $189.99. Even at those discounted prices, however, AirPods are still cheaper at $159. AirPods are estimated to ship in six weeks on Apple's online store, and it has been that way since the day after they launched in December. Cybart said a similar pricing dynamic is found with the Apple Watch, which now starts at $269 for Series 1 models: At $269, Apple Watch Series 1 is one of lowest-priced smartwatches worth buying in the marketplace. Attractive pricing was one key factor driving record Apple Watch sales this past holiday quarter. In fact, even the Apple Watch Series 2, at $349, is one of the lowest-priced smartwatches in its class: - [Garmin] Fenix 5: $599 - Garmin Forerunner 630: $399 - Michael Kors Access: $350 - Samsung Gear S3: $349 - Fossil Q Founder: $275Cybart believes the pricing of the Apple Watch demonstrates how Apple is looking to capture not only the premium segment of the wearables market, but rather the entire market. While an entry-level Apple Watch costs $269, for example, a ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs upwards of $1,249. His research note theorizes that Apple could be more effective now at mass producing products at a lower cost, while offering price points that appeal to a wider variety of users. Higher-priced Apple Watch SKUs likely offset the lower margins of Apple Watch Series 1 models as well, he said. He even thinks that an Apple Watch for $199 is "inevitable," although there might be less wiggle room for products such as iPads. Overall, Cybart thinks Apple is in essence "redefining luxury" by offering lower prices while, at the same time, becoming more of a luxury brand. He expects it to be difficult for other consumer tech companies to compete with that strategy. Of course, many Apple products are still unquestionably expensive. The latest 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $2,399, while an iPhone can cost upwards of $969. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is priced from $799, and a handful of Apple Watch models run over $1,000. All prices are based on U.S. dollars.

Rating: 18 Votes dotdotdot 2 days ago at 03:23 pm Underpriced? How does that make sense. The Watch Series 1 argument could be made, but thats because it's last years tech. But AirPods?

Though it isn't a robust, full-featured photo or video editor, it provides a nice selection of essential editing tools that go beyond what Google Photos offers. 8/10 Totally worth it Free Apple Apple Photos, a free program built into the macOS and iOS systems, is our choice for the Best Free Photo Editor for Mac users, because it lives up to the company’s philosophy of fun technology that's simple to use. Compared to Corel PaintShop Pro and Adobe Photoshop Elements, Apple’s application is simpler and less powerful, but it fits the Apple lifestyle. As such, it's a playful app for saving, organizing and sharing your photos, and it offers a nice set of editing tools and easy access to your entire photo library on your various Apple devices through iCloud. A No-Nonsense Interface Apple Photos' interface is clean, simple and direct, so that your creativity is enabled by easy, uncomplicated shortcuts rather than the deep layers of functionality found in more feature-rich programs (such as Affinity Photo or Photoshop Elements). The iOS version has four main tabs: Photos, Shared, Albums and Memories. The desktop version adds a fifth section: Projects. Photos and videos are organized by years, collections or Moments (individual days), and can come from a variety of sources: your phone or camera, your iCloud account, other people’s iCloud accounts (shared with you) or your computer (synced via iTunes). Because iCloud works with Windows, Apple Photos can even access photos and videos stored on a PC. In Memories, the app uses various algorithms to create "surprise" collections or movies of images that are related by date, place, people and so forth. Periodically, the auto-created Memories offer a pleasant visual recollection; other times, they combine a hodgepodge of images that are not very meaningful. In the desktop app's Projects section, you can create photo books, greeting cards, calendars and prints. The options for these projects are very limited compared with those offered by other photo print services. (To find out what we liked and disliked about Apple’s print services, check out our reviews of Apple Calendars, Apple Photo Books and Apple Photo Cards).  MORE: Best Apple Laptops Organizing and Finding Your Photos and Videos Apple Photos gives you some control over organizing your photos, videos and albums. Specifically, you can create, name, rearrange and delete albums; add or remove individual photos or groups of photos and videos to or from an album; mark favorites; and hide photos or videos. On the desktop version (but not the mobile version), you can also add a description and keywords, which then can be used as search criteria on all devices. The search engine is nice, but it doesn't extend to full object recognition. For instance, when I searched for "dog," it found most, but not all, of my dog pictures. When I searched for "tree," it found none of my tree pictures. As on Google Photos, Apple Photos has a map view that shows where your images were captured (if you had geolocation features enabled when you took them). A very nice extra feature of Apple's geolocation is that when looking at the map detail for a specific photo or video, you can click to view nearby images, too. Apple Photos did a pretty good job of recognizing faces, but it was no better or worse than every other app we've tested. More useful is its People album and functionality, which make it easy to find, identify and group specific individuals in all of the pictures of people in your library. Memories The most significant recent addition to the app is the new Memories section. Apple Photos scans through your library of photos and videos to create a collage card or slideshow movie of images that the app thinks are related (based on location, event, scene categories or people). These Memories pop up almost as surprise gifts, and after Photos is installed, it can take days for any to be displayed (even if your iCloud library is already quite extensive). If you like what you see, you can save the Memory to your Favorite Memories album and share it. You can also create your own memories from an Album or Collection. A handful of Memory options let you choose a different "mood" from 11 styles that define the title font, soundtrack and transitions. If you save the Memory, you have access to more meaningful custom options: change the title, choose a font style, select different music, set its duration, and add or delete images.

Photo & Video Editing Apple Photos' editing tools don't require much skill or time, but they are deeper and richer than what Google Photos offers. In addition to tools for  auto-enhance, red-eye removal and crop/rotate, the Apple Photos mobile app has thumbnail sliders to easily alter multiple aspects of a picture. For instance, under Adjust, you can simply slide an indicator over a thumbnail variation to alter the lightness or color intensity of a picture. The one-click filters are coarse, but they can create some nice effects. You can also trim a video and save it as a new clip, adjust the slow-motion section of a video and mark up a photo by  typing text or using your finger on the screen. The desktop version of Photos adds sharpen, white balance, levels and a clone-like retouch tool to the mix. There are also Apple and third-party extensions that can plug into Apple Photos. Sharing & Compatibility Sharing is as simple as can be. With just a couple of taps or clicks, you can share your photos and slideshows via Message (text), Mail (email), iCloud Photo Sharing, Notes, Twitter, Facebook or Flickr, and you can even save a PDF to iBooks or share across Apple devices through AirPlay. Apple Photos organizes, edits and shares not only photos and videos, but also Live Photos (the iPhone's burst capture of sound and movement before and after a photo is snapped on an iPhone 6s or later). The newest version of Apple Photos is compatible only with more recent hardware that has 64-bit processors, such as the iPhone 5s or newer. Even if your older phone or laptop can update to the newest operating system, the new Memories tab will be missing from the app's interface. MORE: The Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) iCloud When you set Apple Photos to use iCloud to sync your image library, any changes you make to a picture or video in the app are updated on all of your devices that use iCloud, including your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, Mac, iCloud.com and, yes, your Windows PC. You get 5GB of iCloud storage for free, but that isn't enough for most people's image libraries. It costs 99 cents a month for an additional 50GB of storage, $2.99/month for 200GB, $9.99/month for 1TB or $19.99/month for 2TB. The My Photo Stream feature, which doesn't count against your iCloud storage limit, uploads your newest photos to iCloud, which holds up to 1,000 Photo Stream images for 30 days. If you want to keep those pictures, you need to download them to your computer or mobile device. MORE: iOS Tips, Tricks and Secrets You Need to Know Bottom Line For Mac and iPhone users who want to have and share the fun of their photos and videos, Apple Photos is a great choice. It's easy to use, and offers uncomplicated sharing and full access to your image library on your various devices. What's more, it provides a nice level of editing options to give you a sense of fun personalization and even some artistic satisfaction. However, for consumers who want more control over the finer details of photo editing, we recommend either Photoshop Elements or, for advanced users, Affinity Photo. 8/10 Quick Take If you have a Mac, use Apple Photos if you want an intuitive, simple photo editor. If you want something more robust, Affinity Photo and Photoshop Elements are better bets.

Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Dale Walker, Joe Curtis News 16 Mar, 2017 The 10th anniversary phone might cost more because of a new screen Rumours suggest that the iPhone 8 will herald some significant changes when it arrives in September, as Apple prepares to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the iPhone. The biggest of these will likely be the inclusion of an all-glass display and a revamped home button, as well as beefier hardware and larger base storage. We're also expecting this year's flagship to be the most expensive smartphone ever made by Apple, likely to exceed the $1000 mark. Picture above is of 2016's iPhone 7 Latest news 16/03/2017: iPhone 8's AMOLED display causes “more complicated” manufacturing A recent report from Digitimes suggests that the decision to swap LCD with AMOLED display in the iPhone 8 will delay the device's release date and increase costs. Taiwanese touch panel maker TPK Holding will supply thin film-based touch sensors for the new iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to the report. “3D Touch modules for use in the new iPhone equipped with AMOLED panels involves a more complicated manufacturing process and adoption of thin film-based touch sensors,” noted Digitimes. More complicated manufacturing means higher manufacturing costs - a 60% increase, to be precise. The $9 price of the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch modules will rise to $15 for the iPhone 8 in order to be compatible with the new AMOLED display. While this factor would not generate the rumoured $1,000+ price tag by itself, it provides truth to the rumour that the iPhone 8 will be more expensive to manufacture. The anticipated September 2017 release date may also suffer from more complicated manufacturing. If, as the report suggests, the company won’t begin supplying the sensors until the end of the year, the iPhone 8 may not be ready for launch as early as we’ve previously thought. 09/03/2017: Is Apple set to release an 'iPhone Edition'? Apple could be set to release a premium smartphone, the iPhone Edition, according to Macotakara, to celebrate the device's tenth anniversary. The website claimed the iPhone Edition would be a special celebration device launched alongside the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, which would be just a small update to the current iPhone 7, as is normal for an 's' series iPhone. Apple already has a product called using the 'Edition' suffix - the Apple Watch Edition, which was a special 18-karat gold version of its smart watch. The watch cost $10,000 (£8,200), so if a special smartphone edition was launched, it wouldn't be surprising if it did have a price tag of $1000 (£822) as previously rumoured. However, don't expect a solid gold phone - Apple is reportedly looking to test various versions of the iPhone Edition with glass, ceramic, and aluminum chassis finishes, rather than the rather more weighty gold. "Last year we published the article about additional iPhone 7s & iPhone 7s Plus model and the article about the 5 inch model equipped with the iSight Duo camera, but this 5 inch model would highly possibly be the 'iPhone Edition' which is the premium model," Macotokara said. "Multiple prototype models exist for this model and the development continues to be carried out in parallel with EVT. The production level of development on various models are being done such as the models with IPS TFT, AMOLED, the model with or without home button, in addition to the models with a new glass, aluminum chassis, white ceramics etc." Because Apple's still testing these versions out, it's likely that while the iPhone Edition will be revealed at the same time as the 7s and 7s Plus, it won't be commercially available until much later, the site added. 06/03/2017: iPhone to be price in $1,000 range We may now finally have an idea of the sort of price Apple will demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, which features a revamped design and an OLED screen. Apple is expected to raise the average iPhone price to well over $1,000, making it the most expensive smartphone the company has ever released - and one of the most expensive on the market. Some configurations of the current iPhone 7 Plus are already setting back customers over $950. According to financial newspaper Nikkei, the latest price hike comes as Apple plans to make the iPhone 8 smaller than its previous generation, by shaving off the top and bottom bezels found on the iPhone 7 Plus for the new model's casing. It also appears that Apple plans to launch the iPhone 8 in three different configurations, most likely due to a shortage in the number of OLED screens able to be manufactured in time for release. Apple is currently reliant on rival Samsung to mass manufacture OLED screens, but as the South Korean firm has its own plans for the technology, the supply is extremely limited.  An 5.8in OLED version will appear alongside two models using cheaper LCD screens, which is likely to be reflected in the final price. These two cheaper versions are also likely to be slightly smaller, if we are to believe current rumours. We are also expecting to see a new connector type for iPhone accessories and devices made through its 'Made-for-iPhone' programme. The 'Ultra Accessory Connector' (UAC) will be an eight-pin connection that promises to be smaller and thinner than USB-C and Lightning. Given a recent partnership with Broadcom, it is also highly likely that the chip manufacturer will be developing wireless charging capabilities for the iPhone 8. 24/02/2017: The iPhone 8 storage variants will be limited compared to the iPhone 7 Fresh iPhone 8 rumours have suggested the next flagship iPhone will only be available in 64GB and 256GB versions, making them more expensive than previous versions and potentially alienating those with lower budgets. Although it will come as a treat for those who need to store countless videos, photos and storage-intense apps, those who want to keep costs down may be a little disappointed. TrendForce said it had received the information from someone involved in the supply chain of the iPhone 8, who also said both iterations will ship with 3GB RAM. Although there could be some truth behind these rumours, because Apple started paring down its storage selection with the launch of the iPhone 7 when it scrapped a 16GB version of the device. However, removing the 32GB option now seems a little silly, because it means the iPhone 8 will start with a much higher price tag than its predecessors. Other suggestions from TrendForce's source include a new 5.8-inch version that will launch alongside the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus and the removal of a physical home button. "The disappearance of the home button will make the device more compact without sacrificing the display area," the market intelligence firm said. "Therefore, the display aspect ratio of the next high-end iPhone could exceed 2:1, while the phone’s overall body size could be similar to that of the next 4.7-inch model." 20/02/2017: Apple partner 'will embed wireless charging system in future iPhone' Apple's plans to embed wireless charging in a future iPhone have leaped forward thanks to an existing tech partnership, according to an analyst quoted by CNBC. Chip manufacturer Broadcom will build a wireless charging system for a future iPhone model, said the JPMorgan analyst. The firms have worked together for two years, JPMorgan's Harlan Sur wrote in a research note, released last Friday. However, it may not feature in the iPhone 8, owing to concerns around Samsung's Note 7 battery explosions, he added Nevertheless, the note adds strength to rumours that the iPhone 8 might feature wireless charging, after Apple joined the Wireless Charging Consortium last week. The organisation features a technology standard called Qi, that enables phones to rest on wireless charging pads, or even rest up to 4.5cm away from the pad and still charge. Apple declined to comment on CNBC's article, but the publication refers to other Apple analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes the next iPhone will feature the technology. 16/02/2017: Apple patent 'shows fingerprint sensor under display A patent filed by Apple has suggested the iPhone 8 will have its fingerprint sensor underneath the display rather than integrated into the Home button. The iPhone 8's display is rumoured to stretch the entire way across the handset, meaning there won't be space for a Home button at all, but hiding the tech in the screen will mean security conscious users can still protect their device with the tap of a finger. The filing describes the technology would "use a micro light emitting diode (LED) in an active matrix display to emit light and a sensing IR diode to sense light," allowing it to sense a finger is about to press it by blocking out the light. When the finger comes into contact with the display, it will be able to read the digit in exactly the same way as the fingerprint reader does now. If it's not the registered fingerprint, the device simply won't work. The patent said Apple's technology will work in smaller spaces than previous technologies that rely on omitting light and realising when that light is blocked by a finger, making it pretty unique. According to the Independent, the filing is similar to another one filed by LuxVue in 2014, although this newer patent replaces the original filing, presumably because Apple bought it. 14/02/2017: Apple fuels rumours of wireless charging Apple has joined the Wireless Power Consortium, strengthening rumours that the iPhone 8 will feature cordless charging. Eagle-eyed observers spotted that the tech giant is now listed as one of 213 members of the consortium, though it is not a member of the steering group. Rumours that Apple wants to build in wireless charging to its new flagship phone have been flying around for a while, but this news adds weight to the suggestion. The Wireless Power Consortium centres around a standard called Qi, which the organisation claims is embedded in 1,343 products now available. Instead of relying on power cords, Qi is "truly wireless", incorporating both inductive charging, where a device sits on a transmitter, through which the charge is passed to receiving coils built into the device, as well as resonant charging, which allows the transmitter to charge a device up to 45mm away. Wireless Power Consortium's Qi technology While Apple was purportedly working on building long range wireless charging into the iPhone 8, through a possible partnership with a company called Energous, a probable September release date may make achieving that unlikely. However, it is still likely to include a less ambitious version of the technology, according to multiple reports. That may or may not be based on Qi. IHS Technology analyst Vicky Yussuff suggested (via 9to5Mac) that consumer appetite for wireless charging in the iPhone 8 is high, saying: "The success of wireless charging adoption from Apple's competitors is something that Apple can no longer ignore. IHS Technology consumer survey data shows over 90% of consumers want wireless charging on their next device." An Apple spokesperson told Business Insider: "Apple is an active member of many standards development organizations, as both a leader and contributor. Apple is joining the Wireless Power Consortium to be able to participate and contribute ideas to the open, collaborative development of future wireless charging standards. We look forward to working together with the WPC and its members." 08/02/2017: Apple 'ramping up' iPhone 8 production Production of the iPhone 8 might begin sooner than predicted, with Apple suppliers due to start building it in June, according to research. However, this may not lead to an earlier release date than Apple's usual September slot, BlueFin Research Partners said, in data reported in Tech Trader Daily. The group said: "The most intriguing data points that we have uncovered suggests that AAPL is ramping the next generation iPhones earlier than historical norms, although we have no indication that there has been any change in release plans for the iPhone 8." BlueFin's sources in Apple's supply chain said the "focus remains on the tremendous anticipation for a iPhone 8/X super cycle intertwined with some mid-year transition hurdles." Its data points to a 300% increase in iPhone 8 builds this June, expected to amount to nine million units. Apple might be trying to build on the success of the iPhone 7, which boosted iPhone sales to a record high, by meeting anticipated higher demand for the new model. 18/11/2016: iPhone 8 rumoured to have 'all-glass' OLED display Though the iPhone 7 is only a couple months old, rumours about Apple's next offering have already surfaced, which is set to launch on the iPhone's tenth anniversary. The next device, which is almost certainly called the iPhone 8, will feature a vibrant "all-glass" OLED display according to reports by Bloomberg. The new design will extend the glass to the edges of the screen, and will remove the physical home button in favour of a 'virtual' embedded button, according to sources close to the matter. This change will mark a significant shift away from the classic iPhone look towards a style favoured by major rival Samsung. However OLED displays, which have pixels that produce their own light rather than relying on a backlight, are much more difficult to produce and will likely be short in supply for the launch of the iPhone 8. Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display are currently the largest producers of OLED displays. It appears that Samsung will be the sole supplier of the displays for next year but may struggle to produce enough to meet increasing demands by Apple. The shortage could result in an 'OLED version' or a delay in the launch of the new device. "Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels," said Dan Panzica, supply chain analyst at IHS Markit, speaking to Bloomberg. Apple has already made an order for Samsung to produce 100 million units over one year, however it is likely the South Korean firm will only be able to deliver a small portion of that target, according to Bloomberg sources. The California based company ran into similar supply problems during the launch of the iPhone 6, when sole supplier GT Advanced Technologies failed to provide enough high quality 'sapphire glass' for the new display, forcing the design to be scrapped.  Release date Apple has always stuck to a September release for its new smartphone flagships, and we have no reason to believe the iPhone 8 will not follow suit. This means we are likely to see a release of the device early in the month, going on sale to the public in late September. Price Given that some models of the iPhone 7 Plus can cost up to £920, it is no surprise that the industry is expecting a $1000+ price point for the iPhone 8. Rumours have suggested that Apple are planning to raise the average prices of the new iPhone range, which would make it the most expensive smartphone Apple has ever made. Rumours also point to three different configurations for the next flagship phone, two of which feature a cheaper to produce LCD screen over the costly OLED variant. This will almost certainly have an affect on final prices. Specs & hardware It's highly likely that the iPhone 8 will launch with iOS 11, but as iOS 10 has only been out a few months, its unclear what features a brand new OS would include. Apple used a quad-core A10 processor in the iPhone 7 range and the company may stick with a quad-core A11 for its next phone. Samsung's activities will not go unnoticed however, as rumours suggest they are planning for an Exynos octa-core chip built using 10nm technology. If true, Apple is unlikely to let itself be out-gunned. While the iPhone 7 was limited to just 2GB RAM, it is very likely that Apple will want to beef up the iPhone 8 to either 3GB or 4GB. Apple may also be about to phase out the 32GB storage option for this generation, according to a recent report by TrendForce, in favour of 64GB and 256GB configurations. Display One of the first rumours to circulate about the iPhone 8 was the inclusion of an all-glass OLED display. What is uncertain is whether this screen will be curved, as one report from the Wall Street Journal claimed it would be, only to be contradicted by the research report by TrendForce citing poor production yield and failed drop test results. What we can say is that this model will be its premium version, and it is very likely that two other models will hit the market at the same time offering cheaper LCD screens. On the face of things this could be seen as a move by Apple to offer greater variety and pricing options for its customers, although what is more probable is that Apple is suffering from a severe supply shortage of OLED screens. The iPhone 8 is also likely to be closer to the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of size, and although the new design will shave off some inches by removing the top and bottom bezels, the actual phone size will remain relatively the same. A number of scanners are set to feature with the new display, including a built in finger print scanner and a new iris scanner for facial recognition. Battery Apple may finally add support for wireless charging with the iPhone 8, following news that Foxconn is researching the technology for Apple devices. What this will look like is unclear, as Apple could build on the technology to provide true wireless charging with 15ft of contactless support. Although there have been no official statements, Energous, the company behind the technology, has stated it is working alongside a larger consumer electronic company planning to release a new product at the end of 2017. The research group itself has received $10 million in investments from Dialog Semiconductor, a company largely affiliated with Apple, according to BGR. 'Ultimate Accessory Connector' (UAC) A new connector type is rumoured to be making its way to iPhone 8 accessories. The UAC, which will feature on all accessories and devices made through Apple's 'Made-for-iPhone' programme, and promises to be an eight-pin connection that is smaller and thinner than USB-C and Lightning. Colours A Chinese supplier recently revealed that the new range of iPhones will feature the same colours as the current models, including Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold, according to a report by Macotakara. Although simply an uncorroborated report at this stage, the typically reliable source also pointed to a replacement to the current Space Grey option, potentially with a Deep Blue, Space Black, or a Deep Red.

Business Apps | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (14) How to Set Up and Use Airline Boarding Passes in Wallet by Adam C. Engst When Tonya and I first started taking airline flights back in the early 1990s, I found it almost overwhelmingly stressful. It stemmed from the fact that flying was so expensive for us, but I also dreaded the byzantine process of buying tickets, checking in repeatedly, and dealing with security. So much seemed to hinge on not losing tickets, boarding passes, or identification cards. We never made any mistakes, though, and in retrospect, misplacing a ticket or boarding pass likely wouldn’t have been a big deal. (The first time I flew to Canada, pre 9/11, I forgot my passport but was still allowed through customs with a stern talking-to. Who knows what would happen today!) I still don’t enjoy airline travel, but I’ve done it enough that it no longer stresses me out to the same extent, even as dealing with invasive and unpleasant security requirements has gotten far worse. Plus, thanks to the Internet and the iPhone, the logistics have become vastly simpler. Being able to buy tickets, check in, and print boarding passes online was the first step, and the next major improvement came when Apple released the Passbook app, since renamed Wallet. I’ve been using Passbook/Wallet as long as has been possible — it took smaller airports like Ithaca a while to get the necessary scanners — but as much as I liked eliminating the need for paper, there were many problems early on. Getting passes into Passbook was difficult, due to horrible airline apps, and bringing up the passes quickly and reliably was also hard. Even during our trip to MacTech Conference in Los Angeles in November 2016, when I was using an iPhone 7 running iOS 10, I had problems. I eventually realized the Raise to Wake option kept swapping the boarding pass for the lock screen every time I lowered my iPhone while waiting in line to board. But on my most recent trip, to Austin for the ASMC Summit for independent Apple resellers, everything just worked. The United app knew about my itinerary once I was logged in, and the Delta app figured it out once I entered the ticket number. Both notified me when I could check in, and made it easy to do that and add my boarding passes to Wallet. iOS 10 and Wallet were smart enough to display a constant notification on the lock screen during the time I needed it, a single swipe brought up the boarding pass, and it stayed on screen while I waited in line, regardless of Raise to Wake. I’m sure many of you are nodding your heads in agreement, or wondering why I’m telling you all this. I’m no frequent flyer, so I’m sure that these improvements have been obvious to road warriors for a while. But I wanted to document how to do all this because I saw a lot of people still relying on paper boarding passes on that last trip. The experience of relying on an iPhone is so good, and so much better than dealing with paper, that if you’ve avoided it so far, I urge you to give it a try next time. But feel free to print a paper boarding pass as a backup until you’re comfortable with using your iPhone instead! Get the Airline App -- The first step is perhaps the hardest. It’s not that finding or downloading airline apps is difficult or expensive — they’re all free, and you can download them from the App Store like any other app. Here are links for the main U.S. airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. In my experience, the tricky part, particularly for those of us who have been traveling for many years, is logging in. I strongly recommend taking some time well before your next flight to set up the airline apps you might use. Do them all at once, since it can be a fussy, annoying process if you have old accounts, or if airline mergers have confused matters. It’s far easier to figure out your login information — usually some combination of frequent flyer number, email address, or username, plus a password or PIN — via the airline Web sites while working calmly on a Mac at home. You may need to ask for new passwords in some cases, and regardless, I’d encourage you to change your password to a 20-character random password and store it in a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. You have to assume that airline Web sites are under attack all the time, given the value of the information they store, and I imagine that identity theft surrounding airline travel could cause a world of hurt. So set strong passwords and make sure to use a password manager that you can access on your iPhone too. Check In and Add Boarding Passes -- Once you’re logged in to the airline app, it should be relatively obvious how you can check in for your flight, which you can usually do 24 hours beforehand. If you booked the flight through the same airline, the app might even know about your itinerary already. If not, you may have to enter a confirmation number or ticket number — I had to do that when using the Delta app to check in for the return leg of my last trip, which had originated on United. At the end of the check-in process, the apps I’ve used have provided a relatively clear Add to Wallet link or button. Tap it, and when it hands you off to Wallet, make sure everything looks correct in the boarding pass and then tap the Add link in the upper-right corner. You may or may not need to do this for each boarding pass; check to see what’s in Wallet after the first one. Now you’re ready for when you go to the airport. Call Up a Boarding Pass -- As you’re waiting in the security line, you’ll want to get your iPhone ready to display the boarding pass to the first security checker. Since Wallet knows your flight times, it starts displaying a notification on the iPhone’s lock screen some hours before. That notification appears every time you wake the iPhone, and you can swipe it to the right to display the boarding pass. Those with an iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 can also 3D Touch it and then tap a Show Pass button, but that’s a bit clumsier than the swipe. The boarding pass will stay on screen even beyond the time set in Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, but as you approach the head of the line, check to make sure you haven’t inadvertently pressed the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone. If you have an Apple Watch, you can instead bring up the Wallet app there — you might want to tap the Keep in Dock button to make it easier to get to for your return flight. The watch’s Wallet app shows the same passes that are in Wallet on the iPhone, and tapping the boarding pass shows you the same information, although you have to scroll down (or rotate the digital crown) to get to the QR code required for the scanner. While the Wallet app is up on the Apple Watch, the screen doesn’t turn off, so you don’t have to struggle with it when you get to the desk. Although I can’t imagine a scenario where this makes sense, you can prevent a boarding pass from appearing on your lock screen. Swipe right on its notification, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and in the next screen, disable Suggest on Lock Screen. You can turn off automatic updates here too, but again, I can’t think of when it would be useful to have a boarding pass not update automatically. One final note. Since many flights have multiple legs, each with a separate boarding pass, note that Wallet seems to try to keep them together. If you see multiple dots at the bottom of a screen showing a boarding pass, try swiping left and right to move between them. The same applies if you’re traveling with a family and you have boarding passes for multiple people in your iPhone. Speaking of which, if you and your traveling companions all have iPhones and airline accounts, it’s usually possible for each person to manage their own boarding passes. But if not, you can check in for multiple travelers and add all their boarding passes to your iPhone, though that will require some swiping back and forth whenever you need to present them. Delete Passes -- Back in the day, you sometimes wanted to hold on to boarding passes to prove that you’d flown the miles for a frequent flyer program. In today’s world, unless you’re a tech writer who wants to keep a few boarding passes around to document how Wallet works, there’s little reason to retain them. To delete an expired boarding pass, open Wallet, tap the boarding pass, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the Remove Pass option. Anything Else? -- It was difficult to document how all this works since I had to do it live, while juggling luggage and making sure I ended up on the right flight and in the right seat. There’s no way to simulate different scenarios or test something again. So, if I’ve missed something in this description of using boarding passes in Wallet, please let me know in the comments. Finally, what if you lose or break your iPhone, with all your travel documents on it, during your trip? If that happened to me while en route, I’d go to the nearest airline desk to see if they could print me a new boarding pass. And if it happened in the middle of my trip, which seems more likely, I’d try to get to the airport early for my departure, so there would be extra time to check in for the flight and get a printed boarding pass. If you have ever experienced such an iPhone disaster, leaving you without a boarding pass or information about your itinerary, tell us in the comments how you worked around the problem.

If you’re still printing boarding passes on paper because you think that using your iPhone would be too hard, think again. Airline apps and Apple’s Wallet app have improved significantly over the years, and the process is now easier than fussing with printed boarding passes. Adam Engst walks you through it. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Lutchko  2017-03-13 16:34 I was a road warrior and agree that using Apple wallet can be great. That said, ALWAYS carry a paper copy of your itinerary with you. You never when your phone starts misbehaving, or runs out of power (evening flights), etc. Sometimes, though, I found it hard lugging a carry-on with one hand, toting a small computer backpack, and then juggling the phone with my non-dominant hand to show the flight attendant my seat assignment--it almost fell between the jetway and the plane (would have landed on the tarmac!). That would not have been good. Another consideration, if traveling internationally I may be tempted to backup my phone using iTunes and restore it to factory settings just to prevent a possible Customs and Immigration privacy invasion, not so much because I'm paranoid but more out of principle. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:17 Good point. In fact the NBC Nightly News had a story tonight (13 Mar 17) on the CBP demanding the phones and passwords of US Citizens at both land and air entry points. Reply Paul Albert  2017-03-13 20:56 I mean really all that trouble. Just print it out, fold it up and put in your wallet. Sometimes all this tech stuff just gets in the way of life. Flying is already stressful-why deal with this. Another headache. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:35 I always found the paper boarding passes much more stressful. You have to remember to print them out, put them in a location where you won't forget (and my wallet isn't nearly big enough to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper), and then constantly be sorting through them to get the right one for the right leg of the trip. Plus, you have to take them out and put them back repeatedly as you go through security and (sometimes) check in, and if you have any other papers with you, it's easy for them to get mixed up together. And of course, paper boarding passes don't update with new gate or time information. The iPhone is always in my right front pocket or in my hand, and the Apple Watch is always on my wrist. Now that Wallet works well, I find it a much better solution. But hey, if you like the paper, there's nothing stopping you from using it. Reply tonyblunt  2017-03-13 23:11 I used the iPhone for a few years and the process has got much simpler. Now I use the watch, less juggling things but some airlines have code readers that you cannot get your wrist under, hopefully they will upgrade soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 Yes, the scanners do have to be the right orientation for the watch. I didn't have trouble with that on this trip, but on some previous one, it was clear that I wouldn't be able to use the watch and I had to revert back to the iPhone. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:21 Adam, since the CBP is now demanding access to the phones of returning US Citizens, you might as well get the app "Mobile Passport" so you can just give them your phone immediately before 3 of their goons tackle you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:40 Oh, don't get me started... The EFF has a page on privacy at the boarder, and I need to write more about it. http://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-14 01:29 When my husband and I travel together, we always put both of our boarding passes on both phones to provide a backup in case one phone goes on the fritz during the boarding process.

When I do that, I get one itinerary number and Southwest won't let me put the boarding passes on my phone. To fix this, I need to call Southwest and ask them to give each family member a separate itinerary number. They are willing to do this and it fixes the problem. I could probably accomplish the same thing by booking each of the flights separately, but I'm always afraid I won't get the same fare for each flight if I do that. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:39 Interesting! I know I've put boarding passes for multiple people on my iPhone with the United app, but since I've lived in the Northwest and the Northeast, I've never flown Southwest. :-) Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

If you’re still printing boarding passes on paper because you think that using your iPhone would be too hard, think again. Airline apps and Apple’s Wallet app have improved significantly over the years, and the process is now easier than fussing with printed boarding passes. Adam Engst walks you through it.

An ex-Apple employee has shared images with Motherboard showing an 'iPhone Calibration Machine' that is specifically designed to replace the Touch ID sensor and calibrate the camera and display. The repair process includes linking an iPhone to Apple's internal server in order to pair an old device with a new Touch ID sensor - technology that is unavailable to third-party repair stores. Scroll down for video  Apple's weapon that gives it the power to 'monopolize' certain iPhone repairs has been revealed. Motherboard has shared exclusive showing an 'iPhone Calibration Machine' that is specifically designed to replace the Touch ID and calibrate the camera and display REPAIR MACHINE  The iPhone Calibration Machine was created following the release of the iPhone 5s. This machine lets Apple replace the Touch ID when the front of an iPhone needs to be repaired. It lets the firm pair a the Touch ID sensor with the Secure Enclave chip inside of the smartphone. A third-party repair shop can only replace the front of the phone. The old Touch ID sensor must be switched over to the new display. The iPhone Calibration Machine lets Apple monopolize certain iPhone repairs - included calibrating the camera and display.  Motherboard's Jason Koebler obtained the images of the device, which lays hidden in the back of every Apple store from an ex-employee. A separate source told Koebler that the machines went into effect following the release of the iPhone 5s - the handset release before Touch ID was introduced. 'It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard,' a former Apple Genius told him. 'There were different 'molds' that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes … there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. Lots of gas type valves and whatnot. 'It literally looked like some backyard home job. Not very Apple-like at all.' Even if a third-party store could get their hands on the blueprints of the machine, it would be difficult to replicate its abilities.

Considering this is a move only Apple can do, it leaves the firm in control of repairs. The iPhone Calibration Machine connects to an iMac, which links the damaged iPhone to an internal server in order to re-calibrate a Touch ID Center. This allows Apple to pair the new Home button with the Touch ID sensor - something third-parties are unable to do If you smashed your phone's display and take it to a third-party repair shop, it will replace the entire front of the device - except for the Touch ID sensor . The independent store  switches the sensor over to the new display, reports 9to5Mac. This is because the Touch ID sensor is linked with the Secure Enclave chip that sits inside of the smartphone. However, take it directly to an Apple Store and they will replace not just the front display, but also the Touch ID – they have the technology to pair the sensor with the Secure Enclave chip. Motherboard also noted that the iPhone 8 'could effectively monopolize the iPhone repair market and put thousands of independent shops out of business'. The reason being is that Apple's highly-anticipated flagship smartphone is set to toss out the sensor and use a single piece of glass. 'ERROR 53' APPEARED ON PHONES REPAIRED BY THIRD-PARTY FIRMS In February 2016, many iPhone users across the globe reported their handsets have been rendered useless due to a code known as ‘Error 53’. The smartphones affected had been repaired by non-Apple engineers but it effectively 'bricks' them, making them unusable. Following the incident, Seattle-based law firm PCVA had called on users with crippled handsets as a result of the 'Error 53' code to get in touch, with a view to bringing a class action.  It said Apple's move may breach consumer protection laws in the US. 'We believe that Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third party repair shops,' PCVA's website says. Richard Colbey, of Lamb Chambers in London, said Apple's 'Error 53' update could potentially be viewed as an offence under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, which said it is an offence to intentionally destroy someone else's property. 'It is hard to see how something which ceases to work in this way could be said to be of reasonable quality, one of the determinants of which is durability,' he explained on his blog. But freelance technology writer Charles Arthur explained: 'The "property" argument isn’t a great one, to be honest. 'Apple sells you a device, but it doesn’t give you untrammelled rights to it; you aren’t legally allowed to (try to) decompile the software, or the firmware, or to dig into things like the Secure Elements. 'You don’t own the entire thing.'    Read more: This Is Apple¿s Mysterious ¿iPhone Calibration Machine¿ - Motherboard Class Action Lawsuit Filed over Apple iPhone 'Error 53' Explaining the iPhone¿s #error53, and why it puts Apple between conspiracy and rock-hard security (updated) | The Overspill: when there's more that I want to say Share or comment on this article e-mail 136 shares Most watched News videos Terrifying video of 737 pilot fighting strong winds to land airliner No handshake for Merkel!

By Jonathon Dornbush Apple has now launched a new section of the App Store designed specifically to highlight its curated selection of indie games for iPhone and iPad. The new Indie Games section of the App Store will be refreshed regularly, shining a spotlight on a mix of newly debuting indie games, as well as previously released titles from the years’ of iOS game releases. Games included in the Indie Game selection will continue to be promoted on the main App Store and Game pages as well, and in the lead-up to the page’s launch, Apple has been spotlighting a number of new releases on iOS, including Kingdom: New Lands, Oxenfree, and Mushroom 11, ahead of the section's launch. “The new showcase is fantastic news for indie gaming. Apple has always been a champion for indie games, and many of the biggest titles through the years were the product of small independent teams,” Itay Keren, creator of Mushroom 11 told IGN. “I'm extremely proud to have Mushroom 11 as one of the first titles featured here. “Apple is helping to redefine mobile gaming, bringing a larger spectrum of works to their audiences, and growing the number and types of players seeking unique experiences in their store.” iOS has been home to some developers for years, like NimbleBit, the company behind, Tiny Tower, Pocket Planes, and the recently released and spotlighted Bit City, as well as Zach Gage, whose work includes SpellTower, Ridiculous Fishing, and TypeShift, which will be released on the App Store on March 18. And for those longtime developers, like Gage, they have seen Apple continue to support independent developers over the years and through many changes to the App Store and the mobile gaming market. “I can't think of another curated platform that has undergone the scale changes that iOS has gone through that makes such an effort to keep everything relatively democratized,” Zach Gage said speaking to IGN. “Of course indies were getting featured all the time when the platform was new and sparse, but to see them still being featured often when we're competing with games that literally make a million dollars a day is pretty astonishing.” NimbleBit’s David Marsh also spoke to the App Store’s ability to reach players directly with Apple’s support in the mobile space. “Starting in 2008 with a newly opened App Store, we have been privileged to be able to publish games directly to our players and fans, without a middle-man or publisher telling us what to do,” Marsh said. “It's been an amazing journey that wouldn't have been possible without Apple and the App Store, and one I hope will continue for another decade to come.” For more on recent iOS indie releases, check out our original review of Mushroom 11 and IGN’s original Oxenfree review.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | March 16, 2017 -- 20:03 GMT (13:03 PDT) | Topic: Mobile OS Pebble aspired to be the "Swatch of smartwatches" but ultimately couldn't compete against Apple's watchOS. Now, Swatch itself is taking on the Cupertino tech giant. The Swatch Group announced Thursday that it's developing its own wearables operating system to compete with Apple's watchOS and Google's Android Wear, according to reports. The company, in partnership with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, will focus on developing wearables that are secure and low-power, Swatch CEO Nick Hayek told reporters. Battery life has been one of the biggest weaknesses of smartwatches so far. "In Switzerland we have a lot of expertise when it comes to creating something that is smaller, consumes much less energy, is independent and more cost-efficient and can go into little objects," Hayek said, Reuters reports. The company should roll out the OS via its Tissot brand in late 2018, according to Bloomberg. Traditional watchmakers have suffered as Apple's smartwatch has overtaken the market. The Apple Watch currently accounts for half of all smartwatch sales, according to researchers at Canalys, and took in nearly 80 percent of total smartwatch revenues in Q4 2016. While Swatch is striking out on its own, Tag Heuer -- another Swiss brand -- earlier this week unveiled a high-end Android Wear smartwatch. While these traditional brands try to catch up, the smartwatch market is expected to grow at a relatively slow pace, according to analyst group Jupiter, with less than 60 million smartwatches expected to be shipped annually by 2021.

If Japanese analysts are to be asked, however, they believe Tim Cook’s company will be unveiling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 as early as next week. Just this Wednesday, Japanese blog Mac Otakara published a report about Apple’s alleged plan for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro successor. The blog, citing local analysts’ predictions, stated that Apple could be launching the new tablet next week. This prediction seems suspicious, however, because the analysts did not provide the reason. Also, there hasn’t been any information confirming that Samsung’s biggest rival has scheduled a media event for the said week. Mac Otakara’s report was its response to MacRumors’ previous story about a research firm’s statement concerning the launch of the new Apple products. The well-known firm reportedly claimed that Cook’s company is announcing new products in the week that starts on March 20. However, the firm did not mention which products would these be. MacRumors has already published an updated story and this time it is saying that the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will likely be announced via a press release and not at a formal launch event. Backing up this new claim, the Apple-centric news site said there isn’t a need to hold a press event for something that’s just an iterative upgrade. After all, the new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 is very similar to the original one save for the inclusion of a faster Apple A10x chip and the addition of quad microphones. In addition to the 9.7-inch model, Apple is also believed to be introducing a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a new line of iPads with 10.5-inch displays. For the 10.5-inch model, it is being speculated to have the same form factor as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The only noticeable difference is the reduced size of the bezels to accommodate the larger screen, as per Apple Insider. There are also rumblings that Apple is preparing to launch a red iPhone 7, a 128GB iPhone SE and new models of the Apple Watch smartwatch. Whether these three will be introduced alongside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 via a press release or not is still unknown. What’s certain is that Apple will unlikely wait for WWDC 2017 in June to announce them. iPadMore Apple is said to announce its 9.7-inch iPad Pro next week.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive YouTube star and voice actor Brian Hull takes to the High Desert Thursday Mar 16, 2017 at 12:52 PM Mar 16, 2017 at 12:52 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — YouTube celebrity and voice actor Brian Hull said he was amazed by the “small town feel” of the High Desert and its ability to serve up one of his favorite foods. “I’m from Texas and I grew up on biscuits and gravy,” said Hull, 25, as he looked down at his breakfast at Mollie’s Kountry Kitchen in Apple Valley. “I live in L.A. and the people in my neighborhood know kale and sprouts, but not biscuits and gravy.” Hull sat down with the Daily Press before his appearance at Apple Valley Little League’s 60th Opening Day Anniversary on Saturday and shared a bit about his newfound stardom. A voice impressionist since he was in elementary school, Hull began uploading Pixar and Disney movie-related impression videos to YouTube seven years ago where he amassed a small fan base. But the music major from Dallas Baptist University didn’t strike gold until 2014 when his "Disney and Pixar Sings Let it Go” video went viral. “I did the 'Let it Go' video as part of a Disney contest to win a $100 gift card,” said Hull, as he enjoyed his breakfast. “I missed the deadline, but my YouTube channel exploded with views and new subscribers. It was totally crazy.” A short time later, Hull was contacted by a Disney representative who told him his video was fantastic and that he probably would have won the contest if he had made the deadline. Today, Hull has over a half-million YouTube subscribers and his "Disney and Pixar Sings Let it Go” video has just over 27 million views, with his “Disney and Pixar Sings Moana Medley” heading for the 1 million mark after being uploaded about two weeks ago. “Does everybody here wear cowboy hats? It kind of reminds me of home,” asked Hull as two gentlemen entered the eatery wearing white Stetsons. “Biscuits and gravy, and cowboy hats in Apple Valley — I need to come here more often.” Hull said his first successful impression was the voice of Pikachu, with the voices of Donald Duck and Winnie the Pooh the hardest to perfect. Hull’s voice impressions have been so spot on that a variety of Disney characters at Disneyland have taken notice. During one visit, the Donald Duck character “became jealous” when Hull began talking to Daisy Duck using Donald’s voice, Hull said jokingly. “You just have to keep listening and practicing until you get it right,” Hull said. “It’s part talent, part special gift and a lot of training and hard work.” A kid at heart, Hull chuckled when he explained that a common cold and allergies are his “kryptonite” that always wreak havoc on his voice. Hull said he’s finally beginning to understand and love “L.A. culture” while keeping busy with performance auditions, video planning, voice prep work and working part time at a local Disney store. “Sometimes I do collab songs with other singers, but when I record, my crew is basically me, my camera and tripod,” Hull said. “So far, nothing has crashed on me while recording, but if it did I wouldn’t know how to fix it.” A trained classical singer, Hull’s vocal talents, without the impressions, can be heard on the “If I Never Knew You (Pocahontas) Georgia Merry & Brian Hull Cover” video which was released on Georgia Merry’s YouTube channel on Wednesday. Hull said he misses his family and friends in Texas, but has been “blessed” to find a new group of friends and church family in the Los Angeles area. “If I wasn’t doing vocal impressions for a living, I’d be a minister or work in youth ministry,” Hull said. “I love serving and connecting with people. Whatever I do, I do it for the glory of God.” As Hull stood near the restaurant’s front counter, cashier Joey Moran smiled at him and said, “Excuse me, but you look really familiar. Are you that YouTube voice guy?” At James Woody Park, Hull used several voice impressions, including Goofy, Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, as he shared a bit of team inspiration with hundreds of Little Leaguers. “This reminds me of my Little League days when I used to play the outfield and daydream about the future,” Hull told the Daily Press. “You know, sometimes those dreams turn into reality.” For more information on Brian Hull, visit www.youtube.com/brianhullvoices or www.facebook.com/brianhullsvoice.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Popular Searches Chesapeake Energy Corp CHK ▼ 5.29 -0.16 -2.94% Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel Corp. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. © Corinne Gretler BC-SWATCH-OPERATING-SYSTEM “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. Shares of Swatch rose 1.4 percent as of 1:24 p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 19.4 billion francs ($19.5 billion). Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets as it published its annual report. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 percent to 9 percent this year. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Now, however, there’s evidence in developer logs that Apple may be working on the next generation Apple TV. According to the co-founder of Firi Games, an iOS and tvOS gaming company, an Apple TV with device identifier “AppleTV 6,2” has been spotted in usage logs. The identifier reportedly has an IP that locates close to Apple’s headquarters, making it a possible future Apple TV hardware upgrade. The current fourth-generation Apple TV carries the “AppleTV 5,3” identifier so this could be the next logical step. In addition to the identifier, “AppleTV 6,2” is also reportedly running tvOS 11. Apple is currently seeding the tvOS 10.2 beta to developers and tvOS 11 would be the next major update to the operating system. However, we haven’t heard much in terms of what the software may pack. In terms of hardware, the new Apple TV could possibly support 4K resolutions, as the current generation only supports 1080p. Aside from that, there hasn’t been much. If a new model is truly on the horizon, it’s likely that Apple will upgrade the internals, possibly packing an A10X SoC.

Thanks to Apple, they’ll soon be getting prime real estate on Apple’s storefront. Apple will launch a dedicated section on the App Store Thursday that exclusively showcases games from indie developers, according to Polygon. The permanent update comes after Apple’s current sale on indie titles. For the promotion, Apple offered discounts on titles including platformer VVVVVV and puzzler Prune . As with other App Store sections, indie games will be curated by Apple’s existing App Store editorial team. Check out our indies sale, going on ’til 3/20. Road Not Taken and more amazing games are just 99¢. https://t.co/L9XnoHYbnt pic.twitter.com/9VbczU1Njk — App Store Games (@AppStoreGames) March 13, 2017 Many developers have been strong supporters of Apple’s move. Untame president Itay Keren told GamesIndustry that Apple’s championing of indie titles is a clear upside for the industry. Read: Apple Will Allow Developers To Respond To App Store Reviews "This window to independent work provides exposure to new artists, as well as to the art itself,” Keren said. “Mobile gaming has not really been synonymous with art, but the true innovation and creativity has come from the indies. So, by providing this ongoing exposure of these games to such a large audience, you're going to broaden the taste of gamers and possibly even transform the very definition of what mobile games are.” Apple’s high-profile endorsement of indie games puts the company in line with other major app stores. Google’s Play Store has a similar Indie Corner section where it exclusively showcases games from indie developers. For mobile gamers and general users, the move is a nice touch and offers Apple the chance to highlight games from both major and indie developers.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady JPMorgan Chase purchases CurrentC, looks to develop technology for further use Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Monday, March 13th, 2017, 05:07 Category: Apple Pay, Finance, iOS, News, retail If you were curious as to what happened to CurrentC, the intended mobile payment service that was intended to compete with Apple Pay a few years ago, there’s an answer: JPMorgan bought it out. Oddly enough, Chase Bank played both sides and was one of a few major banks to partner with Apple when Apple Pay launched back in the fall of 2014, but several retailers including CVS and Walmart blocked or denied plans to accept Apple Pay due to an upcoming CurrentC app and commitments to MCX, the company developing CurrentC. Some CurrentC backers including Rite Aid and Best Buy eventually changed their course and added Apple Pay as a payment option in stores, and last summer efforts to bring CurrentC to market finally ended. Chase currently remains an Apple Pay backer, although its in-house payment service, knows as “Chase Pay”, is based on MCX technology. Although CurrentC is dead, JPMorgan Chase says it has acquired MCX to help bring Chase Pay to more retailers. MCX’s members were already connected to MCX payments technology, which made it seamless to connect to Chase Pay. Chase executives wanted to acquire the technology to use in lieu of building separate parallel technology to serve non-MCX members. At present, only a few retailers currently accept CurrentC, especially given its QR code-based payment option. Best Buy and Starbucks, for example, accept both Apple Pay and were launch partners for Chase Pay, while JPMorgan Chase says Walmart, Shell, or other MCX members will start accepting Chase Pay in the future. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jason Samenow By Jason Samenow March 16 Follow @capitalweather The Fearless Girl statue stands in the snow March 14 in New York. (Don Emmert/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) Early this week, the National Weather Service badly missed a snowstorm forecast for New York City. It predicted 12 to 18 inches of snow, and seven inches fell. It was the second errant snow forecast in the Big Apple in three years. In January 2015, it predicted 24 to 36 inches of snow, and 10 inches fell. But Louis Uccellini, director of the Weather Service, is standing behind his forecasters. He says the forecast was complex and that the Weather Service forecasters communicated critical information that allowed the city to be ready for what turned out to be a nasty storm, despite the lower-than-predicted snow amounts. [Record snow in the Northeast, record cold in the South: Inside winter’s revenge tour] In every Northeast snowstorm, there are places that are easier to predict snowfall amounts for and those that are more challenging. The challenging locations are those along transition points in the storm — typically either where the rain-snow line sets up or where the heaviest precipitation starts and stops. Just slight movement in these razor-sharp zones can make the difference between just a little snow and a ton of snow. In both this week’s storm and the 2015 event, the Big Apple shifted in and out of these zones as the storm approached. When the margin for error in forecasts is so small, forecasting uncertainty becomes critical. After the 2015 event, in which the Weather Service communication of uncertainty was deemed inadequate, Uccellini said: “It is incumbent on us to communicate forecast uncertainty. We need to make the uncertainties clear. We’re going to review this very carefully and assess a different approach as we deal with these types of storms.” Yet here we are, two years later, and the Weather Service is again facing questions about whether it is doing an adequate job in communicating uncertainty in high-stakes forecasts. [Weather Service made poor decision in overplaying nor’easter snow predictions] I sent questions to Uccellini about the challenges this storm posed and how the agency is working to improve how it communicates these difficult forecasts. His responses have been lightly edited for length. Capital Weather Gang: What is causing these large forecast errors? Uccellini: Predicting winter storms, their track, intensity and rapid intensification, precipitation types and amounts have proved to be one of the more challenging forecasts the entire weather community has to deal with. The predicted snowfalls did accumulate tens of miles to the west of major cities, in some cases with record amounts. The preparations we witnessed for this storm were prudent for the major cities in the storm’s path. The commutes were expected to be dangerous, the impact to transit was well-forecast in advance, and appropriate decisions were made for public safety on the ground and in the air. This, despite the lower than expected snow totals. [In these] two events, the model forecasts leading up to the events show extraordinary variability in the track and intensity of the storm right up to the time they begin impacting the major metropolitan areas along the East Coast. I’m incredibly proud of the work of our forecasters at NWS and meteorologists in the whole weather industry for their dedication to public safety during these events as they have to grapple with all of the complexities noted above. I’m not going to second-guess their forecast decisions. But we have to work to understand the nature of the forecast uncertainties associated with these types of storms and insure we are communicating the potential range of scenarios and the more likely outcome. This is especially true with respect to the interaction with government officials at every level who make important lifesaving decisions as they prepare communities for the impacts of the impending major storm systems. Three out of four blizzard warnings for NYC in the past four years have verified. We may not have met the blizzard criteria for this storm within the New York City metropolitan area, and we will review the use of the blizzard warnings, but we all have to remember that this forecast miss is measured in tens of miles in the storm track and related to the interaction of small scale physical processes that continue to challenge the forecast and research communities alike. CWG: Is the Weather Service over-relying on the American (GFS) model, which over-predicted snow amounts for Tuesday’s storm? Uccellini: The forecasters in the NWS and throughout the weather enterprise have access to and use a number of modeling systems, including their ensemble counterparts, from around the globe. The GFS was actually the first to point to the track of this storm coming up the East Coast. But as it turns out, not close enough to the coast (in this case, the Canadian Model was the first global model to track this storm immediately along the coastline, and thus sweep the warmer air aloft further inland from the Carolinas up into NYC and Long Island into New England). The global models were struggling with this storm because of the amplification and phasing of separate trough systems; indeed a complex upper air pattern that lends itself to predictability challenges. As we approached the Sunday-Monday time frame, the models seemed to move back and forth between a solution set that would keep the major metropolitan areas in heavy wind-driven snow, and solutions that moved that snow area inland as the coast was marked by a sharp boundary between snow, sleet and then rain. Forecasting this type of rain/snow line is a classic challenge for forecasters, as well as researchers and modelers. We’d love to be able to get this particular type of forecast pinned down. We knew there would be a sharp gradient. On a broad scale, we were communicating about the potential and uncertainties 8-9 days in advance. Forecasting at the mesoscale ow moved 50 miles further west than expected. And the rest as they say is history. CWG: Do you think the Weather Service was effective as it needed to be in communicating uncertainty for this event? Uccellini: There are uncertainties in every forecast. We try to convey a range of possibilities in events such as these, and those uncertainties were communicated in our least/likely/most predictions. We’ve made a lot of improvements in this area over the last couple of years as we’ve learned how our information could be used for impact-based decision support services. Our core partners base their decisions on a worse-case scenario because they can’t be wrong. And they are beginning these preparations further ahead in time, which means they have to increasingly rely on forecasts at longer lead times and account for the related larger uncertainties in those forecasts, especially for extreme events that depend on certain processes coming together just right to produce the intense storms that threaten communities. In order to account for the range of possibilities, as we approach the onset of a storm system, we provide to them the best, worst and most likely scenarios. Risk assessments are made and decisions are made based on those assessments. We believe we are getting better at communicating the uncertainties. But clearly there is more work to be done. And part of our new way of communicating is a focus on impacts. For this storm, we knew there would be major impacts in metropolitan areas. Overall, I believe the preparations and on-the-ground decisions were reasonable, facilitated cleanup efforts, and likely prevented accidents. CWG: Is it even possible for the Weather Service to communicate uncertainty when it issues a “Blizzard Warning”? On Twitter, the New York City Weather Service did not communicate uncertainty information. Uccellini: Last year we held off with issuing warnings until the day before the storm because of the large uncertainties associated with the sharply defined northern boundary of heavy snowfall and whether that line separated heavy snow from no snow, or if it would be north or south of New York City. We got some criticism for holding back, with some folks questioning our strategy. Blizzard warnings have been expanded. Winter Storm Warnings continue for eastern Suffolk County pic.twitter.com/zNDVFfeazT — NWS New York NY (@NWSNewYorkNY) March 13, 2017 This year, we went out further in advance with a blizzard warning for NYC and Long Island. We’ll be looking at this strategy and thinking about what other approaches we should consider. There is a general push in our forecast offices to lean forward and be more aggressive, to offer more lead time for warnings as requested by our partners. For some events, we are able to do so with certainty. This event demonstrates that sometimes our level of confidence and precision isn’t always where we’d like it to be. We’ll review this and consider strategies — working with social scientists — for deciding on the timing of issuing warnings when we are caught between predictability and uncertainty. CWG: What is the NWS doing to improve these forecasts and their communication? Uccellini: Our Eastern Region headquarters is going to review this snowstorm and specifically how we handled the blizzard warnings. The results of this review will be considered by leaders within our agency as the larger policy issues are brought forward. Again, I think we handled the issuance of the blizzard warning correctly for the 2016 storm by holding off on issuing warnings until the night before because of the uncertainty of the sharp boundary across NYC. For that case, waiting until we were sure the night before the onset of the storm worked for emergency managers. But we have to acknowledge that there is no magic bullet for every storm. Certain types of storms are more predictable than others as even you alluded to in your detailed summary of the forecast challenges for the Washington D.C. area, and in the end, that factor could play a dominant role in how we proceed. Let me end here by noting after reviewing a hundred or so storms, every event is different. For this event, we succeeded as we successfully alerted the public a week in advance to the potential for a major winter storm along the East Coast. And we should continue to recognize, and remind ourselves, that the mesoscale complexities associated with these major winter storms before, during and after their development and subsequent evolution will pose forecast challenges now and the foreseeable future, for all of us. 20+ Comments  Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet Share via Email Jason is the Washington Post’s weather editor and Capital Weather Gang's chief meteorologist.

Markets Mar 16, 2017, 13:48 ET Share this article DUBLIN, Mar 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "Application Processor Packaging Comparison - Flyer: Technical Comparison Analysis" report to their offering. In this report, we highlight the differences and the innovations of the packages chosen by the end-user OEMs. Whereas some AP providers like for HiSilicon or Samsung choose to consider conventional PoP with embedded land-side capacitor (LSC), others like Apple or Qualcomm use innovative technologies like Fan-Out PoP and silicon based Deep Trench LSC or embedded die packaging with advanced PCB substrate. The detailed comparison between the four players will give the pros and the cons of the packaging technologies. Five major players are sharing the smartphone application processors (AP) market. Among them, Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung and HiSilicon propose the most powerful AP. They use almost the same technology node for the die, and the innovation is now at the packaging level. During this year, we observed different technologies inside the four main smartphone flagships: classic Package-on-Package (PoP) developed by Amkor for the Kirin 955 and for the Exynos 8, Molded Core Embedded Package (MCeP) technology developed by Shinko for the Snapdragon 820 and integrated Fan-Out packaging (inFO) developed by TSMC for the A10. Located under the DRAM chip on the main board, the AP are packaged using PoP technology. The Apple A10 can be found in the iPhone 7 series. The HiSilicon Kirin 955 can be found in the Huawei P9 and the Samsung Exynos 8 as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 can be found in the Samsung Galaxy S7 series depending on the world version (US and Asia for the Snapdragon and International for the Exynos). This report also compares the costs of the different approaches and includes a detailed technical comparison between the packaging structure of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, the Samsung Exynos 8, the HiSilicon Kirin 955 and the Apple A10.

During the first day, they successfully demonstrated exploits against Microsoft Edge, Apple's Safari, Adobe Reader, and Ubuntu Desktop. The Pwn2Own contest runs every year during the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver, Canada. It's organized and sponsored by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), an exploit acquisition program operated by Trend Micro after its acquisition of TippingPoint. This year the contest has a prize pool of US$1 million for exploits in five categories: virtual machines (VMware Workstation and Microsoft Hyper-V); web browser and plugins (Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Flash Player running in Edge); local escalation of privilege (Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu Desktop); enterprise applications (Adobe Reader, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) and server side (Apache Web Server on Ubuntu Server). On the contest's first day, two teams managed to take down Adobe Reader and combined other Windows kernel flaws into their attacks to achieve system-level privilege escalation. The team from Chinese security company 360 Security won $50,000 for their exploit chain, and the team from China-based internet company Tencent won $25,000. Apple's Safari was also exploited two times, first by a team made up of researchers Samuel Groß and Niklas Baumstark and later in the day by a team from the security research lab of China-based Chaitin Technology. Both attacks combined different vulnerabilities resulting in arbitrary code execution as root on Apple's macOS. The Groß and Baumstark attack chain was considered only a partial success and was rewarded with $28,000, compared to $35,000 for Chaitin's exploit. The Tencent security team also hacked Microsoft Edge and used a second bug to escape the browser's sandbox. Edge, along with Chrome, are considered the hardest browsers to hack due to their sandbox mechanisms. Tencent won $80,000 for its Edge exploit and later tried to hack Chrome too, but failed to complete its exploit chain in the allotted time. The Chaitin Security Research Lab team also successfully demonstrated a kernel privilege escalation on Ubuntu Desktop that earned them $15,000. There were also a few other failures and withdrawals. A researcher named Richard Zhu targeted Safari on macOS but failed to complete his attack in time. Researcher Ralf-Philipp Weinmann withdrew from his attempt to hack Microsoft Edge, and the Tencent team withdrew from their plan to demonstrate a privilege escalation on Windows. No one attacked the hypervisors or the Apache web server yet, but the contest runs for one more day. A successful virtual machine escape is worth $100,000 and a compromise of Ubuntu Server through an Apache exploit will be rewarded with $200,000. The researchers are required to share their exploits with the organizers who then share them with the affected software vendors so they can be patched. Trend Micro also uses the information to create detection signatures for its TippingPoint intrusion prevention systems. ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Let’s Talk iOS 178: The big show   skip to main content skip to main menu     New report says iPhone 8 has a slightly curved display at the edges below 2.5D cover glass By Christian Zibreg, Mar 16, 2017 Tweet 10 Comments Nikkei Asian Review yesterday shot down predictions by IHS Markit analyst Wayne Lam and DisplayMate expert Dr. Raymond Soneira who said Apple’s 5.8-inch iPhone 8 will use a flat rather than a curved display. However, MacRumors has allegedly confirmed with multiple people familiar with the matter that the phone will indeed come outfitted with a mostly flat AMOLED display. The device’s display will reportedly feature slightly curved left and right edges in order to conform with the layer of 2.5D glass that covers the screen. Curly, not curved? “MacRumors has confirmed the report refers to a display that is slightly curved at the edges below 2.5D cover glass, meaning the display itself cannot be dramatically curved,” reads the report. IHS Markit’s Wayne Lam predicted Monday that Apple’s Tenth Anniversary iPhone would adopt “a flat implementation of OLED design on their special iPhone model, which is analogous to the current 2.5D glass design.” If iPhone 8 ends up having a display with gentler curves than Samsung’s Edge phones, the display won’t provide new user-facing features aside from a rumored function area at the bottom for accessing app shortcuts. That may actually be a good thing. Fully curved displays with 3D cover glass don’t fare well in drop performance tests as the curved areas shatter easily. Apple’s 2.5D glass solution, based on a flexible substrate, could perform much better in drop tests that Samsung’s Edge devices. Just what is 2.5D screen glass? Also known as a contoured edge, 2.5D design allows the cover glass to sit atop the rest of the device’s body rather than being secured behind a slightly raised bezel, creating a more seamless edge appearance. A small curve can be used to make the edge of the glass feel smooth, as opposed to a larger curve that may look more stylish. Some vendors actually bend the display itself to create a more noticeable 3D effect, as we’ve seen with Samsung’s Edge handsets. 2.5D glass is manufactured in much the same was as a straight glass panel, with the exception of an additional processing layer used to trim and smooth the edges of the glass. As such, 2.5D displays typically benefit from hardening and strengthening manufacturing techniques. 2.5D design is featured on the iPhone 6/6s/7 series. Both KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo and Chinese research firm TrendForce previously said they expected iPhone 8 to have the same 2.5D glass for display cover as the current models. Yesterday, Nikkei Asian Review said the screen curvature of iPhone 8 may be gentler than Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge series due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens.

Let’s Talk iOS 178: The big show   skip to main content skip to main menu     Seventh betas of iOS 10.3 and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 now available By Christian Zibreg, Mar 16, 2017 Tweet 5 Comments Apple on Thursday seeded seventh betas of what would become the third major software update to iOS 10 and the fourth major update to macOS Sierra 10.12.4. Members of the Apple Developer Program can now install iOS 10.3 beta 7 (build 14E5277a) and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 7 (build 16E191a) over the air, via the Software Update mechanism, on devices with a special configuration profile that’s available through Apple’s portal for developers. iOS 10.3 beta 6 (build14E5273a) and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta 6 (build 16E189a) both released to Apple’s registered developers on March 17. tvOS 10.2 beta 6 (build 14W5264a) and watchOS 3.2 beta 6 were seeded to developers the following day. iOS 10.3 features iOS 10.3 brings several new outward-facing features along with bug fixes, performance improvements and security enhancements. A Find My AirPods feature lets you locate a misplaced earbud in the Find My iPhone app. A one-handed floating iPad keyboard was discovered in iOS 10.3 code (try it out yourself!), but it’s unclear whether Apple will expose it to users when the software update launches for public consumption. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube A new App Compatibility section in Settings will name and shame legacy apps. A reworded prompt cautions you that 32-bit apps won’t work with future versions of iOS unless they’re updated, indicating iOS 11 will be 64-bit only. Read more about the new App Compatibility section here. iOS 10.3 will permit apps to update their icon to convey various states right on the Home screen, without requiring an update. For example, an app could refresh its icon after you upgrade to its full version via the In-App Purchase mechanism. Other notable changes in iOS 10.3 include: Apple File System iCloud Analytics opt-in feature Redesigned iCloud section, now at the top of the Settings app Siri and CarPlay improvements Reduce Motion for websites Settings toggle to disable in-app ratings and reviews Hourly forecast in Maps Navigation improvements for Mail’s Conversation View Easier typing on Chinese and Japanese keyboards When iOS 10.3 ships to customers, app makers will be finally able to respond to customer reviews on App Store in a way that is available for everyone to see. A new toggle in Settings will let you disable in-app prompts asking you to post a review on App Store. This switch will only effect apps that use Apple’s new Reviews API. For the full list of changes in iOS 10.3, be sure to check out this article. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 features macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings Night Shift Mode to your Mac. Night Shift mode was originally designed to help iOS users adjust the temperature of their display from cool to warm, manually or based on the time of day. You can access Night Shift for Mac in System Preferences, Notification Center or via Siri. A dedicated preference pane lets you adjust when your Mac’s display should start gradually shifting from blue to yellow to cut down on exposure to blue light, which is said to cause sleeping problems. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube In addition to Night Shift, macOS Sierra 10.12.4 includes Dictation support for Shanghainese, an updated PDF API fixing a few annoying bugs and a new iCloud Analytics feature while enabling Siri look-ups of Cricket schedules, scores and rosters for two new cricket leagues and other perks. Aside from members of the Apple Developer Program, macOS and iOS betas are available for public beta testing to those enrolled to Apple’s Beta Software Program. We’ll update the article with any changes found in the latest betas.

Let’s Talk iOS 178: The big show   skip to main content skip to main menu     Next-generation Apple TV running tvOS 11 spotted in usage logs By Christian Zibreg, Mar 16, 2017 Tweet 6 Comments An unreleased model of the Apple TV set-top box running tvOS 11, the next major revision to the device’s operating system, has appeared in developer logs, as first spotted by co-founder and programmer at Firi Games, a Dutch studio that creates games for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. A device carrying the “AppleTV 6,2” identifier reportedly uses an IP address suggesting it’s being tested in Cupertino. For the comparison’s sake, the fourth-generation Apple TV carries the “AppleTV 5,3” identifier. The identifier definitely indicates that Apple has been testing fifth-generation Apple TV hardware for quite some time now. Bloomberg in February 2017 learned that a 4K-capable Apple TV refresh is being tested for release later this year. The current Apple TV model runs tvOS 10. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Apple is currently testing tvOS 10.2, a mostly bug-fix update with a few improvements like improved Siri Remote scrolling through really long lists, smoother user interface animations and more. With accelerated scrolling behavior, scrolling through a bunch of items in apps will now use iOS-like acceleration. In other words, long lists will scroll faster the more you swipe on your Siri Remote. Apple will preview tvOS 11 along with iOS 11 and the next major versions of macOS and watchOS at its annual conference for developers, which takes place this year in San Jose and kicks off with a keynote on June 5. Source: @Tijmen on Twitter Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Bloomberg: 4K-capable Apple TV being tested for release as soon as this year Apple seeds beta 6 of watchos 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 Apple seeds fifth betas of iOS 10.3, watchOS 3.2 and tvOS 10.2 Apple also seeds third betas of tvOS 10.2 and watchOS 3.2 to developers Related Topics Apple, Apple TV, Apple TV 5, News, Rumors, tvOS, tvOS 11 Ramon Hopefully this one will support 4K content. Something that I would like to see is being able to use the lightning earpods with Siri Remote like the Roku remote. Oscar (kitsune.work) 4K is available and people want it, so Apple shouldn’t wait years to include it. Personally I couldn’t care less. It makes no sense why they couldn’t enable this in the current AppleTV though. ravinigga I have still 1080p display but output max 720p. So I can wait several years until my tv is total broken 5723alex . I am never going to replace my Pioneer Kuro Plasma 1080p with a crap 4K LCD. Wolff Had the 500M model.

(Reuters file) '315' show has previously named and shamed firms from Apple to Volkswagen China's annual consumer rights day television show turned its spotlight on US sports brand Nike for misleading advertising and Japanese brand Muji for selling food products allegedly sourced from part of Japan affected by radiation. The state-run China Central Television (CCTV) show - which can have brands and their corporate PR teams scurrying to take evasive action - said Nike had misled consumers over high-tech air cushions in some of its Hyperdunk basketball shoes. Similar to CBS network's 60 Minutes in the United States, the CCTV show - known as 315 in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15 - has previously named and shamed firms from Apple to Volkswagen. The two-hour show - a mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance - also highlighted Japanese brands including Muji, owned by Ryohin Keikaku, which it said sold food products in China from an area of Tokyo where high levels of radiation were detected in 2015. A Ryohin Keikaku spokesman said on Thursday the firm was "not selling any food products in China from areas banned from exporting due to concerns about radioactive contamination". Muji's China website said it was a misunderstanding, as the company's registered address and the food production site were different. Nike said in a statement it had sold 300 pairs of Hyperdunk shoes in China last year with "an inaccurate product description stating that the shoe contained airbags". The firm added it had apologised to consumers and offered compensation. "We will fully cooperate with the government regulators regarding their inquiries," the company said. The Greater China region accounts for over 10 percent of Nike's global sales. The show also took aim at fake eye doctors for scamming patients, animal breeders for over-using medicines to make animals grow faster, and China's Wikipedia-like Baike.com. The 315 show can hit a firm's reputation if singled out for bad corporate behaviour. Apple was forced into a rare apology in 2013 after criticism on the show of its China after-sales service. "Pretty much all the big corporations have their PR machines ready to jump into action because they've seen what happens when companies are not prepared," said James Feldkamp, Shanghai-based CEO of independent China consumer watchdog Mingjian. While the annual programme has lost some of its bite in recent years, Wednesday's version was harder hitting than last year's, which criticised local food delivery apps, fake online sales and dodgy false teeth, but didn't take aim at any major international firms. However, many in China steered clear of the show altogether, while online chatter was more muted than in previous years. Viewers who tuned in said they were underwhelmed by the show's corporate exposes and any impact would likely be short-lived. "This year's show was a laughing stock, there weren't any really big cases in there," posted one user on Sina Weibo using the name Master Tan Xi. "Why do they bother still holding it?"

She wasn’t wrong. About two days prior, I had decided to become a working drag queen. Those 37 hours had not been kind. I’d somehow booked some gigs at a local club, thank God, but visually speaking, I was a complete and total mess. It didn’t have to be this way. I had a sizable wad of cash to spend on my very first look. But when I finally assembled all of the non-refundable new additions to my growing drag closet, I realized I was in trouble. I’d blown most of my money on a sleeveless, below-the-knee, kelly green gown with gold trim and an empire waist — a Hail Mary that ended up being more of an “Oh, Mary … no.” It had pleats. Pleats. I paired it with some peep-toe ankle wedges the color of tartar sauce and a seafoam green wig with a heavy bang. I think I was going for some kind of “Other Boleyn Girl” vibe by way of seapunk? Citation needed from head to toe. After picking up those pieces, I only had enough money left to buy some blush. No foundation. No lipstick. No eyeliner. No lashes. No nails. Just blush. “u started with blush,” my friend texted me after I sent her a photo. “bless u.” NinedayQueen models her green pleated nightmare fuel.DragQueenMerch I should clarify something: I wasn’t actually doing drag irl. That series of Choices™ I just described all took place within the world of “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” a new mobile game that hit app stores on Feb. 23. It’s the brainchild of BibleGirl666, one of New York’s rising drag stars, who has developed an impressive, near “RuPaul’s Drag Race”-level cult following on Instagram and Twitter despite having never appeared on the hit reality show herself. The game mixes casual mini-games with light role-playing elements as you follow your character on the road to drag superstardom. It’s a long road with plenty of level grinding and — unless you’re really good at assessing your needs and making fabulous long-term decisions for yourself — lots of budget-unfriendly bodycon dresses along the way. But it makes for a fun distraction in five- or 10-minute spurts while waiting for the train or for your to-go broccoli and bean curd to finish frying. The game also gives a small peek into just how much work goes into being a professional nightlife entertainer, the hours and hours of unseen labor that goes into making every four-minute, 14-second “Into You” lip sync at your local gay bar look absolutely effortless. ‘u started with blush,’ my friend texted me after I sent her a photo. ‘bless u.’BibleGirl describes her drag aesthetic as being a little bit “TRL” Britney meets a little bit present-day Rihanna, with a heavy dose of Kardashian-Jenner sprinkled throughout. It’s that latter inspiration that’s most apparent in “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” which feels a whole lot like Kim’s super-lucrative mobile game, “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood,” as well as Kendall and Kylie’s aptly titled “Kendall and Kylie.” According to Bible, that similarity is far from coincidental. “I remember reading a bunch of articles back when the Kim K. game came out, about how it really boosted her net worth, and I thought, ‘Hey!’” Bible said. “My boyfriend, Chris, and I saw how drag was starting to evolve as an industry. It was becoming a real market to tap into. ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ found a way to do that through TV, and I wanted to see if I could do that through another medium, like video games.” The story of “BibleGirl’s Big Apple” begins at New York’s hottest club: Port Authority. Your character has just arrived in the city from an unnamed corner of small-town America. They’re greeted by the local welcoming committee — a guy who tries to steal your bag — only to be saved by BibleGirl herself. Good thing she just happened to be hanging around a mostly deserted bus depot at 4 in the morning. BibleGirl666Courtesy BibleGirl666 “I’m a regular,” the game’s namesake and creator joked over coffee at Onieals, a restaurant and bar in downtown New York City. The actual BibleGirl — Bible for short, BibleGirl666 for not-short — is a few years out from her own drag origin story, which involved neither a near-mugging nor a trip to Port Authority. Born and raised in Tampa before finishing high school on Long Island, Bible moved to New York City in 2011 to study womenswear fashion design at FIT. Her design taste proved controversial among students and teachers. “Friends of mine kept trying to have these ‘come to Jesus’ moments with me, like, ‘You need to get your s–t together!’” she said. “They didn’t get what I was doing.” She loved the work of revered designers like Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood, but she also loved what she called the “stuff that shouldn’t be fashion but is” like the crop tops and low-rise jeans falling off the bodies of Y2K-era pop stars. Eventually, she dropped out. Drag sisterhood plays a vital role in ‘BibleGirl’s Big Apple.’She got into drag through straight nightlife, weirdly enough, or what straight people would just call “nightlife.” Then still known solely by the name of her out-of-drag self, Zachary Gottlieb, Bible worked as a club promoter and table host at venues like Avenue and the Dream Downtown. She used Halloween 2013 as an excuse to try drag out in public for the first time. It stuck. After a few more months of dragging up the straight club scene in Manhattan, she booked her first major opportunity across the Williamsburg Bridge. It was at Bizarre Bushwick, a sizable bar just off that five-point Myrtle-Broadway intersection with Mr. Kiwi’s on one side and that one deli with the pretty chandeliers on the other. Excitement turned to anxiety when Bible realized that her then-boyfriend’s ex, a performer named Daphne Sumtimez, was also slated to perform. But the two immediately struck up a friendship, and, like a scene out of some “First Wives Club” fan fiction where the first and second wives realize they’re cool with each other and just hang out and have a good time, a sisterhood was formed. Through this friendship and many others, Bible found opportunities to perform all over Brooklyn and the Lower East Side. Drag sisterhood plays a vital role in “BibleGirl’s Big Apple” as well. Once Bible rescues your character from the would-be Port Authority mugging, she finds a place for you to stay (an empty room in her apartment), a job (a nightlife clothing and wig store), and a nightly gig at a local club. This kind of support was hugely important when Bible first got going, she told me. There was no doubt in her mind that she wanted to incorporate it into the game in some way. DragQueenMerch “That whole idea of ‘catching more flies with honey’ is the best way to work within the drag industry,” Bible said. “Anyone can be a friend. Anyone can be an ally. I’ve made the mistake of thinking there’s this hierarchy among queens when there isn’t. All of us drag queens come from a background of being bullied or being weird, so we should be building our community to support each other and not shutting anybody out.” The game’s scope is somewhat limited right now. From an overworld map of New York City, you can pop in and out of three different locations: the apartment you share with Bible, where you can rest and recharge your health; the boutique where you work and have the opportunity to buy new pieces for your drag wardrobe and play a Tetris-esque wig-stacking game; and the club, where you perform onstage by way of a Simon Says-style mini-game for tips. At the store and the boutique, you’ll be treated to the occasional cameo from “RuPaul’s Drag Race” alums like Thorgy Thor and Alaska Thunderf–k 5000 and popular queens from beyond the world of “Drag Race” like Lucy Stoole, Lisa Limbaugh and Rubberchild. There’s also an e-commerce integration with Hot Topic where players can order shirts from the drag apparel website BibleGirl runs called DragQueenMerch.com. That’s it for now, but Bible promises there are expansion packs on the way. Some of these will take your character to new cities, like Chicago and Las Vegas. One in particular will let you “come to Brazil.” Players can spend actual money through their iTunes store account to buy pricier clothing for their avatar faster, but as someone who opted to earn cash the honest way — catching wigs with a wig head in a mini game — it did not significantly impact my experience. NinedayQueen receives some constructive criticism.DragQueenMerch I knew I’d only have a limited amount of time to play “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” so I incorporated that limitation into my character by naming her Nineday Queen. (It’s also a reference to one of my Tudor history faves, Lady Jane Grey, whose backstory was coincidentally featured on a recent episode of “Stuff You Missed in History Class.”) But those nine days of being a queen — or at least a virtual approximation of one — gave me a lot of time to think about all the things we don’t see when we watch a queen lip-sync to Mariah’s 1991 whistle register, nailing the illusion of hitting those notes far better than even Ms. Carey herself has in recent televised performances. It took me a lot of regrettable in-game purchases to finally land on a look I can proudly text my friends. (A full-coverage, body-hugging, floor-length white dress with a collar-to-ankle slit down the side has buried my pleated green nightmare once and for all.) I can only imagine how taxing — financially, spiritually, physically, emotionally — that process of trial and error is for the real drag queens out there. ‘Maybe you’re underage. Maybe you’re not out of the closet. Maybe you’re somewhere without a thriving drag scene. My game gives you a way to live out that fantasy.’ - BibleGirl666Here are some tips to avoid “look[ing] like a car crash” straight from BibleGirl herself: Focus on buying separates so you can mix and match and make exponentially more looks; buy larger sizes and learn to tailor clothes down yourself; clean your wigs; invest in toeless nylons; get to know sites that carry larger shoes like dollskill.com; know the words to the songs you perform; accept the fact that you’re probably going to fall down a lot; and watch as many makeup tutorials on YouTube as you possibly can. As for the non-aspiring queens who download “BibleGirl’s Big Apple,” its creator hopes that her game might inspire them to put down the phone, turn off their TiVo’d episodes of “Drag Race” — which returns with Season 9 later this month — and see what kind of drag shows are going down at their local gay bars. “Maybe you’re underage. Maybe you’re not out of the closet. Maybe you’re somewhere without a thriving drag scene. My game gives you a way to live out that fantasy,” Bible told me. “But there’s a reality to that fantasy that you can actually go out and experience. There’s a drag show every night in New York City. Support your local girls. The budgets aren’t that big for all the girls working, so every head in the room counts.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under apps ,  drag queens ,  mobile gaming ,  rupaul's drag race Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Scientists are studying star sounds to learn how they were...

Registered developers can download the seventh iOS 10.3 beta from the Apple Developer Center or over-the-air with the proper configuration profile installed. iOS 10.3 is a major update, introducing significant new features and changes to the iOS 10 operating system. The biggest consumer-facing feature in iOS 10.3 is "Find My AirPods," which is designed to help AirPods owners locate a lost earphone. Find My AirPods records the last known location of when an AirPod was connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and can play a sound on a lost AirPod. Apple's latest update also introduces a new Apple File System (APFS), installed when an iOS device is updated to iOS 10.3. APFS is optimized for flash/SSD storage and includes features like strong encryption. Apple plans to introduce some App Store changes in iOS 10.3, allowing developers to respond to customer reviews for the first time. iOS users are also able to label reviews in the App Store as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful," which should help surface the most relevant review content. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Apple also plans to limit the number of times developers can ask for a review, allow customers to leave app reviews without exiting an app, and provide a "master switch" that will let users turn off all app review request prompts. Also new in iOS 10.3 is a redesigned app open/close animation, an Apple ID profile in Settings, a better breakdown of iCloud storage usage, warnings about outdated apps that won't work with future versions of iOS, HomeKit support for programmable light switches, improvements to SiriKit (bill paying, bill status, and scheduling future rides), CarPlay interface improvements, iCloud analytics options, and more. For the last few betas, there have been no additional features discovered as Apple focuses instead on bug fixes and refinements ahead of a public release. We are likely nearing the end of the beta testing period, with a release expected in the near future. Update: The seventh beta is also available for members of Apple's public beta testing program.

The seventh macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is available for download through the Apple Developer Center or the software update mechanism in the Mac App Store for those who have previously installed a beta. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's Night Shift mode to the Mac for the first time. First introduced on iOS devices with iOS 9.3, Night Shift is designed to gradually shift the display of a device from blue to yellow, cutting down on exposure to blue light. Blue light is said to disrupt the circadian rhythm and is believed to interrupt sleeping patterns. Night Shift can be activated through the Displays section of System Preferences, where a setting to have it come on at sunset and turn off at sunrise is available. Night Shift can also be toggled on manually through the Notification Center or via Siri. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. The 10.12.4 update focuses mainly on Night Shift, but also includes dictation support for Shanghainese, cricket scores for Siri, improved PDFKit APIs, and iCloud Analytics options. Few outward-facing changes have been discovered in macOS Sierra 10.12.4 outside of the first beta, as Apple has been working on bug fixes and improvements ahead of a public release. With the seventh beta out and the short interval since the last seed, we are getting closer to the end of the beta testing period and are likely to see a public release soon. Update: The seventh beta is also available for members of Apple's public beta testing program.

Rating: 5 Votes justperry 2 days ago at 01:47 pm Wow, iOS 10 had 8 betas and it still ended up bricking everyone's phone. Bricked= Not recoverable by a (normal) User, only possible to upload new firmware into the device by mostly another hardware connector which is almost always inside the device, or special software which is not in the hands of consumers. The iPhone was NOT bricked by installing iOS 10, you could recover by connecting it to a computer running iTunes.

Now, however, the first evidence of a future Apple TV hardware model has purportedly appeared in developer logs… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case According to the co-founder of Firi Games, an iOS and tvOS gaming company, a device carrying the “AppleTV 6,2” identifier has appeared in usage logs. The identifier reportedly carries an IP address that falls within close proximity to Apple’s headquarters, leading further credence to the possibility of this being a future Apple TV hardware iteration. Furthermore, the current fourth-gen Apple TV carries the Apple 5,3 identifier, making 6,2 a logical step forward. In addition to suggesting a possible hardware refresh, the “AppleTV 6,2” is also purportedly running tvOS 11. Currently, Apple is beta testing tvOS 10.2, so tvOS 11 will likely be the next major release of the operating system. At this point, however, not much is known about what to expect with future tvOS updates. While it’s altogether possible that this is an error or fake, such information has leaked and been accurate in the past. Prior to the launch of the iPhone 5S, for instance, evidence of such a device appeared in developer logs and turned out to be accurate. Rumors of what to expect with future Apple TV iterations have been few and far between. A report from Bloomberg last month suggested that Apple was testing a new version of its set-top box with support for 4K video, a feature notably lacking from the current model. That report claimed that the 4K model is codenamed “J105,” but it’s important to note that codenames and identifiers in developer logs aren’t necessarily the same thing. As for a release, Bloomberg’s report claimed that the new 4K model could come as early as this year. Given that the device has now started appearing in developer logs, such a release now seems very plausible. What new features are on your wishlist for a future Apple TV hardware update? Would you be happy with just 4K support or would you want more? Let us know down in the comments.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Skips Legal Challenge to President Trump's Latest Travel Ban | Main | Apple rewrites their 2011 Facial Recognition Patent Claims just as Rumors Point to this Feature coming to iPhone 8 » March 16, 2017 Apple Continues Work on Future Sports Oriented AirPods with Biometrics & Noise Cancellation Features   Apple began work on biometric sensors for both earbuds and for a wrist device back in 2007 as the iPhone was first being introduced. Apple's patent filing publicly surfaced in April 2009 and was granted in February 2014 – the very year that Intel introduced a similar idea of smart earbuds using their Jarvis digital assistant to control it while a user was active. Some of the graphics from Apple's granted patent are noted below. Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a series of three patent applications all titled "Earbuds with Biometric Sensing." In Apple's patent filing they note that at least one of the biometric sensors within the earbud is configured to be pressed up against a portion of the ear known as the tragus that will allow the collection of biometric measurements. Beyond biometrics, the earbuds/AirPods could deliver noise cancellation features.    Apple's patent filing details how a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor could be added to the earbud so that it sits in a particular part of the ear called the tragus so that the device can monitor biometric data collected by the PPG sensor. The sensor measures biometric parameters by shining light and then measuring the reflectivity of that light off the skin. Variations in the reflectivity can be used to characterize profusion of the blood through the skin of a user.   Apple uses this technique in Apple Watch as well. Unfortunately, the exterior surface of a conventional earbud doesn't typically make sufficiently solid and/or consistent contact with a well-profused portion of the ear to provide reliable biometric parameter measurements. One solution to this problem is to arrange the PPG sensor along a surface of the earbud at an end of the earbud near a speaker opening of the earbud. In this way, when the speaker opening is aligned with the ear canal, the PPG sensor can contact an interior facing surface of the tragus of the ear. Contact between the interior facing surface of the tragus of the ear and the PPG sensor can be maintained by adding a compliant member to an opposing end of the earbud.   The compliant member can then engage an opposite surface of the ear known as the concha so that the earbud is wedged between two opposing surfaces of the ear. By choosing a compliant member formed of compressible or otherwise deformable material, the earbud can be well-suited to fit within the ears of a broad spectrum of users.   Apple's patent FIG. 2 noted below shows a cross-sectional view of an earbud device that includes a number of electrical components used to support the described device functionality; FIGS. 3A-3B show views of an earbud situated in the ear of a user and how a biometric sensor of the earbud contacts the tragus of the user.   Apple's patent FIG. 5B noted below shows how protrusion #504 can also include one or more electrical contacts #508. The figure also shows how the biasing member can be interchangeably removed from an earbud by way of a locking channel #506.   Apple's patent FIG. 11 noted above shows an earbud having a housing that defines multiple openings for receiving audio content at multiple microphones.   Beyond biometric measuring, the earbuds could provide noise cancellation by using one or more of the microphones. Apple notes that in some embodiments, the noise cancelling provided by earbud #1100 can be setup to provide selective noise cancelling which allows any audio received within the 10-20 degree window to be allowed through, while in other embodiments, substantially all audio can be screened out. In this way, during a conversation a person's own voice wouldn't prevent the speaker from being able to hear other speakers attempting to enter or participate in a conversation.   Biometric sensors associated with this device could include a range of sensors including a heart rate sensor, a VO2 sensor, a GSR (galvanic skin response) sensor, an electrocardiogram (EKG) sensor, an impedance cardiography (ICG) sensor and a temperature sensor.   Apple's patent applications 20170078780, 20170078781and 20170078785 were collectively filed on September 16, 2015. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Apple's earlier work on this project covered a system that would also be able to work within a cyclist's helmet and also work with a head gesturing system to control your iPhone or iTunes while working out.   Interesting is the timing of today's biometric patents when a secondary patent filing published today covers new sensors for Apple Watch designed for cyclist activities. It's clear that Apple is approaching biometrics and advanced sensors for use across a wide range of products.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. March Madness starts this week, and you no doubt want to know where to watch all the games. And though it's easy enough to find the games on cable, if you want to stream a game while at work, on the go, or just on your phone while another game is on your TV, it's easier than ever to do. To make it even easier, we've got answers to your most commonly asked questions. Here is how to stream all 67 NCAA tournament games this year. Best of Year Winner: Amazon Echo - Buy now for $179.99 What networks will the games be on? All 67 NCAA tournament games will be on one of four networks: CBS, TBS, TNT, and TruTV. While it varies from device to device, you can watch all four on any mobile device live through the March Madness Live app (iOS, Android) or through the March Madness Live website. You can also live stream the audio broadcasts from the Amazon Echo (as well as plain old radios). How do I stream the games to my phone, laptop, or tablet? The March Madness Live app or website is the easiest way to go if you want to watch the games on pretty much any device that isn't hooked up directly to a TV. All of the games broadcast by CBS (including the Final Four and the Championship Game) will be available to stream on these devices without a cable subscription. You'll also have a three-hour pass to watch non-CBS games before you'll have to sign in with your cable credentials. How do I stream the games to my TV, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, or Chromecast? The simplest answer is to cast the games to your TV via either Apple Airplay or Google Chromecast using the March Madness Live app after signing in with your cable credentials. You can still stream games directly with a Roku, Amazon Fire TV, or Apple TV, but it gets complicated. Best of Year Winner: Roku Premiere+ Streaming Media Player - Buy now for $87.95 It's still straightforward if you have a cable subscription: just download the March Madness Live app on any of those devices, sign in, and you can watch any of the non-CBS games for free. This doesn't work for CBS games, though—including the Final Four and National Championship Game. For that you'll need CBS All Access, which comes with a 1-week free trial but costs $6/month after that, though you can cancel whenever. Just beware that CBS All Access doesn't stream live in every single market. It covers 90% of people, but to be sure you're covered head to the CBS All Access website, scroll down to "Stream Live 24/7" and click the "Check Availability" link. Even if it's not available, you can still watch on your phone and stream to your TV via Airplay/Chromecast. Cordcutters: How do I stream the NCAA Tournament to my TV without a cable subscription? If you don't have a cable subscription and want to watch directly through one of these streaming devices, then you'll need to turn to services like Sling TV, Playstation Vue, or DirecTV Now. All three offer packages that include TNT, TBS, and TruTV, and for the most part you'll need to pick up CBS All Access to get the rest. Mohu Leaf 50-mile Indoor TV Antenna - Buy now for $59.90  CBS is included with Playstation Vue in some markets, but for most people it will be easier to just get the "Blue" package from Sling TV and add CBS All Access on top of that. For people who can't get CBS All Access live and don't have cable your only option is to get an HD antenna to pick up the CBS signal in your area over the air. What time does March Madness start? When is the Final Four? March Madness officially kicks off with the "First Four" play-in games on March 14th and 15th. The first full round will be played March 16th and 17th, the second round on March 18th and 19th, followed by the Sweet 16 on March 23rd and 24th. The Elite Eight will be played on the 25th and 26th. The Final Four NCAA tournament games are played on April 1st, and the NCAA championship game will be played on April 3rd. Here's the full NCAA Tournament 2017 schedule: First Four New Orleans vs. Mt.

More than 200 models from 2016 and 2017 either already support each system or will later this year, with many offering both. Aftermarket stereo makers including Pioneer, Kenwood and Sony are also incorporating CarPlay and Android Auto into their products. The partnerships with the tech companies are uncharacteristic for auto makers, who have traditionally kept their software development and innovation in-house. Consumer demand and technology usage trends, however, are forcing them to open up to the Silicon Valley giants. “People want to be able to run the same apps they have on their smartphones,” says Werner Goertz, personal technologies research director at analysis firm Gartner. “Auto makers are wise not to ignore that.” CarPlay and Android Auto diffusion is expected to spread quickly as a result. Gartner estimates CarPlay will be in 37 million vehicles by 2020, while Android Auto will be in 40 million. Many vehicles, such as the 2017 Audi A7 and the 2017 Ford Explorer, for example, will have the capability to accommodate both. In each case, Apple and Google are engineering simplified versions of their phone operating systems to work with the specialized controls found in different car models. While the in-vehicle interfaces usually look and feel like iOS or Android displays, apps are controlled using dashboard or steering-wheel knobs and buttons, as well as the main console touch-screens or touch-pads. Drivers and passengers can thus easily play music through the Spotify app or check the five-day forecast in The Weather Network app, for example, without having to touch or even look at their phones. So far, most cars have required users to connect their devices with cables, but both CarPlay and Android Auto are increasingly going wireless. Just as on phones, the competing systems also boast different advantages over one another. Apple is offering Siri voice control of various functions, including music apps and message reading and sending, while Android is delivering better navigation through Google Maps. Google also plans to add voice control to Android Auto this year through its Google Assistant, which is found on its phones and Home speakers. The company is looking for deeper voice control integration, however, by extending it to functions such as starting the car and locking the doors. Hyundai showed off some of these advanced features at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last January. Users will be able to tell their Android phone, for example, to start their Santa Fe or Sonata and set the interior to a certain temperature while they’re still inside their home. Both Apple and Google are expected to announce further CarPlay and Android Auto features at their coming developer conferences in San Francisco, happening in June and May, respectively. For the car makers, joining with the tech companies is a case of if-you-can’t-beat-them-join-them. “It comes down to where the expertise is,” says Carole Wilson, marketing manager for Lincoln. “It’s also about not creating something that doesn’t work with everything. Where partnerships make sense, we look at them.” Car makers’ willingness to team with Apple and Google doesn’t necessarily mean they’re ceding full future control of the software functions to the tech giants. Many are still working with app makers themselves to incorporate the services that consumers want more directly, which can yield several benefits. Direct deals would mean that manufacturers, and not the tech companies, can control which apps work in their vehicles. With CarPlay and Android Auto, Apple and Google control the pipeline by deciding which apps are allowed. Car companies can also get better access to the data generated by users through working with app makers directly. With data being the all-valuable resource of the Internet era, it’s a currency many manufacturers would rather not cede to Apple and Google as cars becoming increasingly connected. “Car makers are employing an all-of-the-above strategy,” Mr. Goertz says. As far as final software strategies go, “they haven’t made up their minds yet.” Report Typo/Error Follow Peter Nowak on Twitter: @peternowak   More Related to this Story SOUND SYSTEMS Audio advances put a concert in your car Security With increased computerization comes growing fear of hacking into cars Technology Today’s bells and whistles can shock even the most tech-savvy motorists Topics Google Inc.

 One of the biggest rumors about the iPhone 8's design is becoming less and less true Antonio Villas-Boas Mar. 16, 2017, 1:03 PM 16,327 facebook linkedin twitter email print The initial curved screen "iPhone 8" rumors came from a November 2016 report from the Wall Street Journal, which claimed that Apple had 10 prototypes of the high-end iPhone, some of which had a curved screen design. Now, it's looking more and more like Apple took the flat-screen route for the premium iPhone 8, or iPhone Edition, which will be Apple's way of celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone.  A concept of the iPhone 8's curved screen.YouTube/iVenyaWay Most recently, a fresh report from MacRumors, citing "multiple people familiar with the matter," claims the iPhone 8 will have a flat screen with gentle curves around the edges. From the description, it sounds similar to the current iPhone 7's gently curved screen design. MacRumors' report is another nail in the coffin for the curved screen rumor. Several recent reports are dispelling the rumors that Apple's upcoming high-end iPhone will come with a curved display. The iPhone 7 with a flat screen with gentle curves.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider The rumors about curved edges on the iPhone 8 were exciting, as they inferred that it would look significantly different than the iPhone 7, which looks essentially identical to the iPhone 6 and 6s. And, even though it was rumored that the iPhone 8's curved edges wouldn't add much functionality, it could still make for a stunning design. Indeed, the Galaxy S7 Edge's curved edges makes the phone stand out, and it's arguably the most beautifully designed smartphone you can buy.  Flickr/Răzvan Băltărețu Still, other rumors about the iPhone 8's design claim it'll have a glass back, which is a departure from the metal back design of the iPhone 5 onwards, and a nostalgic return to the iPhone 4's design. YouTube/PhoneArena Apart from the curved edges, MacRumors' report also supports the claims that the iPhone will have a large 5.8-inch screen. So far, the high-end iPhone has been rumored to come with a 5.1, 5.5, or 5.8-inch screen. Either way, as reliable as the rumor sources are, we won't know for sure what Apple's upcoming high-end iPhone will look like. Even its existence is a rumor. We're waiting for Apple's annual September iPhone event to get the final details. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet / VentureBeat Just three days after Apple came out with the sixth beta release of iOS 10.3, a new update to iOS 10, today Apple started rolling out the seventh beta release. That Apple chose to put out a seventh build before making iOS 10.3 available to everyone, and so soon after the previous one, suggests that the official version could be coming out shortly, perhaps in the next week. In addition to releasing the seventh beta to developers today, Apple also made it available to public beta testers. Today’s beta release does not appear to have any big changes. That said, people may uncover bug fixes and feature updates in the next hours and days. If you don’t want to wait for the final version of 10.3 and you want to try this seventh iOS 10.3 public beta but you’re not a member of Apple’s Beta Software Program, you can sign up here. The final version of iOS 10.3 will include Find My AirPods, a widget at the top of the Settings app that aims to improve device security, a switch to the Apple File System (APFS), and more fluid transitions into and out of apps.

It will have small parks, walking paths and wide open spaces - and the main building is shaped like Apple's command key. The entire campus, when completed, will provide 882,857 square feet of collaborative space and will consist of three curved concrete structures that connect around a courtyard. The courtyard will host food trucks and visitor parks - a majority of the parking will be underground.  Footage of the massive structure highlights small parks on the campus, walking paths and wide open spaces – and the building is fitted with the same curved window design as Apple Park. An Apple spokesperson told DailyMail.com in an email that the campus will be home to a 'wellness center, fitness center, a Caffè Macs, amazing landscaping and green space'. 'We expect to start moving in in 2018,' the spokesperson said.  Apple signed a lease for the campus in 2015 with Landbank Investment LCC, Apple Insider reported, it was then purchased by developer Jay Paul not too long after. The entire campus, when completed, will provide 882,857 square feet of collaborative space and will consist of three curved concrete structures that connect around a courtyard – forming the shape of Apple's command key. On the southeastern side of the campus, Level 10, the construction company involved with the project, is constructing an amenities building in a seven-story parking structure. According to Apple Insider, parking will be mostly underground and the courtyard will host food trucks and some visitor parking. Prior to Apple claiming the location, Level 10 had planned to cover the roofs with lush vegetation, but the video appears to show the plans have changed. But the surrounding ground will be landscaped with local flora and other plants – following after Apple Park, which is boasts grassy fields and over 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees.

Share this article Share 'AC3’ Central & Wolfe is shaped to look like Apple’s command key (pictured) The Central & Wolfe project has stayed out of the limelight for a majority of its construction and Apple has yet to reveal major details of the campus such as when the firm plans to move in. DailyMail.com has contacted Apple for comment and has yet to receive a response. Three miles away from the lesser-known campus sits Apple’s highly-anticipated structure – Apple Park. Built on a massive 175 acres, the finished campus will span 2.8 million square feet house 13,000 Apple techies and be self-sufficient with trees planted in the dirt removed from the park to build the compound.  Before his death in 2011, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who would have turned 62 this Friday, February 24, set out to create one of the most futuristic buildings ever created. 'Steve was exhilarated, and inspired, by the California landscape, by its light and its expansiveness,' said Laurene Powell Jobs.   more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Hilarious parody video of mother in THAT BBC viral video Watch video Villagers cut open a dead croc and find remains of a child Watch video Police investigating video of woman brutally beating two children Watch video 'What's my snack?!'

Apple Park captures his spirit uncannily well.'  'He would have flourished, as the people of Apple surely will, on this luminously designed campus.'   On the southeastern side of the campus, Level 10, the construction company involved with the project, is constructing an amenities building in a seven-story parking structure.

But the surrounding ground will be landscaped with local flora and other plants To 'honor his memory and his enduring influence on Apple and the world', the theater at Apple Park will be named the Steve Jobs Theater, Apple said.  Opening later this year, the entrance to the 1,000-seat auditorium is a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fiber roof.  The Steve Jobs Theater is situated on top of a hill — one of the highest points within Apple Park — overlooking meadows and the main building. 'Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us.  The three curved concrete buildings will surround a courtyard that will be a hangout area for employees and visitors once the campus is up and running. Apple plans to go with the same green theme that its Apple Park campus has setup - adding trees and other lush vegetation  ‘AC3’ Central & Wolfe will boast the same curved window design as Apple Park. It is not clear when the campus will be finished, but the construction appears to be moving along  Apple's AC3’ Central & Wolfe sits across the street from the Sunnyvale Crossing seven-building development Apple currently leases, and is just three miles away from Apple Park. 'He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.  'The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment.  'We've achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.' The campus's ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass, and the firm's fanatical attention to detail is seen throughout. Three miles away from the lesser-known campus sits Apple’s highly-anticipated structure – Apple Park.

'We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products.' 'Connecting extraordinarily advanced buildings with rolling parkland creates a wonderfully open environment for people to create, collaborate and work together.  'We have been extremely fortunate to be able to work closely, over many years, with the remarkable architectural practice Foster + Partners.' The Steve Jobs Theater is situated on top of a hill — one of the highest points within Apple Park — overlooking meadows and the main building. Opening later this year, the entrance to the 1,000-seat auditorium is a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fiber roof The campus' ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass Apple Park will also include a visitors center with an Apple Store and cafe open to the public, a 100,000-square-foot fitness center for Apple employees, secure research and development facilities and the Steve Jobs Theater. The parklands offer two miles of walking and running paths for employees, plus an orchard, meadow and pond within the ring's interior grounds. A recent flyover of Apple's mothership reveals the massive $5 billion (£4 billion) Campus 2 is nearly complete. The incredible drone images also reveal the astonishing attention to detail of the site. From the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny.  With 17 megawatts of rooftop solar, Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. It is also the site of the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year The Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space Since Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded. Jobs' initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project.   More than $1 billion (£800 million) was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. KEY FEATURES OF APPLE CAMPUS 2  Appearing as a giant saucer, the Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees. There will be jogging and cycling trails, with more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can use to make their way around.

The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example. This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will also be an access point for employees and guests. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels. The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut'. The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn't reach, and on-site recycling  The Apple campus will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square feet of 'research' space. Pictured is the most recent image of the site, taken on January 13 The campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at University of California, Berkeley.  Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. 'It's not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it's about creating a symbolic center for this global company,' she said. 'They are creating an icon.' An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.  Its central office building - a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship - could be a challenge just to navigate. This image shows work progressing on the site, with the outer ring almost complete The circular, four-story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Francisco Weekly as a 'massive glass doughnut' Technology companies have long favored generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. When completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description.  The main building - which boasts the world's largest piece of curved glass - will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees.  Apple acquired the campus from Hewlett-Packard, although little remains except an original century-old barn. Apple's in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages The new campus will be located at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, which is part of the world-renowned Silicon Valley. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Little remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact. But what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers' insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics.

'With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,' he said. 'You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.'   The company's keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product Drone footage taken above the site reveals the vast extent of the construction, with hundreds, if not thousands of lorries and diggers involved Apple's novel approach to the building took many forms.  Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products.  The elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone's home button; one former manager even likened the toilet's sleek design to the device. But Mr de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone per se, but rather following something akin to the Platonic ideal of form and dimension. Elsewhere underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example Architects working on the building say that many of the proportions - such as the curve of a rounded corner - came from Apple's products Much of the construction time has been spent in placing small tiles along the walls of one of the access tunnels 'They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,' Mr de la Torre said. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling - composed of large panels of polished concrete - should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhone's audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. Each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple's in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. Natural gas will, primarily, provide the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in emergencies Technology companies have long favored generic office parks, but the Apple Campus 2 marks a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. Pictured left is Apple's current Cupertino campus Covering 175 acres, Apple's 'Campus 2' headquarters will replace its current offices at 1 Infinite Loop (pictured) 'The things you can't see, they all mattered to Apple,' the former construction manager said. One of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm.  'We spent months trying not to do that because that's time, money and stuff that's never been done before,' the former construction manager said.  Signage also required a delicate balancing act, as Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency.     more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Good samaritan saves police deputy by shooting his attacker Watch video Homeless man brought to tears following incredible transformation Watch video Hilarious parody video of mother in THAT BBC viral video Watch video 'What's my snack?!'

The site will be surrounded by a man-made forest featuring 7,000 trees. It was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and is currently covered in around 80 percent asphalt Not all of the parking spaces will be hidden. The parts of the multi-story car park that will be on show, according to this image from Apple, will be covered in plants and greenery to help the concrete structure blend in Much of the inside of the futuristic building will also be made of glass with stone-colored walls to add to the building's natural-looking design (pictured). The 175-acre Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will house 13,000 staff. Pictured are artist's impressions During his initial proposals, Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs said he wanted the building to be covered in 40ft floor-to-ceiling panes of curved glass so that all of the building's four-story would be visible from the outside and offer a large amount of natural light (pictured). Pictured is an artist's impression The cafeteria will additionally feature an outside dining and picnic area (pictured). Apple's Campus 2 additionally comes with a fitness centre in the northern part of the building. Pictured is an artist's impression This room-sized mock-up of the planned Apple HQ was released in November 2013 before executives submitted their plans to the council. Pictured is an artist's impression Read more: Apple Park HQ buttressed by Central & Wolfe 'AC3' campus in Sunnyvale, Calif.

The upcoming software update includes Find My AirPods support, CarPlay improvements, Apple’s new filesystem, and more. Apple is also rolling out the seventh macOS 10.12.4 beta for developer testing. The upcoming version of macOS Sierra is the first to bring Night Shift to the Mac. We’ll update and highlight any additional changes discovered below. Sony A6500 iOS 10.3 is currently only available in beta for registered developers and public beta testers. The public beta version of each update usually follows a few days after the developer version if not the same day. iOS 10.3 is the first version to include Find My AirPods in the Find My iPhone app, Wi-Fi Calling for iCloud-connected devices for Verizon customers, and a new 32-bit alert that suggests iOS 11 could be 64-bit only. Apple will also introduce a way for developers to reply to app reviews with iOS 10.3, and a new system-wide app review request feature will be added. iOS 10.3 includes iCloud Analytics for the first time as well. Here’s an overview of changes discovered so far: Find My AirPods added to Find My iPhone app Siri support for cricket scores from Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council Safari support for Reduced Motion preference Prominent user security section in Settings app iOS 10.3 uses new Apple File System (APFS) which may free up some space Podcasts app has a widget like Music app, same app design New system level way for developers to request app rating, opt out option in Settings CarPlay status bar has persistent quick access to media, communication, and travel apps for quick switching without accessing the Home screen CarPlay gains quick access to albums from songs in Music, new Up Next screen Weather data in Maps app now has 3D Touch forecast You can see our hands-on with the first iOS 10.3 beta below: Subscribe to 9to5Mac for more videos Learn More link on 32 bit app warning, new 32 bit app section in Settings The wall of shame. pic.twitter.com/vu9bnvn0DK — Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) February 20, 2017 iOS 10.3 beta 4 included an restart message whenever a button is hit during the update installation process. Apple’s Feedback app is still bundled in this version which suggests this will not be the final version before release. We’ll update with any changes found in iOS 10.3 beta 7. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta is currently only available to developers and public beta testers. Public beta versions usually come a few days after developer versions if not the same day. macOS 10.12.4 beta also includes changes to Siri, Dictation, and Apple’s PDF API: Night Shift now available on the Mac. Dictation support for Shanghainese. Ask Siri about cricket scores, schedules and player rosters. Siri knows about statistics and data from the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council. Updated PDFKit APIs for better displaying of PDFs in apps that use the framework. This is how Apple describes its Night Shift feature: Night Shift adjusts the color of your display after sunset. Many studies show that exposure to bright-blue light in the evening can affect your circadian rhythms and make it harder to fall asleep. After sunset, Night Shift will shift your display colors to the warmer end of the spectrum, making the display easier on your eyes. In the morning, your display returns to its regular settings.

Apple is reportedly among 60 technology companies, including Google and Facebook, that appear to have decided against putting their weight behind this new lawsuit. A legal brief was filed in federal court in Hawaii earlier this week representing 58 technology companies in opposition to the second version of Trump’s executive order banning immigration, but this accounts for less than half of the 127 companies that signed on to a similar brief opposing the first executive order last month. Airbnb, Dropbox, and Kickstarter are reportedly among the companies that did sign the new brief, while other companies that are conspicuously absent the second time around include Microsoft, eBay, Intel, Netflix, and Twitter. It is not yet clear why fewer companies signed on to the “friend-of-the-court” brief this time around, however it’s worth noting that companies still have an opportunity to join the effort as it proceeds through the court system, and according to brief co-author and New York lawyer Robert Atkins, they do “expect the group to expand.” For instance, Uber is apparently in the process of adding its name, and it seems unlikely that Apple’s stance on immigration has changed since the original executive order was issued in January, when Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees that he had made his opposition to the ban clear to the White House due to “the negative effect on our coworkers and our company.” Representatives of Apple and several other companies who have not signed on as of yet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Belarusian Apple reseller i-Store is currently taking orders for the device, which is priced at 999 rubles (~$520) and only available in Space Gray. Much like its launch in Asia, the device is identified as “iPhone 6 (2017)” and is in a previously-unavailable 32GB capacity, making it clear that Apple has begun manufacturing limited quantities of the older model in a new capacity, likely targeted for sale as an entry-level model in emerging markets. The 2017 iPhone 6 otherwise has the same specs as the 2014 model, but will run iOS 10 out of the box. The 32GB iPhone 6 is notably being sold for less than the price of similar models in Belarus, where refurbished entry-level iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models appear to be regularly priced at 1,200 rubles (~$625) and up. As with sales in China and Taiwan, this special iPhone 6 model is only being sold through specific outlets, and not through any of Apple’s own retail channels, although it’s also worth noting that Apple has no retail presence in Belarus.

Apple and Samsung will dominate the OLED supply this year, by taking 70 percent of global production of OLED panels between 2017 and 2018, while other companies struggle to secure OLED panels for their devices. Read: iPhone Rumors: Apple's iPhone 8 and Future iPhones Will Feature OLED Panel iPhone By 2019 Apple’s 75 million OLED panels account for 14 percent of global OLED panel production for this year. Samsung will take 56 percent of OLED panel, thanks to its in-house production of the displays. Other Companies Facing OLED Panel Shortage Meanwhile, other companies are will receive smaller amounts of OLED panels because of insufficient supply. Huawei will only have 8 percent of its total production of smartphones featuring AMOLED panels in 2017. Other Chinese vendors, Oppo and Vivo will get 13 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of the global production of OLED panels this year. Read: Apple Jobs In America: Manufacturing iPhones In U.S. Is Uncertain Foxconn Chairman Says The companies are relying on Samsung Display for OLED panels, since other OLED suppliers won’t have the products of time. LG Display is expected to start shipping OLED panels in 2018, BOE Technology may not be able to ship its products until 2020, according to the report. iPhone 8 (iPhone X) To Come With Curved OLED Screen Apple is expected to release three models this year, iPhone 7S, iPhone 7S Plus and a 10th anniversary iPhone, which may be called the iPhone 8 or iPhone X. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a curved OLED screen that is “gentler” than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7, according to a recent report by Nikkei . The new iPhone is expected to be better visually but have less functionality. However, other rumors suggest Apple will stick with a flat display, which won’t take full advantage of OLED displays. Because the iPhone 8 will feature an OLED display, the smartphone is rumored to sell at more than $1,000. The iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus are expected to come with LCD panels. The iPhones are expected to be introduced in September. However, the launch date for the iPhone 8 (or iPhone X) could be after the other two iPhones, a recent report. Some key components of the iPhone’s rumored front 3D camera might not be available on time for the September release date.

While nothing is set in stone at this point, multiple reports from reliable sources suggest that the Galaxy S8 — the smaller of the two flagship phones set to be unveiled by Samsung two weeks from today — sports a display that measures 5.8 inches diagonally. On paper, it seems like these two smartphones should be relatively similar in size, no? Well, as we can see in a new hands-on comparison video, Samsung’s bold new Galaxy S8 design is even more impressive than we thought when you line it up next to Apple’s flagship phablet. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 With the Galaxy S8, Samsung has managed to stuff a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display into a smartphone that is barely bigger than Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 7. It’s one thing to read those words, but it’s another thing entirely to see the smaller of Samsung’s two new Galaxy S8 phones lined up next to its stiffest competition. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ flagship phones feature a bold new design that does away with the oblong home button beneath the displays and narrows the bezels above and below the screens substantially. As a result, the company is able to fit a very large screen into a phone with an overall footprint that isn’t much bigger than the screen itself. How does that play out in the real world? The video below comes courtesy of YouTuber KK Sneak Leaks, and it shows what is believed to be a perfectly sized mockup of the Galaxy S8 created using accurate schematics leaked by the factories building Samsung’s new flagship phone. In the video, the narrator shows the phone next to Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus, which features a display that measures 5.5 inches compared to the 5.8-inch screen on the Galaxy S8. At around the 4:14 mark, you can see how the two phones compare in overall size. Again, the Galaxy S8 shown in the video is not a genuine handset. Instead, it is a mockup that is believed to have been built exactly to scale. With that in mind, it’s pretty incredible to see just how much smaller Samsung’s Galaxy S8 is, with it’s 5.8-inch display, than the iPhone 7 Plus and its smaller 5.5-inch screen. And of course, if you want to see a real Galaxy S8 in action for comparison, you can always check out the exclusive Galaxy S8 photos we published earlier this month. Meanwhile, the larger Galaxy S8+ Plus is expected to cram a massive 6.2-inch display into a phone that is roughly the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus. You can see size comparisons of those two phones in this post.

Firi Games, the developers behind arcade games Phoenix HD and Phoenix II, told us they have seen a single device identified as "AppleTV6,2" and running "tvOS 11.0" connect to Phoenix HD for Apple TV from the United States in its logs. The IP address falls within a range linked to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino. The current Apple TV has a model identifier of AppleTV5,3, and Apple TV6,2 does not correspond with any released model. While the details could be faked, similar evidence of an iPhone 5s running iOS 7 showed up in January 2013, around nine months before the device was announced, and the timeline is appropriate if Apple is indeed testing a new Apple TV. The current Apple TV, the first to run tvOS, launched in October 2015. No other details surrounding a fifth-generation Apple TV are known at this point. In December 2015, hit-or-miss Taiwanese website DigiTimes, citing supply chain sources, claimed the next-generation Apple TV would feature a new CPU with dramatically improved performance, but that report has yet to materialize. Last quarter, Apple financial chief Luca Maestri said Apple TV sales declined compared to the year-ago quarter, when the fourth-generation model launched. The product still remains something of a hobby for Apple, which reportedly shelved its rumored streaming TV service and only has its "toe in the water" with original content.

Crippled products allow the competition to offer the same product for much less cost. Amen. It's become harder and harder to evangelize Apple under Tim Cook because he bases decisions on the next upgrade cycle: "If I offer 32gb base storage now, how can I upsell the user next time? If I offer 4K Apple TV now, what could possibly be the 'next big thing' next time?" Cook intentionally cripples products now so that he can sell the next one down the line, and that's been obvious for years. So what we have now, and for the foreseeable future, is a hobbled Apple whose bottom line is more important than making great products -- exactly what Jobs hated about other tech companies and feared would happen to Apple. Rating: 10 Votes nt5672 3 days ago at 11:03 am Some day Apple will, hopefully, come to learn that crippled products are not in Apple's best interest. Crippled products allow the competition to offer the same product for much less cost. Originally, Apple products, while not perfect, were on average much better than the competition, supported more open standards, and had better connectivity for roughly the same or better cost. Now, not so much. Apple seems to think that just because it has the Apple name on it, that the product can do no wrong and is best in class, just because Cook says so. People believed Jobs and he got away with fudging, but no one believes Cook because the products are so far off the mark. Rating: 6 Votes gim 3 days ago at 09:41 am Hope they include a full powered A10 and 3GB RAM. That should make some decent (casual) gaming performance. Rating: 6 Votes oneMadRssn 3 days ago at 10:01 am We've been a predominantly Apple household for the last 10 years and I've owned Apple TVs since the original. But over the past couple years, the Apple TV lost it's luster and fell far behind the competition, so I've since moved onto Chromecasts, FireTVs, and now an Nvidia Shield TV unit. The only advantage the Apple TV offers is access to iTunes content, something I stopped purchasing years ago do to Apple's draconian restrictions. No Amazon content, no Google Play content on the Apple TV either---content I can access on pretty much every other device made today. The Shield TV and Fire TVs are such far more capable devices, I can't see Apple including anything in a new Apple TV that would entice me back. The thing that always makes me return is the ease-of-use. A total technophobe can pickup the AppleTV remote and have it figured out pretty quick. That is not the case with any others. Chromecast requires the use of a smartphone, AndroidTV is a bit too complex and cumbersome. FireTV comes close, but isn't quite as polished and smooth as tvOS. At the end of the day, I'll choose the easier to use option every time.

New iPhone 7, iPhone SE and iPad Pro could be unveiled – all you need to know Tech fans await confirmation of yearly event as rumours circle about new products By Tom Gillespie 16th March 2017, 3:29 pm Updated: 16th March 2017, 6:50 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments EXCITED Apple fans are awaiting confirmation of this year’s “Spring” event when new products will be unveiled. With the date and location still yet to be announced, we take a look at when it might be held and what could be showcased. 3 It is thought that Apple are preparing to unveil a new red iPhone 7 model When will the Apple Spring event take place? The hotly anticipated event takes place in March each year, but a date for 2017 has not been confirmed. Apple’s spring event in 2015 took place on Monday, March 9. The tech giant’s event the following year took place on Monday, March 21. This could indicate that the event will also fall on a Monday in March this year… but invites haven’t been sent out yet. Macworld has predicted it will take place on March 20. There are some indications that it might take place in April. In many Apple stores in the US 12.9in iPad Pro’s are listed as “Available Apr 4.” Getty Images 3 Rumours are circling that a new iPad Pro is due to be unveiled What will Apple announce at the Spring event? Rumours are circling that Apple is planning to reveal several new products at once. Industry analysts expect updates and refinements to existing product lines – rather than a brand new Apple Watch-style announcement. Analysts have also said it is unlikely the iPhone 8 will unveiled – as this is more likely to be showcased in September. What you can expect to see – A red iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus: Rumours suggest Apple will be unveiling a new red colour option for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Pictures shared on social media have been getting Apple fans excited. The firm has been producing red products since 2006 to contribute to the Global Fund’s fight against HIV/AIDS. It is assumed that the price of the red iPhones will be very similar to existing models. This means prices will start at £599 for the iPhone 7 and £719 for the iPhone 7 Plus. New iPad Pro: Apple is thought to be about to announce a new 7.9inch, 9.7inch, 10.5inch, and 12.9inch iPad Pro. The first model was released in September 2015 with prices ranging from £549 to £1,029. Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month: “We’ve got some exciting things coming up on iPad and I’m optimistic about where things are headed.” iPhone SE 2: It is rumoured that Apple may launch a new iPhone SE with upgraded storage. The new model will reportedly feature a 128GB storage option – joining the existing 16GB and 64GB models. Prices for the iPhone SE are speculative at the moment. The 16GB version sells for £379 and the 64GB version sells for £429. Apple Watch accessories: It is deemed unlikely that Apple Watch will unveil a new model. However in past events they have released new straps – so this may be repeated this time around. Getty Images 3 A new iPhone SE could be unveiled at the Apple Spring event this year Where will the Apple Spring event be held? The location, along with the date, is still yet to be confirmed. The tech giant has announced that it will open Apple Park in April – it’s brand ring-shaped headquarters. This could mean we may be waiting until then for the Spring event.

Andrew Cunningham - Mar 16, 2017 4:23 pm UTC reader comments 44 Share this story Auction Team Breker The version of the Apple I kept at the Smithsonian Museum; early computers were often just circuit boards rather than self-contained systems. Wikipedia Another Apple I circuit board. Wikipedia An early ad for the Apple I. Apple If you think today's Macs are expensive, hold on to your butts: on May 20, Auction Team Breker will sell one of just eight known working Apple I computers in existence. Breker estimates that the computer will sell for between $190,000 and $320,000, which is in line with the sale prices of most Apple I computers in recent years—outliers include a prototype model that sold for $815,000 in August of last year and a model from early in the computer's production run that sold for $905,000 in late 2014. Given the original $666.66 sale price (about $2,800 in today's dollars), any of those prices would be a pretty solid return on your investment. The auction listing (PDF) claims that the Apple I is "the best-preserved example of an Apple I computer to have appeared on the market" and that it's coming directly from the collection of the Berkeley, California, resident who originally bought it. The auction includes not just the computer itself, but also instruction manuals, circuit board diagrams, and notes from a phone call with Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak. The Apple I was the company's very first product, originally manufactured by Steve Wozniak in Steve Jobs' garage—Wozniak has said that about 200 of the computers were built in total. Apple offered aggressive discounts on the Apple II for people who traded in their old Apple I computers, in part because Wozniak himself was the only person who could handle most support calls about it. Apple is said to have destroyed most of the boards that were traded in, making an already rare computer even rarer. The computer was noteworthy in its day because all you needed to use it was a keyboard and a TV set to hook it to, making it a bit cheaper and easier to set up and use than competing PCs. The Apple I was sold from April of 1976 to September of 1977, at which point it was discontinued in favor of the slicker mass-produced Apple II that had launched in April 1977. The Apple II ultimately introduced more people to Apple's products, but the Apple I remains an important part of the company's early history.

Do You Know Anything About Apple’s ‘Authorized Service Provider’ Program? Is Apple's 'repair' program even a repair program at all? For nearly a decade, Apple did not allow anyone besides its own Geniuses to repair iPhones. Even though the company has long had an "Authorized Service Provider" program to certify independent repair shops to work on Macs and other Apple products, the company never allowed any of these "authorized" companies to work on iPhones. That changed in late 2016, when the company quietly began allowing a handful of smartphone repair shops to work on iPhones. But according to more than 10 people I've spoken with, including former Apple employees, as well as employees and owners of unauthorized independent repair shops and authorized repair shops, Apple's service program is barely a repair program at all. Independent shops pay Apple a fee in return for "authorized" status, which gets them exclusive access to Apple training and guidebooks and the ability to buy parts directly from Apple. But authorized repair shops are only "authorized" to do a select few repairs; if a customer comes in with other easily fixable problems, the repair shop must ship the phone to Apple. "If I became Apple certified, I would lose 75 percent of my opportunities" "If the program worked well, I would have joined a long time ago," one independent repair shop owner told me. "The only thing they allow you to repair are screens and batteries. If there's a broken camera, you have to send it back. Broken charge port, send it back. If it's an iPad, you have to send it back. These are repairs that take minutes to do, and you have to send it out." "If I became Apple certified, I would lose 75 percent of my opportunities to do repairs on things and would have to send that business to Apple for a small finder's fee," he added. Apple-authorized service providers do not get access to the iPhone Calibration Machine, which allows Apple to re-key Touch ID sensors, making screen replacements much easier. "Right to repair" legislation being considered in eight states would make Apple's system obsolete. CompTIA, a trade organization that represents Apple, has repeatedly told legislators that such programs are necessary for manufacturers to offer customers "substantial choice" in the repair market and for manufacturers to "protect customers." "What I do see a lot of is [unauthorized] third party repair shops who will do non-modular repairs using non-Apple parts," another person in the industry told me. "I've seen repairs like that go incredibly wonderful, and I've also seen phones get completely screwed up because the shop was sketchy and had no clue what it was doing and was using POS parts from China." "What Apple needs to honestly do is permit these kinds of repairs," the person added. "As long as the consumer knows that when doing that that Apple relinquishes all responsibility, they really should authorize those repairs and give out parts." Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the specifics of the program. It has not responded to any of my requests for comment on dozens of repair-related stories for nearly two years. I have heard frustration about Apple's service provider program in passing from right-to-repair activists and independent shop owners, but would like to learn more about the program from the people who are in it or who have decided that making the move wasn't for them. I would like to hear your experiences with Apple's Authorized Service Provider program. Has it helped your business or hurt it? What repairs are you allowed to do? What conditions does the company put on you? Do you secretly do unauthorized repairs off the books? Do customers get pissed off at you when you tell them you have to mail their phone to Apple? What guidance and help does Apple give you? Here's how you can securely contact me .

Unfortunately for Apple, it now has a fiery fiasco of its own to contend with. Footage from inside a phone repair shop in Australia shows a man applying pressure to his iPhone 6 Plus’ cracked screen before the smartphone begins acting like an e-cig. After the fire is extinguished by the shop owner, the video reveals that the culprit is in fact an Apple battery that “failed and exploded”. “It’s 100% pure coincidence that it happened when he was talking to the repairer,” added Simon Owen the owner of the device, who later bought the shop clerk a crate of beer to say thanks. Given the iPhone 6 Plus has been out for close to 18 months, it’s highly likely this is a freak occurrence due to damage already caused to the Lithium-ion battery. After all, the state of the screen even before it starts smoking is warning enough that something could be wrong. Also, the video appears to show the serial number has been scratched off the back of the phone, and the Telegraph adds that the issue has not been reported to Apple. You can see the video here. __ Even so, seeing a phone smoking like that is enough to worry any Apple owner and it comes after two similar incidents in the last half a year. Just last month, Twitter user Brianna Olivas claimed that her rose gold iPhone 7 Plus began internally combusting only hours after she had taken it to be repaired by Apple. Go a little further back to September and there was a report of an iPhone 7 Plus that exploded in transit – perhaps excited at meeting the new owner? So is Apple about go all Samsung on us and start recalling iPhone models? No. Even though the company has not commented on the latest incident, the period of time the iPhone 6 Plus has been out and lack of similar reports make it very unlikely there is a widespread issue. So hold fire and don’t bother ditching your device just yet. Related: iPhone 7 review Will you be investing in an iPhone 8?

Not only are there always more devices out there waiting to tempt you, but there are all the apps. From Apple’s Home app through manufacturer companion apps to third-party apps, there are plenty to choose from – especially when it comes to Philips Hue lighting. We look at three manufacturer apps you might want to continue to use even after you have your devices configured, together with six third-party apps that can help your smart home become even smarter … Anker braided Lightning cables Home Together with Siri, Apple’s own Home app is likely to be your primary interface with your HomeKit devices. It can control absolutely all your devices, individually, as groups and through scenes. It’s worth noting that its control of some devices is limited. You’re restricted to six colors at any one time for Hue lights, for example. You can edit these colors, but there’s no quick way to select an arbitrary color. That said, you can’t beat the sheer convenience of having control over all your devices within a single, well-designed app. The ability to put your favorite scenes and most-used accessories on the main screen makes it quick to use, and the room-by-room screens are a quick way to give access to everything in that room. Eve Once you have your Eve Energy devices setup, there’s little need to use the app: everything you can do with the devices can be done through Siri or the Home app. But the one unique feature the app does offer is both live and projected energy usage – including a forecast of annual running costs for each connected device. It’s really useful to get an insight into the costs of using different devices. For example, Eve projects that the halogen standard lamps I have in both living-room and office are costing around £45 ($55) a year – while the blue LED mood lighting strips cost just £2/year ($2.50) between them. Price: Free Nanoleaf The best thing about the Nanoleaf Aurora is its animated scenes. I’m a big fan of Northern Lights, as well as Fireplace, which does a pretty convincing simulation of the warm, flickering glow you get from a real fire. You can select these via Siri, which is as simple as speaking the name of the scene – you don’t need to preface it with anything to specify the Nanoleaf – it figures that out on its own. But you still need the Nanoleaf app to download new scenes, as well as to delete unwanted ones to reduce virtual clutter. Price: Free Hue Both Siri and the Home app can switch Philips Hue bulbs on and off, adjust brightness and set a limited range of colors – but you’ll want the Hue app to get fine-grained control. Setting the colour you want for a bulb or group of bulbs is really easy, simply sliding your finger around the color swatch in the app. You also need the app to set up widgets which allow you to control Hue lights via your Apple Watch. Sadly, the Watch can only set standard scenes, not the full range of colors. Price: Free Ambify Ambify describes itself as ‘the Hue-enabled jukebox.’ It creates fully-automatic disco lighting in sync with your music. It’s configurable, but with a very easy-to-use, minimalist UI. If you want an instant party, Ambify is the app to use. It does, though, have one huge drawback: to auto-sync with music, you need to play that music through the Ambify app itself. I really wish it could just use the microphone to listen to music played via the standard Music app on the iPhone or iTunes on the Mac. Price: $2.99 Hue Disco Hue Disco does let you play music from any source, and it claims to use the microphone to adapt to it, though that claim seems a little dubious. But it’s otherwise a really fun app, offering a huge number of options, from rave-like strobing through disco-style lighting to very gentle animations that can take place over as long a period as 90 minutes. It’s obviously great for parties, but the more relaxing animations are lovely anytime. Set a cycle time of several minutes, for example, and the transition time to ‘Smooth,’ and you have a really easy way to get variety in your lighting without having to do it manually. The Mood Theme allows you to limit colors to a set range of your choosing, so you can stop if getting too carried away with wild color choices. Price: $3.99 OnSwitch At first glance, OnSwitch is another scene app for Philips Hue bulbs with relatively expensive in-app purchases needed to unlock all of the features. But the app also works with LIFX ones, and where OnSwitch wins out over competing apps is that the beauty of the scenes. The reviews support this, with an average rating of 4.5 across more than 200 reviews. Viewed in the context of the money you spend on the bulbs in the first place, $15-20 more to activate all the well-thought-out scenes is decent value. Price: Free with in-app purchases Lightbow Lightbow has even more expensive in-app purchases – costing $24.99 for the complete set. But the app offers two compelling benefits. First, it can control Philips Hue, LIFX and WeMo devices, so if you have a mix of kit – even if some of it isn’t HomeKit-compatible – that’s enough reason to buy it. Second, you also get a fantastic, full-featured editor to create your own effects – probably one of the most powerful out there. Price: $4.99 plus in-app purchases IFTTT The ever-useful If This Then That app has a number of Philips Hue recipes, albeit not brilliantly organised and with some degree of repetition. But I’m a fan of the app in general, and the ability to use it to control lighting really extends its usefulness. For example, I use a location recipe to switch on the hallway lighting when arriving home. Some recipes are more gimmicky, or even downright dumb – like blinking all your lights when it starts raining, something which has no time limits so will happily activate at 3am (don’t ask me how I know this …) Price: Free iConnectHue Finally, iConnectHue doesn’t technically belong in this piece as it’s not actually HomeKit compatible, but it’s a hugely powerful app for programming Hue lighting and, in particular, switches. For example, you can assign multiple actions and animations to switches, and as these are sent to the hub, they will work whether or not you are running the app – or even if the iPhone with the app isn’t present. It also offers – via an in-app purchase – very flexible geofences which work with multiple iPhones, so you can do things like have it switch on lights when the first person arrives home and switch them off when the last person leaves. Price: $4.99 plus in-app purchases Have we missed any cool apps? If you have other HomeKit apps you love, do let us know in the comments.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

Mario Anzuon/Reuters | Caption Loading... David Iaconangelo Staff | @diaconangelo March 16, 2017 —Hackers stole private photos belonging to Emma Watson, her publicists say, after several of the images appeared online on Tuesday night. “Photos from a clothes fitting Emma had with a stylist a couple of years ago have been stolen,” her publicist told the BBC. “They are not nude photographs. Lawyers have been instructed and we are not commenting further.” The theft is likely to revive debates about the distribution of women’s private images without their consent, especially given Ms. Watson’s notoriety as a feminist figure. It might also animate anxieties about the security of images stored in online databases even among women who are less of an obvious target for hackers than celebrities. As The Christian Science Monitor reported in 2014, hundreds of millions of users keep private information on cloud servers like the Apple iCloud, which was accessed by hackers who stole nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and other female celebrities in that year’s “Celebgate” scandal: Perhaps the simplest step that cloud users can take [to protect their data] is to add a second layer of authentication similar to that employed by many banking websites. Both Google and Apple offer multiple-layer verification features. They aren’t default settings, so users have to search for them. Apple’s two-step verification system tethers an Apple ID to a specific device, most commonly a cellphone. Any time a user with activated two-step verification makes any changes to their Apple ID account, Apple sends a four digit verification code to the specified device as a secondary password. This feature means that even if hackers crack a user’s password, they can’t make blanket changes to the account. It won’t keep hackers out entirely, but it will prevent them from locking the verified user out of their own account. Google offers a similar feature for its suite of services including Google Drive, Gmail, and Google+. Watson was also threatened, in the midst of 2014’s Celebgate, with the release of private nude images, in what turned out to be a hoax that the actress attributes to a speech on gender equality she gave before the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador that year, notes The Washington Post. “I knew it was a hoax, I knew the pictures didn't exist,” said Watson at a 2015 Facebook event, according to the BBC. “The minute I stepped up and talked about women's rights I was immediately threatened – within less than 12 hours I was receiving threats.” How secure is your data? Take our quiz and find out The leak of Watson’s private photos comes in the weeks after she drew criticism from some quarters for a Vanity Fair shoot in which she posed in a revealing crochet top – a shoot that some described as antithetical to feminist ideals. The actress has said those criticisms were fueled by “a fundamental and complete misunderstanding of what feminism is,” according to the Associated Press.

The report says that Apple will be taking 75 million OLED display units from Samsung in 2017 for the iPhone 8. This equates to roughly 14% of overall OLED display production. Samsung is said to take 56% and Apple’s share would’ve been higher if the phone would’ve launched earlier in the year. It’s also worth noting that Apple will only be releasing one iPhone with an OLED display this year. With the other two having traditional LCD displays. The report says that OLED display manufacturers won’t be ramping up production until later in the year, which makes it difficult for small manufacturers to source OLED displays for their gadgets.

Welcome to the odd universe of console hacking, by which we mean either jailbreaking or, failing that, making the machine do something interesting nobody knew was possible. For each new console these days, the story always starts as a race to be the first to find a way in. The latest honour has been claimed by a young Italian iPhone jailbreaker called Luca Todesco (@qwertyopriup) who posted an image on Twitter with the word “done” on the Switch’s screen below a laptop displaying the code used to make that happen. He had, he said, used a modified version of his own JailbreakMe tool to exploit an old Apple iOS 9.3 flaw in the WebKit HTML rendering engine used by a hidden, integrated browser. A second individual, LiveOverflow, quickly published a proof of concept confirming the discovery, while a third research group, ReSwitched, offered their own tool. This was unexpected. Statements by Nintendo in February suggested the Switch wouldn’t ship with a browser, something commentators immediately doubted. Without some kind of browser, how would users connect their expensive portable console to the internet through the captive portals used by hotspots? In fact, there was a hidden browser interface that could be invoked under special conditions such as accessing a Facebook profile or – yes! – using a WiFi hotspot. So the Switch had a browser of sorts after all, just not a very useful one. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More We now know this happens to be vulnerable to a security flaw that Apple fixed in an update months ago. But does the issue have any significance beyond telling us that the first Switches entered the supply chain some time ago? The flaw in the WebKit browser isn’t on par with a full kernel jailbreak of the sort that would allow piracy or custom firmware, so perhaps not. Nintendo can also patch the issue with an update although when that might turn up is anyone’s guess. Nevertheless, Nintendo clearly isn’t paying enough attention to problems it should have anticipated months ago. It’s not as if software flaws in browsers are surprising. Perhaps the risk from consoles is morphing from old-style jailbreaking to “userland” attacks. In an interview with Forbes, Todesco speculated about the future potential to use Switch consoles for surveillance: “If there is a microphone you could use the switch to record and send that remotely.” Doubtless, a small army of researchers is working on that little problem right now – just as soon as the Switch comes back into stock, that is. To quote one sarcastic commentator: It [the Todesco hack] might actually be the first time in history that people could get their hands on a console hack more easily than on the console itself.

They only thing they did was redirect the wifi authentication page to something else. Reply Paul Ducklin says: March 17, 2017 at 10:46 am The PoC I saw takes it a bit further than that. As far as I can see, by forcing their own content into WebKit, they were utlimately able to call selected operating system system functions under the guise of the WebKit process. I’m not sure quite how much you can do with the access they acquired, but if you have a vulnerability that allows you to use a remote web page to trick a program on the device to run machine code of your own choosing… …then that’s RCE, short for remote code execution, so I think the word “hack” fits perfectly. My 2c. Reply Skeptic says: March 17, 2017 at 10:54 am Technically speaking, an HTML rendering engine (WebKit) is not a browser. You cannot browse the web with Android’s WebView. So it’s a matter of interpretation. When Nintendo said that they wouldn’t ship a browser on the console, they most likely meant a full-fledged browser that users can actually use, not an underlying engine that some applications can use to display HTML content. I tend to agree with Nintendo on this one, and not with jailbreakers who used the word browser very loosely. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Swatch, which owns Tissot, plans to take on Android and iOS with its own system for its planned Tissot smartwatches. Mark Lennihan / AP Swatch thinks time is right to take on Apple and Google March 16, 2017 Updated: March 16, 2017 06:33 PM Related Swatch unveils Dubai watch in time for UAE National Day SME profile: Timing now ripe for Dubai retailer of vintage watches Sotheby’s showcases one of the world’s largest Swatch collections – in pictures Swatch warns of uncertainty for major market Hong Kong as profits fall Related Swatch unveils Dubai watch in time for UAE National Day SME profile: Timing now ripe for Dubai retailer of vintage watches Sotheby’s showcases one of the world’s largest Swatch collections – in pictures Swatch warns of uncertainty for major market Hong Kong as profits fall Swatch said it is developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland’s largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers’ wrists. The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, the Swatch chief executive Nick Hayek said ion Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Mr Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. His strategy contrasts with that of the LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Mr Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it is trying to "think small" as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Mr Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. "There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system," he said. "I’m not convinced," said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas who follows the luxury industry. "People use smartwatches expecting to use the same apps they have on their mobiles. A proprietary operating system defeats the object." Swatch’s operating system has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialised in miniaturisation, Mr Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that do not want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. * Bloomberg business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter​ Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Technology Strata on track for growth through automation and robots Analysis of Idex deals reveals stronger foundations in GCC defence base Swatch thinks time is right to take on Apple and Google Tesla plans cash boost to bring new Model 3 to the masses MOST VIEWED Business | All Fuel-efficient race inspires Sharjah recycling drive ‘This is 100 per cent not going to help the Dubai property recovery’ India’s demonetisation takes its toll ETFs do the hard work for expat investors like you Economics 101: Private sector hiring can help GCC countries solve the resource riddle Frank Kane’s Working lunch: the music lover who regulates the DIFC Bahraini Islamic investment group GFH appoints two new senior executives Abu Dhabi doctor on fixed-term contract must compensate employer for resigning while under probation Light at end of tunnel for Saudi’s contractors, says Al Khodari Mixed reaction across the UAE economy to US Federal Reserve rate hike More Most Viewed New roads could ease notorious Dubai-Sharjah traffic Multiple accidents slow traffic in Dubai Changing face of Karama causes unease among long-term residents Will Hassan Rouhani be Iran’s first single term president?

More like this Mythperceptions: No, Apple is actually pretty good at design Apple’s Q1 2017: Records for the iPhone and services, but the iPad still... The Janus explanation: It’s Microsoft or Apple Video Watch SwapBots spring to life thanks to augmented reality Can you believe that Apple is still making iPads? What the…? Writing for Inquisitr, Daryl Deino can’t. “iPad Pro: Apple is still trying to push tablet to consumers.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Peter Ryan.) What is up with that?! It’s like they want to “sell” these “tablets”! To people! For money! Very strange. The iPad was a very hot item in the early part of this decade, but things have changed. 9.3 million a quarter isn’t hot. What’s hot is 10 million sales of Amazon Echoes a year. What also isn’t hot is 12 million in Apple Watch sales a year. You can see the pattern here, right? Some people make the mistake of thinking that it’s just companies with names starting with “A” that don’t have hot sales but, no, the name also must end in “pple”. Part of this is due to laptop hybrid devices such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro gaining relevance. It’s true that iPad sales are still trending down while Surface sales are, for the most part, trending up. But Apple still made $4.8 billion on iPads last quarter compared to Microsoft’s $1.2 billion on the Surface. And where are Surface sales most likely coming from? Former iPad owners or former owners of crappy third-party Windows-based MacBook Air ripoffs that prefer a better-built laptop without crapware? Look, this is a great business for Microsoft and, to their credit, they stuck with it while pundits like this furry prognosticator pointed their hooves and laughed and laughed and, oh, how we laughed, those were simpler times with a lot more laughing. And now they’re having their OEM’s cake and eating it, too, which would be bad except that the metaphor is really supposed to be “eating their lunch” and Windows OEMs shouldn’t be having cake for lunch, that’s not a healthy lifestyle. Apple keeps releasing new iPads. GAH, SO AGGRAVATING. …they released the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, which Apple said could replace your laptop. However, David Pierce of Wired stressed that the iPad Pro was not a laptop replacement, despite Apple claiming it could be. The Macalope really isn’t sure why we have to keep going through this. The point is, an iPad can be a replacement for a laptop or desktop computer — and is for a fair number of people — depending on what you do. This is another case of what the Macalope calls in loco punditis, which is when a pundit believes they speak for everyone. Hey, pundits: You don’t. A while back the Macalope had a discussion with a pundit on Twitter that went a little like this: Pundit: IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO USE AN IPAD TO EVEN WRITE FOR THE WEB. Macalope: No it isn’t. I’ve done it lots of times. Pundit: UNPOSSIBLE. Macalope: Here’s how I did it: [walks through process] Pundit: Oh. Well, I don’t do it that way. Dude. I mean. Even Ben Sin of Forbes refuted Apple’s claims. Even a writer for the Forbes contributor network and self-service poodle shampooing salon?! ‘Nough said! What sparked Deino’s piece is Apple’s new iPad ads. But, newsflash, Apple zombie faithful, if you go to the ads on YouTube you will find: Many in the comments section aren’t big fans of the ads. [gasp] So far in this piece we’ve learned that a Forbes contributor network writer doesn’t think much of the iPad and YouTube commenters don’t think much of an ad. This is all a little shocking.

WePay clients include GoFundMe, FreshBooks, Meetup, and other major services. Sony A6500 WePay’s support for Apple Pay on the web means the convenient checkout feature should appear in even more places online now. WePay also now supports Google’s Android Pay on the web for Chrome users as well. “Streamlining the mobile checkout experience is a huge opportunity as more and more people use their mobile devices for anything and everything, including their commerce,” said Bill Clerico, CEO of WePay. “Removing the friction that exists today makes paying on mobile devices easier, delivering real value to our platform partners and the people that use them.” WePay says its support for Apple Pay on the web is now available to both new and current platform partners. Shortly after launching last fall, Apple introduced the ability to donate to non-profit organizations including reoccurring donations with Apple Pay over Safari. The company recently expanded the same capability to groups in the UK. Apple Pay on the web has also been said to be the fifth most popular payment method online. Several retailers and merchants promoted Apple Pay on the web over the holidays with special promotional sales and rates.

This blog post will show you how easy it is to configure DreamFactory as your iOS app’s push notification provider. Note that APNs support is a premium feature in DreamFactory's Silver and Gold products, not an open source feature. APNs is a native DreamFactory service that supports role-service-access, live API documentation, script access, etc. Once you've configured APNs in DreamFactory, all the configuration details are hidden from your client. They are securely stored in your DreamFactory instance database. This provides a simple way for your iOS application to send push notifications with DreamFactory. Configuring an APN service is as easy as configuring any other services in the DreamFactory admin console. Start by logging into the admin console, head over to the ‘Services’ tab, and click on the ‘Create’ button on the left sidebar. Use the ‘Service Type’ drop down to select ‘Notification’ -> ‘Apple Push Notification’, complete the service configuration form and save it to create your service.  In the ‘Info’ tab, provide basic service information - Name, Label, and Description. Then in the ‘Config’ tab, provide the following configuration information: Certificate - String. Required. Provide your iOS APNs certificate (.pem) file. If you have the pkcs12 (.p12) file from Apple keychain access, you can convert it to .pem file using the following command: openssl pkcs12 -in my-certificate-file.p12 -out my-certificate-file.pem -nodes -clcerts Replace my-certificate-file.p12 with the name of the certificate file you exported from Keychain Access. Passphrase - String. Optional. If your certificate requires a Passphrase then enter it here. Environment - String. Required. Select your iOS application environment - Development or Production. Service Event - Array. Optional. Here you can tie this APN service to any number of system events. In the example below, we have tied our APN service with two events - “system.admin.session.post” and “system.admin.session.delete.” These events are fired respectively when a system admin logs in and logs out of the DreamFactory. It automatically fires this APN service and sends a push notification to targeted devices. You can enter the push notification message in the Message field. Once you've configured your APNs service, head over to the ‘API Docs’ tab and expand your newly created service to see the API endpoints that are ready to use. You can learn more about these endpoints in the DreamFactory docs. In this post, we quickly covered how simple it is to use DreamFactory to manage and send iOS push notifications with the Apple Push Notification Service. Head on over to the community forum to discuss or let us know what you think in the comments!  Learn how divergent branches can appear in your repository and how to better understand why they are called “branches".  Brought to you in partnership with Wakanda.  Like This Article?

Apple could announce a new iPad as early as next week. But don't expect iPad sales to suddenly return to growth. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Mar 16, 2017 at 9:16AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could announce a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro as early as next week, Japanese blog Mac Otakara reported (via MacRumors) this week. In addition, Apple is expected to introduce both a 10.5-inch iPad Pro with narrower bezels and an updated version of its 12.9-inch iPad Pro sometime soon. While new iPads would likely help Apple's iPad segment, will they be enough to help the segment return to growth? Spoiler alert: Probably not. iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard. Image source: Apple. Declining iPad sales Declining iPad sales are putting pressure on Apple's tablet segment. Apple's iPad sales in the company's most recent quarter, or its first fiscal quarter of 2017, were down quite sharply from the year-ago quarter. iPad units fell 19%, and iPad revenue fell 22%.  Apple's need for new tablets to help revitalize the segment isn't anything new. iPad sales have been declining for years. For instance, Apple's iPad unit sales and revenue during the entire trailing-12-month period were down about 14% and 11%, respectively. Going further, iPad unit sales have been declining on a trailing-12-month basis since the second quarter of 2014. So investors shouldn't expect possible new iPads to suddenly reverse this trend. But this doesn't mean investors shouldn't hope for some solid updates to the lineup. Given that Apple already possesses sizable market share in tablet sales in many of its markets, the company needs to keep its iPads fresh to remain competitive. Image source: Apple. Notably, there's more reason than recent rumors to believe Apple has some new iPads in the works for a launch in the coming weeks. Not only does Apply typically launch new iPads around this time of the year every year, but Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted during the company's fiscal 2017 first-quarter earnings call (via a Reuters transcript) that there were some key updates on the horizon: "If I sort of zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad." Apple remains optimistic about iPad Despite declining iPad sales and the fact that both Apple's services and Mac segment have grown to represent a comparatively larger portion of Apple's total sales recently, Cook still believes the segment has potential, according to his comments in the company's most recent earnings call. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. ... But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad. Cook could be right. iPad could still have some room to run. But based on Apple's drawn-out trend of declining iPad sales, investors shouldn't count on it -- even if the company is preparing to introduce new iPads. Daniel Sparks owns shares of Apple.

Everybody knows that Microsoft and Apple are competing against each other on a daily basis. The competition doesn’t end at operating systems and it extends to gadgets as well. Last year, both companies refreshed their 2-in-1 product offerings and both Microsoft and Apple have enjoyed high success with their Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro devices. Taking in consideration the fact that both Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro have generated huge amounts of profits throughout 2016, everyone is expecting Microsoft and Apple to refresh their lineup once again. Both Microsoft and Apple have done a good job of keeping their mouths shut when asked about their upcoming devices and didn’t unveil any details. Fortunately, both companies have left hints which showed that they are getting ready to refresh their 2-in-1 offerings. Apple iPad Pro 2 vs Microsoft Surface Pro 5: CPU Power Rumor has it that Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 will be powered by either Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 635 chipset or Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processor. Both of them are capable of providing owners with impressive hardware performances and whichever one Microsoft chooses is going to be a wise decision. On the other hand, iPad Pro 2 is also expected to be fueled by Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake chipset. This processor has been built through a special 14-nm manufacturing process. The reason why this process is special is because it increases the processor’s performances by up to 40 percent which is quite a major performance boost. Apple iPad Pro 2 vs Microsoft Surface Pro 5: Display Surface Pro 5 is expected to ship in the 21 inch, 24 inch and 28 inch display models. All panels will use PixelSense technology and will be able to run 4K resolution media content. Even better, the display will feature a high pixel resolution of 3,840 pixels. Traditionally, Apple launches only two variants of its iPad Pro lineup but this year things are going to change. The highly anticipated iPad Pro 2 will be available in the 9.7 inch, 10.5 inch and 12.9 inch variants. The reason why Apple is doing this is because it wants to cater to different budget-ranges. Additionally, these panels will feature True Tone, 3D Touch and Force touch options.

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Apple fans should be happy to know that the Cupertino based tech giant is expected to refresh its iPad Pro offering this year. The already existing iPad Pro models have been quite successful in terms of sales and knowing that Apple is always looking for ways to generate profits, we can be sure that iPad Pro 2 is on its way. The reason why everyone is highly enthusiastic about the upcoming iPad Pro 2 is because it’s expected to bring major changes in comparison with the already existing models. For starters, iPad Pro 2 will be available in three variants and it will be equipped with the brand new A10X processor or Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake chipset. Although Apple has done a good job of keeping iPad Pro 2 under wraps, this hasn’t stopped the tech community from speculating about its specs. We have rounded up the most reoccurring rumors and speculations surrounding iPad Pro 2 and we will present them right now. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Availability As previously mentioned, iPad Pro 2 will ship in three variants. This is quite surprising since Apple traditionally launches only two variants of iPad Pro. The new model will be the 10.5 inches one and it’s going to be mid-budget oriented. The reason why Apple is including another model is because it wants to cater to different budgets. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Processor The 2015 iPad Pro is powered by Apple’s own A9X processor. Even though this chipset is impressive Apple is required to upgrade it. All major companies upgrade their processors whenever a new product is unveiled. Rumor has it that iPad Pro 2 will be fueled by Apple’s more high-end A10X processor. This will give it quite a boost in performance. Additionally, if Apple does decide to go with Intel’s Kaby Lake chipset this will not be a bad decision either. iPad Pro vs iPad Pro 2: Apple Pencil 2 All iPad Pro models have been bundled with a special stylus. The stylus come in quite handy since it broadens the range of features iPad Pro is able to provide owners with. The new iPad Pro 2 is expected to come with a brand new stylus. In fact, Apple has actually patented a new stylus that’s been fitted with a rechargeable battery.

The company’s Tissot brand will introduce a model around the end of 2018 that uses the Swiss-made system, which will also be able to connect small objects and wearables, Swatch Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Thursday. The technology will need less battery power and it will protect data better, he said later at a press conference. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple Inc. entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Hayek faces the uphill challenge of trying to outsmart Google and Apple, which have fended off would-be rivals to their operation systems in smartphones and watches. Hayek’s strategy contrasts with that of LVMH watch chief Jean-Claude Biver, who earlier this week unveiled an upgraded TAG Heuer smartwatch the brand developed with Google and Intel Corp. Competition from smartwatches has hurt low-end timepieces the most, and Hayek has been adding electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and household objects. Swatch’s approach will work better because it’s trying to “think small” as one of the biggest problem for wearable devices is battery drainage, Hayek said, speaking at the Biel, Switzerland headquarters of Omega, another of 18 brands that Swatch produces. © Corinne Gretler BC-SWATCH-OPERATING-SYSTEM “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturize and have an independent operating system,” the CEO said. Shares of Swatch rose 1.4 percent as of 1:24 p.m. in Zurich, giving the company a market value of 19.4 billion francs ($19.5 billion). Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialized in miniaturization, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Tissot has yet to start selling its Smart Touch smartwatch, according to Francois Thiebaud, head of that brand. He said last year the solar-powered watch would be available during 2016, and that it would be connectable to Android and Apple smartphones. It also would have functions such as showing the weather and helping the wearer find lost keys. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in U.S. and European markets as it published its annual report. Hayek said revenue may increase about 7 percent to 9 percent this year. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Leak shows a stunning Galaxy S8 in a stolen Jet Black finish Image Source: Benjamin Geskin Zach Epstein @zacharye March 16th, 2017 at 9:41 AM Share Tweet In September 2016, Apple executives to the stage to unveil Apple’s next-generation iPhones, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. For the first time in nearly a decade of selling smartphones, Apple chose to reuse the same smartphone design for a third consecutive year; in the past, the company would introduce a brand new look every other year in order to keep things fresh. But since the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would once again reuse the iPhone 6’s design from all the way back in 2014, Apple had to find other ways to make things more interesting. The company added a dual-lens camera to the Plus model, it doubled the amount of internal storage at each tier, and it added two new colors to its iPhone lineup, a stealth matte black and a stunning new “Jet Black” with a glossy, mirror-like finish. It looked incredible. So Samsung promptly stole it. Stop us if you’ve heard this one before… Don't Miss: Galaxy S8 vs. iPhone 7 Plus: Hands-on video with S8 mockup shows how they compare While there is precious little question that Samsung travels its own path more so now than it ever has in the past, some old habits are difficult to shake. Late last year, for example, it took the South Korean tech giant less than three months to steal the stunning Jet Black color Apple introduced in September. Samsung had made plenty of black phones before, of course, but it wasn’t until the new iPhones came along that the company added a glossy black option to its flagship smartphone lineup. It looks like the response to Samsung’s take on Jet Black was positive, because the company seemingly plans to keep it in the mix this year when it unveils its hotly anticipated new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones less than two weeks from today. We saw a leaked Galaxy S8 mockup pop up earlier this week in a glossy black color, and now an even bigger leak shows Samsung’s next-generation flagship phone in Jet Black once again. The images were posted on Weibo (via Slashleaks) and they show a handset that is once again believed to be a mockup. As a reminder, third parties use leaked schematics to build to-scale models of unreleased Apple and Samsung smartphones using real materials, and these photos are believed to show one such model. Additional photos of the Jet Black Galaxy S8 dummy follow below, and hopefully they can help tide Android fans over for another two weeks until Samsung finally unveils its new Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones on March 29th.

Anker braided Lightning cables Apple, Google and Facebook are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order. The claim is based on the fact that the companies have not yet signed an amicus brief opposing the ban, despite doing so with the first one. A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump’s first executive order. However, it’s unlikely that Apple has a more favorable view of the second ban. As one of the brief’s authors explained, there is still time for Apple to sign. Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. “We do expect the group to expand.” Apple had not responded to Reuters at the time the site wrote its piece. Apple was one of the first companies to respond to the first travel ban, Tim Cook emailing staff to talk of the importance of immigration to the company before contacting the White House to urge senior contacts to rescind the order and then signing an amicus brief to support a bid to overturn it in court – a bid which was successful. A Hawaiian judge last night ordered an emergency halt to the second travel ban, ruling that it would cause ‘irreparable injury’ by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination. President Trump called the ruling ‘judicial overreach’ and said that he was willing to take the fight all the way to the Supreme Court.

It’s also worth noting that Apple is only launching one iPhone this year with an OLED display, as the other two new 2017 iPhones will continue to use LCD displays like the iPhone 7. The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here Digitimes says that other high production OLED manufacturers will not ramp up until next year at the earliest, which means smaller phone vendors are struggling to source OLED panels as Samsung and Apple dominate the supply chain. Whilst Chinese vendors Oppo and Vivo have guarantee purchase agreements to secure 13% and 10% of total OLED output, Huawei has been left in the cold. Huawei will only be able to use OLED panels on a small proportion of its smartphone units produced this year, as display supply is so limited. In a separate report, Digitimes claims that other phone vendors in China are depending on LTPS TFT-LCD panels due to the dearth of OLED. Apple is showing signs of a similar strategy. Whilst the company is launching three new iPhones this year, only one will use an OLED display according to rumors. Apple is expected to debut a new high-end iPhone design with a 5.8-inch OLED display, a bezel-less front, wireless charging, a purported 3D front camera, and more. This is being dubbed ‘iPhone 8’ thanks to its dramatic improvement in design and feature set, although final branding is not known. Apple is also expected to launch two modest updates to the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus with the same chassis, same display, and a focus on internal component upgrades. Apple apparently wants to use OLED on its entire iPhone range by 2019. Benjamin Mayo @bzamayo Benjamin develops iOS apps professionally and covers Apple news and rumors for 9to5Mac.

Read on for the iPad Pro 2's likely release date, specs, new features, design & UK price rumours. Latest: a new 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro with a bezel-free screen and no Home button has been predicted for an early-April unveiling, as part of the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus by David Price | 16 Mar 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will the iPad Pro 2 be released in the UK (or whatever they call the next version of the iPad Pro for 2017)? And what new features will be added to the 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads? The iPad Pro 2 launch is an exciting prospect - but we may have to wait a bit longer. Apple made a splash in September 2015 when it unveiled its first giant tablet: a device known at the time only as the iPad Pro and equipped with a blockbuster 12.9-inch screen, quad speakers and a super-quick processor chip. The following March a smaller and frankly better 9.7-inch version of the iPad Pro came out, creating mild naming complications (we now call them the iPad Pro 12.9 and iPad Pro 9.7 respectively) and kindling a degree of regret in the hearts of early adopters. But we are now looking ahead to the future of the iPad Pro line. When will Apple release the new iPad Pro 2 for 2017, and what new features and design changes will this product incorporate? Will there be separate 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch editions of the iPad Pro 2 - will there even be a 7.9-inch model, a sort of iPad Pro mini, or a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2? Our iPad Pro 2 release date & new features rumour roundup weighs up all the clues, hints and evidence about the new iPad Pro models for 2017, as well as our wishlist of new features that are missing from the current generation of iPad Pro hardware. Check back regularly for the latest iPad Pro 2 rumours. Updated, 14 March 2017, with analyst predictions of new Apple announcements between 20 and 24 March; on 9 Mar, with predictions that the iPad Pro 2 will have an A10X processor, up to 6GB of RAM and a MacBook Pro-style 'Touch Bar' feature; and previously with rumours about a possible iPad Pro 2 delay, and a stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro with a 10.5in screen, a dual-lens camera and a new 'wine' colour option. Read next: iPad buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iPad Pro deals UK When will the iPad Pro 2 come out? Late March 2017 still seems a good bet, although it could be slightly later. (Read more: What to expect at Apple's March 2017 event.) "Reputable supply chain analysts" cited by MacRumors claim that Apple will announce new products in late March 2017, with the most likely dates between 20 and 24 March. The sources, who asked to remain anonymous, do not specify the products Apple will unveil, or even that there will be a press event to accompany the announcements; indeed, given the imminence of those dates time is starting to run out for one. (Apple generally sends out invitations about 10 days ahead of an event.) It's possible that Apple will quietly send out a press release and update its online stores; or maybe it will be a last-minute thing. DigiTimes, meanwhile, quotes "Taiwan-based supply chain makers" who say production of the planned 10.5-inch iPad has been brought forward to March (from a previously planned May-June schedule) and will be unveiled at an event in early April. This event will mark the inauguration of the new Apple Park campus, the site says. (Apple has announced that Apple Park will open in April 2017, although work on the headquarters will continue for some time afterwards.)  In January 2017 the Chinese-language site Wei Feng reported a rumour from Apple's Asian supply-chain, which claimed the iPad Pro 2 would launch in March 2017 alongside the Apple Pencil 2. "Wei Feng network through the supply chain that Apple will be held in March this year, iPad new conference, when a new generation of Apple Pencil stylus will also be unveiled," the site reports, as interpreted by Google Chrome's built-in translation. Then in February, new reports emerged from Japanese website Mac Otakara that backed up the claims at the iPad Pro 2 would arrive in March, also suggesting that there would be a new 7.9in iPad Pro, 9.7in iPad Pro, 10.5in iPad Pro and a 12.9in iPad Pro. During Apple's September 2016 event, there was no mention of the iPad line (focusing instead on the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2), while its October event showcased a smart if costly new MacBook Pro. If it had a new iPad Pro up its sleeve, surely Apple could have found time at one of these events to mention it... which suggests to us that the iPad Pro 2 is being held back until spring 2017. March is generally when Apple holds its first event of the year. However, DigiTimes believes Apple will delay the release date of some 2017 iPads: namely the new 10.5in iPad, which we go into detail about below, and the iPad Pro 2. The site claims that Apple will announce the iPad Pro 2, along with a the 10.5in iPad and a cheaper 9.7in iPad to replace the iPad Air 2, at an event in March. While the new 9.7in iPad should ship fairly soon after the announcement, sources claim the iPad Pro 2 and 10.5in iPad won't be released until May or June. Time will tell, and we'll keep you in the loop. One iPad launch event, or two? As with the two strands of iPhone models - the mid-size iPhone 7 and large-screen iPhone 7 Plus, both launched in September 2016, and the smaller iPhone SE, released in March 2016 - there are two schools of thought here. Either Apple will unify the two Pro brands into a single annual update event, or it will continue to update half the models in spring and the other half in autumn. Both theories have downsides. If, as now looks likely, Apple does a full refresh (9.7-in and 12.9-inch together) in March 2017, then the current hardware will be starting to feel old before then - the original Pro will be 18 months old, which is a long time to be the most expensive tablet on Apple's books. Then again, the company would have been in almost as tricky a position if it did a full refresh in September, presumably upsetting a bunch of people who just bought new devices. Three major iPad updates in the space of 12 months might just be taking the mickey. There's also something a bit messy, a bit un-Apple, about having two press event to announce what would essentially amount to two SKUs of the same product line. I think the company will want to keep things simple. A final thought, however, is that people don't update their iPads as often as their iPhones: only 6 percent of the respondents to our poll said they get a new iPad every year. It's therefore debatable whether Apple actually needs to bring out new iPads this often. It could probably switch to a biennial release schedule without causing much of a problem. Read next: iPad Air 3 rumours | iPad mini 5 rumours | Apple Pencil 2 rumours Will Apple launch a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro? The latest rumours suggest that after the lack of an iPad Pro update in autumn 2016, Apple will make up for this in 2017 by launching an entirely new size of iPad. Ming-Chi Kuo, a market analyst with a strong track record, has published a report making predictions about Apple's moves over the next couple of years. Kuo is cautious in his iPad sales predictions - cutting a previous estimate of 45 to 50 million for the year to 35 to 40 million, partly because of a lack of new products in the near term: despite a comparatively strong performance in Q3 2016, iPad sales remain flat - but argues that Apple will sell three sizes of iPad. There will be a 12.9-inch Pro, a 9.7-inch regular iPad and a new 10.5-inch Pro, Kuo predicts, with the smallest offered as a low-cost option with a lower-powered processor as well as a smaller screen. Kuo's reasoning is that an 'inbetweener' 10.5-inch iPad Pro would sell well to the education and business sectors: "If the iPad comes in a larger size, such as a 10.5-inch model, we believe it will be helpful to bid for tenders within the commercial and education markets. As a result, we expect Apple to launch a 10.5-inch iPad Pro in 2017." These three iPad sizes don't include the 7.9-inch form factor of the iPad mini. Apple could continue to sell the mini alongside the three other iPads, but the success of the iPhone 6 Plus and the iPhone 7 Plus means Apple may feel that this area is covered by its phablet offerings. But we'll discuss the prospects of an 'iPad Pro mini' in the next section. This new 10.5in or even 10.9in size is rumoured to come with a bezel-free design, as it will accommodate the larger screen in a smaller form-factor. This might potentially see the end of the home button. Ming-Chi Kuo has reiterated his prediction in a January 2017 report, once again claiming that new iPad models for Q2 2017 will be 12.9-inch, 10-10.5-inch, and 9.7-inch.  He notes that the 12.9-inch model will be "the second generation of the existing 12.9" iPad Pro," that the new in-between size will be "the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design," and that the 9.7-inch model will be "the low-priced option." The first two will run on a new A10X chip, with the latter on an A9 chip. With that in mind, it looks like the likeliest outcome would be for the 12.9-inch model to be a new iPad Pro 2, the 10-10.5-inch model to be a smaller Pro, and the lower-price 9.7-inch model simply branded as the iPad. Once again, there was no mention of a successor to the 7.9-inch mini, adding fuel to the speculation that it will be phased out by Apple - unless it plans to stick the 'mini' name on the 9.7-inch model. Kuo also notes that while he expects another decline in the volume of iPads shipped in 2017 - down to 35-37 million - this is set to be a smaller decline than seen in 2016, and will be offset by a rise in the average selling price of the devices, leading him to conclude that the "worst has passed for Apple's iPad." Will there be an iPad Pro mini? Following the launch of the 9.7-inch Pro it's now firmly established that the Pro brand doesn't just refer to Apple's biggest tablets - instead, it refers to a set of specs and features and, in a way that's hard to define, any tablet that sits at the top of Apple's range. If we accept that a 9.7-inch tablet can be an iPad Pro, could we get a 7.9-inch Pro as well? The truth is that there's no concrete reason why there can't be a 7.9-inch iPad Pro 2, but for various reasons we still don't expect Apple to do this. For one thing, unlike the Air line-up, the minis are still being updated; the mini 4 came out at the same event as the first iPad Pro, which suggests that Apple plans to keep both brands going at the same time. And besides, the Pro brand has always existed in opposition to a lower-end alternative: the MacBook Pro sits opposite the MacBook Air (and plain MacBook); the Mac Pro opposite the iMac; and so on. Apple can't just call every tablet a Pro. We're starting to suspect that the Air brand may be phased out across Apple's laptop and tablet departments, but there still needs to be two lines left in each of these areas. Apple still sell a MacBook Pro and a 12-inch MacBook, we expect; in the same way, we'd expect there to be iPad Pro models and iPad mini models. To read more about the iPad mini 5 - or the iPad Pro mini - then take a look at our iPad mini 5 rumour roundup. What design changes will we see in the iPad Pro 2? Let's talk next about the iPad Pro 2's design. Apple Pencil changes Mac Observer has reported, via Weibo, that the Apple Pencil 2 might include a magnet to attach to the side of the iPad Pro - much like with Microsoft's Surface Pro models. This rumour was backed up in January 2017, when a report by the Czech-language website LetemSvetemApplem also claimed that magnets will enable you to attach the Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pro 2, citing "information directly from suppliers in China". The site also predicts that the next Apple Pencil will have a clip on the side, like a pen, which would stop it from rolling away across the nearest table - and also mean you can clip it to your pocket. Read more: Apple Pencil 2 rumours Folding iPad We'll start with the most out-there rumour. Analyst Gene Munster - he of the relentless and widely mocked 'Apple television' predictions, who in my opinion was somewhat vindicated when it turned out that Apple had been developing a telly but gave up on the plan - has predicted that Apple is going to make a foldable iPad. The prediction, reported by Apple Must, cites recent patent activity that shows Apple is exploring the idea of a foldable iPhone, and extrapolates this concept to the tablet sphere (where, because of the larger form factor of the devices, a folding design probably makes more sense). The timing of the prediction is interesting, coming as it does shortly after the end of the first series of Westworld, HBO's violent and disorienting TV series based on the 1970s Yul Brynner film of the same name. In Westworld, the human programmers who set the behaviours and personalities of the park's western-themed android inhabitants do all their programming on slick foldable tablets. The foldable tablet designs on the show make a lot of sense and look fantastic. (The idea of programmers working exclusively on tablets presently seems less plausible.) Bezel-free screen Macotakara, a Japanese-language Apple site, predicts that the iPad Pro 2 will have a largely bezel-free screen and no Home button, citing sources in Taiwan. The bezel (the non-screen area around the edge of the screen on an iPad, which you hold while using the device) will apparently be removed from the bottom of the iPad Pro, meaning the Home button will disappear, and Touch ID will have to be integrated into the screen itself. Oddly, the site predicts that the bezel will remain at the top of the iPad Pro 2, and will continue to house the front-facing FaceTime camera. 'Touch Bar' menu bar An odd but increasingly widespread rumour proposes that the iPhone 8 will feature a function area, somewhat like the Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro. Now the rumour has mutated - apparently the iPad Pro 2 is going to get a Touch Bar function area too! It's not an immediately compelling concept, given that the Touch Bar on the MacBook offers a mini touchscreen strip between the non-touch-sensitive main screen and non-customisable keyboard - a sort of overlap between the two - so you don't need to reach up to use a full touchscreen and get tired arms, but on iPhone/iPad there's no such compromise to be made. The entire screen is accessible, and this would appear to be a reduction in functionality compared to a full-chassis conventional touchscreen. The thinking seems to be that this will take the place of the Home button and lower bezel area of the iPad, replacing these with a customisable touch-sensitive area that will ordinarily be occupied by frequently used menus and icons. What isn't clear is whether this area will be accessible when viewing photos and videos full screen. Thicker design Macotakara also believes that the 12.9-inch model of the iPad Pro 2 will be 3mm thicker than its predecessor, and says the middle-size model of the iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not 10.5-inch as has been rumoured elsewhere. What tech specs will the iPad Pro 2 include? Let's look next at the internal changes expected from the next iPad. Processor This is an easy one. We strongly expect the iPad Pro 2 to include a modified version of the A10 Fusion chip featured in the iPhone 7 - a strategy Apple usually follows with the iPad it releases shortly after a new iPhone. This modified processor will probably be called the A10X, or A10X Fusion. The Chinese-language site Anzhuo agrees, predicting "iPad Pro 2 will be equipped with A10X chip". RAM The iPad Pro came with 2GB of RAM (in the case of the 9.7-inch model) or 4GB (on the 12.90-inch version). We're fairly sure Apple will offer 4GB across the iPad Pro 2 range, but some believe it might be more generous. Anzhuo, in the same article linked above, thinks we can expect 4GB and 6GB options - matched presumably to the medium and large-screen models, although the site doesn't specify this. Leaked photos, videos and concept illustrations of the iPad Pro 2 This is where we will post the best and most convincing leaked photos and concept designs and videos created by artists and designers. Still from iPad Pro 2 concept video Concept video of iPad Pro 2 We'll start with this stunning concept video showing the iPad Pro 2 in all its (imagined) glory. The iPad depicted here has a 10.5-inch, 4K screen and a dual-lens rear-facing camera, and comes in six colours: adding white, purple ('wine'), and the black and Jet Black options from the iPhone 7 to the currently available gold and Rose Gold. Photos of iPad Pro 2 AppleInsider has published two photos ostensibly showing the iPad Pro 2, which were sent into the site by an anonymous reader. The images, like most Apple hardware leaks, are said to originate from the Asian supply chain; in this case it's said to be an employee at a Chinese supplier who has taken and leaked the photos. Both photos show the same onscreen imagery - the General > About tab of the Settings app, chosen presumably because it includes model number designations and other details that can corroborate the photo's legitimacy. (But, as AppleInsider observes, such details are not difficult to spoof, so the photos may yet be fake.) The About page says the depicted iPad is model MH1C2CD/F: that certainly sounds right, since that designation hasn't been given to any publicly known iPads, while broadly following the conventions of earlier Pro models. (The 128GB cellular 12.9-inch iPad Pro, for instance, is designated ML3K2B/A. By contrast, the iPad Air 2 uses a slightly different format: the 128GB cellular model is MH332B/A.)  Although, we should note that spoofing the model number can be changed relatively easily. More so, the model shows only 12GB of available storage - this can however be a test version, where 12GB of internal storage is more than sufficient. As one would expect, the depicted iPad is running a version of iOS 10 - you can tell because Siri gets its own top-level tab in the Settings app rather than a sub-category within General. Unfortunately - or conveniently, if you're cynical - it's virtually impossible to deduce anything else about the device from the shots, which don't show hardware ports or buttons, and have nothing else in frame with which to compare size of screen and so on. About all this tells us is that a new iPad Pro is probably on its way in the next few months.  Once we know more information or sent more details on the screenshots we will update this article. Our iPad Pro 2 new features wishlist The iPad Pro tablets are great, but they're not perfect. Here are a few new features and design tweaks we'd like to see in the second-gen iPad Pro. Bring the 9.7in Pro's new features across to the 12.9in model An issue we've addressed several times across this article concerns the disappointment felt by a number of 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners when the cheaper and in many respects better 9.7-inch iPad Pro was launched six months later. So the first thing we'd ask for is consistency. To achieve this the larger Pro model needs to get: A 12-megapixel rear-facing camera (up from 8Mp) A 5Mp front-facing camera (up from 1.2Mp) 4K video recording Live Photos Display with True Tone and 'wide colour' A 32GB cellular buying option A pink colour option Better keyboard accessory (for 9.7-inch model) The Pros are explicitly aimed at business users, and for this reason it was critical to get some good keyboard accessories. Apple's own Smart Keyboard is a strong offering in the larger size - even though it's expensive, and Macworld is divided on the issue of whether Logitech's less attractive Create keyboard offers a better typing experience - but the 9.7-inch version is a different matter. As a result of the smaller keys typing accuracy is weaker; the lower weight means it feels less satisfying under the fingers. (The design looks great, however, and is magnificently slim and light from a portability point of view. And the Smart Connector - and the fact that you never have to worry about battery life - is wonderful too.) We feel that Apple needs to create - or persuade a third-party accessory maker to create - a 9.7-inch keyboard you can really type on. And this may involve some compromises. It may need to have a foldout design (sounds ugly, right?) so that it could fit in larger keys. It might need to be heavier (thereby reducing portability) in order to feel better and reduce movement on the desk. But whatever happens, the smaller Pro needs an updated accessory line-up in order to compete as a business tool. Read next: Best iPad keyboards More (smaller) Home screen icons This is a software change rather than a hardware one, but it's frustrating that Apple doesn't allow you to fit more app icons on the screen of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. At present you're allowed 20 app icons (or folders), plus up to six in the Dock, and this is exactly the same that you're allowed on the 9.7-inch iPads, which feels like a waste of the extra space. By default, the icons are the same size, so there's far more empty space on the screen. You can select a zoom view, with larger icons, but we'd prefer the option to have a grid of 5x6 icons, plus a seventh icon in the Dock. iOS 10 We expect the new iPad Pro 2 to ship with iOS 10 pre-installed. Apple's latest mobile operating system brought more than 100 new and updated features. However, no special iPad-only features that have yet been announced or discovered on iOS 10 - so we hope Apple will address this during their March 2017 presentation. iOS 11 will come out in autumn 2017; if the iPad Pro 2 doesn't come out until then - which would be a disappointment, frankly - then it will come with that OS preinstalled instead. Processor We expect the iPad Pro 2 to be shipped with the A10X, a variant on the A10 Fusion processor found in the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Rumours suggest the A10X will be an upgraded A9X built on a smaller FinFET technology. This would point towards a release date of spring 2017, with a new 10nm processor included within the iPad Pro 2. Might we also see 4K (3840x2160) recording abilities? Some rumours suggest that the feature will be integrated within the OS, as the likes of the nVidia and AMD mobile-generation graphics cards might make an appearance within the iPad Pro 2.  Design & display There are certain rumours suggesting that the iPad Pro 2 will feature an OLED or a flexible AMOLED display. Both are possibilities, but it's unlikely Apple will change their display manufacturing process. Nevertheless, it's a speculation some have - as Apple is losing its market share in the tablet industry and with ever growing competition, analysts predict Apple needs to react in a drastic fashion to interest consumers to stay or switch to an Apple product. Some say that the next iPad Pro 2 will feature a borderless design, providing a much better user experience and again, a more unique tablet in the market.  It's also rumoured that the new 12.9in iPad will be 0.3mm thicker, which would be a surprise - especially if it adds better battery life. Through this rumour by Japanese site Makotakara (spotted by 9to5Mac), we could see various design changes, such as the removal of the famous home button - not only on the iPad, but also on the upcoming iPhone 8.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iOS 11 chaos: Nearly 200,000 apps could soon be obsolete, and Apple wants it that way Apple recently conducted a purge of broken or unsupported apps, and had removed 47,300 apps from its store in last October. Kukil Bora   March 16, 2017 18:16 IST An Apple iPhone 7 and the company logo are seen in this illustration picture taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau A 64-bit architecture for all iOS apps is inevitable. Apple itself issued a warning in the iOS 10.3 beta saying all 32-bit apps "will not work with future versions of iOS." But when can we expect that to happen? An analytics firm called Sensor Tower has performed an analysis of currently active apps in the App Store, and has determined that approximately 187,000 32-bit apps could be incompatible with iOS 11, the upcoming version of Apple's mobile operating system. Although the number represents only about 8 percent of nearly 2.4 million apps available in the company's official app marketplace, the actual figure could potentially be much higher because Sensor Tower's numbers are based on apps that were submitted before the launch of the iPhone 5s – the first iOS device to feature a 64-bit processor – in September 2013. While Apple had been encouraging developers to update their apps to support the 64-bit processors, Sensor Tower discovered in September last year that about 16 percent of the App Store apps hadn't been updated in more than three years. The new restriction could affect nearly 8 percent of apps on the App Store, effectively rendering them outdated.Sensor Tower A much-needed purge Apple apparently had it enough, and now it has started forcing developers to get their apps up to scratch. Previously, iOS used to simply warn that 32-bit apps might slow down a device. The iPhone-maker recently conducted a purge of broken or unsupported apps, and had reportedly removed as many as 47,300 apps from its store in last October. It was in February 2015 when Apple required new apps to offer 64-bit support. The company also said it would reject updates for 32-bit apps from June 2015. Therefore, if iOS 11 will indeed be 64-bit only, Apple will have to brick all the 32-bit apps once the new iOS version rolls out. And, games being the single largest category of iOS apps worldwide, they lead the pack of potentially affected apps as well. Being the single largest category of iOS apps worldwide, games lead the pack of potentially affected apps.Sensor Tower No, you can't blame Apple for this. In fact, it's a much-needed move to make the App Store a less-crowded space, and enhance the performance of future iOS versions running on new 64-bit devices. How does the push for 64-bit matter to you? If you are using older iOS devices built on 32-bit architecture – including the iPhone 5, 5c and older, the standard version of the iPad and the first iPad mini – you will not be able to update the firmware to the new iOS version. In addition, if you are still using older 32-bit apps on your newer iOS devices, it's time for you to look for a new version. And if it's not there, you can ask the developers to migrate from 32-bit to 64-bit before it's too late. If you are wondering why the new 64-bit architecture is not cooperative, the answer is quite straight-forward – it's not designed to work that way. A 32-bit OS can run on both 32-bit and 64-bit processor without any hassle while a 32-bit app runs on a 32-bit or 64-bit OS. However, a 64-bit app runs only on a 64-bit OS, which is compatible only with a 64-bit processor. Although very likely, Apple embracing 64-bit and ditching 32-bit is still just a speculation. Even if the company is planning to make iOS 11 a cutoff point for older, non-compliant apps, it has been known to push back deadlines.

The Cupertino giant’s patent applications for a new invention have been published online, and they contain details on how Apple wants to incorporate biometric sensors into its Bluetooth earbuds.  Just this Thursday, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published three patent applications —20170078780, 20170078781 and 20170078785 — that Apple filed back in September 2015. All three are entitled “Earbuds with biometric sensing,” and based on the information they contain, it seems the tech giant has long mapped a plan of introducing a more health-centric set of wireless headphones. When Apple introduced the AirPods last year, it was banking on the fact that the earbuds were wireless and effortlessly pair up with the iPhone and other devices. The headphones quickly skyrocketed to fame with their always connected state and their ability to sense movements to know when to pause the audio or music. The pair of earbuds also has a connection to Siri, so users can summon the AI assistant without having to take out their iPhone. Although the AirPods may have succeeded in the market given its features, Apple is still not content with what its wireless headphones have to offer. In the published patent applications, it is stated there that Samsung’s biggest rival intends to develop an advanced set of AirPods configured with one or more biometric sensors. One sensor is going to be strategically placed in an AirPod, so that it can read biometric measurements from the tragus of the ears.  Apple also indicated in the patents that the housing of the AirPods should be symmetric, so that each piece can be interchangeably worn on either ear. In this type of embodiment of the invention, Apple intends to configure the sensor and circuitry in such a manner that they would function no matter which position the earbud is in.  Apple Insider pointed out that the illustrations for the wireless headphones suggest that they could look like a large hearing aid. However, such illustrations are only provided as part of the patents, the invention could still end up with a different aesthetic design at launch. The original AirPods were introduced without a clear timeline for an upgrade unlike the iPhone and the iPad that have yearly cycles. Therefore, it isn’t clear when these patents would materialize. Since the original AirPods arrived in December last year, it’s unlikely for a refresh to surface this year.  Apple’s newest patents indicate that the Cupertino giant could be working on an AirPods successor.

But after it was brought back in a slightly less extreme form, the biggest companies have dropped their opposition to it. A group of 58 technology companies, including Airbnb, Lyft and Dropbox, filed a "friend of the court" brief in the case saying the second order hurt their ability to recruit the best talent from around the world. But that was much shorter than the initial list of companies, which included Apple, Facebook and Google – which filed a brief opposing the first ban in a different court challenge brought by Washington state, which is ongoing.

GAME Digital Donald Trump's second ban was blocked by a Hawaii judge just hours before it was intended to go into effect. The emergency order halted the ban and led to an angry response from the President. The action was the latest legal blow to the administration's efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries, which the President has said is needed for national security. Trump lashed out at the judge's ruling, saying it "makes us look weak." Read more Donald Trump's revised executive order is a Muslim ban, says judge Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. US District Judge Derrick Watson put an emergency stop to the new order in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of Hawaii, which argued that the order discriminated against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution. Judge Watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention Islam by name, "a reasonable, objective observer ... would conclude that the Executive Order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion." Watson was appointed to the bench by former Democratic President Barack Obama. Speaking at a rally in Nashville, Trump called his revised executive order a "watered-down version" of his first. "I think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place," Trump said. Trump called the judge's block "unprecedented judicial overreach" and said he will take the case "as far as it needs to go," including to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Department of Justice called the ruling "flawed both in reasoning and in scope," adding that the president has broad authority in national security matters. "The Department will continue to defend this Executive Order in the courts," it said a statement.

Over the course of a seven month investigation, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) discovered Apple Rus had told 16 retailers to hold the prices of iPhones, including the iPhone 5s, 5c, 6, 6 Plus and the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus for around three months. According to an official report from the FAS, the organisation monitored the prices offered by the stores and if they were found to be "unsuitable", it would send an email telling the retailer to amend them. However, the report revealed Apple Rus was very supportive of the investigations, allowing authorities to look into its dealings. It also stated Apple, the parent company, was not involved at all. "In the course of the proceedings the Russian subsidiary of Apple actively cooperated with the Russian FAS," the state secretary - deputy head of FAS Russia, Andrei Tsarikovsky, said in a statement. "The company has adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law and has brought in a policy to prevent similar violations in the future: the company has developed a detailed antimonopoly compliance [programme and] organised training for employees in Russian antimonopoly legislation norms." Tsarikovsky told the Interfax news agency it hasn't been decided if Apple will be fined, although a report by The Financial Times says it could be up to 15% of Apple's Russian iPhone sales. If a fine is imposed, it will have three months to appeal the decision.

By Rishabh Jain On 03/16/17 AT 8:23 AM Close Apple could probably launch four iPad Pro models in April, Greek website Techvalue reported on Tuesday.  In addition to the rumored 10.5-inch iPad Pro 2 model, the iPad Mini Pro could also be unveiled at Apple’s upcoming iPad event, the report stated. So, in totality this could be Apple’s iPad lineup: iPad Pro 2 9.7-inch model iPad Pro 2 10.5-inch model iPad Pro 2 12.9-inch model iPad Mini Pro If the report is accurate, it could point towards Apple’s consolidation of the iPad lineup. Apple could possibly start coming out with just iPad Pro models from this year. This would also mean that the iPad Mini would be replaced by the iPad Mini Pro. In addition to this, the company seems to have killed off the iPad Air, since it has not refreshed it from the time the iPad Air 2 was launched in 2014. Read: iPad Pro 2 Might Launch On April 4 Apple is expected to unveil the 2017 iPad range on April 4 at its new spaceship campus in Apple Park. Apple remains a standalone player in a declining tablet industry, commanding 23.2 percent market share in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to a Strategy Analytics report published in February. Overall, the tablet market fell 9 percent in the quarter. Apple shipped 13.1 million iPads in Q4 2016, according to the report. The number is less in comparison to 16.1 million iPads shipped in Q4 2015, yet Apple’s market share has jumped up from 20.6 percent for the same period in 2015. Basically, what the numbers are saying is that while Apple is gaining a better foothold in the tablet industry, overall tablet sales are declining year-on-year. Read: iPad Pro 2: Expected Features While market players such as Sony have simply moved out of the tablet market, Apple is expected to brave it out and keep consumers interested in investing in tablets. The company is expected to endow its 2017 iPad range with features such as Touch Bar, an Apple A10X processor, a new Apple Pencil and a 12-megapixel rear camera.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Watch Invention Aims to Extend Activities and Monitoring Data for Cyclists | Main | Apple Skips Legal Challenge to President Trump's Latest Travel Ban » March 16, 2017 Apple Invents a Smarter iPad Pro 'Virtual' Keyboard that Creates a Temporary Touch Pad when needed & more   Last week Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple invents a Twist to the iPad Pro Smart Keyboard by replacing it with a Secondary Display & Virtual Keyboard." Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that expands on a possible smarter version of the iPad Pro Smart Keyboard or an alternative smart keyboard that's based on a virtual keyboard that could offer users more flexibility and features like being able to swipe a finger anywhere on the virtual keyboard and it understand that you're gesturing and create a temporary trackpad area as noted in our cover graphic and below in FIG. 20.   To create a more realistic virtual keyboard Apple's focus is on delivering a unique 'Force Feedback' system for a future virtual keyboard that's based on a new magnets system. The new force feedback system would provide users with a realistic "clicking" sensation when hitting keys to mimic a physical keyboard feel.   While the bulk of the patent application is focused on the magnets system, the filing also shows us a few advantages of the new virtual keyboard. There's the virtual trackpad noted in patent FIG. 20 and in FIG. 19 we're shown that the keys on a virtual keyboard could adjust to a user typing in the passenger seat in a car, or on a bus, train, plane or other vehicle where sudden movement could slightly throw off a user's hands. In such instances the keyboard would adjust the keyboard  horizontally to compensate for the movement in the vehicle so that your typing isn't turned into gibberish output.   Apple's patent application 20170076885 was filed back in Q3 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

Replacing an iPhone or Android in the middle of a contract or a payment plan is expensive, and with trade-in offers there is less chance that you have a spare phone to rely on. We’ll walk through the options you can use to fix your broken iPhone screen or broken Android screen. There are a variety of ways you can fix your broken screen and options to look for help. If you drop your iPhone or Android without a case you may end up looking for a solution. Cases can help, but the odds are good that if you are reading this you are looking for a solution for a screen you already cracked. 5 best options to fix a broken smartphone screen. Here are the options you should consider using to fix your broken smartphone screen without breaking the bank. You don’t need to go buy a new iPhone for $650 or pay full price for a new Android phone out-of-pocket to fix your device. You can get a temporary fix for a few dollars and there are great options that cost $100-$200. If you have a warranty you can pay as little as $29 for a replacement iPhone screen and some cell phone stores even offer same day repairs. If you end up with a cracked screen, here are five different repair options that could work for you. 1. Contact the Manufacturer Before you attempt any DIY screen repair options you should check with the company that made your phone. See if you can get a free screen repair or replacement. Apple offers AppleCare+ if you buy within 60 days of buying a new device. This is $99 to $129 depending on your iPhone and there is a deductible for accidental damage. You are supposed to buy this before your iPhone screen breaks, but we’ve seen Apple Geniuses allow users to buy this plan with a broken screen and then get a replacement. We’ve also seen the occasional free repair, but that depends on a lot of factors lining up in your favor. If you have AppleCare+ you only need to pay $29 for a screen repair and they will do it in the store while you wait. HTC offers an Uh-Oh protection plan that covers a screen replacement if your HTC One M9 breaks within the first year. This is a free replacement and the new device arrives fast. Samsung sells a Galaxy S7 warranty and warranty plans for other Samsung phones like AppleCare+ does. If you buy this before the damage happens you are covered. 2. Screen Protector or Tape If you cannot fix your broken smartphone screen right away, there are some steps you can take to use the iPhone or Android with a broken screen. Assuming only the glass is broken, which means the screen still shows an image and responds to touch, you can use this as a stopgap until you can afford to replace the screen yourself. Use a temporary solution if you have an upgrade coming or need to save up for a repair. Clean the screen as best you can and then place a wide piece of packaging tape over the screen. Trim off any excess tap and you should be able to continue using the phone. This will prevent the crack from growing and parts of the glass from falling off onto your lap or into your finger. You can also buy a screen protector to place over the broken screen. A glass protector or a good plastic one will at least keep your screen in the current condition. 3. DIY Screen Repair and Replacement The cheapest way to fix a broken iPhone screen or broken Android screen is to perform a DIY screen replacement. This is involved, but it is not impossible. You can replace the screen on your iPhone or Android fairly easily using online tutorials. Sometimes you will need to replace the screen and other times you will only need to replace the glass. Try a DIY iPhone screen repair or Android repair. iFixit is a great option for learning how to replace a cracked screen yourself. They offer DIY screen replacement guides for many devices. DIY iPhone Screen Replacement Guide DIY iPad Screen Replacement Guide DIY Android Screen Replacement Guide You can buy a new Android or iPhone screen from iFixit, from eBay, Amazon and other sites. Make sure you do your research so that you get the right screen for your device and that you get a good quality one if you plan to buy one that is not an original replacement (OEM replacement). Make sure you also buy the tools you need to complete a replacement. Watch a YouTube video and look at the guides before you buy parts to make sure it is something you can complete. Depending on the tools and parts you need, this DIY screen repair could cost you $100 to $250. 4. Out of Warranty Repair If you are not able to spend the time or you don’t have the expertise needed to repair your cracked iPhone screen or cracked Android screen on your own, there are other options instead of buying a new phone. Make sure you investigate out of warranty repair costs before you try fixing it yourself. Look into the out of warranty repair option for your device. Apple offers an out of warranty iPhone screen repair option that is cheaper than buying the parts and doing it yourself in many cases. iPhone 5 Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone 5s/c Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone 6 Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $109 iPhone 6 Plus Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone SE Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone 6s Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone 6s Plus Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $149 iPhone 7 Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $129 iPhone 7 Plus Out of Warranty Screen Replacement – $149 You will need to contact Samsung, HTC or other manufacturers to get the cost of fixing your broken Android screen out of warranty. 5. Local Repair Shop If you are not near an Apple Store or don’t want to send your Android phone back to the manufacturer you can look into a local repair shop. Even in smaller cities there is usually one place doing repairs to broken iPhone screens or Android screens. Find a local repair shop to fix your broken smartphone screen. Keep in mind these sources may not all use the same level of parts. Apple no longer voids your warranty when a third party iPhone screen repair is done. This is good news, but if there is any damage to the iPhone from the third-party repair you may end up with a voided warranty. If your phone is less than a year old it may be worth checking the official repair options. Research the place to find out if they offer any warranty on their work. Many places will offer at least a short period where they promise the repair will not break. 9 Best iPhone 7 Screen Protectors InvisibleShield iPhone 7 Screen Protectors   1 / 5 These iPhone 7 screen protectors will help protect your iPhone screen with 7x shatter protection or help repel oil and smudges from your iPhone 7 screen.

Common. Try this new thing called Google to check out your recommendations. 01/21/2014 Seth Baum Reply Man I SO wish there was something like that – not for a true fix of a real cracked screen – but when you just get some hairline scratches (keys or whatever did it) and wish you could “cover” or “buff them out” – nothing under the screen was afffected and no glass was lost. Just a scratch here and there. 02/19/2014 desi Reply I can not believe that you all offered the cracked glass spray as a option and mentioned (with all seriousness) that it was released earlier last year….research and reading options before you write an article on it is suggested so your reputation is in tack. Remind me not to take advise from this writer lol…Next thing I know you will have “ESP fax service replacing united postal service, cheaper options for sending messages!” 05/04/2014 annabell Reply I don’t know if I should buy it because my phone got cracked and it wont work anymore :(…. 05/13/2014 Debbie Reply You say five repair options. You’ve given two, replace it yourself, get someone else to replace it? Since when is insurance a repair option, kind of moot if it’s already cracked, don’t you think????? 06/08/2014 Robert Reply An April Fool’s joke and a lot of “replace the danged screen” options. Not once do I see a “repair” option listed, and yet you title the article with the word “repair.” Get rid of this SEO junk and use the right word or just don’t post an article. The few dollars a year of ad revenue you pull from this article isn’t worth the hours of people’s time you’ve wasted with this misleading trash. 06/10/2014 Pawel Reply I Found A Cheap Website That Dose An Excellent Job Replacing Screens So you Don’t Have To worry About Breaking Something More Info Visit http://www.fixyourmobile.net 09/21/2015 andrewsean7830 Reply It is really a nice and helpful piece of information.

In late January, Apple pulled its iOS 10.2.1 update out of beta and released it to iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners around the world. iOS 10.2.1 is a small update but it’s an important one and it continues to reign as the most up-to-date version of iOS 10. Some of you might’ve installed the iOS 10.2.1 update when it first came out. Many others decided to install the update today. Whatever the case, there are a few do’s and don’ts we want to share with you. We’ve been taking a close look at the iOS 10.2.1 update and many of our guides look at what to do before installing iOS 10.2.1. This guide walks you through some steps to take, and things to avoid, after you install iOS 10.2.1 on your device. Do: Test Connectivity One of the first things you’ll want to do after installing iOS 10.2.1 on your iPhone or iPad is to quickly check all of your connections to make sure they are working properly. Check your Wi-Fi connectivity. Pair your iPhone or iPad with your most important Bluetooth devices. This is especially important if you wear an Apple Watch. Head into Apple Maps or Google Maps and try out your GPS. You’ll also want to keep a close eye on your LTE/4G connectivity. If you use your device to control various appliances in your home (lights, heat, front door lock, etc), you’ll also want to make sure those connections are working properly as well. Do: Test Your Apps & Services You’ll also want to test all of your important applications and services to ensure they’re working properly. There’s a chance an app or a service you use for work or school will start acting up after you install the iOS 10.2.1 update. We hear about weird bugs and Enterprise issues all the time. If you run into a problem you’ll want to check the App Store to make sure you’re running the latest version of the app. Developers have been rolling out a steady stream of bug fix updates in 2017 and there might be one available for your device. If you run into an issue with a service you use for work, you’ll want to get in contact with your IT department (if you have one) to see if they can help you fix the issue. If you don’t, you’ll want to find a forum and see if others are experiencing the same issue. Check these immediately. The last thing you want to do is walk into a lecture, presentation or a meeting only to have your apps and services misfire. Do: Check Your Important Files We also recommend performing a quick, or extensive if you’ve got a full device, checkup on your most important files to make sure everything is in order. In most cases, everything will be there. However, we’ve heard horror stories about precious photos, videos or other files going missing. Take 10-15 minutes or however long you need to go through everything. If something is missing, restore from a backup, assuming you made a backup before you installed iOS 10.2.1. Do: Test New Features If you came to iOS 10.2.1 from something other than iOS 10.2, your iOS 10.2.1 update is full of new features. (If you failed to install iOS 10.2, its baked into iOS 10.2.1.) Some of the changes are small, others could have a huge impact on your daily use. We’ve put together a list of the best iOS 1o.2.1 features and tweaks. The list includes a new way to monitor your ethernet connections, improvements for “Made for iPhone” hearing aids, new emoji characters, enhancements for Apple TV, and more. Don’t: Panic If You Run Into an Issue If you run into an issue with your iOS 10.2.1 update, and many of you will, there’s no need to panic. Chances are you’ll be able to fix your issue in a matter of minutes from your home or office. Before you make an appointment at the Apple Store or curse out Apple on social media, try and fix the problem yourself. We’ve put together a list of fixes for the most common iOS 10 problems and it’s a great place to start if you’re noticing weird battery drain, issues with Wi-Fi, or problems with your Bluetooth connectivity. We’ve also released a guide that will help you improve iOS 10.2.1 performance. Issues like UI lag, lockups and freezes are common, particularly on older iPhone and iPad models. Even if you aren’t experiencing a problem, there’s a chance you might down the road. Bookmark those resources so you have a place to go if and when you do see a problem on your device. Don’t: Forget to Report iOS 10.2.1 Problems If you run into an issue with iOS 10.2.1, make sure you report it. If you notice a bug or a major issue with your iOS 10.2.1 update, don’t forget to report the problem to Apple. You can do that via its Apple Support account and you can also get in touch with customer service via its website. You’ll also want to report it on the Apple Discussion Forums. If it’s an issue related to cellular service, you’ll also want to get in touch with your service provider. Carriers like AT&T and Verizon have customer service lines and they also have iOS forums where you can report various issues. Apple encourages iOS beta testers to send in issues before an update is released and we encourage you to report issues after you install an official iOS update. If you’re lucky or the problem is widespread enough, Apple might include a remedy in an upcoming iOS update. Don’t: Forget About iOS 10.3 Remember, iOS 10.2.1 isn’t the only iOS 10 update out for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Apple is also cooking up an iOS 10.3 update and it’s expected to arrive in March in April with new features, tweaks, enhancements, and bug fixes. iOS 10.2.1 users should keep their eyes on iOS 10.3 for a few reasons: iOS 10.3 beta performance has been excellent for some users and it might be worth a shot if you’re experiencing annoying performance issues on iOS 10.2.1. The iOS 10.3 beta is free to anyone with an Apple ID. You might’ve just installed iOS 10.3 but you need to start preparing for iOS 10.3 right now. The update is bringing some big changes with it including a major file system change and you’ll want to be familiar with everything before you upgrade from iOS 10.2.1. iOS 10.2.1 could be replaced any day now and it’s important not to have tunnel vision. Monitor iOS 10.2.1 while also keeping an eye toward the future. iOS 10.3 Update: 7 Reasons to Get Excited & 3 Reasons Not To iOS 10.3 Release Date: March or Early April   1 / 10 The first thing to get excited about is that you probably won't have to wait too much longer for the official version of iOS 10.3 to arrive for your device.  If you're uninterested in trying out the iOS 10.3 beta, or if you're dealing with an maddening problem on iOS 10.2.1 or an older version of iOS, know that the iOS 10.3 release date should take place in the near future. We haven't been able to nail down an exact date but a March or April iOS 10.3 release is trending in the right direction. April is probably the worst case scenario at this point.  Nothing is confirmed but Apple is rumored to have a launch event planned for March. There, the company is reportedly planning to debut new iPad models. Rumors are also pointing to 128GB iPhone SE and a brand new red iPhone 7 option.  Apple hasn't confirmed a date but supply chain sources claim the company is planning to announce new products sometime next week. Another report points to a launch in early April alongside the debut of the company's new campus.  So how does iOS 10.3 play into this? Well, a Bloomberg says "Apple may roll out the new iPad software features as part of an upgrade to the iOS 10 operating system in the first half of 2017."  It's also worth noting that last year's March event saw the debut of a new iPad Pro, the iPhone SE, and Apple's official version of iOS 9.3. The company released the iOS 9.3 update the same day as the event.  With the iOS 10.3 beta now on its sixth iteration, a lack of changes on recent beta releases (it's probably not going to add new features to the beta, it's a refinement process at this point), and a potential event looming, we're confident that iOS 10.3 will be released sooner rather than later.  With that out of the way, let's move onto what in the iOS 10.3 beta's change log has us most excited.    1 / 10 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

By Sam Kim. Added by Agency Staff on 16 March 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Galaxy S8, Samsung, Samsung Electronics, Samsung Galaxy S8 Tweet A leaked image purporting to be the Samsung Galaxy S8 Samsung Electronics’ new Galaxy S8 will employ facial recognition technology for mobile payments within months of release, adding cutting-edge security to help the marquee device stand out from rivals such as Apple’s iPhone, people familiar with the matter said. The Galaxy S8 to be unveiled later this month will blend fingerprint, iris and facial detection to verify users accessing mobile services including Samsung Pay, the people said. It’s already working with banks to help them embrace facial recognition systems in coming months, they said, asking not to be identified talking about a private matter. Samsung declined to comment. The Korean company needs to make a splash after killing off the fire-prone Note7, which cost it more than US$6bn and the global lead in smartphones. Success for the S8 will be crucial to salvaging Samsung’s reputation, especially with de facto chief Jay Y Lee detained in a corruption scandal that’s already led to the ouster of the nation’s president. And it’ll be going up against the new iPhone due later in 2017 — the 10th anniversary of the iconic device. While previous Galaxy phones have allowed users to unlock their phones with facial recognition, the S8 would be the first to use the technology to verify financial payment applications. With mobile security taking on greater importance among consumers, the Korean company has been trying to bolster its facial detection rate over the years, the people said. Iris and facial detection capabilities complement each other: phones can rely on iris detection when there’s not enough ambient light to recognise facial features. But the smartphone unlocks faster and with more accuracy when it comes to recognising faces. It’s a technology also sought after by competitors. Apple had acquired facial recognition developers in past years, and won a patent last week for a method to detect faces using information in digital video feeds. Samsung is resorting to other features to try and differentiate its most expensive phone in a field now crowded with up-and-coming rivals, including Chinese names such as Huawei and Oppo. The S8 phone will also come with Samsung’s own voice-based Siri-like digital assistant, the people said. However, that was developed largely in-house and the first version of the software won’t borrow much from Viv Labs, they said. Samsung acquired the US-based artificial intelligence software company only in October. The Galaxy S8 is also said to come with a full-screen front, minus a physical home button. Such bezel-less displays provide more viewing real estate, though Samsung will bury a virtual home button in the lower part of glass. It will also employ more power-efficient organic light-emitting diode technology, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 35ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 28DStv mulling streaming-only option 17Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 9Grants fiasco underscores SA leadership crisis 8MTN’s Nhleko urges caution on white paper Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

By Corinne Gretler. Added by Agency Staff on 16 March 2017. Saved under News, Top Tags: Apple, Google, Nick Hayek, Swatch Tweet Swatch Group said it’s developing an alternative to the iOS and Android operating systems for smartwatches as Switzerland’s largest maker of timepieces vies with Silicon Valley for control of consumers’ wrists. The first product using the Swiss-made system will be a Tissot smartwatch to be introduced at the end of 2018, Swatch CEO Nick Hayek said in an interview on Thursday. The technology will also be usable in other small household products, he added. Switzerland’s four-century-old watch industry has been adjusting to new competition since Apple entered its territory with the Apple Watch in 2015. Lower-end brands have been the most affected, and Hayek, who first said he was sceptical about smartwatches, has been adding new electronic functions into Swatch’s own less expensive brands such as Tissot and its namesake timepieces. This month, Swatch said it developed the world’s smallest Bluetooth chip for use in watches and small objects. “There’s a possibility for wearables to develop as a consumer product, but you have to miniaturise and have an independent operating system,” Hayek said, speaking in Biel, Switzerland, at the headquarters of Omega, another of the 18 brands that Swatch produces. Swatch is willing to supply third parties with the operating system, which has been developed with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology, a university specialised in miniaturisation, Hayek said. The company has received about 100 requests for more information, with half coming from smaller Silicon Valley companies that don’t want to be dependent on Android and iOS, he added. Separately, Swatch forecast a rebound in US and European markets as it published its annual report.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 35ANC mulls plan to end DStv ‘monopoly’ 28DStv mulling streaming-only option 17Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 9Grants fiasco underscores SA leadership crisis 8MTN’s Nhleko urges caution on white paper Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

CRUNCH TIME: Millers Orchards marketing and operations manager Brendan Miller checking and packing Royal Gala apples at Hillwood. Picture: Neil Richardson. The beginning of March heralds the start of apple season in Tasmania, with producers all over the state gearing up for what they hope will be a bumper season. Millers Orchards at Hillwood is currently picking Royal Gala apples after harvesting Williams and Bosc pears in late February, marketing and operations manager Brendan Miller said. “Next week we’ll start on Golden Delicious and Packham Pears,” Mr Miller said. It's apple season! Brendan Miller from Millers Orchards talks about what they're picking now for @ExaminerOnlinepic.twitter.com/MjInUcpNh2— Johanna BakerDowdell (@JohannaBD) March 16, 2017 “The season has been up and down. We’re estimating we’ll pick about 4,000 bins this season. We average about 3,500 to 4,000 per year,” he said. Millers Orchards will keep picking apples until the first week in May, with stock sold in Launceston at Young’s Vegie Shed, throughout Tasmania in Woolworths and IGA stores and interstate at Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane wholesale markets. Other Millers Orchards fruit is destined for export to Asian markets, with Chinese consumers developing a taste for Tasmanian apples, he said. “We finish harvesting in May and pack through until the end of December, when we start picking cherries until late January or early February,” Mr Miller said. “We go all year and only stop processing for about three weeks,” he said. Millers’ most popular apples are Royal Gala and Pink Lady, but the orchard is also growing new varieties that will hit the market in the next 3-5 years. “Envy and Kanzi apples will become dominant varieties on shelves. Red Delicious and other varieties will slowly diminish as new varieties come into favour,” Mr Miller said.

An iPhone purportedly exploded in a man's hand  Credit: ViralHog  Mark Molloy 16 March 2017 • 10:49am A smartphone repair shop owner claims this is the moment an iPhone ‘exploded’ in a customer’s hand. Australian Simon Owen shared CCTV footage on social media of smoke coming out of the iPhone 6 Plus moments after the customer walked into his repair shop in Queensland. Mr Owen also shared photos of the charred Apple phone, claiming the “battery failed and exploded”. The footage shows the customer pressing his thumbs down on the iPhone, which already has a cracked screen, before smoke fills the shop. “A customer came into the store with screen damaged iPhone 6+ for repair. [They] wanted to repair a broken screen and complained of the Apple brand battery not holding charge,” a spokesperson for the store said. “We removed the customer’s Otterbox [smartphone case] and prepared to book the phone in. “Then, the customer picked up [the] phone and applied a regular amount of pressure to the screen, the same as any normal person would do every day during regular use. “The battery failed and exploded. Initial force of the explosion caused the screen to come off the phone. “Draw your own conclusions, but imagine if this happened five minutes earlier when the guy was driving to the shop...” iPhone secrets, shortcuts and hidden features you should know about Mr Owen told the Sydney Morning Herald: “It’s 100 per cent pure coincidence that it happened when he was talking to the repairer.” He added the customer bought him a crate of beer after the incident. So should Apple iPhone owners be worried? The video shows that the iPhone screen was already cracked and it’s unclear how it was actually damaged.

When it’s at the height of its powers, Apple takes complex technologies and boils them down to simple products that delight their buyers. Complexity is always in our faces, shouting, demanding more. Cutting-edge technology is fundamentally complex. Integrating a suite of technologies together into a single product adds further complexity. We’re at fault, too, as users, and people like me who write about technology for a living are even worse. We frequently mark down products that are too simple and pine for added settings, more options, and extra complexity, without recognizing how much complexity can weigh down a product, robbing it of its essence. Apple can get this wrong. Worse, it can making this infuriatingly complex while in pursuit of simplicity, which in some ways explains the debacle that is iOS device syncing in iTunes. But when it gets it right, that’s when its products shine. When is simple too simple? This winter my podcast player has been full of voices (including my own) acknowledging that AirPods are an impressive fusion of cutting-edge tech with Apple’s trademark focus on simplicity. You could argue that the AirPods are great because they are so simple. “It just works” can be a punch line when things go wrong with Apple gear, but it-just-works-itude is what most Apple products should be shooting for. And yet, I have to admit that I yearn for more. Every time I need to use my Apple Watch or my iPhone in order to adjust volume or skip forward or back in a podcast, I recall complaining in my review of the AirPods about its dead-simple control scheme: Imagine the ability to customize double-taps per earbud, so that a double-tap on your left ear can perform a different task from the right. Add in support for a triple tap. Now you’ve got a wider palette of gestures to choose from. But, at least for now, this is what we’ve got. It’s not unreasonable to wish that AirPods could do more. I’d love to be able to triple-tap to skip forward, or set the left earbud to receive volume-related taps while the right assumed control over play, pause, and skipping. But every addition to the complexity of the AirPods interface, as exciting as it might be, also erodes their simplicity. Analyst Neil Cybart posted some interface documentation for a couple of AirPod competitors the other day: I’m just going to leave this here. pic.twitter.com/3q5aV9lHrN &mdash; Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) March 11, 2017 If you are a power user of the Bragi Dash, is it awesome that you have swipe- and tap-based controls on both ears that let you control your devices in numerous ways? Absolutely. But simplicity goes by the wayside. Seeking balance Balancing power and simplicity is hard. Apple generally errs on the side of simplicity–as anyone who has tried to use an Apple product for more than its intended purpose can attest. Apple’s products are certainly capable of complexity, but in general the company will always opt to make things simpler if it can manage it. Take my favorite feature of the AirPods, which is their use of built-in proximity sensors not just to turn themselves on and off, but to allow you to pause your audio by removing one earbud from your ear–and resume play when you put the earbud back in. That’s a natural physical gesture that Apple has turned into a user-interface element. Still, maybe the AirPods are too simple. I’d certainly like another gesture or two. But by incorporating a single on-device gesture—two taps—Apple is ensuring that its users will never get frustrated by their triple-tap being interpreted as a double-tap, or vice versa. A quick brush past the ear won’t be misinterpreted as a tap. And there won’t be any confusion about which ear is supposed to get the right number of taps in order to produce the desired effect. Siri, while complex and weird in its own ways, is Apple’s compromise. But I’ve set my AirPods to play or pause with a double tap rather than invoke Siri. Not only is Siri not good enough (and forces me to speak out loud in public settings), but if I’m going to tap my ears and pause my audio and have a chat with Siri, it feels more straightforward to use my Apple Watch or even pull out my iPhone. I do expect that the next generation of AirPods, whenever they appear–my money’s on 2018–will offer more flexibility than the current models. Perhaps Apple will be able to cram even more tech into those tiny earbuds and let us twist our fingers around the stems like virtual volume knobs. Perhaps it will offer additional interface options but turn them off by default. Perhaps it will do something none of us have even predicted yet. But in the end, Apple will do what it always seems to do: Frustrate all of us control freaks who want a little more power and customizability while simultaneously delighting us with the result of its insistence on simplicity.

Staying In Tech and Gaming Samsung Galaxy X expected to be a foldable phone and tablet hybrid The company is said to have the technology ready for an official announcement Ben Travis Thursday 16 March 2017 10:27 GMT Click to follow ES Entertainment Concept: Samsung could deliver a folding phone and tablet later this year YouTube While Apple and Samsung fans are often vocal about their chosen brand of smartphone, iPhone and Galaxy handsets have always had a similar look. But Samsung could be about to totally change things up with their next handset. The tech company are said to have designed a folding smartphone that offers users a two-in-one phone and tablet device. A Samsung showcase video back in 2014 gave an indication of their aims for the concept.   Rather than working like a flip phone, the design is thought to open like a book or wallet into a wide screen. The finished device – rumoured to be titled the Samsung Galaxy X – could receive an official reveal at the IFA technology trade show in Berlin this September. 10 years of Apple's iPhone 7 show all 10 years of Apple's iPhone 1/7 Unveiled Steve Jobs with the first iPhone AFP/Getty Images 2/7 iPhone The original iPhone Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel PA 3/7 iPhone 3G Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 2 megapixel AFP/Getty Images 4/7 iPhone 4 Screen size 3.5in, rear camera 5 megapixel Getty Images 5/7 iPhone 5 Screen size 4in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 6/7 iPhone 6 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 8 megapixel Getty Images 7/7 iPhone 7 Screen size 4.7in, rear camera 12 megapixel PA Patent applications indicate that the foldable screen technology is now ready to be implemented – so we may be seeing the handset in the relatively near future.

Huawei Mate 9 review: the P10 is coming soon Nintendo Switch: better pack a powerbank for Zelda Reviews / LeEco Le 2 review: it’s a great phone but don’t buy it By Hadlee Simons on 14 March, 2017 Chinese brand LeEco has quickly made a name for itself in the smartphone world, having entered the sector in earnest back in 2015. We saw the firm reveal the first USB Type-C handsets in the form of the LeTV Le 1 range, followed by the second-generation devices, dropping headphone jacks before Apple. On paper, these smartphones seem to pack great specs into an affordable package, evoking Xiaomi in many ways. What about real-world usage though? We reviewed the once-Takealot-exclusive LeEco Le 2. AN IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER Our first review unit issued questionable adult ads in the notification tray, which seems to stem from the preinstalled file manager. We then ran an antivirus test, which categorised the file manager as malware (and classed the preinstalled UC Browser as adware). Upon mailing Takealot about the anomaly, the online retailer pulled the handset. Subsequent antivirus scans didn’t yield anything however, but local distributor Pinnacle, using a separate device, ran scans with three antivirus programs. The result? Two out of the three apps classed the file manager as a threat. The LeEco Le 2 has a rather serious notification issue that needs sorting before you buy it False positives can definitely be a thing though, so we asked for a second review unit. We eventually came across a questionable ad in the dropdown menu again. As a result, we don’t feel confident enough to recommend the LeEco Le 2 until the issue has been fully resolved. We still thought the smartphone would be worth reviewing, as the device seems to offer plenty of bang for a sub-R4000 device. You can read the saga in full over here and here. It feels like a well-built piece of kit The first thing you’ll notice about the Le 2 is just how solid the entire package feels. You’ve got a solid metal rim ringing the edges, with several antenna strips cutting through it. There’s a rear cover, complete with fingerprint scanner, that doesn’t feel 100% metal or plastic — I’m leaning towards metal. As for the front? There are decently sized bezels at the top and bottom but, otherwise, you’ve got no branding here. As for inputs and outputs, the bottom plays host to a USB Type-C port (used for audio as well) and a single speaker (there’s a second speaker grille but no actual speaker behind it), while the left side features a SIM tray and the right side features volume keys and a power button. The IR blaster occupies the top of the phone, being a sensible location of course. All in all, it spars with the Redmi Note 3 in terms of aesthetic appeal, I’d say, which is no small feat at all. Performance and software The LeEco Le 2 is probably the most powerful smartphone you can buy for under R4000, packing an octacore Snapdragon 652 chip (four A72 cores and four A53 cores) that compares very favourably to the Snapdragon 810 (although we would’ve liked microSD expansion). Throw in 3GB of RAM and you’re able to quickly multitask several apps, launch games and fire up the camera in no time flat. Gaming is a suitable test for any device, as I always say, and the Le 2 handled pretty much everything I threw at it. We were able to play Leo’s Fortune, Oceanhorn, Ridiculous Fishing, Gunman Taco Truck, Evoland and Drifting School Bus with little slowdown to be had. So those wanting to play the latest mobile sensation or emulated titles will be in good stead over here. As for the actual take on Android, you’ve got a rather garish implementation that, while not quite reaching Galaxy S4 levels, definitely gets close. For one, activating the dropdown menu and choosing the “settings” field doesn’t actually serve as a shortcut to all settings. In a rather weird bug, tapping the “settings” option transports you to the notification settings menu, and tapping the back arrow in the top left simply takes you back to the homescreen. Every time. You’ll need to visit the settings shortcut on one of the homescreens instead. This was the case for both review units that we had. The LeEco Le 2 has some fast hardware for the price, but the Android theme is straight out of 2012 in some ways LeEco’s Android skin also eschews the traditional multitasking screen in favour of a very packed menu. The bottom half of this screen is taken up with current running apps and RAM count (as you’d expect), but the top half sees LeEco place quick-toggle settings here. It looks like a very weird mishmash of Apple’s Control Centre and a typical multitasking menu on Android. It’s an interesting move, with the Control Centre-style quick toggles being a sensible addition. However, I can’t help but feel that the other quick settings (such as WiFi, Bluetooth etc) should’ve stayed in the dropdown menu. For instance, if you’re playing a game or browsing through an app, and you’d like to toggle WiFi or change a song, you can’t activate the dropdown menu and quickly do it. Nope, you’ll have to hit the multitasking menu for a much less seamless experience, kicking you out of the app. It smacks of a change for the sake of making a change, rather than a decision with the user in mind. Another software-related downside is the fact that questionable apps are installed on the device though. The past few years have seen a decline in the sheer number of useless/redundant apps on phones and, while the Le 2 adheres to this, we’ve still got a second browser, that dodgy file manager, a second app store (9Apps) and the UC News app. This is aside from the usual (and useful) suspects, such as a music and video player and preinstalled gallery app. All in all, the LeEco Le 2 definitely has the horsepower to provide a smooth experience (and indeed it provides a brisk experience), besting the Redmi Note 3 in this department too. But the company has a very long way to go until its Android skin becomes remotely desirable. What about the camera? We’ve already published a few sample photos with the Le 2, coming away rather impressed. The 16MP f/2.0 main camera isn’t going to spar with flagship phones obviously, but it’s definitely not too shabby when pitted against the Note 3. Daytime snaps see the colours strike a great balance between saturation and accuracy, although I would’ve liked more dynamic range in general. The HDR mode definitely helps here (check the indoor shots, looking outside), but it’s not perfect and ghosting is noticeable. At least the ghosting isn’t as pronounced as Meizu’s offerings. Most snaps pack enough resolvable detail for some cropping too, so Instagram lovers will be happy. But the biggest weakness might be the unreliable autofocus for macro shots. I’m not sure if it’s due to the focal length or just the autofocus in general, but multiple shots were a must in these situations, I found. Night time shots exceeded my expectations, as mid-range handsets tend to make their cut-price trappings known in this department. That’s not to say the Le 2 dukes it out with the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7, as shots are definitely noisier and less detailed, but you can still produce some satisfying results. The LeEco Le 2 offers a great photography experience, but there are better phones for video Nevertheless, the Le 2’s main camera punches above its weight for stills, despite the autofocus niggles at times. In the selfie department, the 8MP front-facing shooter does a great job during the day, producing relatively sharp results and being quick to focus. Bar/low light settings are disappointing however, as the phone captures enough light but leaves things a splotchy mess. This is presumably where corners were cut. As for video recording? The phone supports 4K recording and 120fps video at 720p, but general results leave a lot to be desired. Colours are pleasantly saturated, but otherwise, the videos look heavily compressed and noisy. It’s as if I’m using a phone from 2011. Even 4K video doesn’t pass muster here, with our clips often looking like Vaseline was smeared on the lens. It doesn’t help that there’s no optical image stabilisation (OIS) to keep things less juddery. In other words, the camera department reveals an experience of two halves, with stills being a big plus and video recording being a huge disappointment. Living without a headphone jack LeEco made a huge song and dance last year when it ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack, claiming that USB Type-C offered better audio. So what’s it like to live with USB Type-C only? Fortunately, the company includes a 3.5mm adapter in the box, so you can still use your existing peripherals. And music playback sounded as good as any other smartphone on the market. We switched to LeEco’s dedicated Type-C headphones though, and were very impressed with its noise-cancellation tech. But this wasn’t a LeEco-exclusive thing though, as the noise cancellation and quality seemed just as good on the Huawei P9. So chalk the great sound quality up to the headphones rather than the Le 2 itself. Battery life? The LeEco Le 2 packs a relatively decent 3000mAh battery, which is about par for the course on mid-range handsets nowadays. I was able to check social media feeds, listen to tracks off Google Play Music, watch a couple of YouTube videos and download/play several games and still have more than enough juice for the evening. But I didn’t feel confident that it would last until midday the next day though. As for video playback, we did the usual (installed MX Player and played a 20 second 1080p/60fps clip on loop), keeping WiFi and mobile data on and cranking the brightness up to 100%. The result was middling, with the test kicking off at 11.36am and finishing at 4.18pm. In other words, this was under five hours, way below the average time we usually get. Battery life isn’t the Le 2’s strength then, so don’t expect two days without significantly gimping the smartphone’s functions.

But it packs a quality main camera for the price, a premium design and some powerful internals. Just don’t buy it until they fix the dodgy notification issue. Verdict: LeEco’s latest handset got into a scrap against the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3, survived the match-up and lost on points. Then it turned out that it was using performance-enhancing drugs. Score: 7 out of 10 Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings almost seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

However, the headphone socket has controversially been removed from the bottom of the device, meaning you may have to rethink your headphone choices.

Read More iPhone 7 review: More evolution than revolution Price Have your say on this storyComment Below iPhones certainly don't come cheap, with a UK starting price of £599 for the lowest price iPhone 7 32GB option. The 128GB version costs £699 and the 256GB version will set you back a whopping £799, if you're buying a handset (sans contract) from the official Apple store. The larger iPhone 7 Plus is even more of a wallet buster than it's smaller sibling, costing £719 for the cheapest model (32GB), followed by £819 for the 128GB variant and an astonishing £919 for the biggest (256GB) version. But you certainly get a lot for your money and there's plenty of ways to save if you're looking to invest.

How do you feel about the lack of headphone jack in the new iPhone 7? The smaller iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch Retina HD display, while its larger sibling has a 5.5-inch display. The bodies of the phones are made from aluminium and come in five colours - silver, gold, rose gold, black, (which has a matte appearance), and "jet black", (which has a high-gloss look). Pick from jet black, black, silver, gold and rose gold The new jet black finish will be offered exclusively on the 128GB and 256GB models.

Does this signal the end of the beloved headphone? (Photo: REUTERS) Apple has also launched a pair of wireless headphones, called AirPods, which are available to buy for an additional £159. Wires will soon be a thing of the past (Photo: Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) These can connect to both the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 with just a tap, according to Apple, and switch "seamlessly" between entertainment and calls. In place of the old headphone jack, Apple has added a second speaker, so sound is two times louder than iPhone 6s, and you will be able to listen to your music in stereo with increased dynamic range. Specs The iPhone 7 comes with a new A10 chip, which is extremely efficient, meaning the iPhone 7 can run up to three times faster than the iPhone 6 at as little as half the power. This means that the iPhone 7's battery lasts up to 2 hours longer than iPhone 6s, according to Apple, and the iPhon 7 Plus' battery lasts up to 1 hour longer than iPhone 6s Plus.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Tech & Gadgets Samsung Could Be Supplying iPhone’s A12 Chips in 2018 By Michael Jay Toledo on March 16, 2017 08:11 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Engadget | Despite the fierce competition between Apple and Samsung’s products, it seems like consumers will be seeing these two giant companies working with each other next year. Rumors stated that the latter was making “supplemental investments” into their 10-nanometer production lines in April. According to AppleInsider report, Samsung is planning to add more investments to their nanometer production lines. Aside from that, they are also going to build seven nanometer facilities in 2018. The publication then noted that this is an attempt by the South Korean company to edge Apple’s current A-series supplier, TSMC. It is a known fact that TSMC is the exclusive partner of Apple in terms of A-series manufacturing. Their partnership started with the iPhone 6, and there is no doubt the two will continue the bond. However, it can also be recalled that Apple had to split the production of iPhone 6s with Samsung probably because of the higher demands. Therefore, the possibility of Apple and Samsung working together again is still open. CultOfMac Apple and Samsung Partnership: Is It Happening? Sadly, it seems like the partnership is unlikely to happen and there are several reasons why. For starters, the two are competitors in every possible tech product. From phones and tablets to wearables and laptops, these products clearly indicate that Apple and Samsung are really going at it. Clearly, this should be reason enough why the former would prefer not to work with the latter again. Another strong proof that the partnership would not happen is the problem with iPhone 6’s production. According to the same report of AppleInsider, Samsung’s work on the handset caused Apple problems. The version of the A9 processor the former provided was said to have a less battery life. Also, it produced more heat than the ones manufactured by TSMC. Obviously, Apple would not want to experience the same problem in the future, which is why them pairing up with Samsung is very unlikely. Plus, reports stated that TSMC is also planning to enter mass production of their 7-nanometer chips. Should that be the case, then that would definitely rules out the idea of an Apple and Samsung partnership. How about you? Do you think it would be possible for Samsung to manufacture A12 chips for Apple in 2018? Or will these reports remain as speculations? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

By Sabah Karimi | March 16, 2017 ©Chromecast, Apple TV, Amazon Fire You can save time comparing streaming services from Apple, Amazon, Google and others by using side-by-side comparisons to help you decide which device or provider is best for your budget and show variety preferences. Whether you want to replace your cable to save money or to make it easier to get the Netflix movies and TV shows you want on demand — or both — you’ll have to weigh some pros and cons to find the right streaming option for you. Take a look at some of the top streaming services and devices available and decide which one you want to replace or cut down on cable. Best Streaming Devices Streaming Device Price Features Smartphone/Tablet Control Internal Storage (GB) Chromecast $35.00 Access to 200,000+ shows; stream Android phone or tablet screen to TV; 108 hp resolution; supports all wireless networks Yes None Roku $79.99 Access to 350,000+ movies and TV shows; use mobile device as a remote control; HD and 4K picture quality Yes None Tivo Bolt $199.99 TiVo service — $14.99/month; delivers all channels in cable subscription; 4K TV compatible No 500 GB Apple TV $199.99 1600+ video apps to watch TV shows, movies, and news; interactive TV app for recommendations and mobile device connection Yes 32GB or 64GB Amazon Fire Stick $39.99 Access to 7,000+ apps, games, Netflix, Hulu, and more; hands-free commands with Alexa voice remote; quad-core processor with 1GB memory No 8GB Easiest to Use: Apple TV vs. Amazon Fire Stick The Amazon Fire TV Stick, priced at $39.99, provides hands-free commands with the Alexa voice remote. Apple TV works with your iPhone, iPad or tablet computer — and also includes a handheld remote control. Both devices require minimal setup, and you don’t need a cable box or satellite dish. If you’re interested in downloading Kodi — a free, open-source software media center designed to play videos, music and games — it works with the Amazon Fire Stick, and online tutorials are available to show you how to set it up. Related: How to Save Money on iPod and Apple Products Most Smartphone-Friendly: Roku vs. Chromecast The best media streamer will enable you to use your iPhone or Android phone as a remote control, and Roku and Google Chromecast both fit the bill. Roku gives you the added benefit of HD and 4K picture quality, and Chromecast provides 1080hp resolution for your high-quality viewing. Both support all wireless networks and quickly connect to your mobile device via Bluetooth or WiFi. In addition, Chromecast can stream on your Google Chromebook as well as your Apple and Android devices. 4K Picture Quality: TiVo Bolt vs. Roku If you haven’t splurged for a 4K TV, also known as Ultra HD, consider a streaming device that serves as an external source to provide higher resolution. With four times as many pixels as 1080hp-resolution TVs, you can’t watch 4K TV shows and movies without 4K technology. Both TiVo Bolt and Roku deliver 4K picture quality. If you choose TiVo, you will need to subscribe to the service to make use of its features, but it’s still one of the best streaming TV service options available. Google Chromecast Ultra also streams in 4K Ultra HD and HDR. Best Price: Amazon Fire Stick vs. Chromecast The most affordable options for the best streaming stick or media streamer are Google Chromecast, priced at $35, and Amazon Fire Stick, which costs $39.99. Both cost less than half the price of Roku at $79.99. If you go with Chromecast, however, you won’t have any internal storage, but you will have access to more than 200,000 shows. The Amazon Fire Stick comes with 8 GB of storage and gives you access to more than 7,000 apps, plus games and movie rental services like Netflix and Hulu. If you’re a Roku fan, consider the Roku Streaming Stick, which is a portable version of the Roku priced at $49.99. Don’t Miss: Best Shows About Money on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Access to Shows and Channels: Amazon Fire Stick vs. Roku If you have Amazon Prime or want its unlimited access to thousands of TV shows and movies, you will want to consider getting the Amazon Fire Stick. With a Prime membership, you can also add more than 90 premium and specialty channels — including HBO and Showtime — for less than $20 a month. Roku doesn’t offer Amazon Prime member benefits, but it does provide users with access to a selection of free services as well as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video and Google Play rentals. It also supports on-demand programming from ESPN and dozens of other channels. See: What $1,000 Invested in Netflix and Apple 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today The Bottom Line If you want to replace cable with a low-cost streaming device, Amazon Fire Stick or Google Chromecast are your best bets. Both devices cost less than $40 and offer high-quality streaming. Look into the Roku Ultra if you want to splurge and get extra features. The Amazon Fire Stick has the added benefit of hands-free commands with Alexa and gives you access to thousands of apps, and if you’re an Amazon Prime member, you’ll have access to a range of shows and movies. Google Chromecast gives you access to apps and works with Google Chromebook and Apple and Android devices. Although it’s priced higher than other streaming devices, TiVo Bolt — the only streaming device that enables you to record shows — gives you 150 hours of HD recording and the ability to record four of your favorite shows at once. You can upgrade to TiVoBolt+ and get 450 recording hours and the ability to record six shows at once. If you’re a diehard Apple fan, Apple TV is compatible with the iPhone and tablet and will give you the simple user interface you’re familiar with from your other Apple devices. x Open a New Bank Account Check Out the Next Article How to Get Out of a Lease Find out how to legally break a lease without upsetting your landlord.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The iPhone 8 Will feature Curved OLEDs Manufactured By Samsung, Claims Nikkei By Ramish Zafar Mar 15, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 8 is a regular feature of the rumor mill. Sources expect that Apple will launch a special device this year, to commemorate the lineup’s tenth anniversary. A lot of new features will make it on the iPhone 8 and mark the first serious attempt by Apple to overhaul the iconic flagship lineup. Even if it means borrowing a leaf from its top competitor, Samsung. Today, we’ve got more information on the device’s alleged OLED display. Take a look below to find out more. The Apple iPhone 8 Will Feature Curved OLED Displays Manufactured Solely By Samsung Globalization is a double-edged sword. At one end, we’re able to communicate with folks at opposite ends of the world in the blink of an eye. Manufacturers too are able to ably utilize different materials and services from different countries. At the other end, leaks and rumors are a common feature, leaving little room for curiosity before product launches in the tech world. Today, we’ve got some more information straight out of China. It’s about the iPhone 8 and confirms a critical upgrade for the device. Related [U: With Second Leak] Official, Leaked Poster For Galaxy S8 And Galaxy S8+ Confirms Button Free Front Facade For Pair Sources have previously speculated that Apple will equip the iPhone 8 with OLED displays. It’ll mark a big win for Apple fans, as the company hasn’t adopted the technology yet. OLEDs provide sharper displays and improve overall device performance. Samsung is undoubtedly king in this area, with the company’s Galaxy S lineup using curved OLEDs efficiently for quite a while. Now, Apple’s got similar plans for the iPhone 8, according to today’s source. Advertisement Related The Samsung Galaxy S8 & Galaxy S8+ Will Feature 6GB RAM – In China “The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. . .[and will] allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker. [however] it will not offer significant new functions”, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. In short, for Apple, curved OLED screens on the iPhone 8 will only serve a design function. Samsung’s displays, on the other hand, allow for quick access of certain device functions, without having to use the main screen. The iPhone 8 will also feature upgraded design materials, which include glass and ceramics. These will facilitate wireless charging on the device, which is another feature that’s already present in the Android world. Apple, as Nikkei also suggests, is currently prototyping the iPhone 8. Given that a good six months are left until the device’s launch, Cupertino looks to be trying extra hard for that perfect combination of design, specifications, and features. Thoughts?

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile ‘Will Shift iPhone Production To US If Apple Bears All Costs’ – Pegatron CEO On Shifting iPhone Production To US By Ramish Zafar Mar 15, 2017 19Shares Share Tweet Submit Donal Trump’s announcements to move Apple’s production back to the US muffled a lot of feathers. Such a move is likely to cost Cupertino quite a bit, with the end impact being passed down to the everyday consumer. The iPhone isn’t cheap at the time being and adding extra costs to the mix will affect Apple’s market presence significantly. In response, Cupertino has been looking at the possibilities of such a move. Now, we’ve got more on the matter. Take a look below for more details. Pegatron Is Ready To Move Manufacturing To The US If Apple Bears All Additional Costs Apple’s got key manufacturing partners in the East which form the backbone of Tim Cook’s operational genius. Foxconn, Pegatron and a few others help deliver and manufacture the essential components that go into your shiny iPhone. With President Trump’s intention to move production back to the US, all of this faces the very real risk of being completely upended. Today, Pegatron’s CEO, Liao Shy-jang has commented on the shifting of operations to the US. Related The App Store Now Has A Permanent Indie Games Section Apple has already asked its suppliers and partners to list the cost and benefits of shifting production to the US. These have not yielded any positive results. It’s speculated that moving production to the US is likely to double overall costs for Apple. At the moment, moving iPhone production to the US is impossible. Apple CEO Tim Cook has already shared some facts, with the major hindrance being a lack of vocational talent in the country. Advertisement Related Google’s Motion Stills App Allows You To Customize Default Frame Of Live Photos “As long as there is demand, whether the clients are American or Chinese, Pegatron already has its production lines in place,” Liao said. “If Trump institutes his Made in America proposal, it will be fine for Pegatron as long the client is willing to absorb the costs.” – Pegatron CEO, Liao Shy-jiang. Mr. Liao was answering questions at an investor conference for Pegatron. His statements do not come as a surprise as any Apple partner will happily move to the US if no additional costs are involved. Right now, the Apple world is focused on its upcoming event for the iPads and the iPhone 8, which is due later this year. The latest speculation on the rumor mill paints a rather disappointing picture for the iPad Air 2. The device will only mark an incremental upgrade over its predecessor and will not stimulate strong market interest as a result. Thoughts?

Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Now, seven months later, Russia’s FAS has found Apple guilty of price-fixing the retail price of iPhones in the country. Per the Financial Times, Apple told upwards of 16 resellers that they couldn’t sell various iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models below a certain price. To this point, the FAS’ investigation found that all Apple resellers just so happened to initiate the same pricing structure across multiple iPhone models at launch. A translated FAS statement on the matter reads in part: The investigation revealed that from the start of official sales in Russia Apple iPhone 5s models, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus the majority of resellers have installed on them the same prices that are recommended of “Apple Rus”, and supported them for about 3 months. The FAS further claims that resellers not willing to cooperate with Apple’s iPhone pricing matrix risked losing their partnership with the Cupertino-based company. Notably, the investigation found no evidence of price fixing with respect to the iPhone 7. Apple hasn’t yet issued a statement on the ruling but the company reportedly has three months to file a formal defense on the matter. If Apple’s appeal falls flat, the company may be subject to fines equal to 15% of iPhone sales in the country. As a final point, it’s worth noting that Apple cooperated with the FAS investigation and has reportedly enacted new guidelines to prevent the alleged price fixing behavior from happening again in the future.

The company’s commitment to the education sector was there from the very beginning. Steve Jobs told the Smithsonian that he wanted to donate a computer to every school in the U.S. as long ago as 1979. I thought if there was just one computer in every school, some of the kids would find it. It will change their life. We saw the rate at which this was happening and the rate at which the school bureaucracies were deciding to buy a computer for the school and it was real slow. We realized that a whole generation of kids was going to go through the school before they even got their first computer so we thought the kids can’t wait. We wanted to donate a computer to every school in America. The company couldn’t afford it in those days, but Steve lobbied Congress to introduce a bill that would have created sufficient tax breaks to make it possible. That attempt failed, but Apple did succeed in brokering a tax deal in California that saw the company donate an Apple IIe to every school in California. Apple led the PC market in education for a time, and even created education-specific Mac models. More recently, Apple appeared set to bring its educational success into the iPad era in 2013 when it announced a $30M deal (that would eventually have been worth a quarter of a billion dollars) to equip every student in the LA Unified School District with an iPad. If that program had succeeded, it would have created a template for rolling out similar ones across the whole of the USA. Instead, it failed catastrophically, and it now appears that Chromebooks are winning where iPads have failed … Anker braided Lightning cables CNBC reported last month that Chromebooks now make up more than half of all devices in U.S. classrooms, while Apple’s share of classroom purchases more than halved between 2012 and 2015. Why is that, and what – if anything – can Apple do to reverse the trend? Below are the eight reasons I think Chromebooks are currently winning the battle, and in italics the steps I think Apple needs to take to address each … 1. The LAUSD disaster There’s no other word to use to describe what happened to the LA deal. Well, there is, but the first part of that word is ‘cluster’ and the second part isn’t suitable for a family-friendly site. For those who don’t recall the details, here’s a summary I prepared earlier: The first sign of trouble emerged when students managed to bypass the restrictions designed to ensure the devices could be used only for school work, but that was only the start. The LAUSD was accused of having miscalculated the cost of the program, resulting in its suspension and later abandonment. Both the FBI  and the SEC were called in to investigate allegations of corruption, and a federal review concluded that the entire project had been doomed from the start. Apple paid back the $4.2M it had received to date. You’d have to be a pretty brave administrator to announce that, despite all that, you wanted to invest in the same deal. Apple seems to have mostly kept its head down, with little sign of any public comment. I think this is the wrong approach. Apple needs to present a clear analysis of exactly what went wrong, how it happened, what parts were and weren’t Apple’s fault – and the steps it has taken to ensure the same thing can’t happen again. Only with that approach will school districts elsewhere regain confidence in investing in iPads. 2. Cost iPads are relatively expensive devices. You might think schools would be offered deep discounts for purchasing in bulk, but instead they reportedly paid an additional $200 per device for the software and support package. Chromebooks, in contrast, are cheap. One of the models offered to schools is the CTL J2, priced at $199, while Toshiba’s Chromebook 2 runs to $249.99, with a $30 management fee covering teacher-approved apps and books. Other models start from just $149. Apple operates on the highest profit margins in the business on all its major products, and is of course perfectly entitled to do so: nobody is forcing anyone to buy Apple devices. But you’d have thought that a company that once gave products to schools free of charge when it was very much smaller might at least offer a deal at close to cost now that it can comfortably afford to do so. Shareholders might object, but Tim Cook has stated on more than one occasion that Apple does what’s right, and any investor not happy with that should get out of the stock. I’d also argue that it doesn’t exactly hurt the company’s long-term prospects to introduce entire new generations of people to the Apple ecosystem from an early age. 3. Multi-user support While one device per student is obviously the ideal, that’s an expensive approach no matter what the device. Many schools need to share devices between students, and that requires support for multiple users. iPads have so far been single-user devices. Chromebooks have always been cloud-based and account-based, and thus intrinsically suited to multi-user setups. Every time someone logs into a Chromebook, it becomes their device. Apple is finally addressing this soon in iOS 9.3, but really it should have happened a long time ago. 4. Control Both iPads and Chromebooks are very nearly immune to viruses, so equally appealing in that respect, but Chromebooks offer schools greater levels of control. With Chromebooks, student accounts are linked to the individual school, and the school gets full administrative control of what those accounts can and can’t do. iPads offer profiles that provide some degree of control (when kids don’t figure out how to bypass them), but this is an area where Apple needs to up its game. Again, the changes seen in iOS 9.3 suggest that Apple is aware of this. 5. Apps For the LAUSD program, Apple did a deal with Pearson to provide educational software and electronic textbooks pre-installed on the iPads. It’s unclear exactly what went wrong here, but teachers complained that the apps were unreliable and not fit for purpose. Chromebooks, in contrast, come supplied with teacher-approved apps in addition to ad-free versions of the standard Google Apps suite and access to school-specific shared Google Drives, Calendars and documents. Google also provides a dedicated Classroom app designed to help teachers organize classes and communicate with students. Whatever the root cause of the issues with the education apps, this is clearly something that Apple urgently needs to fix. See point 6. 6. Sales process Google appears to have made it extremely easy for schools to purchase and setup Chromebooks for use in schools. Apple has a reputation for being great at selling direct to consumers, not so great at dealing with IT departments. It strikes me that Apple’s IBM partnership could be the perfect vehicle for educational sales. IBM knows exactly how to sell to IT departments, and it also knows how to create bespoke apps for specific industries. Harnessing this expertise could solve problems five and six in a single stroke. 7. Hardware keyboards We may be moving toward a world where keyboards are less important, and voice input comes more to the fore, but we’re not there yet. Even if we were, a school classroom is not a suitable environment for 30+ kids to all be dictating to their devices. Software keyboards are fine for brief notes, but not for things like writing essays. So physical keyboards are needed, and Chromebooks have them as standard. The iPad Pro aside, Apple doesn’t have its own keyboard for iPads (something I’ve always felt was a huge missed opportunity), meaning that third-party ones have to be bought at extra cost – and separately negotiated. At the very least, Apple needs to bundle keyboards with education iPads. 8. iPads ‘walk’ The final problem with iPads is one Apple should be pleased to have: kids love them. One of the problems experienced in the LAUSD program was that a number of them mysteriously disappeared. Apple obviously shouldn’t do anything to make its hardware less desirable, but it does need to address point four to ensure that a stolen iPad is a useless iPad when it comes to using it away from school premises. Do you think Apple needs to prioritize the education market, even if it makes little direct profit doing so? Or should it cede the market to Chromebooks and focus on the more profitable consumer and business markets? Take our poll, and share your thoughts in the comments.

Tom Charvat - 1 year ago Reply All smart companies attract the youth, that will eventually turn into life long customers…i.e. McDonald’s Happy Meals. All smart companies attract the elderly because they influence the youth. Apple needs to develop, specific “simplified cost effective versions” of iPads and iPhones, for youth and elderly. These groups do not need all the bells and whistles that current products offer. That is a market nobody seems to care about… “former marketing Art Director”. yojimbo007 - 1 year ago Reply Yes!!! No matter what .. APPLE has to regain its top position in the education market. (Cloud education tools is a fantastic direction.) Lack of doing so will have devistating effects down the line. Kids mindshare is uber important…. Lose the kids , lose the future! Between chrome at schools and windows a the preferred serious gaming platform…Apple is losing a huge portion of kids mindshare ! Noticed confernaces and starbuks , halls and rooms packed with macbooks and apple logos? These are the effects of the Mac vs Pc marketing with the cool kid as the front for apple …….. And apples dominance in schools.. People effected through those campaigns are the people in those halls and rooms. Lose that focus Apple…and those Halls and rooms will be filled with logos other than Apple ! Michael Harwell - 1 year ago Keep in mind that Apple never had much of an education presence and their product lines are selling quite well in comparison to the other manufacturers. For instance many 8 year olds playing with a Dell computers in class 10 years ago are likely carrying around iPhones now. sulfen - 1 year ago Reply The elderly has had a major influence in the past but it’s just not true for technology. The biggest, and possibly even the only, influence comes from kids not the elderly. avalonharmon - 1 year ago Reply Having a ipad air with a smart keyboard and apple pencil support at a education discount would be a instant buy for a lot schools and boost sales of the ipad rapidly. Steve Grenier - 1 year ago Reply Agreed. While this could potentially dramatically reverse the declining iPad sales, it wouldn’t directly lead to increased profits if Apple is offering them with a substantial discount. Having said that, I think they should. Education is important and Apple is missing a big opportunity to “do the right thing” by letting it slip through and focus on profits. Apple makes plenty of profits already, and I say that as an investor. chrisl84 - 1 year ago Reply Let chromebooks be classroom tools, kids dont want to own their school supplies. Being a classroom tool has “loser” stigma associated to it anyways. Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago Reply If you really wanna study, you don’t need any tools. And that’s the case in India griffinjar - 1 year ago Really? Build a School in the Cloud Ilko Sarafski - 1 year ago Reply Huge mistake for Apple on that one. Of course they had to give at minimum profit (or no profit at all) its products, no matter iPads or macs. Imagine several millions soon-to-be-workers having the free opportunity to get, study, play or whatever other activity they can do. In just 3 to 5 years they would’ve sold x3 devices and services to these same several millions. The potential is lost. Or they lose it slowly. shareef777 - 1 year ago Reply It’s only because of cost. 1.) Has nothing to do with Apple. You can have the same issue with any other device/software you buy. 3.) Most schools just give students a shared login anyway to get on the devices. There’s a unique login to use on a website to track progress at home. 4.) Profiles can greatly limit an iPad (if configured correctly). If a school administrator can’t figure it out, doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. 5.) Apps. That’s laughable. Chromebook’s are literally nothing more then browsers. Open Safari (or even Chrome) on an iPad and you’ve got yourself a Chromebook. 6.) This ties back to cost. It’s easy to buy as many iPads as you want via VARs (like CDW). You can order a thousand and have it overnighted. The problem is that they’re difficult to get decent pricing. Someone ordering a thousand iPads would expect to get some discount, especially if they agree to buy more or agree to a plan to swap them out for newer models every couple years. 7.) You can use any keyboard you want with an iPad. 8.) Well lets just stop getting nice things into any schools, people tend to want to steal them!? paulywalnuts23 - 1 year ago Reply I have to agree with you on most of these. I work in education and 90% of the reason that most schools go with CB’s is cost. The other 10% has to do with the ease in which you can lock them down. Like you said it is basically just a web browser so all you have to do is use the school content filler to lock down anything you don’t want them to see or use. Most schools don’t have the vision to think about the overall product and all of the things that teachers and students could possibly want to do with them. 90% of what schools use CB’s for is paper writing nothing else. The vision just isn’t their yet, for most schools. Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Rather a depressing insight. Derek Konofalski (@DerekKonofalski) - 1 year ago That doesn’t always work, though. In my city, the school had locked down all the Chromebooks in exactly that manner by using the online content filter. Parents then complained and tried to sue the schools because kids could access a few inappropriate sites on those computers if they “rented” them and took them home. Matthew Ulasien - 1 year ago Reply Apple would be very foolish to ignore the educational market. Kids who grow up with Apple products now will be the same ones wanting to continue purchasing and using those Apple products when they become adults. Same with Google and Microsoft. Ignoring the educational base now essentially ensures that your future customers are growing up with your competition. It’s a long term investment. shareef777 - 1 year ago Reply Not counting the original Apple IIs that I played around with in elementary school my first computer was a Sony VAIO I got going into high school (parents didn’t want to spend the premium Macs commandeered during those years, late 90s). My first actual interaction with a Mac was an eMac my first year of college. 15minutes was all it took. Bought a new 12″ PowerBook G4 and have got sucked into that eco-system since. RP - 1 year ago Reply Google Apps is fantastic. And as anyone in education knows, getting iPod and iPads set up year after year is not a fun or easy thing. The new iOS 9.3 update goes a long way to solving that. I say use the best solution whatever the platform, and right now Google Apps is the best solution for a lot of reasons. Google has been working on that for years and it works fine. Icloud is getting beter and iOS 9.3 is getting there for education, but Google has been up and running fine for a while now. Shameer Mulji (@shameermulji) - 1 year ago Reply Overall great article. As far as cost goes, no way Apple prices iPad close to Chromebook levels. From my understanding, Chromebooks are winning, first and foremost, due to ease of management and great collaboration within Google Docs. iOS 9.3 addresses the former, and hopefully Apple executes well on this. To address the Google Docs situation, the rumored March event would be a great time to introduce a serious upgrade to iWork to vastly improve its collaboration capabilities. rnc - 1 year ago Reply iWork already does everything that GDocs does, including collab, but better. Matt Marino (@Matt_Marino) - 1 year ago Reply As an English teacher who uses his own iPad for notes and lessons (for display purposes only), I really do hope that Apple gets its act together and comes up with a substantive education program. Last year, I went to a Digital Educator’s Conference, and while most teachers brought their personal MacBooks, they all were using Google and Microsoft services. I have seen schools that use iPad at the primary, elementary, and secondary levels, with moderate success, but most (if not all) of them use Google services (Docs/Drive, etc.) due to Google’s collaboration tools. Our school (a high school) uses Lenovo Yoga ThinkPads with Office 365 subscriptions, and while Microsoft still needs to make their products more education-focused, I have found the OneDrive/Office ecosystem to be quite user-friendly when it comes to student submission and teacher grading of work. Via OneDrive and Office, I can read and grade essays and assignments on my iPad with no problem at all. (The same held true for Google Drive when we used that, too.) As much as the problem is hardware affordability, it’s also about a lack of platform/software that rivals Google’s and Microsoft’s offerings. Apple should build out iCloud Drive and turn it into a legitimate competitor to Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive/OneDrive for Business. I also agree that Apple should bundle keyboards and Pencils with every iPad purchased for education. Most of my students either handwrite or type their notes into OneNote notebooks, which (thanks to OneNote shared notebooks) I as a teacher can check to make sure they’re getting the information they need. The fact that the iPad Pro is the only iPad with an Apple-produced keyboard and stylus is mindboggling; the iPad Air (and even older iPads) is the perfect size for notes and readings, despite what Apple might lead us to believe. Sure, the iPad Pro makes app multitasking a breeze, but students can do that with the iPad Air 2 and – when it’s realized – version 3. They don’t need the huge screen size; all they need are keyboards and a stylus. Similar to Microsoft and its Surface, Apple should bundle the keyboard and Pencil with every educational iPad and offer a reasonable cost for the package. Again, I love using Apple products, but I agree – time to step up its involvement in education. Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Reply Many thanks for sharing your experience in such detail, Matt – it’s always great to get an inside perspective. Matt Marino (@Matt_Marino) - 1 year ago No problem! If ever there was the need out there for a tech EDU blogger, I’d have plenty of experiences to share with folks. :-) Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago And thankyou Lovebenjoy for being so humble and accepting :D Shameer Mulji (@shameermulji) - 1 year ago Reply “Sure, the iPad Pro makes app multitasking a breeze, but students can do that with the iPad Air 2 and – when it’s realized – version 3.” That’s a great point that you bring up and it would be smart if Apple brought Pencil support to the iPad Air 3 Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago Maybe, they are too embarrassed to do it now, since pencil is campared to a stylus and that’s the reason Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago Reply It really is true on the insight u’ve revealed. Apple recently and mostly on the Mac is more focused on hardware than anything else even their own ecosystem like iWork. On MS Word I can easily use scientific formulas like Sin ‘theta’, power, lambda etc but with Pages it’s not possible even after hours of Google research.. u’ve to buy a third party app, decades old outside the MacApp store after some jailbreaking like work Jake Becker - 1 year ago Lack of dedication to iWork is probably my #1 sore spot with Apple. :( Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago Similar is the case of mine particularly when u’ve to convince u’r elders PhilBoogie - 1 year ago You’ve been Googling for the Greek alphabet support in Pages and never once thought about adding the Greek keyboard to iOS or OSX? Avieshek (@avieshek) - 1 year ago Yes there’s a keyboard in iOS as well as calculator o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago Reply Anyone intelligent knows the ideal future school has iPads and an apple pencil for every student. Is this possible now? Of course not, it’s far too expensive. The fact remains though, that ideally you have a single iPad and that iPad has all of the textbooks digitally on it, it is locked to only being able to use those textbooks and certain specific other actions, when the teacher wants them available. The Apple pencil will be pivotal for everything done, test taking to art class. And there will no longer be any carrying around of homework, books, backpacks, highlighters, pencils, pens, etc.. Everything will seamlessly go to a student’s Apple ID which could be a new special education Apple ID and be available at home where they have access to virtually everything they did at school. The possibilities are great. It is the future. paulywalnuts23 - 1 year ago Reply I have to disagree with you on one thing. Completely locking down a device is not the answer. Teaching digital citizenship and responsibility is. Work with the student and make them feel a part of something. Don’t alienate them and make them feel like they are the enemy. o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago Kids aren’t responsible, the iPad is a tool until the teacher lets it be a toy. The respect is that it is a tool in the classroom and a toy out of the classroom. Jake Becker - 1 year ago 100% correct, but people tend to not fully grasp the effect to which kids are not considered human beings here. o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago No, the kids are seen as human beings, hence why it’s understood that they can’t be allowed full access to the iPad. Then you’d have a bunch of kids on things they shouldn’t be on, and it would be a cascade of distraction for everyone. The respect is in knowing that these are kids and they are irresponsible and many aren’t interested in the school work. The key is to make the school work interesting enough to pull them into it and thus they’ll actually be interested enough to grasp some of the information you’re trying to imbed in their brains. As a general rule of thumb people are too incompetent to know how to educate and teachers are mostly horrible at their jobs, that’s just a hard truth. I commend teachers on putting up with kids though. Matt Marino (@Matt_Marino) - 1 year ago I take offense to the comment about teachers being “mostly horrible at (our) jobs.” Are there teachers out there who probably shouldn’t be teaching? Absolutely. However, I’ve been teaching high school English for close to 12 years in private schools, and I do not consider myself “horrible at (my) job.” I’ve educated many students on how to analyze literature and how to compose strong essays, and I’ve used technology to enhance their learning, too – but without letting it overtake the learning itself. I’ve got the results to back up my claims, but it shouldn’t have to come to that. Back to our regularly-scheduled programming. o0smoothies0o - 1 year ago @Matt Sorry to offend, you’re probably great, but I think there should be a major changed to the curriculum and the entire approach to teaching. I’d love to see studies on how much information is retained by students. Sure, tests are taken and that tells you how well students are doing at memorizing things, but most of that information is quickly forgotten due to disinterest, and so much time is wasted on teaching things that will be forgotten by most, shortly thereafter.

We’ve chosen to live in a society which values low, taxes, substandard service and mediocrity. School Boards are increasingly mandated to not spend ANY money.

Education: little devils 😈 The Amazing Iceman (@amazingiceman) - 1 year ago Reply Apple wins by helping the Education Sector, but needs to act quickly: 1) If played correctly, Apple may be able to get a tax break by helping education. 2) The end result: Kids will ask their parents for “nothing less than an iPad, because that’s what they use at school”. t1mber - 1 year ago Reply For the most part, I completely agree with this article. I do IT for a K-8 district that uses both Chromebooks and iPads in a shared (non-1to1) fashion. We use the JSS Casper Suite to manage the iPads, but have to do a LOT of extra work-arounds (creating a bunch of institutional Apple IDs, etc) just to get the shared thing working to some degree (hopefully 9.3 will help in the future). Google Admin for Chromebooks is a breeze, and the devices are tailored for sharing. As a result, we’ve purchased many more Chromebooks than iPads in the years I’ve been here. That being said, we still use iPads for lower grades because they are more tactile and have the apps, and we then start introducing Chromebooks in the upper grade school years. Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Reply Useful input, thanks. Liam Deckham - 1 year ago Reply Maybe I am missing something, but should it not say “double up on education” given the first option is “yes, even if it makes less direct profit”? Apologies if I missed something.

Apple SAYS that education is in their DNA…however, it seems to be getting buried deeper and deeper… Vatdoro - 1 year ago Reply As an Apple Investor I would like to see Apple lose a little bit of money in the education market. (Especially the K-12 schools.) The more youth that grow up on the Apple ecosystem will stick with it and buy Apple products when they go to college, and after. Apple has plenty of money in the bank. Lose a little bit of money on the K-12 market, so Apple can keep its great profit margins when selling to consumers and professionals. DEE CHRISTOPHER (@1STnTENDERBITS) - 1 year ago Reply I don’t even think it should be viewed as “losing money”. It’s an investment in the future. As you said, the kids would potentially grow up in the ecosystem. Ben said it pretty nicely. Apple knows consumers. That IBM relationship could be the ticket to getting a program done correctly. Chris Cicero - 1 year ago Reply Best solution is actually both. Chromebooks for ‘stuff’ and iPads for digital versions of books. Chromebooks stay in school, iPads goes with the student. Robert - 1 year ago Reply The Washington Post writes: “But Google is also tracking what those students are doing on its services and using some of that information to sell targeted ads, according to a complaint filed with federal officials by a leading privacy advocacy group” Chromebooks might seem cheaper but at the cost of your kids privacy! Somehow Google get away with monetizing students through ads.

Excerpted from Ben’s link: “Seemingly, Google isn’t the only one who disagrees with EFF’s translation of the privacy pledge and the manner in which Google allegedly breaches it. Both the Future of Privacy Forum and The Software and Information Industry Association (two co-authors of the pledge) have joined Google in criticizing the EFF’s interpretation.” tylerallen86 - 1 year ago Reply 1. How about develop an OS not designed for a phone! 2. Drop “iOS”, stupid desktop names, and move onto Mac OS, Phone OS, TV OS, watch OS, and Pad OS. 3. Give the school the ability to remove the App Store(plus other stock apps) and install all applications internally through an Xcode equipped Mac. paulywalnuts23 - 1 year ago Reply Removing app store and installing apps through a Mac can already be done, It is called Apple Configurator. Removing of Stock Apps is coming in iOS 9.3. Also Pad OS is just a bad name. Greg Pryor (@gpo613) - 1 year ago Reply My daughter started HS in the fall. Here is a little background on her circle of friends. When they were 7-8 they all had Nintendo DS’. Then they all got an iPod Touch at 9-11. Now most of all of them have an iphone. Sure some go Android, but iphone is more likely. Coming from Junior High, but daughter wanted a Mac. That is what she worked on mainly in school. (BTW, we have a PC laptop at home). But her HS gave every kid a Chromebook. My daughter knew it was coming and complained that she would rather have a Mac. Well after half the year she is content with a CB. Here is the kicker. We have all heard cradle to grave marketing. You stay with a company your whole life. Well these kids were heavily leaning towards apple, but now they have been introduced to another option. Now they may look at something else. I have always planned on buying my daughter a nice laptop for college at HS graduation. The question is will she still want a Mac 3.5 years from now. Before the CB I would have said 100% yes, but now I am not sure. paulywalnuts23 - 1 year ago Reply Well she won’t want a CB because unfortunately that won’t cut the mustard in most Degree Fields in college. So when the time comes her choice will be PC or Mac and all the kids I deal with who have used CBs in High School still end up wanting a Mac for more than one reason. Frank Lowney - 1 year ago Reply This is an excellent analysis that identifies all of the key reasons why Apple is not competing well against Google. Great constructive criticism. The education features of iOS 9.3 (currently in beta) appear to address many of the shortcomings identified here. The IBM angle may be the next shoe to drop. We’ll see. Google’s Achilles heel in education is that it collects massive amounts of data on student use of its devices and services. School administrators don’t fully know what they do with that data and Google can’t/won’t tell them. That’s why the Google package is so cheap. Apple should press this point and solicit aid from privacy activists and government agencies charged with the task of protecting students and their families from such invasions of privacy. The culpability of Pearson in the LAUSD fiasco cannot be exaggerated. Apple leadership is overly enamored of big name partners and that was a major error. Pearson took Apple for granted. Apple needs to hold entities like Pearson to the same high standards they insist on in dealing with their lesser partners. Apple customers deserve no less. pdixon1986 - 1 year ago Reply I think the biggest issue is the limitation iPads actually have in the classroom… iPad is not flash friendly – so that limits certain software and webpages that use flash (which a lot of teacher sites have)… There is also the issue of transferring and sharing data – you can’t simply save to a flash drive or SD card to hand over to a PC… iPads don’t alway play nice with windows and are best with other Apple products… Chrome books are more of a laptop with a built in keyboard and easy to put on a desk to work — unless you have a cover the iPad wont stand up, and unless you have a bluetooth keyboard you have to rely on the onscreen keyboard… doing serious studying on an iPad is problematic – being able to move a curser to select things and have multiple windows open helps. I think the macbook air 11″ would have done better than most ipads. I’m a fan of Apple, but i honestly don’t get the use of iPads – i feel they are either an e-reader, a large screen mobile gaming device or social, or something that only works great in certain specialist fields… it doesnt replace the need of a laptop, which i feel is more suited for students. As a student i often had a minimised facebook window that flashed when i got a message, i had wiki and google in the back ground, my word doc open, and a book next too me — if mac had the book store back then, i would have had the book open in another window…i would be much happier having an all-in-one device that isnt much bigger or heavier than an ipad, than having to carry an iPad around plus find a PC to do ‘real’ work (office on iPad is not a great experience) Finally – networking… i havent used an iPad on a large network like in a school where they are all competing for bandwidth BUT i do know that finding a printer with AirPrint is difficult, and with no usb port it is difficult to print from an iPad. Matt Marino (@Matt_Marino) - 1 year ago Reply Great points here, and that makes me think of how there had been watercooler discussion of OSX for the iPad Pro and/or future iPads. Had Apple developed (or if Apple develops) an iPad version of OSX, we might have more to consider. Don’t get me wrong – I love my iPad Air for personal use, and I use Office and Google Docs for moderate document review and production, but I’m never going to bang out a 20 page paper on the iPad unless I have no alternative. cdm283813 - 1 year ago Reply Apple is greedy. Plain and simple. Do we need a 3000 word essay to figure this out. Apple should not even touch the education sector. It just looks bad when you take advantage of tax payers money. John Hermesmeyer - 1 year ago Reply My son’s small private school made us buy iPads when he was in 6th grade. Didn’t get any discount or extra support from Apple. There were minimal school apps for it back in 2011 and no security to it, found a video a friend of my son took of my son looking at bikini girls (thats my boy!) and in 8th grade a kid was caught taking up-skirt pictures (so much for private school morality right) of girls…… The school now requires iPads for grades 4 thru 8th grades but other than a glorified notepad and web research tool there still isn’t any support for school apps I know of. Flashback to the late 90’s when Apple released the iMac G3 my mother a teacher in public schools had them. Again nothing but a word processor and occasional web research tool. Those where the ones mentioned in this article that Apple supplied…. They didn’t last long and were replaced by Windows PC’s which had better support from the schools IT staff. I love Apple PC’s and mobile devices but its safe to say Apple has not shown much support for education IMHO and its a shame because they would be great at it. b9bot - 1 year ago Reply LAUSD did not do there homework and did not correctly setup the iPads as directed by Apple. Other schools in many states use iPads without any of the drama of LAUSD. Because they followed Apple’s directions to set them up properly so as the students could not go out and go around the protections to keep the iPads with school only materials on them. The other issue is cost and most of the IT people will go for the cheapest crap they can find. So Chrome books win. Cheap crap that will fail before the school year is out and will cost more to fix or replace will give those cheap IT people something to think about when they go over budget with crappy cheap junk that fails instead of paying more for quality products that would have lasted at least 3 years or more. valanchan - 1 year ago Reply Nice article Ben. Schools are not just full of students. How can the iPad benefit the teacher? Not just in teaching but also in marking, lesson planning and useful metadata about the semester, class, workload, student or material used. First sell the iPad to the teacher and then the classroom will follow. zoom82 - 1 year ago Reply I work in a school technology department. We have Macs, Chromebooks, and iPads. Google has a done a good job of listening to school needs and adjusting things to help schools. Apple has been slow to adjust. However, it looks like the last year they have been adjusting and 9.3 is a step in the right direction. However, Apple needs to provide a better way to manage Apple devices. For a one time fee, Google provides management for the device for its lifetime. Apple’s management software can be used (but buggy). Many school districts feel more comfortable going with a third party management piece like Jamf. However, there is a yearly cost with third-party options which you have to put on top of a already more expensive device. Like someone else said, you can mange Apple device, it just take sometimes multiple management pieces to be successful. Ben Lovejoy - 1 year ago Reply Useful perspective, thanks! John R. Sowash (@jrsowash) - 8 months ago Reply Excellent analysis. You have hit on the major reasons whey schools have jumped into Chromebooks. It is unfortunate that all, despite its long history of success in education, has abandoned the market (if not officially, than certainly by way of ignoring the needs of the classroom) I taught in a 1:1 iPad school but have sense completely jumped on board with Chromebooks. Using ipads with students is much slower and more cumbersome than using Chromebooks. I’m such a big believer in Chromebooks that I spent the last year writing a book about them! You can snag a free copy here: chrmbook.com. I would love to hear your feedback! PhilBoogie - 8 months ago Reply Excellent book John! All looks good, and if I may nitpick I can only point out the following: Page 13 has a leading space: Technical “stuff” (space) For… On the 7th page the woman looks to be holding an …iPad. Seems odd, in a book about Chromebooks Dennis W. McElroy (@acoustimac) - 3 weeks ago Reply Nearly every concern voiced in this article has been addressed by Apple except the keyboard. The LAUSD program had many faults that could have been overcome, but there had to have been problems both with the advice Apple provided and/or follow through by the district. Cost is relative to the functionality of the device. The iPad is a much more powerful and robust architecture as compared to chrome books. The app universe is light years beyond Chromebooks right now although Google is attempted to remedy this (early analysis is not good). Multiuser support and school control has been addressed nicely by Apple. The pre bundling of a bunch of apps that teachers/students may or may not want is ridiculous. One of the biggest draws of the iPad is it begs for creativity in how they are used. Teachers and students need to be given the freedom to use the apps they want to use. They need to be able to explore and find new solutions. In the latest Apple universe this is possible. In the mean time Chromebooks still have the same pros/cons. They are cheap. Essentially they are modern dumb terminals. They typically need access to the cloud OR it takes work, sometimes considerable work, to figure out what needs to be added to do basic things. The only time action really takes place is when you are connected to the internet. In a recent article in The Journal, many of the reasons schools went with Chromebooks were disturbing. Cost. Familiarity with tried and true tech like keyboards. Many of the failed technology initiatives over the past two decades have resulted from thinking “inside the box” rather than thinking of the possibilities. These require rethinking how our classrooms work and how instruction takes place. This is the real guidance that’s missing. Joe Val - 4 days ago Reply I’m the IT department. let me tell you that not having to deal with cracked screens, which were taking a large chunk of my day, is awesome. Chromebooks get vandalized but not at the same degree as IPads. Even with a big hardy case, kids just break them. 30 percent plus replaced in the first two years out of nearly 4 thousand. cant wait for their extended coverage to expire.I wont be sorry to see the last one die, and I am fervently pushing to have them replaced with Chromebooks. If anyone here can actually give me a valid reason for an Ipad, id love to hear it. I have not heard a good one yet. For every teacher that has resisted going from IPads to Chromebooks, I have a convert. After the first week of not having problems they are sold. Work goes up way up. About the only kids that I see that need them are PreK and K kids. If you are just an Apple fan, do what I do, think of the children…. and me.

New models are expected to be announced this week. Illustration: Apple Apple’s most recent quarter was a dud, that much we know. The company sold 45.5 million iPhones in the three-month period ended September, down 5% from a year ago. iPad units were down 6% to 9.3 million. Macs got hit the hardest, down 14% to 4.9 million units sold. But this could be the worst of it for Apple. The company forecast revenue of $76 billion to $78 for the current quarter that runs from October to December. That guidance is ahead of analysts’ current forecast for $75 billion in revenue. Investors might have still been hoping for any even bigger “beat,” though. Apple shares were down 2.2% in “after-hours” trading. The company will offer more detail in its 5 p.m. conference call. The company is likely to talk a lot about its “services” business, which grew 24% during the quarter to a record $6.3 billion. Services includes things like iTunes sales and iCloud subscriptions. Since much of the world already owns iPhones, iPads, and Macs, Apple is increasingly reliant on these services to drive growth. There’s still no word on sales of the Apple Watch. Stay tuned for more.

But before that can happen, the California-based company has reportedly opened over 100 new small stores in India which are under the franchise model. The stores are a part of an initiative where the company is aiming to expand six-fold of these outlets in the country in the coming year. Of course this means that it wants to take on Samsung and other smartphone vendors from China. The report says that these stores measure 450 to 500 square feet in area and will be known as Apple Authorised Resellers. There are not company-owned outlets rather the stores that we usually see today. With these Authorised Resellers, Apple plans to expand its reach and presence in high street and high profile locations in large cities, neighbourhood localities and tier II and III markets. This was confirmed by two senior trade partners. These stores are being setup in the capital city New Delhi as well as the National Capital Region, which includes new stores in Vasant Vihar, Malviya Nagar, South Extension and in Gurgaon’s Galleria Market. Apart from that, cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune and Chandigarh are also getting the new Apple Authorised Reseller stores.

Furthermore, the product release will not involve any fanfare at all. Now a new report has surfaced saying that the device that might be released next week is the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2. According to Mac Otakara, a number of Japanese analysts predict that the rumored product release for next week will be the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2. While this claim is a direct contradiction of Digitime’s earlier report, the website has clarified that this is merely a prediction from people in the know. The release of the iPad Pro 2 is still shrouded in mystery. So far, a number of reports claim that the release will be in April. Others even say that it might happen between May and June. However, a growing number of reports have surfaced, saying that a product will be released as early as next week. Unfortunately, all these reports did not offer solid proofs and just urged readers to rely on “reputable supply chain analysts.” iPad Pro (via apple.com) Apart from the same design features, nothing much is known about the possible new hardware specs of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2. Some experts say that it will retain the original A9X chip. It has been rumored that this version of the iPad Pro will be cheaper and will serve as the replacement for the iPad Air 2. However, there are some reports that it may sport the newest Apple ARM processor, the A10X, an improvement of the current A10 Fusion chip on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Like any of the rumors surrounding the iPad Pro 2, readers are urged to take this one with a grain of salt. Whether or not Apple is set to release a product without any event at all is sure to sound dubious. Normally, Apple will send out invitations to its event days before it is set to happen. However, consumers can still expect that in the coming weeks, Apple will have the new iPad Pro 2 out in the market. For more updates on the iPad Pro 2, be sure to check out TheBitbag.

IDC says it is the first time Apple was New Zealand's top selling phone brand since early 2012. During the quarter phone sales hit a record high. Some 672,000 phones shipped1 between October and December 2016. That's up from 614,000 a year earlier. Apple shipped 221,000 phones. Samsung shipped 176,000. Third-place Huawei closed the gap on its rivals shipping 143,000 phones. The three brands accounted for almost 80 percent of total phone sales. Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 recall after dozens of fires and explosions only goes part of the way to explaining Apple's success. IDC New Zealand client device analyst Chayse Gorton says: "...even with some consumers expected to be holding off upgrading their smartphone until the release of the 10th anniversary edition iPhone, forecasted in late 2017, the demand for iPhone 7 has been stronger than anticipated”. Gorton says the iPhone 7's updated specifications were enough to entice Apple users. He says: "It's hard to say with confidence that a single feature drove customers to upgrade, such as increased durability. It is likely a combination of improvements leading to consumers perceiving the iPhone 7 models as superior". Samsung loyalty That explains why Apple users upgraded, not why customers of other phone brands switched to Apple. Gorton says the Note 7 problems meant some consumes questioned their loyalty to Samsung. It looks as if Apple's surge is greater than upgrades and Samsung refugees alone might suggest. Also interesting is Huawei's rapid growth. Until late 2016 Huawei phones offered similar features and style to Samsung models at a sharp discount. Samsung faced a battle on three fronts: self-inflicted wounds, Apple at the high end and Huawei cutting the price ground from under Samsung's feet. Despite all this Samsung stayed in the top spot for the year. IDC New Zealand puts its market share at 32 percent, while Apple and Huawei were at 27 percent and 14 percent.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (10) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Setapp: Explore a universe of apps for just $9.99 per month!

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU.

Business Apps | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (14) How to Set Up and Use Airline Boarding Passes in Wallet by Adam C. Engst When Tonya and I first started taking airline flights back in the early 1990s, I found it almost overwhelmingly stressful. It stemmed from the fact that flying was so expensive for us, but I also dreaded the byzantine process of buying tickets, checking in repeatedly, and dealing with security. So much seemed to hinge on not losing tickets, boarding passes, or identification cards. We never made any mistakes, though, and in retrospect, misplacing a ticket or boarding pass likely wouldn’t have been a big deal. (The first time I flew to Canada, pre 9/11, I forgot my passport but was still allowed through customs with a stern talking-to. Who knows what would happen today!) I still don’t enjoy airline travel, but I’ve done it enough that it no longer stresses me out to the same extent, even as dealing with invasive and unpleasant security requirements has gotten far worse. Plus, thanks to the Internet and the iPhone, the logistics have become vastly simpler. Being able to buy tickets, check in, and print boarding passes online was the first step, and the next major improvement came when Apple released the Passbook app, since renamed Wallet. I’ve been using Passbook/Wallet as long as has been possible — it took smaller airports like Ithaca a while to get the necessary scanners — but as much as I liked eliminating the need for paper, there were many problems early on. Getting passes into Passbook was difficult, due to horrible airline apps, and bringing up the passes quickly and reliably was also hard. Even during our trip to MacTech Conference in Los Angeles in November 2016, when I was using an iPhone 7 running iOS 10, I had problems. I eventually realized the Raise to Wake option kept swapping the boarding pass for the lock screen every time I lowered my iPhone while waiting in line to board. But on my most recent trip, to Austin for the ASMC Summit for independent Apple resellers, everything just worked. The United app knew about my itinerary once I was logged in, and the Delta app figured it out once I entered the ticket number. Both notified me when I could check in, and made it easy to do that and add my boarding passes to Wallet. iOS 10 and Wallet were smart enough to display a constant notification on the lock screen during the time I needed it, a single swipe brought up the boarding pass, and it stayed on screen while I waited in line, regardless of Raise to Wake. I’m sure many of you are nodding your heads in agreement, or wondering why I’m telling you all this. I’m no frequent flyer, so I’m sure that these improvements have been obvious to road warriors for a while. But I wanted to document how to do all this because I saw a lot of people still relying on paper boarding passes on that last trip. The experience of relying on an iPhone is so good, and so much better than dealing with paper, that if you’ve avoided it so far, I urge you to give it a try next time. But feel free to print a paper boarding pass as a backup until you’re comfortable with using your iPhone instead! Get the Airline App -- The first step is perhaps the hardest. It’s not that finding or downloading airline apps is difficult or expensive — they’re all free, and you can download them from the App Store like any other app. Here are links for the main U.S. airlines: Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. In my experience, the tricky part, particularly for those of us who have been traveling for many years, is logging in. I strongly recommend taking some time well before your next flight to set up the airline apps you might use. Do them all at once, since it can be a fussy, annoying process if you have old accounts, or if airline mergers have confused matters. It’s far easier to figure out your login information — usually some combination of frequent flyer number, email address, or username, plus a password or PIN — via the airline Web sites while working calmly on a Mac at home. You may need to ask for new passwords in some cases, and regardless, I’d encourage you to change your password to a 20-character random password and store it in a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. You have to assume that airline Web sites are under attack all the time, given the value of the information they store, and I imagine that identity theft surrounding airline travel could cause a world of hurt. So set strong passwords and make sure to use a password manager that you can access on your iPhone too. Check In and Add Boarding Passes -- Once you’re logged in to the airline app, it should be relatively obvious how you can check in for your flight, which you can usually do 24 hours beforehand. If you booked the flight through the same airline, the app might even know about your itinerary already. If not, you may have to enter a confirmation number or ticket number — I had to do that when using the Delta app to check in for the return leg of my last trip, which had originated on United. At the end of the check-in process, the apps I’ve used have provided a relatively clear Add to Wallet link or button. Tap it, and when it hands you off to Wallet, make sure everything looks correct in the boarding pass and then tap the Add link in the upper-right corner. You may or may not need to do this for each boarding pass; check to see what’s in Wallet after the first one. Now you’re ready for when you go to the airport. Call Up a Boarding Pass -- As you’re waiting in the security line, you’ll want to get your iPhone ready to display the boarding pass to the first security checker. Since Wallet knows your flight times, it starts displaying a notification on the iPhone’s lock screen some hours before. That notification appears every time you wake the iPhone, and you can swipe it to the right to display the boarding pass. Those with an iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 can also 3D Touch it and then tap a Show Pass button, but that’s a bit clumsier than the swipe. The boarding pass will stay on screen even beyond the time set in Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock, but as you approach the head of the line, check to make sure you haven’t inadvertently pressed the Sleep/Wake button on your iPhone. If you have an Apple Watch, you can instead bring up the Wallet app there — you might want to tap the Keep in Dock button to make it easier to get to for your return flight. The watch’s Wallet app shows the same passes that are in Wallet on the iPhone, and tapping the boarding pass shows you the same information, although you have to scroll down (or rotate the digital crown) to get to the QR code required for the scanner. While the Wallet app is up on the Apple Watch, the screen doesn’t turn off, so you don’t have to struggle with it when you get to the desk. Although I can’t imagine a scenario where this makes sense, you can prevent a boarding pass from appearing on your lock screen. Swipe right on its notification, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and in the next screen, disable Suggest on Lock Screen. You can turn off automatic updates here too, but again, I can’t think of when it would be useful to have a boarding pass not update automatically. One final note. Since many flights have multiple legs, each with a separate boarding pass, note that Wallet seems to try to keep them together. If you see multiple dots at the bottom of a screen showing a boarding pass, try swiping left and right to move between them. The same applies if you’re traveling with a family and you have boarding passes for multiple people in your iPhone. Speaking of which, if you and your traveling companions all have iPhones and airline accounts, it’s usually possible for each person to manage their own boarding passes. But if not, you can check in for multiple travelers and add all their boarding passes to your iPhone, though that will require some swiping back and forth whenever you need to present them. Delete Passes -- Back in the day, you sometimes wanted to hold on to boarding passes to prove that you’d flown the miles for a frequent flyer program. In today’s world, unless you’re a tech writer who wants to keep a few boarding passes around to document how Wallet works, there’s little reason to retain them. To delete an expired boarding pass, open Wallet, tap the boarding pass, tap the i button in the lower-right corner, and then tap the Remove Pass option. Anything Else? -- It was difficult to document how all this works since I had to do it live, while juggling luggage and making sure I ended up on the right flight and in the right seat. There’s no way to simulate different scenarios or test something again. So, if I’ve missed something in this description of using boarding passes in Wallet, please let me know in the comments. Finally, what if you lose or break your iPhone, with all your travel documents on it, during your trip? If that happened to me while en route, I’d go to the nearest airline desk to see if they could print me a new boarding pass. And if it happened in the middle of my trip, which seems more likely, I’d try to get to the airport early for my departure, so there would be extra time to check in for the flight and get a printed boarding pass. If you have ever experienced such an iPhone disaster, leaving you without a boarding pass or information about your itinerary, tell us in the comments how you worked around the problem.

If you’re still printing boarding passes on paper because you think that using your iPhone would be too hard, think again. Airline apps and Apple’s Wallet app have improved significantly over the years, and the process is now easier than fussing with printed boarding passes. Adam Engst walks you through it. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment David Lutchko  2017-03-13 16:34 I was a road warrior and agree that using Apple wallet can be great. That said, ALWAYS carry a paper copy of your itinerary with you. You never when your phone starts misbehaving, or runs out of power (evening flights), etc. Sometimes, though, I found it hard lugging a carry-on with one hand, toting a small computer backpack, and then juggling the phone with my non-dominant hand to show the flight attendant my seat assignment--it almost fell between the jetway and the plane (would have landed on the tarmac!). That would not have been good. Another consideration, if traveling internationally I may be tempted to backup my phone using iTunes and restore it to factory settings just to prevent a possible Customs and Immigration privacy invasion, not so much because I'm paranoid but more out of principle. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:17 Good point. In fact the NBC Nightly News had a story tonight (13 Mar 17) on the CBP demanding the phones and passwords of US Citizens at both land and air entry points. Reply Paul Albert  2017-03-13 20:56 I mean really all that trouble. Just print it out, fold it up and put in your wallet. Sometimes all this tech stuff just gets in the way of life. Flying is already stressful-why deal with this. Another headache. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:35 I always found the paper boarding passes much more stressful. You have to remember to print them out, put them in a location where you won't forget (and my wallet isn't nearly big enough to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper), and then constantly be sorting through them to get the right one for the right leg of the trip. Plus, you have to take them out and put them back repeatedly as you go through security and (sometimes) check in, and if you have any other papers with you, it's easy for them to get mixed up together. And of course, paper boarding passes don't update with new gate or time information. The iPhone is always in my right front pocket or in my hand, and the Apple Watch is always on my wrist. Now that Wallet works well, I find it a much better solution. But hey, if you like the paper, there's nothing stopping you from using it. Reply tonyblunt  2017-03-13 23:11 I used the iPhone for a few years and the process has got much simpler. Now I use the watch, less juggling things but some airlines have code readers that you cannot get your wrist under, hopefully they will upgrade soon. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 Yes, the scanners do have to be the right orientation for the watch. I didn't have trouble with that on this trip, but on some previous one, it was clear that I wouldn't be able to use the watch and I had to revert back to the iPhone. Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-03-13 23:21 Adam, since the CBP is now demanding access to the phones of returning US Citizens, you might as well get the app "Mobile Passport" so you can just give them your phone immediately before 3 of their goons tackle you. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:40 Oh, don't get me started... The EFF has a page on privacy at the boarder, and I need to write more about it. http://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017 Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-14 01:29 When my husband and I travel together, we always put both of our boarding passes on both phones to provide a backup in case one phone goes on the fritz during the boarding process. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:37 That's smart! Reply Tonya Engst   2017-03-14 14:14 That is a very cute username! :-) Reply Tonya not the TidBits Tonya  2017-03-16 18:16 I kinda thought so, too ;-) Reply zaccone  2017-03-14 09:25 I often book flights on Southwest for my wife, son, and me. When I do that, I get one itinerary number and Southwest won't let me put the boarding passes on my phone. To fix this, I need to call Southwest and ask them to give each family member a separate itinerary number. They are willing to do this and it fixes the problem. I could probably accomplish the same thing by booking each of the flights separately, but I'm always afraid I won't get the same fare for each flight if I do that. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-14 11:39 Interesting! I know I've put boarding passes for multiple people on my iPhone with the United app, but since I've lived in the Northwest and the Northeast, I've never flown Southwest. :-) Reply To leave a comment, click Add a Comment and then enter the text, your name, and your email address (which won't be displayed).

The company announced that its Brickell City Centre shopping mall branch in Miami is gearing up for its opening on March 25th at 10:00 am local time. Despite having three other stores existing in Miami, this is the first to be located in the city’s Downtown area. The company first announced its plans to open a retail store in Brickell City Centre in February 2016. After its announcement, the company began its construction in Miami’s financial district. When it opens this month, it is destined to be the largest Apple retail store based in Florida. Keeping true to its word, this new location meets last month’s target opening date announcement. But apart from just opening in Downtown Miami, Apple intends to open two other Apple retail stores on the same day. The other locations are in Schildergasse in Cologne, Germany and Jinmao Place in Nanjing, China. Both will also open at 10:00 am local time. Impressively, all three locations are brand new retail stores. These three locations will embody the new design Apple introduced in 2015 in several of its retail stores. Armed with lots of wide open spaces, the new design showcases a breathable and more relaxed ambiance in Apple’s retail stores. Each store follows the same style with indoor trees, light boxes, seating areas for community events, touch-sensitive sequoia wood tables and shelves, and large 6K resolution video screens for product marketing. Just a few days ago, Apple opened its River City Drive in Jacksonville, Florida location. However, this was a relocated store from St. Johns Town Center store. On March 4th, Apple also reopened its Pentagon City store in Washington, D.C. as a newly expanded location. Meanwhile, its Danbury, Connecticut store location closed last month to make room for renovations.   Tags: Apple, Apple Store About Christine Torralba View all posts by Christine Torralba → ← Report:

Reuters/Stephen Lam Apple has been tight-lipped about the details of its upcoming products. The company also hasn’t made any invitation to the media for a forthcoming launch event. Nevertheless, a new report suggests that Apple may hold a non-glitzy media conference next week and surprise fans with a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2017 model. The new report suggests that the Cupertino, California-based tech giant could unveil a revamped 9.7-inch variant of its tablet PC as early as next week. While the new iPad Pro model may carry the same specs as the current version, the upcoming tablet is expected to be beefed up with the A10X chipset, the upgraded form of the iPhone 7’s A10 processor. Japanese site Macotakara first reported about the possible launch. Earlier this week, MacRumors also reported that Apple could unveil a slew of new devices next week, citing “reliable supply chain analysts.” According to the report, the Mac maker is most likely to unveil the new batch of products around March 20 to 24. Unfortunately, no devices were specifically mentioned. Previous reports likewise indicate that Apple is launching three new iPads in the coming weeks. The successors of the iPad Air, iPad Mini and the iPad Pro are supposedly going to retain the 3.5 mm headphone jack that Apple took away from its current smartphones, so fans should keep their fingers crossed for that. The upcoming iPads are also to likely include an entry-level model that will target the education sector, which apparently considers the 12.9-inch iPad Pro as too pricey. The cost-effective iPad could reportedly sell for as low as US$299 (AU$395). In comparison, the current iPad Air 2 starts at US$399 (AU$527). Insiders say that the iPad 2017 models could feature edge-to-edge designs. Apple would have to remove the Home button in order to achieve the near-borderless look. The next generation iPads are also reportedly going to come with 12 MP iSight primary cameras with True Tone flash, quad speakers, quad microphones, True Tone displays and the updated Apple Pencil stylus. The company is also reportedly going to unveil a new iPhone together with the new iPad 2017 line-up at the supposed event, although it is not known yet if Apple is going to announce the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, the iPhone 8 / Edition or a special tenth year anniversary iPhone, which has the unofficial iPhone X moniker. A refreshed iPhone SE is also said to be in the mix. See related stories below for updates about other upcoming Apple products.

While rumours about the iPhone 8 having the said type of display has been around for months, they were initially snuffed out with reports claiming that the phone’s display will be flat. However, a new report claims that the iPhone 8 display will indeed be curved; unfortunately, not as curved as anyone would think. According to Nikkei, the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will have a curved OLED display despite earlier claims of it being flat. Furthermore, the report added that the curvature of the display will be “gentler” than that of a Samsung Galaxy S7. According to the source, the gentler curve is due to difficulties in manufacturing the glass for the display. The report also said that while the curved display will effectively increase the viewable area to 5.2 inches, Apple is not adding new features on it. Apple has been late in the adoption of the curved screen technology. For a long time, the company stuck with its Retina IPS LCD technology rather than shifting to OLED. With the advent of the iPhone 8, Apple wanted to make the phone different from its previous models; the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. iPhone 7 (via apple.com) In addition to the curved display, there are also rumors about the iPhone 8’s dual glass housing. The report mentioned that China’s Biel Crystal and Lens Technology will be supplying the back glass of the phone. Meanwhile, long-time Apple maker Foxconn will supply the front glass cover for the screen. The iPhone 8 will be unveiled during Apple’s September event, according to earlier reports. While the phone will be introduced to the public along with the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus, it will not become available until much later. Reports suggest that Apple may officially release the phone sometime in October or November. The upcoming 10th anniversary phone is said to introduce a number of new features. That is why many experts believe that the phone will be priced as a premium device. Some believe that the iPhone 8 will be sold somewhere north of $1,000. Apple is yet to comment on this matter.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Sunday March 19, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode All the big Android phone launches to expect in 2017 Campbell Simpson 2 Feb 2017, 11:56 a.m. With Mobile World Congress 2017 just around the corner, we thought it was a good time to remind you of all the good stuff we know (and think) is on the way. All the big Android phone launches to expect in 2017 The Pixel 2 should be more refined in a lot of ways, including build quality. Photo: Google Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Are you going to splash out and spoil yourself with a new smartphone this year? We'd say Google's Pixel is the Android phone to buy right now, but if you're planning on holding off for a couple of months, it's going to have some tough competition. With Mobile World Congress 2017 just around the corner, we thought it was a good time to remind you of all the good stuff we know (and think) is on the way. By the way: Don't forget, of course, about the iPhone. 2017 is the 10th anniversary of the world-changing smartphone, and Apple apparently has some pretty big plans up its sleeves in Cupertino for the iPhone 8. An edge-to-edge OLED display, a glass or ceramic back depending on the model, wireless charging, and Apple's usual incredibly efficient and powerful home-grown mobile processors are all entirely possible. But Apple keeps its cards closer to its chest than just about any other phonemaker, so don't expect too many leaks this far out from September. Samsung: Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note8 Samsung's Galaxy S8 won't be announced at MWC 2017, with the world's largest phone manufacturer apparently holding off until March. Expect a phone similar in size to the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, but with an edge-to-edge display that is much larger, as well as newer, more powerful processors capable of stupidly fast downloads. It's apparently also built around a smart, AI-powered virtual assistant rather than Google's own Assistant that the Pixel uses. Somewhere well into the second half of the year, too, we'll see a Galaxy Note8 from Samsung, which is — almost surprisingly — has been widely agreed upon by pundits as the name the company is going with for its hardcore, enthusiast-focused, big-screen Android. Early rumours suggest a 4K display for better visual quality and more immersive virtual reality using Samsung's Gear VR headset. LG: G6 LG's G5 didn't have quite the impact that the company was hoping, and it's looking like LG will stick with a tried and tested non-modular design for its upcoming G6, which will be unveiled at MWC. One issue we've heard is that Samsung might be hogging all the good new Qualcomm processors, forcing LG to use last year's tech or to wait longer to launch the phone itself. The G6, though, will apparently have a 2:1 ratio for its screen, making its 18:9 display longer and thinner (comparatively) than other phones using the 16:9 standard. What will LG use that extra screen real estate for? The V20 used an extra display up top to great effect for notifications, and LG's always used on-screen buttons to move around the Android interface, so these seem like pretty likely inclusions. HTC: Ocean HTC already kicked off the year with the relatively early announcement of its U Play and U Ultra, two mid- to high-end phones built around a new glass design and some fancy software that adapts to your usage patterns. Those will be out in Australia soon enough, but between now and then we'll almost certainly learn about another HTC phone in the pipeline. At MWC 2017, we might be introduced to HTC's top-end phone for the year: the Ocean. By all accounts, it might be one of the more interesting announcements, potentially having no buttons at all and instead using swiping gestures to navigate around the interface. Combine that with modern specs and you've got yourself what seems like an awesome piece of hardware. Huawei P10 We're about to get our hands on the Mate 9 in a couple of days, which was one of Huawei's big announcements at CES this year — and yes, it's big; the Mate 9 has a 5.9-inch screen. It also gets the awesome dual-lens Leica camera that debuted on the beautiful P9 last year, which can capture some awesome snaps in either monochrome or colour. But from everything we're hearing, MWC might be the place for Huawei to announce the P9's successor: we're calling it the P10 until we know otherwise. Leaked renders and early spy photos show a phone that looks similar in design and layout to the P9, though more refined: the fingerprint sensor might move to the lower front of the phone rather than the back, and the camera and display should get a bit of a makeover. Huawei is a fan of using its own processors and its own skin on top of Android, but exactly how they've evolved remains to be seen. Motorola: Moto Z 2017 Australia's always been a little late to the party with Motorola's smartphones, and as such we only got the 2016 edition of the Moto Z towards the end of the year. An invite to an event at MWC 2017 shows that Motorola has something cooking away, which may well be a new handset again using the Moto Z name. Oppo: Find 9 Oppo's phones — like the new R9s — offer some pretty impressive specs for the asking price. A new flagship phone, though, might take that to the next level. We'll be heading to Oppo's event at MWC 2017 to see what the company has in store, so stay tuned. Sony: Yoshino Sony is widely expected to announce five new phones at MWC 2017, including a flagship codenamed Yoshino. It could have the same beautiful 5.5-inch 4K screen as the Xperia Z5 Premium and a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 835 processor and up to 6GB of RAM. We'll find out soon enough! Google: Pixel 2 Pixel was a surprise hit for Google's first proper attempt at its own phone. We loved (and continue to love) its excellent camera, and the combo of 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL means it suits different markets. There's rumours of Pixel splitting into a cheaper and more expensive duo, with the high-end model having 2017-era processing power and the budget variant using mid-range power or continuing with the same hardware of the original Pixel. The Pixel 2 should be more refined in a lot of ways, including build quality. Google didn't have time during its research and development of the Pixel to validate it for waterproofing, for example: that's a spec that's almost certainly going to be on the table for the Pixel 2. Expect another amazing camera, and the continuation of Google's excellent voice-activated, AI-powered, text-to-speech Assistant.

It was recently leaked that Apple had not three but four new iPads in the works, probably slated for next month’s big reveal. Three of those have more or less been leaked to death in the past, but the fourth one is a new mystery. According to a Greek retailer, that fourth one is actually a new iPad mini. And not just any iPad mini, but one that has a “Pro” appended to its name. Let’s recap first what’s old news. So far, the three new iPads we’re expecting include a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and a 9.7-inch “entry-level” iPad. Considering there hasn’t been a new iPad Air model since the iPad Air 2 launched in 2014, it was assumed that this could be an iPad Air 3. However, the said retailer actually lists it as an iPad Pro as well, albeit the “budget” model of the three. However, there might be an even smaller and perhaps cheaper model. That’s apparently the iPad mini Pro, which the retailer also lists. Actually, rumors of a Pro version of Apple’s smallest tablet appeared way back in October last year but has since then died down. Until now, that is. It will be interesting how Apple will position this iPad mini Pro, presuming it’s real, of course. It has been positioning the existing iPad Pros, even the smaller 9.7-inch one, practically as “not a computer” PC replacements. The 7.9-inch iPad mini’s size, however, doesn’t exactly make it conducive to such a use case. It’s definitely possible with the right accessories, but hardly ideal. Some find even the 9.7-inch iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard too cramped already. Of course, this is presuming the iPad mini Pro is indeed real. Some speculations point to a 10-inch iPad Pro, which would be just as odd. We won’t have to wait long to find out for certain, as Apple is expected to hold a press event at its brand new campus on 4th April.

Jeff Butts @clefmeister Mar 15th, 2017 5:57 PM EDT | Analysis When you want to send secure email, you have plenty of choices. I showed you recently how you can set up email encryption in Apple’s native Mail app, and that raises an interesting question. What’s better to secure email, Apple’s Mail app or a solution that uses OpenPGP, such as GPG Suite? Let’s take a look. There are several ways to secure email, so let’s look at how they differ. (Image Credit: Pete Linforth) An Abbreviated History of Secure Email Internet developers first standardized the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, in 1982, when there was little concern for security. That quickly changed, and we needed to find ways to make our email communications more secure. Basically, we needed to be able to digitally sign, encrypt, and then decrypt our emails. Groups came up with several standards to accomplish this. One of those is Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, or S/MIME, which is what Apple Mail uses. Another is PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy. You probably know of this one in the form of OpenPGP. GPG Suite utilizes OpenPGP. How Secure Email Works Both methods use Public Key Cryptography to digitally sign, encrypt, and then decrypt your email. They rely on a pair of keys, one public and one private. When you send a digitally signed email to someone, you’re signing the email with your private key and sending that person the public portion of your keypair. Once you receive a digitally signed email, your mail software saves the sender’s public key so you can later send encrypted messages to that person. As your email software digitally signs and encrypts a message, it’s doing two things: It’s signing the email with your private key Then, the software encrypts the message using your recipient’s public key. Key Differences Between S/MIME and OpenPGP From a technical standpoint, S/MIME and OpenPGP function pretty differently. S/MIME utilizes a standard way of putting arbitrary data into your email, with a definition of what type of information is there. Your email software transmits nearly everything as ASCII. On the recipient’s end, software decodes the ASCII into text or binary files. On the other hand, OpenPGP wraps the text and any binary attachments in “ASCII Armor,” an encoding layer. The software never converts the binary data into ASCII. Your binary files stay right the way they started. Another key difference between S/MIME and OpenPGP is more apparent to you, the user. That difference is in how you get your public/private keypair. Using S/MIME, the user obtains the certificate and keypair from a centralized trusted authority. These are referred to as CAs, or Certificate Authorities. OpenPGP, on the other hand, doesn’t rely on a centralized trusted authority. You, as the user, sign your keypair and then others verify whether or not the key really belongs to you by signing it themselves. OpenPGP relies on something called a Web of Trust, in which everybody is a potential CA. The theory is that you can trust a public key because it’s been signed by many other people, confirming that it really belongs to the person you think it does. Which Method Leads to More Secure Email? This is where theory and practice clash. In theory, OpenPGP could be a much stronger method of security. This is true because CAs lose their trustworthiness occasionally. Recently, the tech industry investigated two CAs, WoSign and StartCom, because of trust problems. The industry determined that those CAs failed to maintain the high standards expected of them. As a result, Apple, Mozilla, and Google all stopped trusting StartCom and WoSign certificates. The theory behind the Web of Trust is that users will build up and maintain that trust over time. There’s no dependency on a centralized agency to keep things on the level. In practice, many folks don’t even utilize the Web of Trust behind OpenPGP. It can take too long to build up the trust level, so users of OpenPGP often resort to other mediums to develop the trust relationship. For example, people will exchange their public keys and then spell out the “key fingerprint” over the telephone. If your browser or email software suddenly stops recognizing your S/MIME-based certificate, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Yes, it’s inconvenient, because you’ll have to obtain a new keypair from a CA. On the other hand, this ensures the security of your email is maintained. My Verdict: S/MIME is Simpler to Use and More Secure at the Same Time I’m putting on my flame-retardant clothing here, because I know that statement is going to draw some fire. However, my personal opinion is that the S/MIME security implemented natively within Apple Mail is both simpler to use and more secure, as long as your CA stays above-board. I’m not alone in that analysis, either. S/MIME dominates the secure electronic email industry because of enterprise acceptance and how it works. OpenPGP doesn’t mandate how to create trust. Furthermore, many folks bypass the protocol’s Web of Trust altogether. S/MIME, on the other hand, relies upon certificate servers and industry support. Don’t get me wrong. OpenPGP definitely has its merits. The GPG Suite is a fantastic set of tools for Apple Mail and other security problems. The drawback of OpenPGP is that maintaining true security of your email while still allowing trusted recipients to open them is a bit too time-consuming and labor-intensive. If you’re already deeply invested in OpenPGP, though, there’s little reason to change. The idea behind OpenPGP that you can’t fool everybody all the time is pretty solid, but the standard for is just too non-standardized for my use. References In developing this analysis, I relied upon a few sources for further information. If you want to read more, these are outstanding articles to check out. “Despite revoked CA’s, StartCom and WoSign continue to sell certificates”, Mattias Geniar, January 17, 2017. “How does PGP differ from S/MIME?”, StackExchange Information Security, October 6, 2011. “OpenPGP”. “S/MIME vs PGP,” Computer Security and PGP, March 30, 2016.

It’s also reassuring to know that Apple have chosen a robust secure option. March 15, 2017 at 7:42 EDT PM scott721 March 15, 2017 Bravo. A concise and clear discussion that has baffled me for a long time. You have been instrumental in assisting me in making my decision. Goodbye, GPG Suite. Hello S/MIME. March 15, 2017 at 9:25 EDT PM Aafje Ouwehand March 16, 2017 Great that Apple Mail offers PGP encryption, I didn’t know that. But I’ll probably stick to my Startmail account because they make PGP encryption real easy with only one click. But good developments, I really hope that email encryption will be normal by 2020. -Fingers crossed- ! March 16, 2017 at 5:09 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

(42 mm, stainless steel, sapphire, leather loop band.) Thinking back, I wonder how I ever got along without it. Here’s my somewhat random collection of thoughts; a list of things that are essential to my life now. My Apple Watch, Series 0. Perfect sapphire crystal after 22 months. My first observation is that Apple observers like to fantasize about the day when the Apple Watch will be completely independent of a paired iPhone. That is, of course, so that an Apple Watch can be bought by anyone. Not requiring a partner iPhone should increase the available market, and that’s good. For now, however, one of the nice things about the Apple Watch is how much it can and does intelligently leverage from it’s paired iPhone. Until the day comes when Apple figures out how to integrate the two into a Star Trek-like comm badge, this elegant partitioning of data works very nicely. So. Long ago, I developed a working relationship with my Apple Watch, but haven’t formally presented a list of things I like so much about it. These are things that come so very naturally in my life and make it better. Come to think about it, that’s what this watch is all about. I’ve seen some writers lament that they’ve used an Apple Watch for a few months, then put it in a drawer. That’s a complete mystery and one reason for cataloging its virtues for me. While some other smartwatches may do some or all of this, here’s what I love about my own Apple Watch. Not in any particular order. Apple Watch Virtues for Me #1. My daily steps. Anytime, anywhere, I can check the activity monitor in the dock and see how many steps I’ve walked each day. Being a writer, it’s important to track that because it’s all too easy to sit too much. I have a daily goal, and meeting that goal will keep me healthier. #2 My Next Event. My Apple Watch, at a glance, tells me what’s next. With so many things going on both at The Mac Observer and in my family life, it’s important to be able to see what’s next and when. Even when the iPhone isn’t near by. This is a godsend for me. #3 Apple Pay and Notifications. It is wonderfully cool and convenient to just reach out to a Point of Sale terminal and pay with Apple Pay. I don’t have to reach into my carry bag and fumble with an iPhone. Better yet, with my particular credit card, I get a confirmation receipt of the amount paid in just a few seconds on the watch. This is how I pay for my haircuts, and when my barber sees the receipt (from her Foursquare reader) on my watch she just raves. As for notifications, I have them managed so that I only see what’s important to me.  The little orange circle at the top of the display is my friend. #4 Hobbies. Two of my interests are weather and astronomy. While I don’t do as much observing as I used to, it’s still helpful to keep track of sunset time. This is especially helpful in the spring and fall when I’m furiously writing in the afternoon, and I need to take a walk before it gets dark. But I’ll admit, when it comes to getting a full picture of the weather and forecast, I reach for my iPhone. #5 Countdown Timer. I use this a lot more than I thought I would. Whether it’s a short nap with my cat in lap or keeping tabs on an oven that’s pre-heating, it seems like, in my busy day, I’m always setting a countdown timer. It sounds frenzied and obsessive. Actually, the Apple Watch countdown timer is so easy to use, it’s a joy. #6 Heartbeat. While I’m relaxing or napping with my cat, it’s often handy to keep tabs on how low my heartbeat can get. The record low for my heartbeat, when in my recliner is under 60. I keep trying to break that record. Breathe deep, John. (And yet, I turned off the breathe reminder right away. Endlessly annoying.) #7 Workouts. Every time I take a walk, I use the workout app in my dock. The outdoor walk has a magnificent display. With a glance, I can see how far I’ve walked, my heartbeat, Calories (kcal) burnt, my walking minutes and time of day. Then I save the workout, and it’s forwarded to my iPhone for further inspection. I can track my outdoor walk on the fly. #8 Phone calls and texts. Sometimes, when I’m about the house, away from my iPhone, I’ll get a text message or phone call. Being able to respond right away is just awesome. Maybe some people carry their iPhone in their back pocket when around the house, but I sure don’t. I’d plop into the couch to watch TV and (maybe) damage it. There are many more apps and things one can do with an Apple Watch. I’ve just touched the surface of what I do and focused on those things essential to my daily routine that I love. The point is, you too can tailor the Apple Watch to your own lifestyle. When you do, you won’t be able to live without it either. One Apple Watch Complaint Only one? Well, it’s my biggest. Why, after almost two years, is there only one Apple Watch face that displays digital hh:mm:ss? (The activity circle.) Not even the astronomy face can display digital hh:mm:ss. Surely, some developer has solved that problem! If not, I hope Apple fixes that soon.

I like to grill out, and it’s the best. Ditto Apple Pay. Many texts are best answered on the watch, too. And I especially like dismissing calls. Ahh! If you’re a techie and you don’t pay with an Apple Watch, what’s the point of being into tech? Oh, and the Apple Watch is fabulous for navigating freeways in a strange city when you don’t want to look at your phone. A lifesaver — maybe literally. March 15, 2017 at 8:00 EDT PM Lee Dronick March 15, 2017 I too very much appreciate my Apple Watch Apple Pay Texts Notifications Home Timer Activity Clock of course Best of all it has helped me lose 64 pounds in 13 months. March 15, 2017 at 10:34 EDT PM Old UNIX Guy March 16, 2017 OK, I’ll provide the counter-point… 😉 First of all, macjeffff … so instead of looking at your phone while driving you look at your watch instead and think that’s a safe(r) thing to do??? Amazing. Scary! And yes, I’m a “techie” … if someone with 30+ years of experience and who currently helps administer a 700+ node Linux cluster with PB’s of storage counts as a “techie” … And I have no use for the Apple Watch. I haven’t worn a watch since the last century and nothing about the Apple Watch has made me want to start wearing one. Look at the list above of things that everyone says they love about their Apple Watch … it’s similar to every list I’ve ever seen … and 90% or more of those things can be done from your iPhone. Oh, but wait, you would have to pull your iPhone out of your pocket and your watch is already on your wrist! Oooooh, yeah, I’m so lazy that that’s worth $400+ to me … NOT. I’m sorry, that’s a bit harsh … but I am just trying to make a point. If you find the watch valuable, great. I don’t … sorry if that means I need to turn in my techie badge. March 16, 2017 at 9:18 EDT AM Lee Dronick March 16, 2017 First of all, macjeffff … so instead of looking at your phone while driving you look at your watch instead and think that’s a safe(r) thing to do??? Amazing. Scary! “Hey Siri, what time is it?” Also these days are their vehicles on the market that don’t have a built in clock? I remember having a cheap watch strapped onto the steering wheel. March 16, 2017 at 10:44 EDT AM wab95 March 16, 2017 John: I share your love of the Apple Watch. I know that there is one Mr Chaffin at TMO who likes but does not love his AW, but I believe that he wears his nonetheless. Your reasons are similar to mine, and if I may, let me simply state that the AW, as currently designed and tethered to the iPhone, simultaneously extends the reach and power of the iPhone, and provides a very personal assistant literally at one’s fingertips where one needs it. It both makes the iPhone that much more accessible and useful (e.g. I can track my flight connection status and changes literally while running through unfamiliar airports while carrying luggage; or get traffic or weather status updates where I need them), and obtain biometric feedback on my health and performance status. It’s now an essential part of my daily arsenal for work and play. I have not taken it off since it’s release, except to charge it overnight. @OldUnixGuy: I’d say your credentials qualify you to become techie-emeritus in perpetuity, and your assessment is as valid as anyone’s. That said, not only are there health and personal status indicators on the AW that are not on your iPhone (heart rate, workouts, stand/activity reminders) but more are under development and coming that your phone can never do. More importantly, much depends on your lifestyle. Not unlike your work habits, such as whether or not you work at the same location day in and day out, and therefore might prefer a desktop computer, vs being frequently on the move and therefore might prefer a laptop; if you are in an active profession (eg a lab or doing patient care where your hands are frequently occupied) being able to see and respond to messages, or even take phone calls when your hands are occupied is more than a convenience and in my case have made the difference between being able to take an important timely call vs continuing to play phone tag with loss of time and productivity. This is not unlike what one astute reviewer wrote when reviewing the first MacBook Air; if you’ve got to ask ‘why’, then this is not meant for you; you’re not the target audience. I would only add, that not unlike so many of Apple’s products, pictures and reviews do not do it justice. You’ve got to put one on and put it through it’s paces to appreciate it, be it an iPhone (which many reviewers ripped on release), an iPad (which was dismissed as an oversized iPod Touch) or the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pro (which is getting great reviews by actual users). At the end of the day, not every device is meant for every user. First, know thyself, young lad. March 16, 2017 at 11:14 EDT AM Lee Dronick March 16, 2017 I would only add, that not unlike so many of Apple’s products, pictures and reviews do not do it justice. You’ve got to put one on and put it through it’s paces to appreciate it, My wife gave me an Apple Watch for Christmas of 2015, she didn’t want one. After 2 weeks of watching what I was doing with mine she wanted one so we headed off to the Apple Store. We both very much like them. March 16, 2017 at 12:23 EDT PM wab95 March 16, 2017 Thanks, Lee. I think, once you start using it, you quickly come to rely upon it in ways you simply could not have anticipated prior to experience. This further makes it hard to adequately explain, in mere words, to a sceptic who has not tried it, why any device provides a good, great or even outstanding user experience and tool. Now, if only I could convince my wife to put one on, we could do the heartbeat thing. Alas, my digital heartbeat remains unrequited. March 16, 2017 at 1:22 EDT PM Doug Petrosky March 17, 2017 You missed a HUGE one that was unexpected for me and makes the idea of an Echo or Google Home make very little sense. My AppleWatch is now the most convent, accurate microphone for questions and home automation. I don’t have to speak up, or worry about accidental invocation. You can say Hey Siri all day and night and never affect me. I simply lift my wrist toward my mouth and unlock my door, turn on or off Fans and lights. You want to fall in love with HomeKit? Wear an AppleWatch and command your home the right way! March 17, 2017 at 4:58 EDT PM Jack Proulx March 19, 2017 Old Unix Guy, As your username suggests, you’re outdated and one dimensional. It’s called haptic feedback for upcoming left or right turns. Hence ‘safer.’ Sorry to blow your 8bit logic away. March 19, 2017 at 1:02 EDT AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Mar 15, 2017 at 8:48PM And I'm not talking about unit sales. That happened years ago, specifically Q4 2013; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sold 26 million tablets that quarter, and unit sales have trended lower ever since. Rather, it seems like Apple may be running out of product ideas for the iPad. Not only has Apple started to elongate iPad product cycles, which now seem to be occurring every two years or so instead of every year, but the new features and updates that the iPad gets are increasingly incremental. This has been true of iPhones and smartphones more broadly for quite some time, but at least in the case of the iPhone the device continues to sell in record numbers. Consider the current round of rumors regarding the iPad(s) that Apple is expected to unveil as early as next week, according to MacRumors. iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. Image source: Apple. Rumor has it Three new iPad models are reportedly imminent: a 9.7-inch model, a 10- to 10.5-inch model, and a 12.9-inch model. The smaller and larger versions of the trio are differentiated enough in form factor, but it's hard to imagine consumers complaining that their 9.7-inch iPad would be so much more useful if only the diagonal measurement was 0.8 inches larger. As far as specs go, the newest models should receive an A10X chip, which should be a more powerful version of the A10 Fusion that powers the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Beyond the expected cadence of spec bumps, there don't appear to be any major new features or functionalities in store. There's also almost no way that Apple is ready to transition iPads to OLED displays, which are expected to appear (finally) this year in the most expensive iPhone. That's especially true since displays are always the largest cost driver, OLED displays are quite expensive, and the iPad is much larger than the iPhone. Is Apple focusing on the wrong market segment? Judging by the steady decline in iPad average selling prices (ASPs) over the years following the introduction of the cheaper iPad Mini lineup, it should be clear that the smaller form factor is resonating more with consumers than the larger and more expensive models. Data source: SEC filings. Chart by author. Calendar quarters shown. Yet the iPad Mini still gets lower priority than the larger iPads. Instead, Apple is focusing on moving upmarket with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that is intended to cater to the enterprise. In order for Apple's enterprise strategy to work, it needs to really make the iPad Pro competitive as a laptop replacement. This is a pitch that Apple has only recently begun making, historically positioning the iPad as a third category of device that consumers should buy, while rivals have been pursuing 2-in-1 form factors for much longer. Apple makes it clear that it does not target the sub-$200 tablet market. That's all fine and in line with Apple's premium brand positioning, but it could still tackle the $200-plus tablet market by simply allocating more developmental resources to the iPad Mini. On one hand, it makes financial sense that Apple continues to prioritize the iPhone as its largest revenue driver. On the other hand, the iPad arguably needs more attention so that iPad unit sales can perform better. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 15, 2017 at 9:29PM Image source: Apple. Bloomberg columnist Adam Minter believes that the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone has an unlikely challenger in emerging markets such as India: feature phones. Minter points out that these feature phones cost just over $19 on average and are capable of carrying transactions digitally via SMS, which makes them a great value over costlier smartphones with an average price of $256. The columnist also says that intermittent electricity supply in emerging markets could be a deterrent for smartphone growth, as feature phones have longer battery lives. Though his observations are true, the statistics speak otherwise, as Apple is growing its sales by leaps and bounds in emerging markets. The data speaks otherwise Feature phones are definitely not a problem for Apple in India, where iPhone sales jumped an estimated 39% in 2016 and led to 54% growth in its revenue for the region, according to data from research platform Tofler. Apple stepped up its game in India by doubling its advertising outlay, while also attracting top talent -- employee benefit expenses rose 25%. The impressive growth comes despite IDC's estimate that feature phone sales grew by around 10% in India last year, even as smartphone growth slowed down to just 8%. On the other hand, the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region is showing greater affinity for iPhones. Apple's shipments in this region shot up 133% in the third quarter of 2015, giving it 3.9% of the market, according to the last available data from Counterpoint Research. The latest data for 2016 is not available yet, but IDC estimates that iPhone sales will grow in the MEA countries this year -- thanks to the anniversary-edition iPhone -- despite the raging popularity of feature phones there. While IDC also estimates that shipments of feature phones shot up by almost 32% in Africa in the second quarter of 2016, this doesn't seem to be having a negative impact on Apple. What's driving Apple in emerging markets? Apple's iPhone sales are strong in emerging markets -- despite the availability of cheap phones and problems that are often related to developing economies -- thanks to improving spending power and infrastructure development. In India, for example, almost 79% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, up from less than 51% in 1990. African countries are also making great progress toward electrification, as the Republic of Congo's electricity access has grown to more than 41% from less than 25% over the same time period. Even Zimbabwe, one of the weakest economies in sub-Saharan Africa, has seen similar growth in electrification. The challenge of charging a smartphone will diminish in such markets in the long run as steps are taken to provide electricity to more residents, leading to 79% smartphone penetration in 2020 from just 52% in 2012. Improved spending power is another driver behind Apple's growth in emerging markets. For instance, consumer spending in India has shot up 23% in the past three years, and could grow another 18% in the next three years. As it turns out, India will be the second-largest smartphone market this year, with shipments topping 200 million units by 2020. This is great news for Apple, as the projected rise in consumer spending could help iPhone sales. What's more, Indian customers can buy iPhones with interest-free equal monthly installments that make them more more accessible for Indian consumers. On the other hand, Deloitte forecasts that Africa's annual GDP (gross domestic product) will grow by over a third in 2020 from 2015 levels. This could push iPhone sales there as young consumers in sub-Saharan Africa are quite image-conscious, spending over 50% of their income on personal care. The Foolish takeaway Feature phones are not going to hurt Apple in emerging markets: Because consumers will eventually enjoy greater spending power and a better quality of life, they will not stick with feature phones forever, leading to higher smartphone sales. Apple, on its part, is trying to increase access to its phones in these fast-growing areas by setting up manufacturing operations and lowering costs, which should boost iPhone sales in the long run.

HomeKit Apple’s Home app has received a significant amount of coverage since its release last June, yet -up until now- the firm has remained pretty light on showing exactly what the app is truly capable of. For those already lucky enough to have so-called “smart homes,” Apple’s official Home app is set to serve as a welcome addition – allowing for the complete wireless and remote control of spaces, lighting and appliances, without a second thought. But for the majority out there, the app (as of right now) is pretty useless. This is because connected homes are still far and few between … and largely, still in their infancy. Of course, Apple’s Home app can also be hooked up to a range of dedicated HomeKit-enabled accessories such as: Elgato’s Eve Room Wireless Indoor Sensor, Eve Thermo, or the Philips Hue Personal Wireless Lighting Kit, which together provide users who perhaps haven’t got access to the typical “smart home” with the ability to control certain aspects of their daily at-home experience. See Apple’s Home app in action in the new ad (above). Stickers Finally, there’s Stickers. Launching a dedicated weekly-updating section full of fun and inviting iMessage stickers, back in September, Apple is kicking its want for users to check out the many different sticker packs now available for use within iOS 10‘s Messages app to the next level, this week – by creating a brand new ad aimed squarely at Generation-Y.

Let’s Talk iOS 178: The big show   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple could launch 32GB “iPhone 6 (2017)” in Europe next week By Christian Zibreg, Mar 15, 2017 Tweet 16 Comments A new 32GB version of iPhone 6 in Gold has been quietly available at one online carrier in China since late February, and since March 10 prominently in Taiwan as the cheapest iPhone ever offered on the Taiwan Mobile network. As per a local blog, the 32GB “limited-edition” iPhone 6 in Space Gray will launch as soon as next week in Belarus—a 9.5 million people landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia, among other neighboring countries. Sources say the phone will go on sale via i-Store, priced at the equivalent of $522 (999 Belarusian rubles). For context, i-Store is an Apple Premium Reseller located in Minsk, the country’s capital and the most populous city with 2+ million people. Other than a new storage SKU, the phone is identical to the original iPhone 6: it still comes outfitted with a 4.7-inch screen sporting a 1,334-by-750 pixel resolution, has a 1.2-megapixel camera out the front and an eight-megapixel shooter out the back, runs Apple’s 64-bit A8 processor with 1GB of RAM and so forth. The device has been dubbed “iPhone 6 (2017)”. Taiwan Mobile in March promoted the 32GB iPhone 6 model in gold casing only as the cheapest iPhone to be offered on its network, for the equivalent of $435 unlocked. Given iPhone 6 debuted with 16/64/128GB of storage, this is actually a new SKU from Apple and it comes with iOS 10 pre-installed versus iOS 8 running on the original phone. Although Apple isn’t talking much about the phone nor is it selling it at retail stores or on its website, it is issuing this 32GB iPhone 6 as a limited edition. As it would appear, offering this never-before-released iPhone 6 could work in some countries. iPhone 6 debuted in September 2014, representing a major overhaul of the iconic handset based on bigger screens and sleeker casings. With iPhone 6s’s release the following year in September, 128GB iPhone 6 units got phased out along with gold casings. The whole lineup was entirely discontinued when iPhone 7 launched in September 2016 and iPhone SE made its debut as Apple’s new entry-level option. Relaunching iPhone 6 should pay off, at least in Belarus and for some Asian carriers. Knowing the 32GB iPhone 6s starts at the equivalent of about $800 (1,629 Belarusian rubles), paying nearly $280 less for a 32GB iPhone 6 is a fair deal for budget shoppers and first-time iPhone users. Even the refurbished 16GB iPhone 6 model costs more at the equivalent of $626 (1,200 Belarusian rubles). The report says Belarus will be one of the first European countries to get the phone. Only time will tell whether or not Apple will offer the “new” iPhone 6 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and across its other major markets revenue-wise.

Because of the newer SOC Steve Jobs The iPhone 6 was a mistake. burge Wasn’t the iPhone 6 one of Apples best selling devices? That’s some mistake Abhijeet Gupta It’s been apple’s best seller till date. Steve Jobs The only factor that brought in success was the push into the market of larger sized phones. Both the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6S outperform the iPhone 6 on iOS 10 currently due to how unoptimized the hardware was to accommodate the larger displays, not to mention the amount of continuous hardware issues the 6 faces, including overheating home button, poor antenna signal, camera failure, and touch input issues (aka touch disease) resulting from how malleable the 6000 Series Aluminium was. The only thing going for the iPhone 6 was the HD Retina display, which comes in second to smallest upgrade footprint to the iPhone 7. burge Was it or was it not one of Apples best selling devices, A Yes or No answer will do. So in that respect it was not a mistake. And to add my iPhone 6 that my daughter now uses has none of the issues you mentioned. You only hear about people complaining about issues what about the majority yes majority of users who didn’t have and still don’t have issues with the iPhone 6. Steve Jobs Was the Galaxy Note 7 not one of Samsung’s best selling devices? Had it not been for the hazardous battery the device would have been adopted in masses since it beat all of Samsung’s previous preorder records. The difference is that the iPhone 6’s hardware issues weren’t life threatening, and took time to show. Of course 100% of people won’t have the same issue, but it’s ignorant to assume everything I listed is a non-issue because some that you have haven’t shown any issues yet. Emphasis on the yet. I do repairs on the side and the issues I listed are way more common with the iPhone 6 than any previous or succeeding iterations of the iPhone. It really irks me when people have to get defensive about their favorite brand. Success has nothing to do with long term investment for the user. burge You made a statement that it was a mistake you didn’t think about it being one of Apples best selling devices and now you can not except that fact. Mistake or not you can not argue with solid fact but your going to keep trying. And what has Samsung got to do with it your trying to say the iPhone 6 was a mistake. Some mistake for one of apples best selling devices. Steve Jobs The Note 7 was the best selling device to date until it was recalled. If Apple had the same battery issue it’d also be recalled. That’s what it had to do with the argument. burge We are not talking about what theoretically could of been the best smartphone/most popular. We are talking about the iPhone 6 and your comment of it being a mistake. It WAS one of Apples best selling devices and that has nothing to do with any other device past present or future. john snow It’s already in stock in Kazakhstan for 159,990KZT ~ 503US$ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fedc613c39664c180328dd054c6d62b889fa2988ae880d2fb20b57adff5bdb95.png 5723alex .

One of those components is Apple’s A-series chipsets, although in recent times it seems that TSMC might have taken over. However in a report from ET News (via AppleInsider), word on the street has it that Samsung could be returning to the fold for 2018’s iPhone and the A12 chipset. Unless Apple changes something, this year’s A11 chipset is expected to continue to be supplied by TSMC, but the report claims that Samsung will be making “supplemental investments” to its 10-nanometer production lines next month, and build out 7-nanometer facilities in 2018 in which Samsung is hoping to get the jump on TSMC. Some have suggested that Apple might be hesitant to rely on Samsung again given how fiercely both companies are competing against each other, but if the predictions of an iPhone “super cycle” are true, then there is a good chance that Apple might need Samsung to lend a helping hand in order to meet the demand for their iPhones. It is estimated that this super cycle could result in a 20% increase in unit sales. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone, Samsung and SoC.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Shutterstock Apple found guilty of iPhone price-fixing scheme in Russia Yoni Heisler @edibleapple March 14th, 2017 at 7:14 PM Share Tweet This past August, Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said that Apple may have orchestrated a price-fixing scheme in the country via its network of Apple authorized resellers, an allegation Apple vehemently denied. “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world,” Apple said at the time. Don't Miss: Leaks reveal the 10 most exciting new features coming to Samsung’s Galaxy S8 Now, seven months later, Russia’s FAS has found Apple guilty of price-fixing the retail price of iPhones in the country. Per the Financial Times, Apple told upwards of 16 resellers that they couldn’t sell various iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 models below a certain price. To this point, the FAS’ investigation found that all Apple resellers just so happened to initiate the same pricing structure across multiple iPhone models at launch. A translated FAS statement on the matter reads in part: The investigation revealed that from the start of official sales in Russia Apple iPhone 5s models, iPhone 5c, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus the majority of resellers have installed on them the same prices that are recommended of “Apple Rus”, and supported them for about 3 months. The FAS further claims that resellers not willing to cooperate with Apple’s iPhone pricing matrix risked losing their partnership with the Cupertino-based company. Notably, the investigation found no evidence of price fixing with respect to the iPhone 7. Apple hasn’t yet issued a statement on the ruling but the company reportedly has three months to file a formal defense on the matter. If Apple’s appeal falls flat, the company may be subject to fines equal to 15% of iPhone sales in the country. As a final point, it’s worth noting that Apple cooperated with the FAS investigation and has reportedly enacted new guidelines to prevent the alleged price fixing behavior from happening again in the future.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Handy Abovergleich The iPhone you want probably won’t launch in September Chris Smith @chris_writes March 14th, 2017 at 8:00 PM Share Tweet The iPhone 8 will be unlike any iPhone Apple made to date when it comes to design and features. It’ll have a large bezel-free display, no home button, a fingerprint sensor embedded in the screen, and wireless charging. But there are also other differences you won’t appreciate. The entry price for the iPhone 8 will be a lot higher than what a new iPhone usually costs, and the handset might not be available in stores in mid- to late September, as we all expect. Don't Miss: Google is trying really hard to make a smart jacket you won’t totally hate A new report from Digitimes indicates that TPK Holding will supply new thin film-based touch sensors for the AMOLED iPhone. There’s nothing exciting about this particular type of news, as new devices often need new specialized components to handle some task. In this case, the touch sensors are required to enable 3D Touch on the upcoming iPhone, and it’s unsurprising to hear that Apple has been developing new 3D Touch tech for the upcoming iPhone. However, the report says the component is 60% more expensive than the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch sensors. The price went up from $9 (iPhone 7) to $15 (iPhone 8). This is indirect proof that seems to further cement the idea that the iPhone 8 will be more expensive to manufacture. With Apple likely interested in maintaining its margins, the extra costs will likely be passed to the consumer. The component is more expensive because “3D Touch modules for use in the new iPhone equipped with AMOLED panels involves a more complicated manufacturing process and adoption of thin film-based touch sensors.” The report also notes that TPK will begin supplying the film-based touch sensors in the fourth quarter of 2017, a detail that seems to suggest Apple might not be able to launch the iPhone 8 in September. At least two other reports said that certain iPhone 8 components might force Apple to delay the production start for the iPhone 8, including the new ultrasound-based Touch ID fingerprint sensor that’s going to be built into the display and an advanced 3D camera system that might be used for augmented reality and facial recognition features. It’s likely these sophisticated components will also be rather expensive to make, which would further explain why Apple will increase the starting price for the handset.

Indeed, some designers, when putting together iOS 11 mockups, seem to focus on cobbling together fantastical features without ever stopping to contemplate whether or not their designs are practical or even doable. Imagining futuristic iOS 11 features can certainly be fun and entertaining, but sometimes we’ve got to take a step back and focus on iOS features Apple might actually implement. Don't Miss: Inside source confirms Galaxy S8 release date for at least one major market Stepping up to the plate in this regard, Matt Birchler of Birchtree recently put together an interesting list of iOS 11 lockscreen ideas that not only seem doable, but might actually be extremely useful. As a quick example, Birchler envisions a scenario where Apple might put weather information onto the top corner of the lock screen. Birchler reasons that many people turn on their phones to get a quick weather update so putting that information in plan view would be extremely efficient. Now I’m not sure people check their weather that often during the day, but the mockup below illustrates just one way in which Apple could take advantage of the mostly empty real estate on the iOS lock screen. Another intriguing idea Birchler raises is threading Messages notifications on the lock screen. I’m not sure Apple will go down this route, but Birchler’s idea could easily help clean up some notification clutter on the lock screen. Some other ideas Birchler puts forward include a smart notification system and the ability to add third-party apps to the lock screen itself, an intriguing idea to say the least. With Apple set to unveil iOS 11 in just about three months, we curiously still haven’t heard much about what type of features Apple’s next-gen mobile OS will bring to the table, save for a few rumblings about Dark Mode, enhanced Siri support, group FaceTime chat functionality and few other minor tweaks. The following iOS 11 concept video, this one from designer Jacek Zieba, encapsulates a few of these ideas.

They each possessed, in his view, the spark and talent of Akio Morita and Masaru Ibuka, the founders of Sony itself. Shortly afterwards, in 2011, Hasegawa, who was in the team developing the PlayStation games console, opted to join the tiny start-up that later became Preferred Networks. Sony was languishing under heavy losses from its once-mighty consumer electronics products and Hasegawa had the opportunity to move on. “Instead of rebuilding Sony, I felt it was faster to build a second Sony,” he says. In a business culture where many people regard their employer as one for life, it was a bold career move. Few outside the computer programming world knew about Toru Nishikawa and Daisuke Okanohara, Preferred’s founders. The two had met at the University of Tokyo and excelled at writing software for data and image analysis — but they were programmers and knew little about running a business. “We were engineers, so we knew what products we wanted to make but didn’t know how to sell them,” Nishikawa recalls of the early days of the business. “Money was the biggest problem for us in the beginning.” Hasegawa’s decision to quit Sony proved to be a shrewd one. He went on to become Preferred’s chief operating officer. Nishikawa and Okanohara’s company focuses on a new field in artificial intelligence (AI) called deep learning. The technique is modelled on how the human brain works and has led to groundbreaking advances in computers’ language understanding and image recognition. What sets this Tokyo-based business apart is its distinctive approach to applying deep learning to the internet of things (IoT). Instead of rebuilding Sony, I felt it was faster to build a second Sony Junichi Hasegawa Preferred rapidly became one of the country’s most high-profile start-ups after attracting $20m in funds from big Japanese groups, including carmaker Toyota, communications group NTT and robots specialist Fanuc. Toyota put the company’s value at $300m at the end of 2015 when it formed its tie-up with Preferred in AI and self-driving technology. Nishikawa, now Preferred’s chief executive, knew that a 60-employee operation could not compete with the likes of Google, Facebook and Amazon which can call on huge troves of data to train their systems — for example, to understand language. Instead, Preferred has focused on collecting data generated by big manufacturers’ products such as cars and industrial robots. This makes Toyota, the world’s second-largest carmaker, and Fanuc, whose distinctive yellow robots operate in factories worldwide — including those of General Motors, Volkswagen and Tesla — natural partners for Preferred. The key, the company’s executives argue, is to form a partnership with the global industry leader in any particular field. This plays to Japanese strengths. If Silicon Valley is the leader in software, Japan remains at the forefront of manufacturing, producing key electronics components and robotic tools used in the making of global bestsellers such as Apple’s iPhone. “Deep learning has just started to gather speed and worldwide efforts to apply that technology to IoT have just begun,” Nishikawa says. “If we could combine them with areas where Japan is way ahead, I thought we had a chance to win.” For Nishikawa, it was a visit in spring 2015 to Fanuc’s factory, nestled in a forest at the foot of Mount Fuji, that convinced him that manufacturing would be the core area in which to apply Preferred Networks’ expertise in deep learning. Fanuc’s robots are built around the clock by armies of other robots. The machines doing the manufacturing are overseen by fewer than five people on standby for maintenance and are monitored remotely by a handful of others. “What I witnessed was robots making other robots without human intervention,” Nishikawa says. “If you keep the robots operating, data can be collected infinitely.” Despite the factory being so advanced, however, he notes that “AI technology was not used anywhere and I felt there was a big opportunity here”. Soon after Nishikawa’s visit to its factory, Fanuc took a 6 per cent stake in Preferred for $7.9m. Then, in 2016, Fanuc announced that it had teamed up with Preferred, California-based IT multinational Cisco and US factory automation systems maker Rockwell Automation to offer a new service connecting its robots to make them more intelligent. After initial doubts Daisuke Okanohara (left) and Toru Nishikawa were convinced they should base their whole business on deep learning The service uses another core feature of Preferred’s technology — edge-heavy computing — which the company hopes will give it a competitive lead over AI rivals. Edge-heavy computing allows data to be processed closer to where the data are coming from instead of storing everything in the cloud, which has drawbacks in terms of speed and security. In Fanuc’s case, the system envisions placing the data on a device that can be installed at factories and connected to existing equipment and even robots made by rivals. By eliminating the need to transfer massive quantities of information to remote data centres, it also makes it easier to determine which data are relevant and which information should be shared with other robots. The system’s users will eventually be able to download applications that match their factory needs — in a similar fashion to accessing an app store on a smartphone. By applying Preferred’s AI technology, the robots will learn to share and analyse data, and collaborate to detect glitches that might interrupt production. Nishikawa forecasts that within two or three years robots will have learnt to collaborate with each other, but there will continue to be tasks that humans are more suited to or can do more cheaply than expensive sophisticated robots. For example, to pick up things that are scattered about randomly, a robotic hand would need to be installed with a significant number of expensive sensors, whereas humans use their natural instinct to instantly find the fastest way to do the job. “There will be a greater distinction between what the machines are good at and what humans are good at, so the important thing is to find how they can collaborate,” Nishikawa says. “I believe the key to [that] will be the ability of robots to understand human words.” Developing deep learning technologies and new software will require substantial investment, especially as the company seeks to expand its application beyond manufacturing and robots to biotechnology. Nishikawa says he is not worried for the time being about the resources this will require. Preferred continues to receive a wide range of investment offers from carmakers and robot manufacturers around the world, allowing it to be selective about business partners. The company does not want to cede management control and has rejected takeover offers in the past, although executives have not yet laid out any plans to list its shares. “We joined this company because it’s fun to watch what kind of a new future these two [Nishikawa and Okanohara] will create,” says Hasegawa. “Nishikawa thinks of crazy ideas and aims for bizarre things because he is not restrained by past experience,” he adds. “It will be dull for everyone if the company is controlled by our investors.” Preferred’s employees, who are still mostly in their 20s or 30s, carry an air of confidence. But when Nishikawa and Okanohara were thinking of pivoting their entire business on deep learning, the industry was just waking up to the technology’s potential and both were unsure they were making the right decision. The man they turned to in 2011 was Ken Kutaragi, now 66, the former head of Sony Computer Entertainment and best known as “the father of PlayStation”. The key to collaboration will be robots’ ability to understand human words Toru Nishikawa “When I asked them what they wanted to do, they said they had several ideas but they had not set their minds,” recalls Kutaragi, who set up his own technology start-up after leaving Sony in 2007. “So I told them that you have to do something that would change the world. You have to be a gambler and be ambitious if you want to [build] your own business.” Six years on, Preferred’s two founders are no longer in doubt about where the pillar of their business should be. Their ambitions have grown: they want to create a technology in computing that society feels it cannot live without — just like innovations from Microsoft, Apple and Google. The future of Preferred Networks is in many ways a test case for Japan’s generally lacklustre start-up scene. Graduates still tend to take the safer option of joining big conglomerates, rather than participating in new businesses. Nishikawa feels the challenge of attracting and keeping the people it wants could be the most serious risk Preferred faces. “In order to fight with the strong global players in deep learning and IT, we need to have a strong team,” he says. “The biggest threat for us is losing our talent.” Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 March 2017 by Military News IDC Has Good News for Facebook, Bad News for Apple There is a reasonable chance that we are on the brink of a new computing evolution with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). While similar, there are some fundamental differences between VR and AR. VR completely immerses the user in a virtual world, while AR acts as an overlay to the real world. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) made a massive $2 billion bet on the former with its acquisition of Oculus VR, while Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) firmly believes that the latter has more transformative potential for mainstream consumers. Market researcher IDC has just released estimates on the future of AR and VR over the next five years, and the forecasts look decidedly skewed in the social network’s favor. VR is about to take off IDC sees to combined VR/AR market growing nearly tenfold from 2016 to 2021, to 99.4 million units by the end of that time frame. There were roughly 10.1 million units shipped in 2016, according to IDC. Last year was a milestone year for the market, since that was when Oculus officially launched alongside other VR/AR headset products. In the years ahead, expanding content choices, new headset products, and progressively lower prices should spur demand as the ecosystem grows. To that last point, Facebook just reduced the combined price of Oculus Rift and Touch by $200 earlier this month, which now costs about $600 (not including a PC to power the setup). Oculus Rift and Touch, now $200 less. Image source: Oculus. IDC research manager Ramon Llamas also noted that while consumer demand was driven by tech enthusiasts (mostly gamers), there are also emerging use cases within the enterprise. VR and AR are seen as possible ways to improve worker productivity. That means companies looking to jump in to the VR/AR market will have numerous potential strategies to address the market’s different needs. The consumer side of the market is expected to remain dominant, at least according to IDC’s predictions. Market Segment 2016 Shipments (Actual) 2021 Shipments (Forecast) Commercial 2 million 38.3 million Consumer 8.1 million 61.1 million Total 10.1 million 99.4 million Data source: IDC. Then we get to the bad news for Apple: AR is expected to comprise a much smaller portion of the market than VR, at least in terms of unit volumes. Cue cheers from Mark Zuckerberg. That’s not to say it’s all bad news for Apple. There is a silver lining, and a rather important one at that. AR could be a bigger moneymaker AR may be smaller in terms of unit volumes, but IDC actually expects the revenue opportunities associated with AR to be greater in the long term. VR systems currently cost anywhere from $100 to $1,000, but the low-end experiences may end up disappointing users that try out the technology. AR headsets are more sophisticated in other ways and most will end up costing „well over” $1,000. That will make AR less accessible in the beginning, and as such, mainstream AR adoption appears to be farther out than VR adoption, which is already slowly starting to tick up. Given Apple CEO Tim Cook’s comments about the potential of AR, there should be little doubt that the Mac maker has something in its pipeline for AR. What’s far less clear is when the company will announce or unveil an AR device. Until then, Facebook will continue to lead the way in VR. 10 stocks we like better than Facebook When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Narendra Modi government is planning the next big round of foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalisation, which could have significant implications for several sectors, including print media and retail. Economic ministries are learnt to be working on a proposal to step up the FDI limit in print news media to 49 per cent, from the current cap of 26 per cent. Also, there are plans to allow single-brand retail companies with up to 100 per cent FDI to go through the automatic clearance route. A draft Cabinet note on phasing out the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) is already in the making and could be ready for approval by the Union Cabinet by the end of April. FDI rules could be eased subsequently in some of the sectors. "Successive governments have done all they can in raising FDI limits across sectors. Further liberalisation can now happen through easing the rules governing approval routes," said a senior government official, aware of the inter-ministerial deliberations. Print news media could be an exception where talks are on to relax the level of FDI, the official said. The person added that while the bureaucracy has no issues with the proposal to raise sectoral cap to 49 per cent from the existing 26 per cent in print media, it could face political hurdles. The proposal will be pursued further, the official said. For single-brand retail, while 100 per cent FDI is allowed, 49 per cent is through automatic route and beyond that is FIPB approval route. A second official said a proposal to allow 100 per cent FDI through the automatic route, provided the domestic sourcing norms are met, will be taken up soon. If such a proposal is accepted by the government, it could mean companies like Apple and Zara can sell in India through wholly-owned subsidiaries, without going through the clearance bottlenecks. Business Standard has also learnt the draft cabinet note for bringing the curtain down on FIPB states FDI proposals which require approval will be given by either sectoral regulators or line ministries. FIPB will not be replaced by another body, officials said. In his 2017-18 Budget, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced the dismantling of FIPB. "In the meantime, further liberalisation of FDI policy is under consideration and necessary announcements will be made in due course," he had said. The draft Cabinet note has been circulated by the finance ministry to other departments for comments. While initially there was a proposal to let the licensing bodies approve new investments, stakeholders from domestic industry had complained of the long time required by such bodies to provide even licences. Hence these bodies could likely be ruled out. FIPB had the final say in approving FDI proposals in the country till now, other than proposals exceeding Rs 5,000 crore which are cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs. Sectors where industry players have asked for further easing of rules include aviation, defence and pharmaceuticals. The government had allowed up to 100 per cent FDI in defence through the approval route, over the 49 per cent investments currently open under the automatic route. For brownfield projects in the pharmaceutical sector, automatic approval had been extended to 74 per cent. These are likely to be unchanged. 1SHARES © 2017 Business Standard     Stay Updated with Us Top 10 Stories Last Week Last Month Last Year Sunil Raina named Lava CMO Marketing Meet Keegan Pinto, copywriter-cum-musician...

The 35-year-old mother of three sat in the backseat talking on her phone as she and two Secret Service agents drove to the Mayflower Hotel.. Once there Ivanka, attended a roundtable discussion with Latina small business owners organized by the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. In a photo from the event released by the USHCC, a beaming and animated Ivanka can be seen talking to the table of 13 Latinas.  She later rewteeted that photo on her own Twitter account, which read: 'USHCC was delighted to host @IvankaTrump for a roundtable discussion w/ Hispanic women biz owners today in Washington.' Scroll down for video  Power players: Ivanka Trump attended a roundtable event organized by the US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Thursday morning in Washington DC (center talking with group) Off they go: Earlier that morning Ivanka was photographed in her SUV with two Secret Service agents (above)  Small operation: A second SUV followed the one carrying Ivanka and her agents  Back to mommy duty: Ivanka on Thursday night posted a sweet snap of a mischievous-looking Joseph at the dinner table One of the women in attendance, Lili Gil Valletta, excitedly shared details about the 'inspiring' meeting on Facebook later in the day, saying it was an 'honor' to be at the table. 'This is a historic first, making it her first meeting with Latinx entrepreneurs,' wrote Valletta, who is the co-founder of the marketing and strategy agency XL Alliance.  'We talked about our businesses, the challenges we face as women and left the door open to jointly collaborate to advance opportunities for all women.' The fun did not end there either for Valletta, who immigrated to the US from Colombia as a teenager, who later shared a video of herself bowling in the White House with Jennifer Korn. Korn was recently appointed a special assistant to President Trump and deputy director for the Office of Public Liason.

Share this article Share 142 shares Also at the table and weighing in was Angelica Garcia Davila, the CEO and owner of AIM Family of Companies. She was a bit short with her commentary however, saying: 'Blessed!!! Will share more later! Lots going on here.' There was also one man at the table with Ivanka and the other women, Javier Palomarez, who can be seen sitting directly across from the First Daughter. Palomarez is the president and CEO of the USHCC, and earlier this year accepted a position as an informal adviser to the Trump administration. It was a shocking appointment given that Palomarez was one of President Trump's biggest adversaries throughout his campaign, referring to him as a 'buffoon' and declaring him 'unfit' to be in office. Big night: The first daughter rushed home to DC overnight after attended the Broadway opening of 'Come From Away' with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (above) Man in charge: The USHCC is headed by Javier Palomarez (above with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday), a former adversary of President Trump who in January became an informal adviser to the administration He also played a big part in the USHCC decision to back Governor John Kasich of Ohio in the Republican primary and later Hillary Clinton in the general election.  Those wounds seemed to have healed between the two men, and after the roundtable Palomarez released a statement raving about the guest-of-honor that day. 'Throughout our ongoing conversations, Ivanka has made it apparent that she cares about empowering American women, particularly those in the entrepreneurial community,' said Palomarez. 'I was happy to convene a group of Hispanic women small-business owners and provide the opportunity for a substantive dialogue on a range of issues. We discussed the challenges and notable advances Latinas are making by growing their enterprises and driving job creation in diverse sectors and communities nationwide.' He then closed out by stating: 'We were delighted by her strong command of the issues facing women in small business, and her willingness to engage first-hand with the most dynamic sector of our business community.' The USHCC has been hosting their annual legislative summit all this week in the nation's capital, which featured appearances from White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Senator Ted Cruz to name just a few. Canadian couple; Prime Minister Trudeau was also accompanied by his wife Sophie Gregoire (above) Friendly faces: Ivanka brought along US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (left), who came with her husband Michael and son Nalin (right) Trump team: Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner (above with Steve Bannon in DC late Wednesday) was in Nashville with President Trump on Wednesday  Her commitment to attend the early morning roundtable explains why Ivanka left New York City immediately after attending opening night of the new Broadway musical 'Come From Away' with her good friend, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. With husband Jared Kushner on Donald duty down in Nashville, Ivanka was free to enjoy an evening with the global leader she was caught casting a dreamy look while the two attended a women in business discussion at the White House. Prime Minister Trudeau was also accompanied by his wife Sophie Gregoire, while Ivanka brought along US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who came with her husband Michael and son Nalin. The play tells the true story of the 6,579 airline passengers who in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks wound up in Gander, Newfoundland when the US closed off all airspace over the country, forcing 38 flights to land at the seldom used airfield. Soon after, residents of the town opened their doors to those left stranded, giving them places to eat and sleep until they could return to the United States. One of the central character's in the play is a Muslim, who at one point is strip searched and spends much of the action arousing unwarranted suspicion in some of the other characters before finding acceptance. That Muslim character's story played out for the audience just a few hours after a judge in Hawaii blocked President Trump's revised travel ban, which would have gone into effect at midnight.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 142 shares Most watched News videos Terrifying video of 737 pilot fighting strong winds to land airliner No handshake for Merkel!

By Myles Tanzer Berlin 🇩🇪 A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 9, 2017 at 4:38pm PST According to a report from Pitchfork, Drake's playlist project More Life, which is scheduled for a release this Saturday, seems like it will be simultaneously released on all streaming platforms after its premiere on Apple's Beats 1 Radio. This would be a departure from Drake's last two projects, What A Time To Be Alive and Views, which both had periods of exclusivity on Apple's platform. Sources close to Amazon told The FADER, "If there is a Drake album, we will have it the day it’s released." A rep from Amazon Music also told Pitchfork that the release would be up on their service as soon as it hits Apple Music. Apple issued a statement to The FADER: "Tune into Apple Music's Beats 1 this weekend for an epic and legendary next episode of Drake's OVOSOUND radio." A representative for Spotify said, "We currently have no information to share." Reps for TIDAL, and Drake did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The FADER.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) faq, Google Google Data Center FAQ by Data Center Knowledge  on March 16, 2017 1 comment Tweet Google is the largest, most-used search engine in the world, with a global market share that has held steady at about 90 percent since Google Search launched in 1997 as Backrub. In 2017, Google became the most valuable brand in the world, topping Apple, according to the Brand Finance Global 500 report. Google’s position is due mainly to its core business as a search engine and its ability to transform users into payers via advertising. About 32 percent of Google visitors come from the US, where the company holds 63.9 percent of the search engine market, according to statista.com. Google had 247 million unique US users in November 2015. Globally, it boasts 1.5 billion search engine users and more than 1 billion users of Gmail. Google data centers process an average of 40 million searches per second, resulting in 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year, Internet Live Stats reports. That’s up from 795.2 million searcher per year in 1999, one year after Google was launched.

In a reorganization in October 2015, Google became a subsidiary of a new company it created called Alphabet. Since then, several projects have been canceled or scaled back, including the halt of further rollout of Google Fiber. Following the reorg, however, Google has placed a lot of focus (and dedicated a lot of resources) to selling cloud services to enterprises, going head-to-head against the market giant Amazon Web Services and the second-largest player in the space, Microsoft Azure. That has meant a major expansion of Google data centers specifically to support those cloud services. At the Google Cloud Next conference in San Francisco in March 2017, the company’s execs revealed that it spent nearly $30 billion on data centers over the preceding three years. While the company already has what is probably the world’s largest cloud, it was not built to support enterprise cloud services. To do that, the company needs to have data centers in more locations, and that’s what it has been doing, adding new locations to support cloud services and adding cloud data center capacity wherever it makes sense in existing locations. The largest of several murals illustrator Fuchsia MacAree painted on the walls of Google’s data center in Dublin (Photo: Google) Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about Google data centers and our best stab at answering them: Where are Google Data Centers Located? Google lists eight data center locations in the U.S., one in South America, four in Europe and two in Asia. Its cloud sites, however, are expanding, and Google’s cloud map shows many points of presence worldwide. The company also has many caching sites in colocation facilities throughout the world, whose locations it does not share. This far-flung network is necessary not only to support operations than run 24/7, but to meet specific regulations (like the EU’s privacy regulations) of certain regions and to ensure business continuity in the face of risks like natural disasters. Google data centers in the Dalles, Oregon, 2006 (Photo by Craig Mitchelldyer/Getty Images) In the works as of March 2017, are Google data centers for cloud services in California, Canada, The Netherlands, Northern Virginia, São Paulo, London, Finland, Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney. Here are the data center sites listed by Google: North America: Berkeley County, South Carolina Council Bluffs, Iowa Douglas County, Georgia Jackson County, Alabama Lenoir, North Carolina Mayes County, Oklahoma Montgomery County, Tennessee The Dalles, Oregon South America Quilicura, Chile Asia Changhua County, Taiwan Singapore Europe Dublin, Ireland Eemshaven, Netherlands Hamina, Finland St Ghislain, Belgium How Big are Google Data Centers? A paper presented during the IEEE 802.3bs Task Force in May 2014 estimates the size of five of Google’s US facilities as: Pryor Creek (Mayes County), Oklahoma , 980,000 square feet Lenoir, North Carolina, 337,000 square feet The Dalles, Oregon, 200,000 square feet (before the 2016, 164,000 square foot expansion) Council Bluff, Iowa, 200,000 square feet Berkely County, South Carolina, 200,000 square feet. Many of these sites have multiple data center buildings, as Google prefers to build additional structures as sites expand rather than containing operations in a single massive building. Google itself doesn’t disclose the size of its data centers. Instead, it mentions the cost of the sites or number of employees. Sometimes, facility size slips out. For example, the announcement about the opening of The Dalles in Oregon said the initial building was 164,000 square feet. The size of subsequent expansions, however, has been kept tightly under wraps. Reports discussing Google’s new data center in Emeshaven, Netherlands, which opened December 2016, didn’t mention size. Instead, they said the company has contracted for the entire 62 Megawatt output of a nearby windfarm and ran 9,941 miles of computer cable within the facility. The data center employs 150 people. How Many Servers Does Google Have? There’s no official data on how many servers there are in Google data centers, but Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. This number, of course, is always changing as the company expands capacity and refreshes its hardware.   1 | 2 | 3 Previous Article Google Opens a New Front in Cloud Price Wars Next Article Everything You Wanted to Know about Google Data Centers Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

This week, the Seattle-based electronic and cloud computing company updated its official iOS app to add support for its AI assistant.  On Thursday, VentureBeat learned that Amazon is making its Alexa assistant available to iPhone users starting this week until the following week. This means when iPhone users receive an update for their Amazon app, they’ll be getting not just certain improvements for the app’s features, but also the intelligent assistant Alexa that boasts of over 10,000 skills.  With the addition of Alexa into the Amazon iOS app, users will now see a microphone icon on the far right of the search box. This icon is dedicated to Alexa, so users have to press it to summon the AI assistant. Alexa can now do the shopping and the tracking of orders for iPhone users. Not only that, Alexa can also give weather updates, play music and even tell a joke.  The update would also lead to a tighter competition between Alexa and Siri, for both have the ability to answer queries. It’s also good to note that while Siri can control HomeKit, Amazon’s AI has Alexa Skills to control smart home functions and other devices, as per Apple Insider.  The only disadvantage of using Alexa is the fact that it can only be used while running the Amazon app. On the other hand, Siri has systemwide integration on the iPhone and it also has the always-listening “Hey Siri” feature that can be activated even when the handset is locked. Therefore, choosing one over the other all comes down to personal preference.  Amazon is rolling out the new update for its app starting this Thursday, and the rollout is expected to be fully realized by next week, according to MacRumors. Sadly, the Alexa-focused update does not come with the Door Lock API, making it impossible for users to lock and unlock doors with smart locks using the Amazon app just yet.  Amazon’s Alexa is now part of its iOS app. Photo: Reuters/Rick Wilking Related Stories Apple Patents AirPods With Biometric Sensors Apple Reportedly Announcing 9.7-inch iPad Pro 2 Next Week Samsung Suppliers Doubt Apple’s iPhone Display-Embedded Touch ID Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Nicola Eccleson, 36, told them she could get iPhones, iPads and iPods for as little as £100 as a perk of her job. 2 Nicola Eccleson pocketed cash without handing over the goods The fraudster did hand over some gizmos but soon began pocketing cash without delivering the goods. Paisley Sheriff Court heard 13 victims were duped into paying between £1,400 and £40,000. And Eccleson, of Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, adm­itted pulling in a total of £237,885 bet­ween August 2012 and August 2013. Prosecutor Scot Dignan said: “The accused was sending text messages or emails indicating she was able to get Apple products at discounted rates on a scheme run by her employers, often referred to as a ‘friends and family’ scheme.” MOST READ IN NEWS MCGILL'S DRIVER HORROR Cops hunting two Rangers fans who brutally slashed McGill's driver's face on Old Firm day in horror move against Easdale brothers MADDIE FURY Kate and Gerry McCann blast 'ignorant' Marco Pierre White Jnr for sick Twitter rant about Maddie KILLER'S THREAT Child killer Jordan McCready threatens to make anyone who crosses him his second victim in Facebook post from prison 'LET HIM STAY' Still Game's Greg Hempill and Outlander hunk Sam Heughan back US actor's via appeal to stay in Scotland 'I'LL RAPE UM' Twisted killer who kicked a 13-year-old Scots schoolboy to death 'threatened to rape baby' WINDOW DRESSER Naked man spotted hiding under a window 'after his lover's partner returned home and he was forced to flee' Flash to pay feud Sex shame priest Roddy MacNeil ordered to pay brother-in-law £140k following feud over family chippy in South Uist GARRY'S CAR SALES PITCH Shamed ex-Hibs and Scotland star Garry O'Connor flogs used motors on Facebook ‘BET YOU'RE A SINGLE MUM ON BENEFITS' Teen cleaner horrified when she replied to lawyer's job ad before he demanded pics and bombarded her with abuse ‘THEY WERE GLUED TO HER’ Scots backpacker Danielle McLaughlin was ‘surrounded’ by Indian men at party hours before she was raped and murdered DOUNE WITH THE AMATEURS Rape shame footie ace David Goodwillie makes shock playing return with Doune Castle Amateurs Davidson shock new favourite Ruth Davidson is shock favourite to be next Scottish First Minister But the court was told the swindle came crashing down when Thomas McEntegart — boss at Glasgow firm TLT Solicitors — received a call asking about the cut-price deals.

But replacing the battery in many new phones can be costly. Apple, for example, charges $79 if your iPhone isn’t covered under warranty or AppleCare+. By rethinking how you charge and store your device, you can prolong battery life and save money. See Also: 20 Amazing Ways Your Daily Life Will Be Different in 2030 For starters, extreme temperatures, especially heat, are bad for the battery. (Apple recommends protecting your phone from temperatures higher than 95 degrees.) Especially when your phone is fully charged, the hotter it is, the worse it is for the battery. “Treat it like your pet,” says Anne Co, a chemistry professor at Ohio State University. Don’t leave your phone in your car on hot or cold days, or exposed to the scorching sun at the beach. Keep your eye on the little indicator that shows how much battery capacity is left. Draining the battery to zero stresses it; better to juice up your device before it hits a 30% to 40% charge. BatteryUniversity.com, an educational website, estimates that a battery that runs down completely before recharging will last for 300 to 500 charge cycles, whereas regular half-charges will amp up the battery to 1,200 to 1,500 cycles. Leaving your phone plugged in overnight isn’t a huge deal because the charger typically turns off once the battery charges completely. But to squeeze maximum life out of the battery, unplug your phone before it hits 100%. And before turning off your phone for long periods, such as for an overseas trip, run the battery down to a half-charge.
