The bad news is that there's no word on when it's coming out. The TechCrunch report alleged to have talked to a spokesperson from Apple who claimed that the company needs "a little more time" to perfect the Apple AirPods before the release date.  "The early response to AirPods has been incredible," the alleged spokesperson said. "We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers." Apple only created the hype when it unveiled the AirPods during the launch of the iPhone 7 on Sept. 7. It was billed to be the solution to the company's vision to become wireless. Apple ditched the 3.5mm audio jack on the smart phone and instead installed a Lightning connector for charging, as well as Bluetooth headphones. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

WIRED had some funny descriptions on the earphone such as similar to "wearing a toothbrush in your ear," or similar to an earbud "melting down the side of your face," or a tiny hair dryer. But Apple diehards are willing to give the AirPods the benefit of the doubt. That's because there's another feature of the Apple AirPods that's unlike any other: it can also synch with the Apple Watch or the iMac as long as they are within range. When the Apple AirPods release date will be announced, buyers can order it for a price of $159.

Headline No. 1 is that instead of that function-key row above the keyboard, it has a thin, touch-sensitive screen, which displays useful buttons that change as you switch from program to program. View photos The MacBook Pro’s touch bar in action.More Headline No. 2 is more troublesome. Apart from a headphone jack, the laptop has no jacks you’d recognize. No USB jacks. No video-output jack (DVI, VGA, or HDMI). No SD card slot. Not even the magnetic MagSafe power jack that Apple itself invented! The new laptop has only USB-C jacks. Two or four of them. (Apple calls them Thunderbolt-3, but for most people’s purposes, they’re USB Type C.) The new MacBook Pro has four USB-C ports. (The base model has only two.)More In the short term, this means that you’ll need a lot of adapters. No existing flash drive, camera, monitor, inkjet printer, Apple power cord, or USB hard drive will connect without an adapter. Incredibly, even the iPhone’s own Lightning cable won’t connect without an adapter! (Which costs $25.) View photos You’re going to need a lot of adapters.More Apple says: Welcome to the future. I say: Well, if USB-C is the future, then you may as well get to know it. A crash course in USB-C If Apple had to use only one jack on its new laptops, at least it picked a winner. USB-C is fantastic. View photos Apple laptops have had the same power connector for at least two–time to change!More In the big picture, USB-C is technology that will save us time, money, and frustration. It’s a breakthrough that will even keep tons of e-waste out of the landfills. This single, tiny connector can carry power, video, audio, and data—simultaneously. It can, in other words, replace a laptop’s power cord, USB jacks, video output jack, and headphone jack. (On the new MacBook Pros, for example, you can plug the power cord into any of the four USB-C jacks.) Meet USB-C: The Wonder Jack.More And a USB-C cable is identical top and bottom, so you can’t insert it the wrong way. (Woohoo!) It’s identical end for end, too, so it doesn’t matter which end you grab first. It feels more secure than USB when you insert it; you get a physical click instead of just relying on friction to hold it. USB-C can charge your gadget faster and transfer data faster than what’s come before, too. It’s tiny—about the size as micro USB—so the same cable can charge your phone and tablet and laptop. And the brand doesn’t matter. My Samsung USB-C cable can charge your MacBook Pro and his Surface tablet. Can you imagine? You’re witnessing the dawn of the universal charging cord. We can all dump out our drawers full of ugly, mismatched, proprietary charging bricks, long since separated from their original devices, and recycle it all. Now we’ll need only one kind of cable for everything. The specifications for USB-C were finalized late in 2014. That’s astonishing for two reasons: First, it was dreamed up by engineers and executives from every major electronics company, working side-by-side for three years—even blood rivals like Apple and Google (GOOG). Second, you can already buy phones, tablets, and laptops that come with USB-C jacks—from Google, Microsoft (MSFT), Nokia, and others. (Apple’s strange, expensive, slow 12-inch MacBook was the first to have a USB-C jack. One.) Already, you’ll find USB-C on all of Google’s phones, tablets, and laptops; Microsoft’s laptops; the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (kaboom); the Motorola Z series; the OnePlus 2 phone; the Asus ZenPad 8; the Nokia N1; and so on. Read More The MacBook Pro does have a headphone jack—but USB-C is perfectly capable of conducting audio, too. (For my exclusive interview with the leaders of the team that created USB Type C, click here.) What it all means So USB-C has fantastic promise. Eventually, the payoff will be gigantic, convenient, and universal. But clearly, the world isn’t ready to go all USB-C yet. Change is annoying. We’re in for a couple of years of transition and fumbling with adapters that accommodate all our old USB gear: flash drives, hard drives, scanners, printers, cameras, and so on. So why did Apple switch to USB-C so suddenly, and with such total commitment? Does it just want to make us livid? The obvious answer is size and weight. Inside a laptop, there’s a block of metal that has to receive every kind of connector, and some of them prevented the MacBook from getting thinner. It’s the age-old Apple story: Toss the old, embrace the new, and drag the world along with it. USB-C is a fantastic, genius, intelligently designed universal jack. For the sake of Apple fans, let’s just hope the world makes the switch as soon as possible.   David Pogue, tech columnist for Yahoo Finance, welcomes non-toxic comments in the Comments below.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Mother of missing Apple Valley woman clings to hope and prays for closure Sunday Oct 30, 2016 at 12:01 AM Oct 30, 2016 at 4:30 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — On the one-year anniversary of Christina Bastian’s disappearance, her family still clings to the hope that she’s safe and will come home. Cheryl Denny said her 35-year-old daughter Christina was last seen by family and friends on Halloween night 2015. Denny told the Daily Press she’s “praying for closure” and hopes that a reunion with her oldest daughter will be part of that answer. “We’re still hoping that Christina comes walking through the doors or that we’ll find where she’s living,” said Denny, pastor of Apple Valley Faith Center on Bear Valley Road. “I just want to know whether she’s on this earth or living in Heaven with Jesus." With signs posted outside inviting the public to this year’s Harvest Party at the church on Halloween, Denny sat at her desk and explained how the disappearance of her daughter has taken a physical and emotional toll on her and her family. “My faith in Jesus Christ is the only thing that keeps me together,” Denny said. “I have my moments when my mind just goes blank and I have to ask God to fill in the blanks. I don’t know how people who don’t have Jesus make it.” Denny said during last year’s Harvest Party on Oct. 31, Bastian was overheard talking with her brother-in-law, Chris, asking him to what lengths her loved ones would go to find her if she just disappeared. “Christina called me from Chandler, Arizona on Halloween morning saying she didn’t know where she was at,” Denny said. “That night, she was at the church and that is the last time I saw her.” Denny said her daughter, who suffers from bipolar disorder and was exhibiting erratic behavior before she went missing last year, left a friend’s house early Nov. 1 with a few personal belongings and her dog, Coco, a small white and tan Maltipoo. “Christina’s truck was found abandoned the day after Halloween near Valley View Road in Morongo Valley, over by Highway 62,” Denny said. “About 10 days later, someone found Christina’s backpack and some of her belongings near Central Road and Bear Valley Road in Apple Valley.” Denny said the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department has “gone all out” during several searches, with the agency “even using their cadaver dogs” to search for the former Silverado High School English teacher. “She was mentally stable up until a few months before she disappeared and went off her meds, ” Denny said. “Christina was dealing with a lot of stress — she was in debt from student loans, she was depressed and she was still feeling the loss of her grandmother (Pastor Doris Eddy), who passed away about two years earlier.” Eddy, 85, who pastored the congregation of AVFC for almost 30 years, died of cancer just before Halloween 2013, the Daily Press reported. Susanna Bastian noticed that her sister’s paranoia seemed to increase after her Laguna Road apartment in Apple Valley was broken into, said Denny, who remarked that Christina had removed her phone’s SIM card and smashed her phone just before departing for Arizona. Denny said last summer was last time she was in contact with the Sheriff’s Department, which was investigating a claim made on Facebook by a Middle Eastern individual who said they were “holding Christina hostage.” “After the police got involved, that page was taken down,” Denny said. “It’s amazing how people can take advantage of others who are hurting.” Denny said over the year, she’s received several “sparks of hope” when people said they sighted her daughter in Yucca Valley, Joshua Tree, Oregon and several locations across the country. “One lady said she thought she saw Christina at a casino in Twentynine Palms,” said Denny, whose family handed out fliers as they looked for Christina in Joshua Tree, Yucca Valley and the Twentynine Palms area. “With every lead, every tip and every report we hit a dead end,” Denny said. “The Bible is right when it says that ‘hope deferred makes the heart sick.’” Denny said she’s not sure if the disappearance of Krystie Stuart in March 2015 is connected even though there are many similarities between the two cases. Both girls are devout Christians who suffered from bipolar disorder and went off their medication just before they went missing from Apple Valley, about a mile apart from each other. Krystie Stuart took medication for about two years to deal with depression, bipolar disorder and Asperger’s syndrome, her parents told the Daily Press in an earlier interview. Stuart and Bastian both drove trucks that were eventually found abandoned in two different locations in the middle of the desert, the Daily Press reported. “I need to look at this entire situation from the perspective of eternity,” Denny said. “I know that Jesus has all the answers and I just need to trust in Him with my daughter.” Anyone with information regarding Christina Bastian’s whereabouts is urged to call Detective Alex Naoum of the Apple Valley Sheriff's Station at 760-240-7400. Callers wishing to remain anonymous can call the WeTip Hotline 800-782-7463 or visit www.wetip.com. Denny also asks anyone who sees or encounters Christina Bastian not to approach her as it may “scare her off.” She urges people to contact local authorities or Denny instead.

MARCIO JOSE SANCHEZ by Hannah Elliott Apple has released the newest update to its watch, the Apple Watch Nike+. The new timepiece, in 38mm- at $US369 ($529 in Australia) or 42mm-wide ($US399) models, is the latest innovation in the long line of running-related apparatus that Nike started producing in 2006, when runners could connect iPod playlists to devices embedded in their shoes. "We have been working on this project in some way or another since day one," said Stefan Olander, the head of Nike's Digital Sport division. The Series 2 is notable for its minimal design around a steel grey aluminum case and clean graphics on the small black mirrored face of the watch. It is markedly pared back in look and less complicated to use than other running-oriented watches. The Series 2 is notable for its minimal design around a steel grey aluminum case and clean graphics on the small black mirrored face of the watch. MARK KAUZLARICH "The other devices that are out there are pretty techy and geeky — so we wanted to remove everything that was a distraction and keep it clean, elegant and also let it be a delight to use," Olander said.

This next iteration includes all the same functionality as the Series 1, but adds a twice-as-bright display on the screen, plus extended water resistance to 50 metres and water-lock, which prevents false taps on the screen while washing dishes or swimming. It also has a series of weather updates, messaging, and health-monitoring enhancements along with updated routing maps for swimming and other off-road endeavours. One new program runs through a series of breathing exercises much as the type yogis use during meditation. You use the Nike+ Run Club app to set the watch specifically to compare your weekly mileage against friends who have the same watch or to set alerts that tell you when to run, and how far, to reach fitness goals — the main idea being to give runners a sense of community even if they typically train alone.

MARK LENNIHAN You can even activate little soundbite recordings from Nike's current pet running ambassador Kevin Hart, encouraging you along your run. "One of the things that comes back loud and clear from feedback from our runners is that it's not that easy to stay motivated — a lot of people need a little extra push," Olander said. "Traditional watches are one-way interactions. They don't really communicate with you. But we wanted to make this feel like a running partner." That part is certainly true, as I discovered on a four-mile jog along Manhattan's East River this morning: Apple Watch Nike+ has built-in GPS system that tracks pacing, distance, heart rate and routes even if you don't have your iPhone with you.

MARK KAUZLARICH (The two are synced in a lengthy process — too lengthy in my opinion; it took me 30 minutes — when you first buy the watch.) Apple Watch Nike+ is the fourth version of the Series 2 Apple watch. It follows the Standard, Hermès, and Apple Edition versions that were launched this year, and it is available in four colour combinations involving black or white rubber sport-band style straps and grey aluminum cases, each with Nike trademark "volt" yellow or gray highlights.

It’s not a surprise, especially given Apple’s embrace of the Thunderbolt platform in the past, but a support document from the company released after the event reveals that “only two of the four ports on the 13” MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar support Thunderbolt 3 at full performance,” MacRumors reported. On the right side of the notebook, the document explains, the two Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports have reduced PCI Express bandwidth. As a result, Apple recommends plugging your higher-performance devices into the Thunderbolt 3 ports on the left side of the MacBook. “Late-2016 MacBook Pro models vary slightly in the data speeds they provide to each Thunderbolt 3 port,” the document reads. Macbook Pro (15-inch, Late 2016) delivers full Thunderbolt 3 performance on all four ports. MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) supports Thunderbolt 3 at full performance using the two left-hand ports. The two right-hand ports deliver Thunderbolt 3 functionality, but have reduced PCI Express bandwidth. MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2016, Two Thunderbolt 3 Ports) delivers full Thunderbolt 3 performance on both ports. In addition, the Thunderbolt 3 ports (USB-C) ports on all MacBook Pro models have USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10Gb/s) speeds when they are connected to a USB accessory, according to MacRumors. Related: This 13″ MacBook Pro teardown reveals product details we didn’t hear from Apple And while the Thunderbolt 3 is “the port to rule them all,” plugging multiple chargers into the device will result in the MacBook drawing power from one of the chargers. You can also daisy-chain up to six devices to each Thunderbolt 3 port. Apple also warns that using chargers that exceed 100W have the potential to damage the laptop, and that it would not be as effective to use chargers like the USB-C VGA Multiport Adapter or the USB-C Digital AV Multiport, as slow or delayed charging would result. Unsurprisingly, Apple recommends using its own charger for the MacBook. Also watch: Apple OS X El Capitan – Hands On Please enable Javascript to watch this video

Pingie.com was first to note the removal of the sound from Apple's new 13-inch and 15-inch laptops – both the models featuring Apple's new Touch Bar (as well as the 13-inch version without a Bar) automatically boot when opened or when connected to a power source if the battery is dead, so the sound has apparently been deemed surplus to requirements. The iconic chiming startup sound was originally made to indicate that diagnostic tests have found no hardware or software issues. A similar sound has accompanied almost every Mac boot sequence since 1991 and the most recent F-sharp chord incarnation was first used in the iMac G3. Originally, a C major chord was recorded by Apple engineer Jim Reekes using a Korg keyboard, and what most people hear these days is a pitch-shifted version of the sound made by the Macintosh Quadra family of professional computers, first released in 1991. According to the book The Sonic Boom: How Sound Transforms the Way We Think, Feel, and Buy, Reekes' "earconic" sound came out of a desire to replace the older tritone boot sound heard on earlier Macs. Reekes wanted to use a more meditative sound to indicate the Mac had passed its initial Power On Self Test (POST) checks, a sound he later called a "palate cleanser for the ears". According to Reekes, Apple executives didn't particularly like the sound, but it managed to make the final code that was shipped in all Quadra 700 Macs. The chime was tweaked a few times in subsequent Macs, but allegedly, Steve Jobs himself prevented any further alteration of the sound when he came back to Apple in 1996. The Mac startup sound can also be heard in 2008 Disney-Pixar movie WALL*E. When the titular robot character has reached 100 percent power after positioning his solar array, the booting chime goes off. Apple has updated its support documents to reflect the change. As noted previously, Apple has also removed the backlit Apple logo on new MacBook Pro models. Update: As noted by a MacRumors forum poster, the boot chime can be turned back on and the automatic boot turned off using a few simple Terminal commands.

The reason Attorneys General is correct is because the noun is Attorney and is what is counted, not the General which is an adjective of Attorney. So I believe since Pro MacBook would just as descriptive as MacBook Pro I would lean toward MacBooks Pro being more grammatically accurate, but I would most likely find myself following John F. Braun’s logic of going with what sounds better, “MacBook Pros”. thanks for a great podcast!!! Craig October 31, 2016 at 11:06 EST AM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

(STR/AFP/Getty Images) China is the world’s largest and fastest-growing market for mobile payments, and its most popular service is planning to parlay its success abroad. Alipay, China’s biggest mobile payment service, unveiled several new partnerships to accept payments in the U.S. last week. Alipay is a service of Ant Financial Services, a spin-off of Chinese internet giant Alibaba.com. Its foray into the United States commenced with deals struck with Verifone Holdings and credit card processor First Data Corp. Alipay has aggressively expanded into foreign markets in recent months, signing up local merchants in the U.K., Germany, Thailand, and Australia. Western media has explained the move as a desire to service China’s 150 million tourists who travel abroad each year. Alipay looks to join the ranks of Visa, MasterCard, and China UnionPay as their preferred payment methods. But the company’s ambitions clearly extend beyond Chinese tourists. “We are targeting 2 billion users in the next 10 years,” Alipay’s international president Sabrina Peng recently told Reuters. The company expects 60 percent of its transactions to come from outside of China by then, and that kind of volume can only be achieved by mainstream global adoption. China’s Mobile Wallet Last year, China overtook the United States as the world’s largest mobile payments market by total value spent. China has around 200 million people using their smartphones as wallets, according to eMarketer estimates. That’s an almost 40 percent adoption ratio of mobile payment users to total smartphone users. Together, more than $1 trillion worth of mobile transactions were made in 2015 on mobile, according to iResearch data. Alipay, with 450 million accounts, is the largest mobile payment platform in China with a 68 percent market share. Together with WeChat Pay (Tenpay), operated by rival Tencent Holdings, the two platforms have an 89 percent market share. The most recent entrant into the Chinese market is Apple Inc.’s Apple Pay, which recently signed a deal with China UnionPay in hopes of a quick market capture. Payment via mobile is fairly straightforward. After pushing a “pay” button in the Alipay or WeChat app, the app generates a QR code which can be scanned by merchants and keeps a copy of the digital receipt. NFC (near field communication) compatible hardware also allows making payments without opening the app. Mobile payments—and the broader internet banking market—has always been a two-horse race between Alibaba and Tencent, which operates WeChat, China’s biggest social-networking and instant messaging app. Two years ago, Alibaba and Tencent were locked in bitter competition on multiple fronts, including internet banking, mobile payments, and even taxi services. Their competition in mobile banking intensified during the 2015 lunar new year period when both services used “red envelop” cash promotions and other subsidies to attract new users. Since mid-2015, Tencent has scaled back its competition with Alibaba after a few minor setbacks. The Tencent-backed taxi service Didi was acquired by Alibaba-backed taxi service Kuaidi to form Didi Kuaidi. The company is known today as Didi Chuxing, the largest ride-sharing company in China which recently agreed to acquire Uber’s China business. Tencent’s online bank—WeBank—also got off to a slower start compared to Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial in loan origination activity. Ant is also better funded; its Series B funding round earlier this year pegged the company at a $60 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable startups in the world. Alipay and Ant’s recent wins drove Tencent’s decision earlier this year to eliminate fee subsidies when customers transfer cash from their bank to WeChat, in an effort to stem losses. The action further ceded market share to Alipay.  No Quick Global Adoption Alipay will face stiff challenges it never encountered in China. The biggest concern for Alipay is fragmentation of global payment infrastructure. Developed markets in the United States and Europe have entrenched ways of securely making purchases online, something China lacks. The World Bank estimated that only 16 percent of Chinese consumers have a credit card. Many smaller businesses, especially those outside the more advanced cities, do not accept credit or debit cards. This made the transition from cash to cashless payments a far more open competition, one which mobile payment services have captured handily due to the penetration of smartphone usage in China. In other words, Chinese consumers were happy to sign up for mobile payments due to a lack of reliable alternatives. Digital payment systems are the number one online payment method in China (Source: Nielsen Media) In developed markets, the prevalence of credit and debit cards presents a stiff challenge to mobile payment solutions. Alipay only needs to look at the slow adoption of Apple Pay, almost two years after its introduction, for evidence. Apple has run into a slew of issues, both technical and environmental—where banking giants and rivals such as Samsung have invested huge sums into their own mobile payment solutions. Until mobile payments can demonstrate clear advantages over credit cards, adoption will be slow. The other challenge facing Alipay—if it wants to gain international trust—is concerns over data security. Only 16 percent of Chinese consumers have a credit card. Earlier this year Apple and its CEO Tim Cook sparred with U.S. Department of Justice over government access to private customer data stored on Apple’s devices. This month, Alibaba founder Jack Ma did the complete opposite by essentially pitching customer data to the Chinese communist regime. In an October presentation to the Chinese Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, which runs the Party’s security forces, Ma suggested to authorities and police officers present on using digital data for rooting out illicit activities. “Police used to follow a pickpocket thief day by day,” Ma told the group, according to a transcript obtained by Sohu.com. “In the future, if the man uses electronic payment, and the police finds him riding 50 different buses in one day, this person may be very suspicious.” “I believe that public security, courts, the People’s Procuratorate [the Chinese agency responsible for investigation and prosecution], security departments, including anti-terrorism departments, should use this data,” Ma said. The technology industry’s relationship with law enforcement will be a hot topic as the digital economy expands. And that’s especially true for the Chinese market where “illicit activity” can carry any definition ascribed by the Chinese communist regime leadership.  For now, the foreign partnerships should give Alipay more business from traveling Chinese nationals. But it remains to be seen whether global consumers will entrust their financial data to a company affiliated with Ma—China’s second-richest man, a proponent of China’s internet censorship policies, and a defender of counterfeit goods.

The new Apple Watch Nike+ Edition is pegged at a starting price of $369, according to Arabian Business. According to the Associated Press, the new Apple Watch Nike+ Edition is equipped with a GPS component, which could be important for runners as they train and prepare for races. Smartwatch sales declined 52 percent in the third quarter of 2016. [Image by Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images for Apple] “The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind,” the Associated Press noted. “Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. “Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts.” The Associated Press also notes of the new Apple Watch Nike+ Edition that cyclists can make use of similar GPS functionality as runners and walkers. Among the changes and GPS is the biggest, the AP‘s technology writer still wanted the ability to move data between apps and devices, something that is extremely limited at the present time. So while she liked the device and its improvements, she noted that she will still likely stick with her preferred device, at least for now. “The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all,” she wrote. While smartwatches were all the rage just a few short years ago, the fad has quickly diminished among the consumer population, with CNNMoney reporting a 52 percent decline in smartwatch sales in the third quarter of 2016. That includes more than just Apple — it includes manufacturers such as Samsung and Garmin, as well. “Apple sold just 1.1 million of its Apple Watches in the quarter, compared with 3.9 million a year earlier — a 72 percent decline,” CNNMoney reported the same week the Apple Watch Nike+ Edition was released. So why the drastic drop in sales? CNNMoney speculates that certain features are still not available on smartwatches, like answering emails from the device. Still others may not want to replace the device every few years when a newer model hits the market, it said. And yet another reason is other companies appear to be keeping pace with Apple, Samsung, and others by releasing so-called “hybrid” devices. CNNMoney lists luxury brands such as Kate Spade getting into this marketplace. The Associated Press reports Apple is doubling down on the Apple Watch despite CNNMoney reporting sales drop of 72 percent for Apple Watch. [Photo by Pablo Cuadra/Getty Images for Apple] “Analysts think the hybrids could fare better because people may be more inclined to buy if they like how the watch looks and get a few tech perks, like the ability to count steps, as a bonus,” CNNMoney reports. Even so, the features of an Apple Watch Nike+ Edition, or any other Apple Watch edition, are impressive considering these types of devices were just concepts a decade ago. For individuals who are fitness enthusiasts, such as the AP technology reporter, the ability to map your run, track your speed, and other features not before available without having your smartphone strapped to your arm could be appealing.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 30, 2016 at 1:06PM On Oct. 27, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced three new MacBook Pro computers: a premium 15-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, a premium 13-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, and a 13-inch model without the OLED Touch Bar. Image source: Apple. The systems offer several nice improvements over the prior-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, ranging from improved displays and faster processors to sleeker industrial design. Apple has built a great set of machines here, and I suspect that the new models will do very well in the marketplace. Nevertheless, there is one fly in the proverbial ointment with these new machines that needs to be discussed. Soon-to-be last-generation processors Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models use high-end Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. The 13-inch MacBook Pro systems utilize dual-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors with Intel's premium Iris graphics, while the 15-inch models use quad-core Core i7 processors with lower-end vanilla Intel HD Graphics (though for graphics-intensive tasks, Apple has included more powerful stand-alone graphics chips in these systems). As of this writing, Apple's new MacBook Pros have some of the fastest notebook processors available on the planet. Unfortunately, though, these chips have been available for about a year now, and Intel will have more powerful notebook processors available in early 2017. Why did Apple choose older processors? The reality of the situation is that Apple launches its Mac systems -- particularly the MacBooks -- on its own schedule, rather than based on Intel's schedule. Apple likely wasn't ready to launch these new MacBook Pro systems when Intel's sixth-generation Core processors came out, so it simply had to wait until the system hardware and software were ready. Now, Apple could conceivably have waited until Intel released its new seventh-generation Core processors in January (pushing out the MacBook Pro launch by a couple of months), but the company probably didn't want to hold off on releasing these long-overdue updates to its MacBook Pro line any longer than it had to. Furthermore, the differences between the sixth-generation and seventh-generation Core processors don't amount to that much; the seventh-generation Core chips can run at higher speeds for a given power envelope, and they have slightly enhanced media playback capabilities. Nevertheless, since Apple's MacBook Pro systems are marketed as premium products, it's probably going to come as a disappointment to some that soon they will be using one-generation-old processor technologies. Can Apple's Mac get back up to speed? Apple could conceivably update the processors inside of the new MacBook Pro models to incorporate Intel's newer seventh-generation Core processors early next year. The new processors should be pin-compatible with the current sixth-generation Core processors (meaning that the chips can be placed into the same systems without hardware modification), so upgrading the systems from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core wouldn't be too difficult. Even if Apple doesn't do this, there's a pretty simple way for Apple to get back on track -- skip the seventh-generation Core processors altogether. Intel's eighth-generation Core processors -- which should bring significant performance/feature gains over the seventh-generation Core chips -- should be available for notebooks during the second quarter of 2018, per a recent leak that's been circulating on the Web. Apple could just keep selling the recently released MacBook Pro systems until around May of 2018, at which point the company could release updated versions with Intel's new eighth-generation Core processors: problem solved.

Recent rumors suggest that next year’s model, which will also be a commemoration of the iPhone’s tenth anniversary, is going to feature an OLED display. The newly appointed Sharp CEO Tai Jeng-wu appears to have confirmed rumors that the next-generation iPhone is going to have an OLED display. Nikkei reports that Tai commented on Apple’s future plans during a talk to students at Tatung University, his alma mater. He was speaking to students after being presented with an honorary doctorate degree by the university. “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels,” Tai is reported to have said in his talk, “We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,” he added. The Sharp CEO also revealed that the company is developing a new OLED manufacturing facility in Japan and that the company might even produce OLED panels in the United States “if our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S.” It merits mentioning here that Sharp has always been rumored to be one of the suppliers from which Apple will source OLED displays for iPhones.

Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 30, 2016 at 11:50AM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares fell more than 2% on Wednesday following the release of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Tuesday. Revenue and earnings per share for Q4 both met expectations, so investors must be disappointed with the company's guidance for the all-important holiday quarter. In fact, Apple investors should be extremely pleased with the company's guidance. The iPhone maker expects to return to revenue growth in Q1 after three quarters of decline -- and its forecast could turn out to be quite conservative. Apple is on track to have another great holiday quarter. Image source: The Motley Fool. Revenue growth resumes For the current quarter, Apple has projected that revenue will reach $76 billion to $78 billion, up from $75.9 billion a year ago. On the one hand, it's a good sign to see Apple returning to growth, especially considering that its sales in Q1 of fiscal 2016 were somewhat inflated by an unsustainable increase in channel inventory. On the other hand, Apple is benefiting from an extra week in the current quarter. That means its guidance actually implies a year-over-year decline in the weekly sales rate. Furthermore, Apple forecast that its gross margin will be 38% to 38.5% this quarter. That would be down significantly from 40.1% a year ago and 39.9% the year before that. This apparent margin pressure also may have spooked investors. Supply constraints emerge again To put Apple's Q1 guidance in context, it's important to recognize that the company faces supply constraints for its new iPhones, particularly the iPhone 7 Plus. Demand for larger iPhones has been rising steadily in recent years, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 disaster has likely driven even more big-screen phone fans to switch to Apple. Demand for the iPhone 7 Plus is far outpacing supply. Image source: Apple. On Apple's earnings call earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook bluntly stated that he wasn't sure Apple would be able to reach supply-demand balance for the iPhone 7 Plus this quarter. (By contrast, he does expect supply to catch up to demand for the iPhone 7.) Indeed, lead times for the iPhone 7 have improved significantly in recent weeks. Apple's U.S. online store lists most iPhone 7 models (excluding the popular new Jet Black color) as available for next-day delivery. In-store availability at U.S. Apple Stores is also rising. By contrast, most iPhone 7 Plus models have a backlog of several weeks online, while retail stocks are minimal. Back to the future? Cook's tone regarding the iPhone 7 Plus harkens back to his comments two years ago about the supply-demand imbalance for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. At that time, he told analysts that supply was "not on the same planet" as demand. By contrast, last year and three years ago, Cook sounded much more confident on the Q4 earnings calls that Apple would be able to build enough iPhones to meet demand during the holiday quarter. Sure enough, in both of those years, Apple exited the first quarter with iPhone inventory within its target range. The difference in outlook corresponds to a stark difference when comparing Apple's results to its guidance. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016, Apple's Q1 revenue fell within its guidance range, while gross margin modestly exceeded the high end of the range. Meanwhile, for Q1 of fiscal 2015 (corresponding to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch), Apple crushed its guidance. Revenue came in 12% above the high end of Apple's forecast, while gross margin was 1.4 percentage points better than the high end of the guidance range. Two years ago, Apple had its most successful iPhone lineup ever. Image source: Apple. What does history tell us? Past performance is no guarantee of future results. That said, for great companies like Apple, it's usually a pretty good predictor. Apple's supply chain prowess is virtually unmatched in the consumer electronics industry. The company also has a ton of leverage with suppliers, due to its massive scale. As a result, when its biggest challenge is building enough iPhones -- as opposed to finding enough iPhone buyers -- Apple typically finds a way to improve supply while boosting manufacturing efficiency to drive down costs. Investors still shouldn't expect an earnings beat on the scale of two years ago. At that time, analysts had a hard time gauging just how much the introduction of larger phones would increase Apple's market opportunity. Furthermore, the supply-demand imbalance appears to be limited to the iPhone 7 Plus this year, rather than both models in fiscal 2015. Nevertheless, based on Apple's track record, it will probably be able to increase iPhone 7 Plus production faster than its forecast implies. That could lead to Apple reporting Q1 revenue and gross margin comfortably above its guidance range. Strong demand and tight supply for the iPhone 7 Plus could also help Apple maintain its sales and earnings momentum beyond the holiday quarter. That will provide a nice bridge to the introduction of Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone next year -- an event that could drive the next big cycle of growth for Apple.

The most controversial thing about the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, both which came out in September, was the fact that neither had a headphone jack built into the actual phone. Even BGR, the most pro-Apple website in the world, didn’t think removing the jack was a good idea. “Either way, the burden was decidedly on Apple to convince users that they wouldn’t miss the headphone jack. And now that we’re a few days removed from the event, we can calmly ask: did Apple adequately justify its decision to remove the headphone jack? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is resounding no.” Is Apple really being “hostile”? [Image by Daryl Deino] Then came The Verge, which recently claimed that Apple was being downright hostile to its iPhone customers by removing the headphone jack. “I am surrounded by wireless speaker systems. (I work at The Verge, after all.) And while they mostly work fine, sometimes they crackle out and fail. It sucks to share a wireless speaker among multiple devices. Bluetooth headphones require me to charge yet another battery. You haven’t known pain until you’ve chosen to use Bluetooth audio in a car instead of an aux jack.” Author Nilay Patel added that getting rid of a deeply established standard will impact accessibility, and that, at worst, nobody is even asking Apple to remove the headphone jack. But this is where Patel and the headphone jack critics get it wrong. Apple didn’t intend to “kill” anything. Instead, they made a thinner device and packaged a very simple headphone jack adapter to fit into the Lightning port. As one can see from the main picture in this article, the adapter barely adds inconvenience. This author started to use wireless headphones with the iPhone 7 Plus before being reminded that the sound from wireless headphones simply can’t match wired ones. Using the wired Bose QC20i noise canceling buds has been almost as easy as using them with the iPhone 6s Plus. One can simply put the adapter on the plug of the headphones they are using so they can be prepared anytime. Some carry the QC20i with them in a pocket pouch. They can do the same with the adapter connected. Apparently, Apple isn’t the only company that is not putting a headphone jack directly into their smartphones. iTech Post has the news. “Amidst the high-end specs being rumored to come in the Samsung Galaxy S8, there are talks of it adopting a rather surprising feature… it may actually arrive sans the headphone jack. Considering the backlash that Apple received when it launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, is it really a wise move for the South Korean company?” The next version of Samsung’s Galaxy S smartphone may not have a physical headphone jack either. [Image by Daryl Deino] By the time Samsung releases the Galaxy S8, which should be soon given all of the problems with the Galaxy Note 7, the removal of the headphone jack on the actual device won’t be as controversial. Samsung will likely include an adapter as well that will be easy to use. There will be some early complaints, but consumers will ultimately accept it as long as the S8 doesn’t blow up in their faces like the Note 7. According to The Verge, headphone companies are unfazed by Apple’s removal of the headphone jack. Co-CEOs of Sennheiser say that that they have seen many different connection standards come and go over the years and think 3D audio technology may take over anyway. Rory Dooley from Jaybird thinks Apple has confirmed what they have known for a long time — the world is going wireless. However, all these headphone makers should state the most important reason why they are unfazed: You can still easily use regular headphones with the iPhone 7 and will likely be able to use them for several years to come. Apple did not kill the headphone jack.

On Apple's earnings call earlier this week, CEO Tim Cook bluntly stated that he wasn't sure Apple would be able to reach supply-demand balance for the iPhone 7 Plus this quarter. (By contrast, he does expect supply to catch up to demand for the iPhone 7.) Indeed, lead times for the iPhone 7 have improved significantly in recent weeks. Apple's U.S. online store lists most iPhone 7 models (excluding the popular new Jet Black color) as available for next-day delivery. In-store availability at U.S. Apple Stores is also rising. By contrast, most iPhone 7 Plus models have a backlog of several weeks online, while retail stocks are minimal. Back to the future? Cook's tone regarding the iPhone 7 Plus harkens back to his comments two years ago about the supply-demand imbalance for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. At that time, he told analysts that supply was "not on the same planet" as demand. By contrast, last year and three years ago, Cook sounded much more confident on the Q4 earnings calls that Apple would be able to build enough iPhones to meet demand during the holiday quarter. Sure enough, in both of those years, Apple exited the first quarter with iPhone inventory within its target range. The difference in outlook corresponds to a stark difference when comparing Apple's results to its guidance. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016, Apple's Q1 revenue fell within its guidance range, while gross margin modestly exceeded the high end of the range. Meanwhile, for Q1 of fiscal 2015 (corresponding to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus launch), Apple crushed its guidance. Revenue came in 12% above the high end of Apple's forecast, while gross margin was 1.4 percentage points better than the high end of the guidance range. Two years ago, Apple had its most successful iPhone lineup ever. Image source: Apple. What does history tell us? Past performance is no guarantee of future results. That said, for great companies like Apple, it's usually a pretty good predictor. Apple's supply chain prowess is virtually unmatched in the consumer electronics industry. The company also has a ton of leverage with suppliers, due to its massive scale. As a result, when its biggest challenge is building enough iPhones -- as opposed to finding enough iPhone buyers -- Apple typically finds a way to improve supply while boosting manufacturing efficiency to drive down costs. Investors still shouldn't expect an earnings beat on the scale of two years ago. At that time, analysts had a hard time gauging just how much the introduction of larger phones would increase Apple's market opportunity. Furthermore, the supply-demand imbalance appears to be limited to the iPhone 7 Plus this year, rather than both models in fiscal 2015. Nevertheless, based on Apple's track record, it will probably be able to increase iPhone 7 Plus production faster than its forecast implies. That could lead to Apple reporting Q1 revenue and gross margin comfortably above its guidance range. Strong demand and tight supply for the iPhone 7 Plus could also help Apple maintain its sales and earnings momentum beyond the holiday quarter. That will provide a nice bridge to the introduction of Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone next year -- an event that could drive the next big cycle of growth for Apple.

These phones are planned a long way ahead of time, and we're already hearing rumours about what's in store for 2017. The particular rumour we're interested in here concerns display technology: Tai Jeng-wu, president of electronics giant Sharp, has told an audience of students that the iPhone 8 will use OLED display technology, something we've already heard whispers about. Pay attention at the back - Sharp has just been bought out by Foxconn, Apple's main manufacturing partner in Asia, and the word on the Cupertino grapevine is that Apple wants to start making screens in-house with the help of Sharp and Foxconn. Sharp already makes some of the displays used in the current generation of iPhones. That display tech in full Today's iPhones use LTPS (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon) LCD technology and are of course already great to look at, but the switch to OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays (similar to those used in Samsung Galaxy phones) would mean better colour contrast and an easier path to making curved screens. The Apple Watch already uses an OLED display. Perhaps not the most interesting of iPhone rumours to the average consumer, but you're going to be spending a long time staring at the screen, so it's important to understand the technology behind it. It's also a clue that Apple may one day add a curved screen to its iconic smartphone handset. We're also hearing that next year's iPhone will have a glass back and there might even be a third size and form factor to celebrate 10 years of iPhones. If you want to get in early with all the iPhone 8 speculation, we've got a complete round-up here.

Photograph: Tony Avelar/EPA Alex Hern @alexhern Sunday 30 October 2016 11.51 EDT Last modified on Friday 4 November 2016 09.22 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Apple released its latest laptops on Thursday, a new range of computers to replace the ageing range of Retina MacBook Pros. They are thinner and lighter than their predecessors, with a new touch bar at the top of the keyboard and a fingerprint sensor replacing the power button. They are £750 more than the machines they replace were – though their price has also gone up. The larger of the two new MacBook Pros, the 15in with Touch Bar, is the first laptop the company has released with a starting price of more than £2,000 for more than a decade: it begins at an eye-watering £2,349, with build-to-order options taking it well north of £4,000. Apple’s former cheapest laptop, the £749 MacBook, is also being retired. With the next cheapest going up in price due to post-Brexit currency swings, there is now only one Apple laptop available for less than £1,000: the £949 13in MacBook Air, an almost two-year-old computer that is likely to never see another update. Brexit hits Apple Mac customers hard as prices rise by up to £500 Read more It too has been quietly replaced by another top-end machine, 2015’s MacBook: a £1,249 ultralightweight laptop with one port, one headphone jack, a mobile processor and a width of just 13mm. After a long period as a mid-market manufacturer of some of the most popular laptops on the market, then, Apple is back to making premium computers for the very top end of the market. “Apple has always had a firm strategy on the high-end of the market with adding a few models towards the mid-range to attract new user groups,” says the Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann. She argues that the new models’ touch bar is the perfect feature to reposition the overall range towards the high end, as well as taking on competition from other computer manufacturers that have been building their own touchscreen devices. The shift has been rapid, and reflects the changing shape of the PC market, Apple’s attempts to refashion its line-up of computers and mobile devices for that altered world, and some new competition from an old foe, says Ben Wood from the analysts CCS Insight. “We shouldn’t forget that the last significant update to the MacBook Pro family was 2012,” he says. “I think it’s a real indication of the broader malaise in the notebook market that Apple was able to get away with selling a four-year-old product as successfully as it has. All they had to compete with was some nasty black plastic from Dell or HP.” But over those four years, the PC market has shrunk consistently. In 2015, 164.4m units were sold, according to TrendForce, while that is expected to fall to 157.4m this year. The cause is obvious: the rise of mobile and tablet computers have allowed users to do more with less, be that replacing a laptop with an iPad, or simply never buying a full computer in the first place and going online with a smartphone. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple unveils new MacBook Pro with new Touch Bar feature – video Different companies have responded in different ways: first, by focusing less on their computer divisions as they chased the market to mobile, but later, by recognising that the smaller size of PC industry allows for greater segmentation of the market. One of the first to really push that to its limits was Apple’s old foe Microsoft. Since 2012, Microsoft has been building its own line of hardware, based on its Surface range of tablets. Where the initial devices were intended to act as iPad competitors, in recent years the company has positioned the latest Surface devices as hybrid tablet/laptops capable of doing the work of either. This month, it stepped up the competition even further, introducing the Surface Studio, a $3,000 (£2,460) desktop machine intended to provide the perfect working environment for the likes of visual artists who can make the most of its 28in touchscreen. “We could be entering a new arms race in these premium computing devices,” says Wood, “with Microsoft stepping up and giving Apple a run for its money. Apple is currently saying that they see a clear distinction between touch-based products, like the iPad and iPhone, and Macs, where they are going to great lengths to avoid putting touchscreens on the main device. Microsoft has a different strategy.” Apple has a blip and the world wobbles. Why? | John Naughton Read more Apple’s motivation to redefine its laptops may also have been driven by a desire to more fully distinguish between its iPads and its MacBook range. Until last week, the most expensive iPad, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi and mobile data, was more expensive than Apple’s cheapest laptop. That posed a problem for Apple, which struggled to explain what the two devices were for: if a laptop is best for work on the move, who would pay more for an iPad? Now, it can more consistently structure its messaging: iPads are cheaper, hardier portable devices with all-day battery life, but if your main computer is to be portable, a premium laptop is the way to go. The downside for British customers is that Apple has picked perhaps the worst possible time to enact the change. Thanks to the collapse in the value of the pound, the company repriced its entire line – even older, unchanged computers – raising the price of some by as much as £500 to account for the new exchange rate. That means customers who were holding off until new computers came out have suddenly found that the older computers are more expensive as well. Apple said: “Apple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business. These factors vary from region to region and over time, such that international prices are not always comparable to US suggested retail prices.” • This article was amended on 4 November 2016. An earlier version said “£949 13in MacBook Pro” where “£949 13in MacBook Air” was meant.

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? October 30 AAPL: 113.72 -0.76 New MacBook Pros lack iconic Mac startup chime, but they do automatically boot when you open the lid (update: here’s how to enable it) Benjamin Mayo - 2 weeks ago @bzamayo MacBook Pro View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Update: There is apparently a way to make your 2016 MacBook chime again at boot, using an NVRAM tweak — full details here on how to do it. To enable chimes, open Terminal and type sudo nvram BootAudio=%01 This is not documented or officially supported in any way, so mileage may vary. There’s also a flag to disable the auto-boot behavior. It has been discovered that along with physical function keys, glowing Apple logo and ‘old style’ USB ports, the new MacBook Pros lack the iconic Mac chime when booting up. This is the distinctive noise heard at startup when the Mac passes the initial POST checks; Apple has used the same F-sharp chord sound in its computers since 1998. The new MacBooks end this tradition as the chime has been removed completely and the machines will make no noise at all on boot, unless there is a fault. However, there seems to be a good reason for this change … The removal of the Mac chime was first noted by Pingie.com. A lesser-known feature about the new MacBook Pros is that the late-2016 laptops actually turn themselves on when you open the lid. Current MacBooks wake when the lid is opened if they are sleeping but the new machines go one step further. If they are fully switched off, opening the laptop will automatically turn them on, removing the need to press the power button. This new feature rationalizes the decision to remove the startup chime, as it means the MacBooks turn on automatically and silently. It would be annoying to open the lid in a meeting to have it make the noise of its own accord. A silent boot process allows the automatic boot feature to be included without a chance of it disrupting other people nearby. It also means that there is now no difference in behavior between waking from sleep and booting from scratch, apart from a few more seconds of loading in the latter case. The automatic boot feature is available on all new MacBook Pros, those with either two USB-C 3 ports (the cheaper 13-inch) or four USB-C 3 ports (the ones with the Touch Bar). It will turn on when the Mac is opened as long as it has sufficient battery charge. The new 2016 MacBook Pros will also turn on automatically if you connect them to a power adaptor, and the lid is open or the laptop is connected to an external display. It’s the end of an era for the Mac boot chime but there is a good justification for its removal and the new automatic boot feature eliminates the need to press the power button at all for many people, further streamlining the experience of using an Apple computer. The 2016 MacBook Pros were announced at Apple’s event last week and the base 13 inch model is already available to buy at many retailers; Apple retail stores will likely get in-store stock next week. The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is currently backordered by up to a month. Expect the first shipments of those later in November. (As a homage to the Mac chime, by the way, we included the sound at the opening of our latest Happy Hour podcast episode discussing Apple’s October Mac event.)

Follow TechnoBuffalo Microsoft and Apple both announced new laptops this week. Microsoft wants you to trade in your Apple laptop for one of its products, either a Surface Book or Surface Pro, and is offering up to a $650 discount depending on the notebook you’re trading in. Bad news? You can’t trade it for the new Surface Book with Performance Base, according to the fine print. “No device line up can match the performance, portability and versatility of the Surface family,” Microsoft argues, taking shots right across the bow of the new MacBook Pro. The trade-in process is pretty standard to selling a gadget elsewhere. You’ll start off on Microsoft’s site where you’ll determine the trade-in value of your Apple notebook, agree to the price (or turn it down), and then send it to Microsoft. Once received, Microsoft will send an email with a promo code for the agreed-upon discount, which can then be applied in a Microsoft Store or on Microsoft’s website. Trade your MacBook for a Surface So far as I can tell, the offers seem relatively fair. You can get up to $450 for a working 2012 MacBook Air, for example. Not bad considering that’ll knock a good chunk off the cost of a more modern laptop. The only trouble is you’ll be without a laptop while you’re waiting, so this is probably only best for folks who want some extra cash for a notebook that’s just sitting around collecting dust Trade-ins kick off now and can be taken advantage of through November 10, 2016, Microsoft said.

He confirmed Apple's display shift when delivering a speech at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree (as noted the photo below). In his speech he noted that "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation."     The next generation flexible OLED displays will allow Apple to invent iPhone displays that are curved or iPhones that could fold. Apple of course invented an iPhone display with curved edges back in 2012 before Samsung ever delivered such a design. For Apple's engineers, this isn't new. As for foldable displays, it's a concept that Samsung has been obsessed with over the years, and yes, Apple does have at least one invention covering such a device on record.   Interestingly, Tai did not specify when iPhone will start to sport OLED screens, but confirmed to reporters after the ceremony that Sharp was committed to developing OLED technology.   "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too," he said. "If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?"   The Nikkei Asian Review has reported in the past that Apple has tentatively planned three iPhone models for the gadget's 10th anniversary next year. A premium 5.5-inch handset is slated to have a curved OLED screen, while the other two products will stick with existing LTPS panels.   Tai was appointed president and chief executive of Sharp in August, soon after Hon Hai finalized its purchase of the century-old corporation. He is a close associate of Terry Gou, chairman of Hon Hai, which is also Apple's principal iPhone assembler.   For a little more background, in June Patently Apple posted a report titled "Apple Supplier Foxconn Surprises Market by saying that Sharp will begin Delivering OLED Displays Next Year," and in September another key report was posted titled "Sharp may Tag-Team with Japan Display to Enter Apple's OLED Supply Chain by 2018."   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Photo: Graham Bower/Cult of Mac I work on an iPhone app called Reps & Sets as a hobby project in my spare time. This week, my partner and I came to the conclusion that there is no future for our app as a paid download, so we have reluctantly decided to make it free. This was an incredibly tough call, because we have invested literally thousands of hours in developing our app over the years. Giving all that hard work away for free is heartbreaking. But we didn’t feel we had much choice. Why no one buys apps anymore We started developing Reps & Sets in 2010. Back then, in-app purchases were still a relatively new phenomenon. This type of payment mechanism didn’t strike us as being relevant to our app. I realize now that we failed to anticipate just how fundamentally in-app purchases would change the App Store. Back then, app sales were still booming. But in hindsight, the writing was already on the wall for paid downloads. Today, Minecraft: Pocket Edition is the only paid app in the App Store’s top 200 grossing chart. All the others are “freemium,” generating their revenue by selling items within the app. You could argue that this is just part of a long-term trend in the software industry, as companies like Microsoft and Adobe have moved from selling shrink-wrapped software with an up-front charge to providing ongoing subscriptions and cloud services. This move away from paying up front is not limited to software. In the music industry, even Apple has been forced to concede defeat. Steve Jobs once shunned subscription services such as Spotify, arguing that “people want to own their music.” With the launch of Apple Music, however, Cupertino made a U-turn and jumped on the subscription bandwagon. Rumors indicate Apple might even ditch the iTunes Music Store altogether, which would have been an unthinkable move just five years ago. If you can’t beat them, join them We’re hoping our new Apple Watch app will tempt some of our users to become subscribers and help fund ongoing development. Photo: Repsio Ltd Apple’s Music strategy is effectively “if you cant beat ’em, join ’em.” And in our own humble way, that is exactly what we have decided to do with Reps & Sets. This week we made all the existing features of our app free. Instead we will be selling an in-app subscription, which provides access to all the new features we add moving forward, starting with our Apple Watch app. This way, all of our current users, who bought the app, can continue to access the features they paid for without incurring any extra cost. Hopefully the Apple Watch app will tempt some into subscribing, and maybe new users will discover the app now that it is free. Time will tell if this business model works for us. Since our app is just a hobby project we do in our spare time for fun, we don’t expect it to earn us a fortune (although of course that would be nice). But we would at least like to see it wash its face. I wish it hadn’t come to this: Why freemium sucks The reason we held out for so long against the switch from paid to freemium is because, honestly, we think it sucks. Last year I wrote a manifesto for classy app developers. I argued that app pricing should be clear and easy for the user to understand. Frankly, most freemium apps are anything but. Take Pokémon Go for example. There is no way I would have downloaded this “free” app had I known that it would end up costing me over $40. Yes, I realize that I’m a grown adult and it is entirely up to me how much I choose to splurge on cute pocket-size creatures. But my lack of impulse control aside, the fact remains that, like most freemium software, the total cost of ownership for the game is unclear at the start. When you download it, you really have no way of knowing how much storage, incense, lucky eggs and lures you will need to purchase. To be fair, Pokémon Go is far from unique in this respect. In fact, these days this is pretty much the norm, which means I now avoid the temptation of “free” games like Madden NFL Mobile because I have absolutely no idea how much they are really going to cost me. Suddenly the price of the console version looks like a bargain. Like Steve Jobs said about music, I believe that people want to own their apps. That way you know what the total cost will be. And, once purchased, you can be sure you get full access to everything you need with no surprise extra costs. Apple could have saved paid apps What I find most frustrating is that it did not have to be this way. It’s true that Apple had little option but to offer in-app purchases. The switch to services was, after all, the direction in which the whole industry was heading. But there is still a great deal Apple could have done to promote paid apps on the App Store. The first big problem paid-app developers have is that Apple provides no way to offer a free trial. Prospective buyers just get to see a 30-second video, five static screengrabs and some plain-text blurb. That is not much on which to base a purchasing decision. Apple also does not allow developers to offer free “demo” versions on the App Store. Cupertino requires all apps to be useful in their own right. Some developers attempt to get around this by offering feature-limited “lite” versions. But attempting to get the user to switch from one app to another is not easy, especially if the lite version sufficiently meets their needs. For years, developers like us have been hoping Apple would provide a way to offer a free one-month trial. Now it looks like that would be too little too late, since the market for paid apps is all but dead anyway. Things are very different for in-app subscriptions, where Apple makes it easy for developers to offer a one-month free trial. No wonder so many developers are switching to this model. Pay once, then ride for free Another problem for paid-app developers is that Apple does not allow developers to charge for updates. This means that users who purchased our app five years ago for the princely sum of $1.99 receive all our hard work on subsequent updates at absolutely no extra cost. So in reality, new versions of the app were effectively free for them already. Once again, some developers attempted to get around this by releasing major updates of their app as new apps entirely. But this is not an elegant solution. Unless you are willing to cold-bloodedly end support for owners of previous versions, you end up with multiple versions of your app available on the App Store, which is a marketing nightmare. App development is not a simple matter of building an app, then sitting back and raking in the money. It requires continuous ongoing development to maintain compatibility with new hardware and new versions of iOS. Since we launched the app, we’ve had to add support for numerous big changes, including: iOS 7’s redesign, Retina displays, larger screen sizes, HealthKit, Today widgets, Apple Watch, interactive Notifications and iCloud Drive. The list is endless. Users rightly expect support for all the latest Apple features. But this doesn’t happen by magic. Apple frequently claims at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference that supporting new features is super-simple for developers, which often gives users unrealistic expectations. The reality for developers tends to be quite different. Any app that has been around a few years, like ours, has built up “technology debt,” which means it relies on older APIs and functions. A small developer can’t afford a full rewrite every time there’s a major shift, like from Objective-C to Swift, Auto Layout constraints, etc. These things take time. As Benjamin Franklin famously said, time is money. Without the ability to charge users for updates, app development quickly becomes financially unsustainable. Apple does not owe us a living You might say that if we can’t make a living out of our app, that’s our problem. And of course you are right. Apple does not owe us, or indeed any developer, a living. And it is entirely up to Cupertino how it chooses to steer the App Store. But when free becomes the norm, what really suffers is diversity. I believe that is ultimately bad for users as well as developers. Apple likes to crow about the millions of apps available on the App Store. But I wonder just how many of them remain actively developed. Even John Gruber recently called it a day with his Vesper app. And if someone that high profile struggled to market a paid app, what hope is there for the rest of us? Only mega-corps like Google and Facebook can really afford to give away apps. And that is rarely where innovation comes from. Just look at how Instagram, iMessages and SnapChat busily copy each others’ features. Without the continued contributions of indie developers, the App Store becomes a much more dry and sterile place. If they can’t make money selling apps, that is bad news for everyone.

If it’s free, fine if not I don’t want it unless I can but it at the time of download. I also don’t care if they decide to load it with ads because I block ads in apps on my iOS and Android devices. Let me buy the app and dump the in app purchases. NoneOfYourBusiness Would you agree to buy a car without a test-drive? NoneOfYourBusiness But that doesn’t make any sense to complain about Free + IAP. Let me explain this from a customer point of view. Say, I’m not very happy with a standard camera app on iPhone, I want to have manual controls and other great features. So, I go on App Store. What should I do, buy each app out there to see which I like? What I, as a customer, want is to try before buy. Free + IAP gives this opportunity even if not fully fledged (not all features could be tried). Some developers wisely choose Free and Paid feature sets, others are less thoughtful. We live in a world of crazy competition, obviously as a customer I want to have the best at minimum available price. I personally have no problems to pay for apps or even updates, but I definitely don’t want to have 100s of purchased apps thrown to trash (I can spend those money on something else). Also, lately it became quite dangerous to trust reviews on big Apple related sites. Most of them just repost the same review for years, don’t have time even to update app version they review. Finding a new app, well forget about it. Apple’s team is also doing poor job time to time, putting in top sections total garbage. So, yes, as a customer I’m in favour of Free+IAP model Deplorable Lance Corvette No free trial period. Bingo. Add that to the list of things going downhill with APL since Jobs left (I know, it started before, but App developers could have spoken up about it). Storm I agree that the lack of a free trial period is a problem, but I’m confused by your second paragraph: are you saying this is Steve Jobs’s fault, Tim Cook’s fault or app developers’ fault? Linton Findlay The worst apps that are Paid AND have IAP. Like the ‘free’ app of the week, is sonic, but is riddled with ads. If I pay for an experience I want the full experience. Too many apps have a premium features that are locked behind IAPs, which the descriptions don’t make clear. Not to mention premium apps that are ditching the price for a subscription model- EG 1Password Yarrenbool My biggest complaint with IAP is that most times it is not clearly, fully, and unambiguously stated what extras or advantages the IAP will provide. Full IAP information should be provided up front in the AppStore’s description! Future Burrito I take issue with apps that charge upfront and then add ads down the road. When that happens, I request a refund from Apple and I stop using the app altogether. Same thing if they move to a subscription model. Future Burrito This trend is unfortunate. I stay withe iOS because 3 pillars: – The premium build of the iPhone – Reliable and innovative software updates – High-quality apps I don’t consider their updates reliable (anymore) and innovativation is few and far between. I don’t consider any subscription based apps (outside of VPNs, videos services, etc) or ad infested apps high quality. I wouldn’t move to android because that platform has the same problems, but I would stop updating my iPhone software and hardware. mctrials23 The reason iaps are prevalent is party due to developer greed and party because of customer sense of entitlement. The huge huge majority of people I know simply will not pay for apps. This is going back years. They can’t explain why they are unwilling to pay 99p for an app they use every day. Lots of people take it as a point of pride as well. They will go and spend £3 on a coffee but won’t spend £1 on an app. Developers have realised that you can make lots of money from IAPs when you hit those willing to spend. The people that wouldn’t buy your app for an up front cost probably won’t use IAPs and some people that don’t mind spending on their apps will end up spending much more than they ever would have via a single up front purchase. NoneOfYourBusiness “The people that wouldn’t buy your app for an up front cost probably won’t use IAPs” Not true. Speaking from my our experience. Some people just want to try something before they buy. There are too many scam/bad apps out there to waste your money on all of them. Rating/reviews don’t help since easily manipulated by developers, despite all effort Apple puts to eliminate this type of scam. mctrials23 Thats why I said probably. In my experience people generally fall into two camps. Those that will pay for apps and those that won’t. I will only pay for apps after I am happy they do what I need them to. A 10 minute google will usually tell you that. I have bought very few apps that are a waste of money and even those I don’t use much have only cost me a few quid. Writing software is so far removed from what most people do in their jobs that there seems to be an idea that its easy to do. I have heard a lot of people say “I’ve had a good idea for an app and I’ll build it in my spare time” when they have no programming experience. We also get a massive amount of our most useful software for free. All the google services like gmail, maps etc. I program for a living and I am always astounded that people who do simple jobs that you could learn in a few weeks consider their work more worthy of spending money on than software. Amy Poeler It’s demand and supply. If someone sold a coffee for $1 then the $3 coffee shop will go out of business. mctrials23 That wasn’t really my point. I’m saying that a lot of people are unwilling to pay for software whereas they are happy to spend far more on things like a chocolate bar, a coffee or a t-shirt they never wear. Storm “There is no way I would have downloaded this “free” app had I known that it would end up costing me over $40” This makes no sense. Surely, as a “grown adult”, once you realise that it *will* cost you over $40, you just delete the app without spending anything. No one is forcing you to make in-app purchases. BP I hate most free apps especially games. For my 6 year old I go out of my way to find ones that are paid only so she doesn’t click on advertisements or there are levels that are locked. Free apps seems so spammy. People are just so damn cheap it’s ridiculous hence why so many free and ad ridden apps. DiamondDNice i never pay for an in app purchase and never will. all but about two apps i’ve ever had are free. i paid for a music app because apple’s music app is horrible NoneOfYourBusiness What’s the difference paying all upfront or paying later for the same using IAP? Stephen Hutchinson There’s a reason most if not all of Apple’s stock apps are complete crap. Do you think that they know that? Of course they do. If they stocked a decent calendar app, who would go out and spend money on Calendars 5 by Readdle or some other such app? This makes Apple more $$$. This thought occurred to me quite awhile back, and the same attitude persists throughout every segment of Apple’s ecosystem, and why not.. they’re there to make shareholders money, and nothing else. Grayson I think a better solution might have been to keep your current app as is with an up front price and continue to add features for people who bought that app, but create a second App Store entry for the freemium model. That’s what PCalc does. There is a $10 PCalc app that gets you all of the features and has no in app purchases, and there is also a free PCalc Lite that has in app purchases for each feature and can actually get all of the features of the normal PCalc app if you buy all of the in app purchases. That two app model satisfies both the users who prefer to pay once and get everything currently available and in the future, and it satisfies the people who want to dip their toes in for free at first and maybe pay to add features later. rmckie713 It annoys me that they say the apps are free only to find their are in app purchases. M S i N Lund Apps suck, period. Why would i want to install special client-applications like its the 1900’s? I have a browser, now give me the URL to your stuff, or F off!

 Apple is stalling for time with its new MacBooks — and Microsoft knows it Matt Weinberger Oct. 30, 2016, 9:30 AM 223,868 facebook linkedin twitter email print The MacBook Pro's new Touch Bar.Apple With its new Surface Studio desktop PC, unveiled last week, Microsoft did something unimaginable: It upstaged Apple. The machine's sharp, superthin screen, smart design, and innovative click wheel led Business Insider's Steve Kovach to write that "the Studio isn't a computer. It's an entirely new computing category, a sort of desktop-tablet hybrid that already has people excited." When Apple gathered tech reporters in Cupertino, California, on Thursday, the company showed off a new lineup of MacBook Pro laptops sporting largely the same design we've seen for years, but with the addition of a new touch-screen Touch Bar that doubles as a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The contrast between the cool new Surface Studio and the so-so MacBook Pro was striking. Microsoft — popularly known for decades as the bland purveyor of bland software for bland beige boxes that sit in bland offices — is out-innovating the company that once dared its customers to "Think Different." The Microsoft Surface Studio.Microsoft And with Microsoft making such a splash with the exquisite Surface Pro tablet, Surface Book laptop, and now the Surface Studio PC, it has Apple's legions of Mac devotees asking: Why can't Apple just build a better Mac? Well, those Mac fans ain't gonna like the answer. You see, the replacement for the Mac is already here. It's called the iPhone. Maybe you've heard of it? Stalling for time Apple is the most valuable company in the world, and it's all thanks to the iPhone. Sure, Android phones dominate by market share. But at the end of 2015, the iPhone was more profitable than all the major Android manufacturers combined. Plus, the iPhone drives Apple's growing services business, including Apple Music, iCloud storage, and, most of all, the 30% cut it takes of all App Store transactions. Ultimately, as the iPhone grows, the Mac's importance to Apple diminishes. Check out the steady year-on-year revenue decline of the Mac since 2011: BI Intelligence Sure, Apple could pour money into the Mac business, inventing a touch-screen MacBook that rivals the Surface Book. With Apple's cash reserves, the sky's the limit. But Apple's actions aren't about money or beating Microsoft on the PC battlefield. Apple will never admit it, but the real goal is to ensure that the Mac stays frozen in time. Pressing pause While you and I might want a touch-screen Mac, Apple has already moved its big-picture focus to the iPhone and iPad. Launching a touch-screen Mac now has a huge potential to confuse the market, split the developer base, and pause the overall transition while customers try to figure out if they need a work-friendly iPad Pro or a touch-screen-enabled Mac. It's unarguable that today, it's difficult for most people, particularly students and creative professionals, to do their entire jobs on an iPhone or iPad. Consider this, though: What can you do with the iPhone today that you couldn't when it launched in 2007? When the Apple App Store launched, stuff like Google Docs on the iPhone seemed like a convenient novelty; now, as the apps have improved and their feature lists have filled out, they've become normal parts of the workday for millions of people. Apple iPad Pro.Apple It'll be a while before iOS, the operating system on the iPhone and iPad, is really, truly ready to replace a Mac (or a Windows computer, for that matter). But we've already seen signals that Apple is thinking in that direction: CEO Tim Cook probably tipped his hand when he pitched the giant-sized iPad Pro as a laptop replacement. So while the world waits for iOS to mature, Apple still needs to keep the Mac around for the many millions for whom an iPad still isn't good enough. It's a tricky balance — if Apple makes the Mac too modern, it hurts iPad adoption. Not modern enough, and Apple's install base erodes away before there's a real replacement. And when Apple finally starts to push into new platforms like augmented reality or even audible computing, you can bet that it will be centered on the iPhone, not the Mac. Hence, we get things like the Touch Bar — an underwhelming compromise between old and new while the future shakes itself out. Microsoft swoops in For Microsoft, this is a huge opportunity. Microsoft lost out on smartphones — by year's end, Windows phone platforms are expected to drop to a pitiful 1% of global market share. And with overall PC sales shrinking and smartphones handling an ever larger amount of everyday computing, the future of the company's Windows business is in danger. Windows 10 is designed to meet this threat head-on: It's designed to bridge the old Windows desktop experience with a new, touch-friendly interface. It tries to be as good for tablets as it is for PCs, and for the most part, it succeeds. Where Apple is trying to balance an old platform and a new one, Microsoft has one very mature operating system. So with Apple stuck in this weird stage between Mac and iPad, it's the perfect time for Microsoft to get people jazzed up about Windows 10. That's where the Surface line comes in, making the case to consumers that Microsoft is really good at helping you get stuff done and at coming up with nifty new touch-screen experiences. Microsoft Surface Book.Melia Robinson/Business Insider Clearly, Microsoft would love if everybody on the planet bought all Surface everything. But even if they don't — the devices are pretty expensive — Microsoft's real end-game with devices like the Surface is showing off what their hardware teams can do that Apple can't or won't. The mere fact that we're talking about the real possibility that Microsoft out-innovated Apple is proof enough that the strategy is working. It's going to get people at least considering a Windows machine, even if it's not a Surface, whereas before they might have just bought another MacBook. The real game now is whether Microsoft can use the Surface hype to bring Windows back to growth — before Apple sorts out the existential crisis with its platforms and starts pushing its computers forward again.

Fighting. ‘Did not vote’ was U.S. winner Tuesday. Guess which 7 states were exceptions St. Paul man: I pay for city services not performed. See you in court A winning season year in and year out is not the Minnesota Wild’s only ongoing challenge. Behind the scenes, the downtown St. Paul-based National Hockey League team is largely run off Apple iPad tablets that staffers tote everywhere. However, maintaining the gadgets — mass-installing apps and keeping the iOS operating system on every device up to date — is tricky, time-consuming business. Related Articles Study: Twin Cities one of eight best for tech-startup workers Minnesota ranks high in tech jobs but is losing workers, report says Watch the ‘DocuMNtary’ on Minnesota’s growing tech scene A few blocks away, information-technology workers at Minnesota Public Radio confront a similar hurdle. About 200 Apple Macintosh computers also require the same kind of ongoing attention, which seemingly takes an eternity for an IT worker having to move from machine to machine while doing basic maintenance. Wouldn’t it be cool — and more productive — if an IT staffer at either company could simply push a button and upgrade dozens of iPads or Macs, all at once, from anywhere? Actually, that’s exactly what they do, courtesy of technology from a Minneapolis-based company called Jamf. Founded in 2002, Jamf caters to corporate Apple-hardware administrators who need their drudge work to be largely automated for massive time savings. Former Jamf CEO stays true to St. Paul roots Jamf is, by many metrics, a success. Its tools for streamlining the maintenance of Mac, iPad and iPhone fleets are now in active use by more than 9,200 organizations — up from roughly 6,500 in 2015 — that collectively manage more than 7 million Apple devices. Jamf says it now has $100-million in annual billings with a 95-percent customer-retention rate. But Jamf — known until recently as JAMF Software — also faced a bit of an identity crisis. NEW NAME, NEW IDENTITY The “software” in its former name became inaccurate as its newer tools became Web-based — requiring no traditional software to be installed on any device. Jamf’s automation tools for Apple-device administrators include Jamf Now, a lower-cost and Web-based offerings for smaller companies without dedicated information-technology staffers. (Courtesy of Jamf) The company’s product line also suffered from identity confusion. It’s higher-end Casper Suite software for larger organizations and more-complicated Apple-device deployments seemingly had little to do with Bushel, a lower-end and Web-centric offering for small companies without dedicated IT staffs. Jamf chief executive Dean Hager said a customer who was familiar with Casper often had no idea Bushel exists, or vice versa. This problem, though not necessarily a company crippler, is the sort of situation that could impair growth over the long run, he said. The importance of crystal-clear branding can’t be understated, he insists. GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE So, when more than 1,200 Apple-network managers from around the world recently met up at Minneapolis’ Guthrie Theater for the seventh annual JAMF Nation User Conference, Hager had news for the attendees: The company would henceforth be known as Jamf — just Jamf with no all-capital letters nor “software” in the name. Along those lines, Casper Suite would now be known as Jamf Pro, while Bushel would be dubbed Jamf Now. The company wants customers to eventually say, “We use Jamf,” regardless of which specific product they’re using. (Hager admits this could take a while.) Jamf clearly is not doing too badly, he added, if this was one of the biggest problems on its plate. PROMISES AHEAD Hager previously CEO of Eden Prairie-based Kroll Ontrack, came on board as Jamf CEO in June 2015. He replaced the company’s founder and co-chief executive, Zach Halmstad, and co-CEO Chip Pearson. Both remain at the company as majority shareholders and board members with some non-management duties thrown in. Dean Hager, CEO of Minneapolis-based Jamf, speaks at the company’s recent user conference at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. (Courtesy of Jamf) Given his newcomer status, Hager said he’s spent the past 16 months doing more listening and learning than making major changes, given that “Jamf was on a terrific trajectory.” The company, he said, is poised for further growth given a couple of industry trends. First, he said, companies of all sizes are increasingly permitting their employees to choose what kinds of computers and mobile gear they wield on the job — and Apple hardware is enormously popular among workers, as it is in the general population. Second, he added, iPads are huge in schools — and about 3,700 Jamf customers are K-12 districts. It is in the educational sphere, however, that Jamf faces potential peril over the longer term. Simplified, Web-centric laptops known as “Chromebooks” — dependant on a variant of Google’s Chrome browser — have increasingly eclipsed iPads and even Macs in K-12 education. Hager said he is not worried, and sees no Chromebook impact on his company’s bottom line at the moment, but acknowledges this is a trend to pay attention to. Meanwhile, he’s delighted to trot out the latest customer success stories. One of the company’s marquee announcements at its recent user conference involves the Jacobs Medical Center at the University of California, San Diego. The medical center is said to be the first with Apple devices (iPads paired with Apple TV video-streaming gadgets that are hooked up to TVs) in every patient room. The facility is using Jamf Pro to run the Apple-device deployment. This, among other things, will allow the patients to use the Apple gear both for entertainment and for accessing their medical details. The tablets will be erased when a patient departs, protecting that person’s sensitive data. Jamf is even going into orbit, Hager added. In a first for the firm, a NASA tech worker used Jamf tools on the ground to manage an iPad aboard the International Space Station, he said. WHAT CLIENTS SAY In St. Paul, meanwhile, a couple of Jamf customers swear by the company’s offerings. Josh Kielbasa, an IT specialist at the Minnesota Wild, said Jamf Pro has been invaluable for managing the organization’s fleet of iPads. Some of these are in the hands of employees and others are in the arena’s suites for visitors to use as TV-control gizmos. “On such a large campus and so diverse in the different uses of the iPads, this allows us to not have to keep walking around to change different features on the devices,” Kielbasa said. “It makes it a one-location kind of thing, and saves a lot of time for us,” he said. “For me personally, I can get on my laptop and make changes on the fly without having to physically touch any iPads. This saves a ton of time.” At Minnesota Public Radio, IT workers keep tabs on 130 Macs in St. Paul and 70 in Los Angeles. The broadcaster has been using Jamf Pro for nearly two years. “It has made our software management much better,” said Joe Juvland, information technology service desk manager. “This is definitely a relief.” Juvland said he loves Jamf tools so much that he wonders when the company might enter the PC market so the broadcaster can keep better tabs on its 800 or so Windows computers. That would be never, Hager said. “That would be watering down the support we have for our Apple customer bases,” he said.

And as the number of paid subscribers for such services increases, companies are coming out with offerings that can look very similar at first glance. But like with most other things, there is always the fine print, and it is best you look at some of the finer points before you decide the service that works the best for your needs. Here is a ready reckoner on the features and distinctions of some of the more popular music streaming services, listed in alphabetical order. Amazon Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant waded into the music streaming business, almost as a way to boost its Echo hardware. The company already had a music streaming service, Amazon Music, for its Prime customers but the offering started earlier this year caters to non-Prime customers as well. For $10 a month ($8 a month for Prime customers), users can listen to unlimited music. The Amazon Echo, a voice-controlled virtual assistant, is seen at its product launch for Britain and Germany in London, Sept. 14, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Peter Hobson However, the service also has a cheaper version if you own Amazon’s voice-controlled Echo device. This service costs $4 a month for access to “tens of millions” of songs which can be skipped unlimited number of times without any ads in between them. There is also a recommendation engine, as well as the option to create automatic and hand-made playlists. If you are already a Prime customer and don’t want to pay for streaming music, you still get access to over two million songs without any ads. Prime customers can also download tracks for offline listening. Apple The company that created the iPhone has only one standard plan for all its users which costs the usual $10 a month for individual subscribers. Tens of millions of songs without any interruptions from ads can be accessed across Apple devices you own. Music can also be heard offline on Apple Music too.

The discounted offering is available in select countries only. Apple Music also offers a three-month free trial period. Pandora The internet radio service comes in two variants, one a free service that, much like a radio station, is punctuated with ads, and the other a paid service, called Pandora Plus, that costs $5 a month for ad-free music. The mobile version, called Pandora One, costs the same. DJ Hesta Prynn performs at the Pandora Summer Party at the Concord Music Hall.

The music users hear changes depending on how they vote the tracks the service plays for them. The skips in Pandora One are not unlimited, but are more than the free service. There is also a new offline mode that switches to one of users’ preferred stations if they lose connectivity. The service is also available only in a handful of countries. Slacker Radio Along with Amazon, at $4 a month, this is the cheapest of the services listed in this article, but unlike the Amazon service, this doesn’t require any specific hardware. The paid package gives users ad-free music with unlimited skipping of tracks, as well as news and ESPN radio. There is also a $10 a month option that also allows jumping to specific parts of songs, creation of playlists and some other benefits.

A special touch is that music on its stations is curated by real people instead of by machines or algorithms. It is available only in U.S. and Canada. Spotify Related Stories Spotify Launches In Japan Amazon Launches Music Unlimited Service Options from the Swedish company include three offerings, one free, the other a discount for students and the third a regular paid service. The free service, paid for by advertising between songs, does not support on-demand listening on mobile devices, and shuffling tracks allows only six skips every hour.

"There was this presumption that we were too dumb to get it," said the Ford Motor Co. executive chairman and great-grandson of auto pioneer Henry Ford. "The conversation has really shifted." Bloomberg photo by Bradley C. Bower.   Keith Naughton, Alex Webb and Mark Bergen Bloomberg     Bill Ford is tired of hearing the future of cars belongs to Silicon Valley. Yet for years, the Apple and Google crowd have been telling him that only Big Tech can make driverless vehicles. "There was this presumption that we were too dumb to get it," said the Ford Motor Co. executive chairman and great-grandson of auto pioneer Henry Ford. "The conversation has really shifted." He's not kidding. Tech giants Apple and Alphabet's Google, once intent on disrupting, if not destroying, Detroit, have concluded for now that they don't want to build cars. Sure, they still bank on supplying the autonomous software that will drive robot rides, but the concession that they're not up to the complex task of mass production tilts the balance of power to traditional automakers. Vehicle manufacturing is a massive undertaking. There is the metal bending and assembly, a highly evolved process in itself. Car companies also integrate millions of lines of code that control everything from the radio to the radar sensors that will soon allow hands-free driving. Detroit also has deep experience managing the long chain of suppliers that provide roughly 30,000 parts. All that complexity is "something a lot of I.T. companies getting into the business realized the hard way," James Kuffner, former head of Google Robotics and now chief technology officer at the Toyota Research Institute, said. "Despite what a venture capitalist tells you, making a car is hard." Google Co-Founder Larry Page came to that conclusion when he confided in a private discussion earlier this year he was heartbroken by the slow pace of the company's self-driving car project, said a person familiar with the meeting. Though Google began its autonomous-driving efforts well before other tech companies, its project has been plagued by uncertainty around its business model and executive departures. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. Automakers, meanwhile, are pouring billions into developing their own self-driving systems. They're already installing semiautonomous features, such as automatic braking and technology to keep a car in its lane. And they're working on building models that can withstand the punishing workload expected of robot taxis, which will likely amass 130,000 miles a year -- 10 times today's total -- as they run 18 hours a day, 365 days a year. The robot rides will be replaced often and sold in high numbers, providing a big payoff for manufacturers that figure out the formula. "The old conversation I used to have was, 'You guys are going to end up being the handset, you're going to be low-margin assemblers of other people's cool technology,'" Ford said. "We don't want to be the handset. And we won't be." That's not to say auto companies haven't tried working with Silicon Valley. Volvo Cars is providing sport utility vehicles to Uber Technologies Inc. for testing as robot taxis in Pittsburgh. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is supplying Google with 100 minivans for transformation into self-driving people haulers. Those deals could herald larger alliances. "Eventually, the incumbents and the disrupters will need to get together," said Scott Corwin, who advises tech companies and automakers at Deloitte Consulting. "No single company has the resources or the know-how to put all the pieces together." For now, the two industries view each other with suspicion. Each wants to stake its own claim to a driverless future and reap the rewards. Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors Co. and Ford have all conducted extensive talks with tech giants such as Google or Apple but in every case failed to come up with a way to share power. "It's amazing to see these two sides. They look at each other and there's fear and greed," said Evan Hirsh, an auto-executive adviser at Strategy&, a PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting group. "They really don't understand each other." Tech companies believe they could boost anemic margins in auto making if they had access to vehicle-performance data that would allow for more efficient manufacturing. Car companies control that data now and are unlikely to release it to a competitor. However the power-sharing arrangement shakes out, no single company will "own the brain" of the autonomous car, said Swamy Kotagiri, chief technology officer of Magna International, a veteran contract manufacturer that will build the BMW 5-Series. Automakers probably will control safety systems, while tech companies will handle "enjoyment, convenience and comfort data," such as Apple's CarPlay dashboard infotainment system, he said. Where automakers come up short is attracting sufficient numbers of software engineers, which they lack by the thousands. Technology now represents half the cost of a car, according to Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association. But luring tech talent away from Silicon Valley hasn't been easy. "Talk to any automaker or big supplier, and they will all tell you they are woefully lacking in software-development capabilities," Hirsh said. "They can't hire." Car companies are trying to fix that. GM's $1 billion acquisition of self-driving startup Cruise Automation has helped the automaker attract talent, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told a tech conference in Detroit last month. Meanwhile, GM and Ford are expanding their Silicon Valley research labs, but their presence and reputation still lags the tech players. That's why U.S. automakers and suppliers are working hard to develop the Detroit area as a competing center of autonomous automotive development, with robot-car test tracks and R&D facilities. "In Silicon Valley, the auto industry is a small player in a big pond," Matt Simoncini, CEO of auto supplier Lear Corp., said on October 18 at the dedication of a $10 million innovation center in Detroit. "And then you come back here. We are 'the' player in this pond." --With assistance from Alistair Barr Article Comments (0) Tweet This article filed under: Business Autos Technology Bloomberg Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Falling on 25 and 28 November, they give deal-savvy shoppers the chance to snap up tech, electricals, clothes, homewares, and Christmas gifts at lower prices. Although last year Apple didn't discount its products on Black Friday or Cyber Monday - as part of its mission to be "good to... employees" - shoppers were still able to snap up deals through other retailers. Which is just as well, as many of us can only afford a shiny new upgrade when the prices are slashed. I'm so cheap I've had the money for a new Apple laptop but I'm waiting till Black Friday to get a good deal.— vaniaaa (@LynetteCruz896) October 4, 2016 I want the new iPhone 7 and Apple Watch! 😍 I'll treat myself on Black Friday 😇— m.a (@miriamxo_) September 8, 2016 What iPhone deals can we expect this year? It's still a little early to tell what discounts will be out there this year, but we can guess what's in store based on 2015's offers. If you're considering splashing out on the latest iPhone 7, read the Telegraph's review first. Every iPhone ranked: from worst to best Carphone Warehouse As well as selling an iPhone contract every three seconds last year, the mobile phone retailer also slashed the prices off loads of their network-specific offers. They knocked £33 off their £50-per-month Vodafone iPhone 5S offer, £17.51 off their £50-per-month EE iPhone 6 offer, and gave out the iPhone 6  for free with their £28.50-per-month O2 offer. Black Friday shoppers get TOO excited over cheap towels Play! 01:11 Giff Gaff On a monthly contracts over 24 months, Giff Gaff reduced the Apple iPhone 5S 16GB price from £329 to £299 (with customers paying £13.69 monthly). They also lowered the Apple iPhone 5S 32GB price from £399 to £379 (with customers paying £17.36 monthly). And for Apple Watches? Last year the coveted Apple Watch was on sale at John Lewis for £399, Amazon for £309.99, and KRCS for £896.02. This year the second Apple Watch came out, so with a newer model on the market, there could well be discounts on the original.  The 2016 model has upgraded GPS connectivity, is 50 per cent faster and has an improved battery though, so fingers crossed that one is on offer too. It's also swim-proof. The watches are available in aluminium, gold and stainless steel as well as a ceramic material. The pearl-like shiny case is four times stronger than stainless steel.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 30, 2016 at 7:00AM One of the more high-profile instances of an activist investor pushing for change was when Carl Icahn put the pressure on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) . The billionaire head of Icahn Enterprises successfully pushed Apple to boost its share repurchase program to return capital to investors. In this clip from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and Evan Niu, CFA, discuss how Icahn got what he wanted. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 21, 2016. Dylan Lewis: I think "distraction" cues us up perfectly for a discussion on some cons for activist investors. When you said distraction, the first thing that came to mind for me was Carl Icahn and Apple. It seemed like, when he had a stake in that company, every two months we were seeing a new valuation. Evan Niu: And a new letter. Lewis: "I think shares are worth $900!" It was just every day in the news, that's what they were talking about. That becomes kind of a nuisance for management. Niu: It is. I think, in Icahn's case, he's kind of a ruthless activist investor. He had a big position, and of course, a big position in Apple means 2% or 3% of the company. Lewis: Yeah, I think he was just under 1%. Niu: Yeah, it's single digits. There's no way that anyone is buying 10% of Apple. Lewis: Which is tens of billions of dollars, for that position. Niu: Yeah, no one has the money for that. I think, in Apple's case, the specific thing that he was gunning after, which was this really big push for capital returns ... Lewis: Via buybacks. Niu: Right, buybacks and dividends. I think that was a very valid cause, because Apple had been getting criticized for years about that. Their cash position had grown ridiculously large, unjustifiably. You can't justify having that much cash. Again, as a public investor, you're just sitting there, and you're like, "Guys, come on, you have way too much cash." But a public investor can't do anything about it. That's not to say that Apple doesn't know better. I think Apple was just being stingy at the time, choosing to do that. They had already started a buyback program, but Icahn came in here and really pushed them to make it bigger and really meaningful. Of course, they didn't listen to exactly what he said. But I think he was successful at getting them to increase it, in which case, it's definitely a good thing for investors, because otherwise, investors have no recourse to get Apple to start giving back all this money that's just idly on the balance sheet doing nothing, earning really crappy returns. Lewis: And his pitch was basically, "Shares are criminally undervalued and you have all this cash. You should be buying back shares." I think the number that he threw out there was a $150 billion share-repurchase program. Niu: Something like that. Lewis: We've seen, in the last couple years, I think he began his position in 2013 and exited in 2015, he had about a two-year holding period. During that time, we saw the company acquiesce to that a little bit, and decide, "We're going to be buying back shares at a pretty significant clip." It obviously wasn't to the extreme that he'd been hoping for. Niu: I think, right now, they have bought back about $120 billion, so far, total. Which is a pretty crazy number in itself. That's a megacap company. They just bought back a megacap company. But, I think, in the example of this cash thing specifically, having too much cash really does affect some of your financial metrics, too. Think about, for example, return on assets. If you have all this cash just sitting out there, and your asset number is humongous ... Lewis: And you're not returning anything on that. Niu: Right, and you're not giving back to shareholders, then your net income ratio to your assets is now smaller. So, your return on assets, return on equity, all these important financial metrics that investors look at to judge the performance of the company are now being artificially deflated because you have a ridiculous amount of cash, and that cash is not doing anything. So, there are a lot of meaningful ways this impacts things. Beyond, when they start to buy back, then you get earnings creation. I think he did a good job in terms of really getting them to do something that needed to be done that was holding them back. Dylan Lewis owns shares of Apple. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

The company is now offering the handset in the Galaxy Note 7's exclusive Blue Coral color option.  ( SamMobile ) Advertisement Samsung has just announced it will offer a new color in its Galaxy S7 edge lineup. The Blue Coral color option that was exclusive to the now-recalled Galaxy Note 7 is now available on the curved display of the Galaxy S7 edge. When Apple officially announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September, the company removed its Space Gray color option and added two new hues to its flagship iPhones: Jet Black, which features a glossy black aluminum case; and Black, which is a more toned-down matte black hue that doesn't attract fingerprints and scratches like Jet Black. New Colors Sell New Phones As expected, the two new color options Apple introduced that are exclusive to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus immediately sold out when Apple opened up preorders on its online store. New color iPhones are usually the most popular choice with iPhone fans, since it allows them to proclaim to the world that they have latest and greatest iPhone without having to shout it out. Samsung experienced the same issue when it released the Galaxy Note 7 in August and offered the phablet in an exclusive Blue Coral color option. The color was so popular that it caused a delay in national retail availability, with many customers having to wait three weeks or more to get the blue Note 7. Galaxy Note 7 Blue Coral Coming To Galaxy S7 Edge Since Samsung is no longer selling the Galaxy Note 7, it has decided to bring a feature that made the now-recalled phablet a popular choice. Samsung has officially announced that it is now offering the Blue Coral Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. As you can see in the image above, the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge uses the same Blue Coral color that was very popular with Note 7 buyers. It features a light blue front and rear and a rose gold trim around its sides. Specs The Samsung Galaxy S7 edge packs in a 5.5-inch 2,560 x 1,440 Quad HD dual-edge curve display, which has a pixel density of 534 pixels per inch and features a waterproof and dust-resistant design. The handset includes a 12-megapixel rear camera with autofocus, OIS (optical image stabilization), ability to capture 4K video and 5-megapixel front-facing camera for selfies and video calls. While the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow, it has already been confirmed to receive an update to Android 7.0 Nougat in the future. It's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, Adreno 530 GPU and a generous 4 GB of RAM. Samsung offers the Galaxy S7 edge in two storage configurations: 32 GB and 64 GB. Users can also increase available space, thanks to the return of a microSD slot, which supports up to 256 GB microSD cards. In terms of battery life, Samsung has included a large 3,600 mAh battery that will provide up to 27 hours of talk time and features Quick Charge 2.0 support and wireless charging out of the box. Availability Samsung will release the Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge in Taiwan and Singapore in November but reports claim Verizon will offer the handset in the near future.

Next-Generation iPhone Could Pack OLED Display, Sharp CEO Claims GO Apple is rumored to switch from LTPS to OLED panels Oct 30, 2016 07:19 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  The iPhone 7 might not be the iPhone of your dreams, but Apple seems to be working hard to make sure that the next-generation one will certainly be mind-blowing. Starting with the overall design and the materials used, Apple plans to make some drastic changes for the upcoming iPhone. According to previous rumors, the next-generation iPhone will feature a “glass sandwich” design, but another improvement could be the addition of an OLED panel. Currently, Apple uses LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) panels inside its iPhones, so the switch to OLED could be a major change for the Cupertino-based company. However, in order for this change to happen, Apple will need loads of OLED panels since the iPhones usually sell by the millions. Sharp is one of Apple's display suppliers, so we could say that the following information comes from a very reliable source. Sharp announced it would ramp up production of OLED panels It appears that Sharp's newly appointed CEO, Tai Jeng-wu, made some interesting remarks towards Apple's future plans for the next-generation iPhone. Tai was holding a speech earlier this week in front of the students at his alma mater Tatung University, when he had the following to say about the iPhone: “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels. We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity.” The official went on to confirm that Sharp plans to build a new OLED facility in Japan, but that his company could start manufacturing OLED panels in the United States if required. Rumors about Apple launching a next-generation iPhone with a flexible OLED display date from back August, but Sharp's CEO is the first official to confirm this possibility. #iPhone 7#iPhone display#Sharp display#OLED panel#iPhone 8 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Next iPhone Could Be Made of Transparent Glass, Unlikely Rumor Claims Apple's Next-Generations iPhone, iPad to Use Flexible OLED Displays iPhone 7 Plus with Wireless Charging and 3,500 mAh Battery Shown in Leaked Photo iPhone 7 to Launch with Fast Charging, Ship with USB-C to Lightning Cable - EXCLUSIVE OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE    Bezel-less iPhone concept new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments iPhone 8 to Launch with Curved 5.0-Inch and 5.8-Inch Displays and No Bezels more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Panic, perhaps Denunciations of the deal by politicians may have weighed less than fear that rivals might pre-empt them with synergy of content production and distribution Want to watch Game of Thrones on your AT&T smartphone? You could be in luck if the proposed merger goes through. Photograph: HBO/2016 Home Box Office, Inc. All Suzanne McGee Sunday 30 October 2016 07.00 EDT Last modified on Sunday 30 October 2016 07.30 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger The dealmakers behind the proposed mega-merger of AT&T and Time Warner have accomplished the impossible: uniting Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their condemnation of the deal. Trump, needless to say, has been the most vituperative. The merger would “destroy democracy”, he said. But pretty much everyone in Washington has publicly come out against it. Sanders, Clinton’s opponent for the Democratic nomination and now campaigning on her behalf, is already preparing to battle a future Clinton administration to ensure that anti-trust regulators turn thumbs-down on the deal. Lining up beside him? Powerhouse senator Elizabeth Warren. The two companies and their bankers must feel that they have walked straight into a buzzsaw. The Senate will hold a hearing on it on 7 December, after the election. Will tempers have cooled by then? Maybe, maybe not. So, what on earth drove Time Warner and AT&T to sprint to the altar during an election season in which populist politicians are dominating the airwaves and the debate? Insanity? Desperation? A sense that there was an opportunity that was just too good to pass up? Or simply an urge to annoy the politicians? The word to bear in mind might simply be “panic”. It’s no shock to anyone who keeps an eye on these worlds that companies that distribute all the content that we consume, and the companies that produce it (translation: AT&T as the party of the first part, and Time Warner as the party of the second part) have a vested interest in forging alliances among themselves. The closer and more seamless those alliances are, the faster and more creatively they can work on developing and delivering more of that content for all our devices, especially those smartphones and tablets from which we are unable to wean ourselves. Those that get it right have captive audiences simply because they are delivering a growing proportion of that content. It’s an enticing prospect. Analysts have been expecting that we’d see yet another wave of convergence – a buzzword in this media/telecommunications universe for the better part of two decades now, having been behind the merger that formed Time Warner itself in 1995 – for several years. This time, it’s happening in different ways, not always via mergers. Apple and Time Warner’s HBO have linked their brands already, with Apple distributing the HBO Now service. Imagine what might happen if Apple – with its cash mountain – decided to snap up HBO’s parent company, Time Warner, and pursue the myriad potential synergies between its own platforms and Time Warner’s content? I suspect it’s safe to say that the folks at AT&T did just that – and panicked. Or else they considered what might happen if another giant rival with the potential to build a mammoth platform and plenty of cash – like Google, which has already pushed into live-TV streaming – pre-empted them. Or they allowed companies like Amazon or Netflix to get further ahead with their own plans. Facing that kind of strategic risk, a little bit of political risk may not look like anything terribly threatening. Sure, the politicians may indulge in a lot of saber rattling for the benefit of voters, especially since the deal was announced in the final days of the presidential election campaign. But it will be many months before regulators will rule on it – even if a deep-pocketed rival doesn’t muscle in and outbid AT&T for Time Warner. Will the public outrage endure? The dealmakers and the board members at both companies seem to be making a calculated decision that the answer is “no”. That seems optimistic. We already pay far more than citizens in most other parts of the world for basic broadband access, thanks to the fact that most communities offer very limited options to their citizens. Most telecommunications services are equally pricey, relative to those offered elsewhere, from mobile phones to cable television services. The number of cord-cutters continue to grow. What will AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner mean for customers? Read more The two companies have an idea of what they’ll do to keep their own customers loyal. “Premium content always wins,” said Randall Stephenson, CEO and chairman of AT&T, in the company’s press release announcing the transaction. “We’ll have the world’s best premium content with the networks to deliver it to every screen. A big customer pain point is paying for content once but not being able to access it on any device, anywhere. Our goal is to solve that.” At what price, though? Stephenson does refer to delivering “value” to customers, and certainly, you can expect to hear Time Warner and AT&T insist that because their proposed match is a “vertical” merger rather than a “horizontal” one, this should pose less of an antitrust threat. In other words, consumers won’t see prices soar as a result of reduced competition. In a horizontal transaction, two companies that compete to provide roughly the same kind of services or goods (think, Cox Communications and Comcast), merge and become one, meaning that there are fewer entities involved in setting prices for content as purchasers, or for services as providers. In a vertical transaction, such as the proposed merger, companies that are in different parts of the business (in this case, content and distribution) join forces. But in markets where competition is already restricted – such as, say, the internet – price increases could be a result of even vertical mergers. That’s the conclusion of studies by one economist, John Kwoka of Northeastern University, who found that of the 1,000 mergers of all kinds that he evaluated over the last two decades, at least a third generated price increases in excess of 10%. A remarkable 80% of them raised prices to consumers to some degree; the average increase was about 7%. Ponder that, antitrust regulators. There are plenty of ways in which this could happen. For instance, all of the programming that Time Warner produces could suddenly become unavailable to competitors to the newly merged entity’s rival distributors, except at a much higher price. You have an AT&T smartphone and want to watch the latest episode of Game of Thrones? Congrats – you can do so on any device you own for half the price you’d pay if you have a Verizon phone and want to watch on your iPad. It’s up to the politicians not just to be blowhards about the deal or threaten to axe it. Consumers may end up with great, efficiently delivered and fairly priced content as a result of mergers like the one that AT&T and Time Warner are proposing. The trick is to ensure how that potential is realized. Will the regulators do their job? That’s why what happens in the weeks following the election is going to be so crucial. Who will the new president choose to advise her (or him) on issues like commerce and telecommunications? Who will (s)he tap for membership on the Federal Trade Commission (which governs antitrust issues) and the Federal Communications Commission (which oversees telecommunications policy, and of which the next president must name a new chairman), two of the key regulators associated with this industry? Regulators have the ability to lay down the law and make the deal much more consumer-friendly in any number of ways, demanding (for instance) that the new company make HBO shows available more readily via apps or streaming, meaning that we wouldn’t be forced to sign up for costly packages. For once, all the heated political rhetoric might come in useful, if it ensures that the regulators keep their eye on the ball. I wish I was confident that the attention span of outraged politicians was as long as that of the strategic thinkers and panicky dealmakers – but I’m not.

Speeds will be so fast -- 5G and WiGig -- and the chipsets so cheap and plentiful that everything from your coffee maker to your garage door opener will have them embedded by default. Even your charging cable may go away, when and if we ever get a single wireless charging standard. In the meantime: you've got cables and wires. Lots of them. And they all probably fit into a different-shaped port. That's the world that Apple's new MacBook Pros are coming into. Ironically, after pulling the headphone jack from its iPhone 7, Apple left it in its new laptops. But aside from that old-fashioned 3.5mm jack, the only connector you'll find on Apple's latest and greatest laptops is USB-C. Depending on which model you choose, you get two or four of the tiny ports, all of which offer the Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth and connectivity. Apple's full-on embrace of Thunderbolt 3 is great. Thunderbolt 3 is extremely fast and versatile and really is the connection port of the future. On the other hand, we're still living in a present where port standards like HDMI, the SD card slot, and especially regular old USB-A ports -- those rectangular ones that have been around for 20 years or so -- are still widely used by the vast majority of devices. Which means, buying a MacBook Pro right now is to invest in a variety of adapters for all your legacy devices. But before we delve too deeply into the cons, let's take a closer look at the pros of this decision. One port, one cable for everything Last year Intel announced that Thunderbolt 3 would use the same port type as USB-C. Meaning that depending on the type of device connected to it, every Thunderbolt 3 port will also work as a USB-C port and every Thunderbolt 3 cable will work as a USB-C cable and vice versa (as long as you get a qualitative USB-C cable.) When working as Thunderbolt 3, the port delivers up to 40Gbps bandwidth and as USB-C, up to 10Gbps. Both types of connections allow for the delivery of data, audio and video, making it by far the fastest and most flexible peripheral port to date. Plug in a Thunderbolt 3 device to a new MacBook, and file transfer speeds will be so quick that the write speed of the storage will be the only thing holding you back. And with the right adapter, you can output video to HDMI, VGA, DVI, DisplayPort or pretty much anything else under the sun. It's also important to note that USB-C supports bidirectional charging. This means not only can you now can say goodbye the the MagSafe charging adapter on the new MacBooks, you can also use the laptop to charge any peripheral device connected to it or use a peripheral device to charge the laptop. So you really only need one power adapter, no matter how many devices you use with your laptop, including those that would normally require a separate power source, which is awesome. When Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C are the only port types used in peripheral devices, you won't need to carry more than one type of cable with you. Just a few USB-C cables will connect everything. Just think about how convenient it is! Dongle and accessory madness But that future is still quite far away; for now, there are myriad peripheral devices that still require the USB-A connector (legacy standard USB), like portable drives, SD card readers, most smartphones and so on. This means you'll need to get an accessory or dongle adapter before you can use them. If the new laptops retained just one regular USB type-A port, this wouldn't be such a big deal and would greatly ease the pain of the transition. Keep in mind that this is the first time the MacBook Pro has gotten USB-C; prior to this the 12-inch MacBook was the only Apple computer that used USB-C. Apple's fastest growing product category. pic.twitter.com/d1sel4N5Yc— Drew Breunig (@dbreunig) October 28, 2016 And the number of ports itself is also significant. Even in the case of the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models (13- and 15-inch), the ones with 4 Thunderbolt/USB-C ports, that's still not enough ports to comfortably suit many people's needs. Just look at your computer right now and count how many things are currently plugged in. (And remember: there's no more MagSafe port, either; if you want to charge your new MacBook, a USB-C power cable will occupy one of those precious ports.) For me personally: a charging cable, a portable backup drive, a smartphone, an SD card, and a thumbdrive, and at times an external monitor. And while the new MacBooks compare pretty favorably to the MacBook Air (two USB, a Thunderbolt 2 port for external video, plus MagSafe charging, and 3.5mm headphone), they're a far cry from the previous (albeit still available) MacBook Pro 15-inch, which has a total of 7 ports (two USB, two Thunderbolt 2, HDMI, SD, MagSafe and headphone). For power users -- the very folks looking for a "Pro" laptop -- that's already limiting. The iPhone paradox However, it's iPhone users who'll suffer most. When the iPhone 7 was first announced, I was extremely disappointed by its lack of USB-C support -- Apple still opted to use its proprietary Lightning connector instead. And now this means that you can't connect the phone to any of the new MacBook Pros, without an adapter. You could skip the adapter and get Apple's Lightning to USB-C cable for $25. That will solve the connection problem, but then you'll need to carry at least two types of cables when traveling. So much for the future where only a single type of cable is necessary. (Apple didn't immediately reply to my request for comment on why it had made this decision.) This whole ordeal is rife with irony. With its computers, Apple is now one of the biggest supporters of USB-C. But at the same time, it bars its flagship smartphone from natively using this port, which just doesn't make sense to me. But even taking the iPhone out of the equation, the abrupt move -- from no USB-C on the MacBook Pros at all to going all USB-C and nothing else -- feels premature. Apple is treating a relatively distant future as if it were already here. And as a result it may have taken its shot way too soon.

December 12, 2015 AAPL: 113.18 -2.99 Review: Apple’s USB 3 Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader offers only modest speed benefits, for now Jeremy Horwitz - 11 months ago @horwitz iOS Devices Apple Lightning SD Card Reader Lightning to SD Card Reader Comments (27) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Three years ago, Apple released the original Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader, a larger, faster, and more expensive version of a Camera Connection Kit component it had previously developed for Dock Connector iPads. When I tested it back in 2012, I noted that the reader was working 3 times faster than its predecessor when used with the then-current iPad (4th-Gen), and 50% faster with the original iPad mini. Since then, iPads have only gotten faster, while the Reader has stayed unchanged. This week, Apple subtly replaced the accessory with the Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader (USB 3), which carries the same $29 price and arrives in a nearly identical box. As the parentheses suggest, the new Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader is capable of running at USB 3 speeds if the connected iPad supports USB 3 — for now, only the iPad Pro does — but it’s backward-compatible with earlier USB 2 iPads, and thanks to iOS 9.2, both old and new Readers now work with iPhones. If you have an iPad Pro, or plan to get a new Apple device in the future, the new version should be a no-brainer purchase over its predecessor, though other options (such as Eye-Fi’s excellent wireless SD cards, reviewed here) can eliminate the need for card readers altogether, even if they operate at slower speeds… Key Details: A slightly larger and, for now, slightly faster SD Card reader with a Lightning connector Works with iPads and iPhones iPad Pro transfer speeds are somewhat faster with new model Earlier devices and iPhones will see very little difference, for now Breaking with historic (but not universal) Apple practice, the USB 3 version of the Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader is — like the fourth-generation Apple TV — noticeably but not importantly larger than its predecessor when they’re placed next to each other. Measuring 5.2″ long by 1.2″ wide and 0.3″ thick (versus 4.6″ long by 1.2″ wide by 0.27″ thick), the new Reader has a longer and slightly thicker SD Card chassis, as well as a thicker cable leading to its Lightning connector, both parts no doubt in service of hidden USB 3 components inside. Interestingly, the changes aren’t obvious from the packaging, so you’ll need to look carefully to make sure you get the right version. Apple’s new box looks virtually identical to the old one, this time oddly leaving off the SD Card icon that’s found on the top of both Readers, and indicating the new version’s presence only in tiny print on a bottom-edge sticker. The new version is labeled as “MJYT2AM/A Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader (USB 3),” model A1595. There’s no reference to iPad Pro or iPhone support on the box, or in the instruction manual. Even the image on the front of the box looks like the old version. The user experience is mostly the same between the two accessories. Plug the card reader into your iPad or iPhone, and nothing happens. But insert an SD Card and the Photos app will launch automatically, switching to a newly-added Import tab. Press a button and the import process will start, blazing through even high-resolution photos at a rapid clip. To really test the “Pro” potential of the new USB 3 Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader, I decided to use a very large DSLR photo collection — 1,107 photos, each taken at a resolution roughly twice as high as Apple’s best still cameras, for a total of 6.83GB. I timed each transfer with the USB 3 Reader on three different devices, then after deleting and purging the photos, repeated the process with the USB 2 version. Perhaps not surprisingly, the only device where I saw a meaningful speed difference was the iPad Pro, which took 6 minutes and 15 seconds with the USB 3 Reader versus 7 minutes flat with the USB 2 Reader. Running the same test with an iPad Air 2, the USB 2 version took a meaningless 5 seconds longer than the 12 minutes and 15 seconds of the USB 3 version. And the iPhone 6s Plus took only 1 second longer with USB 2 than the 6 minutes and 39 seconds required by the USB 3 Reader. My takeaway from these tests is that, for now, a given iOS device’s CPU performance has more of an impact on transfer time than USB performance; the real difference between the A9X-based iPad Pro and A8X-based iPad Air 2 was, as can be seen from the A9 iPhone’s speed, not USB 3. But as iPads get faster and add USB 3 support, the new Reader will likely continue to widen the gap over the prior one. If you routinely use large memory cards with lots of pictures, the minutes saved with the new Reader and iPad Pro will start to add up. One other thing worth mentioning in light of the SD Card Camera Reader’s addition of iPhone support is the significant battery drain you can expect to see when using the accessory. On an iPad, you probably won’t even notice a drop in power unless you’re doing super huge photo dumps. But on the iPhone 6s Plus — with one of the largest phone batteries Apple has ever shipped — the battery dropped by 1% for each minute the SD Card Camera Reader was in use. The impact on smaller iPhone batteries is likely to be larger, and this is a key reason Apple previously declined to let these accessories work with its pocket devices.   So is the USB 3 Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader fantastic? That depends on the iPad or iPhone you plan to use it with. iPad Pro users should preferentially seek it out if they want to achieve peak transfer speeds, while everyone else can — for now — comfortably keep using the prior version, which performs almost identically at its sole task. I personally have strongly come to prefer the convenience of using wireless SD Cards including Eye-Fi’s excellent Mobi and Pro X2 series, which eliminate the need for Lightning readers in favor of automated Wi-Fi transfers as I snap photos. But if raw speed is what you need, the latest Lightning to SD Card Camera Reader is fairly priced at $29, and worth considering.

With such a small gain in speed I now don’t see the point in Apple incorporating USB 3 with this generation of iPad Pro. I suppose it’s nice to have but its more USB 2.25 than 3 speed wise. LikeLike srgmac - 11 months ago Reply They put USB 3 on the iPad Pro so it would be faster to transfer stuff to the iPad from a host PC. The bottleneck here, is the SD card itself. SD cards are slow by nature — there are fast ones, but they are expensive. LikeLike Scott Bryant - 11 months ago The bottleneck could be the reader if it’s not UHS-II capable. The latest SD cards are capable of up to 300 MB/s read speeds. I guess expensive is relative. I just bought a Lexar 32GB, 1000X (150 mb/s) card on sale for $18. If the iPad Pro is, indeed, going to be a tool for professionals, it doesn’t make sense to manufacture an obsolete card reader.

LikeLike Graham J - 11 months ago Reply I think you’re missing something here. Only the iPad Pro has usb3 so that’s why it’s the only device that benefits from the new device. With any other device you’re comparing usb2 and usb2 so the speeds will naturally be similar. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 11 months ago Reply You mean the key point that was mentioned in the second paragraph. Right? LikeLike Graham J - 11 months ago No, I mean the paragraph where you mention all the tests and come to the conclusion that transfers are CPU bound. Having similar results between the two units on all devices except the iPad Pro suggests that USB speed is the limiting factor. On the iPad pro it’s probably sustained NAND write speeds that hold back the USB3 unit. LikeLike Graham J - 11 months ago Ok I read that paragraph a couple more times and see what you mean. The absolute times tell a different story than the differences. NAND limits all around I’d say. LikeLike freediverx - 11 months ago Reply I’m very skeptical of the Eye-Fi Mobie cards. I’ve read numerous complaints that these cards place a significant strain on your camera’s battery life, that they don’t live up to their Class 10 read/write speed rating (which slows down your burst shooting speeds), and that the gee-whiz benefit of doing wireless transfers does not compensate for molasses slow transfer speeds and sometimes finicky connections. I own a couple of Canon cameras with built-in WiFi yet I rarely use the feature because it’s much faster and easier to swap out an SD card then to fiddle around with the connection functions and wait for a slow file transfer, while denying my computer or mobile phone access to the internet via WiFi.) LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 11 months ago Reply I’ve been using Eye-fi cards for years, and the Mobi series most recently. It comes as no shock to most photographers that adding a wi-fi transmitter to a DSLR will impact battery life, or that the cards (particularly older ones) aren’t rocket fast. Speed is, as noted, the key potential penalty you pay for using one. I have never found the connections to be finicky, either in an office setting or used in the field, and I’ve used them extensively in both settings. The convenience of having photos flow instantaneously from your camera, literally as they are shot, to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac is just fantastic. It’s not some “gee-whiz benefit” – that’s a trivialization of a key feature that millions of people use and love. Eye-fi has been an integral part of my personal and professional workflow, and given the choice between frequently pulling cards out for readers or using Eye-fi cards, there’s no contest. LikeLiked by 1 person freediverx - 11 months ago Sounds like you’re confirming that these things do kill your camera’s (and your smartphone’s) battery life and slow down continuous shooting because they don’t live up to their Class 10 rating. It’s not my place to tell you what solution works best for you, but I would argue that for some use cases the benefits won’t justify the drawbacks. It may be that you have a very specific use workflow for professional photo work where these things come in very handy. But I still sense that the more typical use case – a person on the go who needs to multitask while depending on both their camera and their smartphone – is ill served by a product that diminishes battery performance while essentially crippling many of your smartphone’s features while in use. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 11 months ago Really not sure what point you’re still trying to make here. The review said clearly that the SD Card Reader is the solution to choose if speed is important to you. And as I said, Eye-Fi’s ability to wirelessly, immediately share images to an iPad or iPhone in the field has been a complete game-changer for my photography (as well as many other users’). Suggesting that it cripples ‘many’ smartphone features while in use is such a radical misstatement of reality that it’s obvious you’ve never used one. If anything, it enhances the phone’s ability to share incredible pictures, anywhere, under any conditions. It’s also obvious that ‘for some use cases’ one will be a better pick than the other. If you prefer to immediately receive each photo as it’s shot, Eye-Fi is great; if you like to transfer photos in big batches, and don’t mind pulling your card to do so, the SD Card Reader is better. Both options have impacts on battery performance, just as using your iPhone to record videos or transfer big batches of DSLR photos using the Reader will have a different impact than recording videos on a camcorder or sending over one photo at a time with Eye-Fi. What you call ‘ill served’ is really just based on your value judgment as to how people use cameras. And I honestly have no idea why you care so much to tell other people what will and won’t work for them. LikeLike PhilBoogie - 11 months ago I actually use both: larger SD card in slot one with RAWs and I put a Eye-Fi in slot 2, where the same photo goes to -but in .jpg- and I’ll have instant access to photos on a larger screen than the small one on the DSLR. At home, I plug the SD Card with RAWs into my MP and import…into Aperture (OSX Photos is waaaay too buggy) LikeLike olsenconsulting - 6 months ago Reply Great review!

Sharakat Hussain, 26, had bought the £799 iPhone for his sister last month but returned it after she said she did not want the gift. Apple products just got a lot more expensive because of the weak pound The 26-year-old, from Birmingham, was allegedly told that because of the large amount, he’d receive the money through a bank transfer. But after waiting weeks, he still hadn’t received the money. Eventually, he received an email from the tech giant and was stunned when they allegedly asked him to prove he was not the deceased Iraqi dictator. Iraqi Dictator Saddam Hussein was hung in Iraq in 2006 (Picture: Getty Images) He was then told by an admin worker that due to his surname, he could be on a Government’s Denied Parties list, which meant he wasn’t allowed to be sold an iPhone. Apple finally lets us know what’s new with the latest Macbook Sharakat, a father-of-two, told the Sun: ‘I thought the email was spam, I was stunned to learn it was real. I was furious to be linked to Saddam.’ Saddam Hussein was hanged in Iraq in 2006, but for some reason, staff at Apple still managed to mix the two up. The company have reportedly promised to sort out the refund. A spokesperson for Apple told Metro.co.uk: ‘We offer our sincerest apologies to Mr. Hussain. Though we are required to check identity while processing a refund, the letter he received was an error and should not have been sent.’ MORE: Apple just leaked the big secret about the new Macbook – ahead of this week’s launch More Making a Murderer's Brendan Dassey released from prison after 10 years Mysterious green and blue flashes appeared as New Zealand earthquake struck Sponsored13 reasons American ERs are so much sexier than our A&Es British woman, 21, falls nine storeys to her death in Benidorm Sponsored13 coolest children's toys to buy this Christmas Man gets wedding ring stuck on his penis Comments Must read What's trending nowMore trending stories » Shops shouldn’t open on Boxing Day and this is why Mysterious green and blue flashes appeared as New Zealand earthquake struck Making a Murderer's Brendan Dassey released from prison after 10 years NHS accidentally emails everyone in the NHS Good news for world's saddest polar bear as he's removed from shopping centreMore trending stories » VideoMore videos » Couple filmed having sex in the middle of Cardiff nightclub Petition to close shops on Boxing Day CCTV of man related to homophobic attack Ukraine MPs brawlMore videos » YOU ARE HERE: World Home News Sport Lifestyle Entertainment More Blogs Jobs Search Metro Trending Nutshell MetroUK @MetroUK © 2016 Associated Newspapers Limited Powered by WordPress.com VIP Your ad choices Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite map Back to top Get us in your feed Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter

Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 04:17 / GMT - 00:47 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sun Oct 30, 2016 12:6 How to Downgrade from iOS 10.1 to iOS 10: Tips for iPhone and iPad Users Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Apple fans who are running iOS 10.1 have a myriad of reasons to be happy, but some are experiencing performance drops or were simply more content with the previous version of the iOS. We will guide you through an easy downgrade to iOS 10, should you feel that the iOS 10.1 is not your cup of tea. Despite the fact that Apple does not officially support iOS update downgrades, there is a way to accomplish this in iTunes, but the window of opportunity is rather slim. Apple no longer offers users the possibility to install iOS 9.3.5, but downgrading to iOS 10.0.2 is still an option. Downgrade From iOS 10.1 To iOS 10 Read on to see the exact steps required to backpedal to iOS 10. Unfortunately, for those who want to revert to iOS 9.3 from iOS 9.2, this is no longer possible. Also, keep in mind that jailbreak-able variants of iOS cannot be a destination for your downgrades. Back Up First! An important first step in any OS change is to back up your data on your PC or Mac. It should be mentioned that, after a downgrade, the iOS 10.1 backup will not make its way to iOS 10. However, it is better to have your data in backup form, in case the downgrade process misfires. Simply put, downgrading the OS will erase everything from your phone. iOS 10 Update Download And Installation To start the download, plug in to your PC or Mac computer via the Lightning cable and verify that you have the iOS 10.0.2 update file. Here is the official repository, and you can download the appropriate .ipsw files for iOS 10.0.2 from here, for both the iPad and iPhone. Make sure that the table row is green and that next to the Apple Signing Status there is a check mark. If Apple no longer signs iOS 10.0.2, we advise you to stop. Installing iOS 10.0.2 After you download the necessary file to your PC or Mac, make sure to unzip it if necessary. With the mobile device, connect via Lightning cable and open iTunes. Open the device summary page of your iOS carrying phone or tablet. Before you start, disable "Find my iPhone." Tap the "Restore iPhone" button, which will open up a prompt. From there, find and select the iOS 10.0.2 ipsw file you recently downloaded. The installer will notify you that iTunes is about to delete everything on your device and restore your iPhone to iOS 10.0.2. The restore will be Apple-verified. Simply click "Restore" to begin and wait until the process finishes. You now have a clean slate iPhone/iPad running iOS 10.0.2.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

"Shukriya India and everyone who turned out for Friday's launch of iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2!" tweeted CEO Cook. The technology giant launched its new smartphones in India on October 7 at 7pm, ending almost a month-long wait of Apple enthusiasts in the country. With the Chinese market softening, India has become increasingly important for the technology giant. At its recent earnings call, Apple CEO said that iPhone sales in India surged more than 50% in the year ended September, among the few bright spots for the smartphone maker that reported its first annual sales and profit decline in 15 years. "Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity," Cook said during the call. Cook added that India could be as big a market as China and is crucial for the smartphone maker. READ ALSO:How to use all the new messages features in iOS 10 Apple's revenue from Greater China fell 30% year on year and declined 7% in the Americas (among its biggest markets) in the just-ended quarter. The company shipped a record 2.5 million iPhones in India between October 2015 to September 2016, up 56% over the previous year, according to an estimate by Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research. According to a report in Economic Times, the CEO of a leading Indian retail chain said that the sales of the company's newly-launched iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have been very good so far. Following the Galaxy Note 7 debacle for Samsung, Apple is expected to become the country's top smartphone maker in the premium segment — devices costing upwards of Rs 30,000 — in the quarter ending December. Apple is expected to command 60% of the market by volume during the quarter, as per ET estimates. Its share in the overall smartphone market may rebound to 3% by the year end from 1.4% in the September quarter.

But though there aren't many dairy or egg-free products at the junk food chains, there are more vegan options than you may realise. And while some are obvious, others may surprise you. FEMAIL can now reveal the free-from foods that are safe for vegans on meat-heavy menus at two of the UK's biggest fast food chains. MCDONALD'S McDonald's Apple Pie doesn't use a traditional shortcrust pastry, and its batter is dairy and egg free, meaning it's safe for vegans to eat Apple Pie: Traditionally, apple pie is made with shortcrust pastry, which contains eggs. But the apple pie pocket at McDonald's is surprisingly vegan-friendly, as it is dairy and egg free.  Though the restaurant warns it may contain traces of milk, it is made using vegetable oil and does not contain any animal products. However, the restaurant does not include it on its vegetarian menu, as there is a very small possibility that the oil used to fry the pie has come into contact with the oil used to cook chicken and fish products. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next You CAN have your burger and eat it! The healthiest items on... He's not lovin' it! Man is left groaning in pain after... Share this article Share In a statement on its website, it explains: 'Due to the design of the oil filtration system there is a small chance the oil used to fry the Apple Pies can come into contact with oil used to cook chicken and fish products during the oil filtering process.  'We therefore cannot guarantee that cross contamination will not occur.' But if you want to take the risk, the pies themselves are vegan. Hash browns are often made using an egg to bind the potato together, but the version at McDonald's is vegan friendly Hash Brown: If you make hash browns at home, you may well use an egg to bind the potato mix together. But the egg is absent from the ingredients list for McDonald's Hash Brown, which means it's safe for vegans to enjoy. Though McDonald's version is safe, don't buy the hash browns from Burger King if you're vegan as its mini browns contain milk. Vegetable Deluxe: McDonald's pledges that it uses vegetarian-only fryers for its veggie burgers, meaning there's no chance of cross contamination with animal products. The burger is topped with 'sandwich sauce', which contains egg - but without the sauce, this vegetarian meal is also vegan. The Vegetable Deluxe and Spicy Vegetable Deluxe at McDonald's are also safe for vegans - just as long as you hold the mayonnaise on the lettuce It may be obvious but fries are safe for vegans as McDonald's as they're fried in vegetable oil The patty is made from chickpeas, yellow split peas, breadcrumbs, onion and potato, and is topped with vegan-friendly lettuce and cucumber. The sesame seed bun is also dairy-free. Spicy Vegetable Deluxe: The spicy version uses the same patty as the vegetable deluxe - the only difference is the addition of sweet chilli sauce. Just make sure to hold the mayonnaise if you're a vegan.  Fries: It may be obvious, but it's not unheard of for restaurants to fry their chips in beef dripping, making them unsuitable for vegetarians or vegans. But McDonald's fries are fried in vegetable oil and are made from 100 per cent potato.  BURGER KING   Burger King's Apple Pie Sticks are safe for vegans as the batter doesn't contain egg or dairy products - but they are fried in the same oil as animal products Apple Pie Sticks: Just like McDonald's, Burger King's version of an apple pie is also safe for vegans as the batter that coats the hot apple filling is egg and dairy-free. However, there is a major catch which makes the sweet treat potentially unsuitable for both vegetarians and vegans. A note on Burger King's UK website states that its apple pie sticks are fried in the same oil as its chicken and fish products. That may be enough to put off some meat eaters too.  Burger King's Fries and Shaker Fries are also suitable for vegans as they are not fried in the same oil as animal products Burger King's Kids Veggie Burger is suitable for vegans as well as vegetarians, as it doesn't come with a mayonnaise topping Shaker Fries: Vegans will be pleased to hear that Burger King's fries and its special Shaker Fries - which are coated with a BBQ spice - are suitable as they are made from pure potato and fried in vegetable oil.  Veggie Bean Burger: The patties themselves simply contain breadcrumbs, vegetables and grains, meaning they are safe for vegans. The bun is also safe, as it doesn't contain any milk, as some baps do. But you will have to request your burger without sauce or cheese, which it comes with as standard. Kids Veggie Burger: The children's version of the adult's veggie bean burger doesn't even come with mayonnaise, so you can order it as it was first intended by the fast food titan, and tuck into a vegan meal.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 1.8k shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Moment of impact as earthquake rattles home in Wellington Got any oink-tment?: Excited piglets take a warm bath SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Obama and Trump sit down to discuss the transfer of power James Corden sings for the 2016 Sainsbury's Christmas advert Is this the creepy moment the corpse of a girl OPENS her eyes?

Why? John Naughton Apple has published its latest quarterly figures and the doomsayers are again questioning its future. They should look at the facts Apple CEO Tim Cook: the numbers are down, so the speculation rises. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Sunday 30 October 2016 04.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger It’s that time of year again. Apple has released its results for the fiscal quarter ended 24 September 2016 and we are immediately plunged into “Has Apple peaked?” speculation. How come? Well, the company posted quarterly revenue of $46.9bn and net income of $9bn. Not bad, eh? Ah, yes, but not if you’re a Wall Street analyst, because these numbers compare to revenue of $51.5bn and net income of $11.1bn in the same quarter the year before. And – shock, horror! – the company’s gross margin was only 38% compared to 39.9% a year ago. The numbers are down, in other words. Cue fevered speculation about the fate of the company. The numbers, burbled one analyst, show “the danger of being a one-trick pony when everyone already owns a pony. The company’s reliance on the smartphone, which is now a mature and saturated market in the developed world, is starting to create a growth problem for Apple. Breaking through will be a challenge, reminding investors Apple’s fundamentals and stock price have peaked.” Pause for a reality check: Apple has cash reserves of $237.6bn, up $32bn from last year. At $622bn (at 26 October 2016), it is the most valuable company in the world. For comparison, Exxon Mobil is worth a mere $361bn (at 26 October 2016). In the quarter under discussion, Apple sold 45.5m iPhones, 9.3m iPads and 4.9m Mac (desktop and laptop) computers. By any reasonable standard, this is the record of a truly formidable corporation. But because 2016 marks the first full-year revenue decline for Apple since 2001, the Wall Street guys are in a lather. Imagination Technologies falls after Apple results Read more This neuroticism tells us two useful things. The first is that capitalism is an inherently unstable system: like a Ponzi scheme, it has to keep growing. The pressure for continual growth is particularly fierce on tech companies, because investors have become accustomed to exponential rates of growth in such outfits. Apple gets off a bit lighter than companies such as Google and Facebook because it actually makes real things – phones, tablets, computers – which require vast engineering and manufacturing resources. Just consider: Apple manufactures about a million iPhones a day, every one of which is sculpted to 10 micron tolerances from a single block of aluminium, as is every Mac, iPad and Apple Watch. This explains why Apple is the world’s largest owner of CNC (computer numerical control) milling machines and swiss-style lathes. It also explains why Apple can’t grow at the rate that Facebook can add users. Scaling up with software is easy – you just add more servers. Scaling up with physical manufacturing is much harder to do. The other inference to be drawn from the neuroticism about Apple’s results is that there is something about the company that causes perfectly sane people – analysts and investors, as well as customers and tech bloggers – to lose their marbles. There is a whole blogging ecosystem devoted to whispers, rumours and theories about every aspect of Apple’s activities, an ecosystem that provides an army of what Lenin would have called “useful idiots” for the company. An illustration was the prediction that the iPhone 7 was going to be boring. “If early leaks are to be believed,” it raved, “and they’re too numerous and too consistent to not believe a lot of what’s floating around out there, then this year’s iPhone 7 won’t be a major departure from last year’s iPhone 6s.” Then Apple came out with the dual-camera iPhone 7s, which was anything but boring – at least to affluent photographers – thereby exceeding the depressed expectation. But it’s not just tech bloggers who are in thrall to the Apple brand. So, too, is a sovereign state, namely the Republic of Ireland. Recently, the EU ordered Apple to pay the republic €13bn in back taxes after the European commission ruled that the company had enjoyed illegal tax breaks from the government over many years. For a small country, €13bn is a lot of dosh – it would probably keep the cash-starved Irish health service going for a year. Apple is, naturally, going to appeal against the ruling. But – guess what? – so is the Irish government: it has declared its intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the company and argue that it doesn’t want the money. It seems that the EU ruling “threatens the integrity of Ireland’s low corporate tax regime and could jeopardise inflows of foreign direct investment”. So, in the networked world, exercising sovereignty comes down to being nice to Apple. Note to Brexiters: this might be relevant to you.

Microsoft Brings Office on Apple’s New MacBook Touch Bar GO Office productivity suite updated with Touch Bar support Oct 30, 2016 03:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple and Microsoft are most of the time fierce rivals, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t see the potential of each other’s products and work at full speed to support some of their latest tech. This is what is happening right now with the Touch Bar, a feature that Apple presented earlier this week and which is essentially a touchscreen placed at the top of the new MacBook keyboard that can be configured to perform a wide variety of tasks depending on the app. Microsoft is one of the first companies to support the Touch Bar, and today the firm has revealed that its Office productivity suite has already been updated to bring Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook on the MacBook keyboard to make it easier to work with documents. How to use the Touch Bar in Office In Word, for example, the Touch Bar can be used to access the settings that you typically find in the ribbon, such as styles, text formatting options, and pasting. PowerPoint comes with similar controls and, thanks to the Touch Bar, it enhances the experience of working with presentations with quick taps on the keyboard. “Touch Bar commands in PowerPoint allow you to easily manipulate graphic elements. The Reorder Objects button produces a graphical map of all the layers on a slide, making it easy to find the right object and move it where you want it. And by sliding your finger across the Touch Bar you can easily rotate an object to get just the right angle,” Microsoft explains. In the case of Excel, you get quick access to formulas, such as SUM, COUNTIF, AVERAGE, MAX, and others, while in Outlook the Touch Bar comes with options to start video, mute, share desktop, or hang up a call. Furthermore, calendar appointments are also displayed on the Touch Bar, so you never miss an important event. All these improvements will be there in Office when the new MacBook with a Touch Bar ships and Microsoft says it’s committed to delivering even more improvements to its productivity suite to benefit from the full potential of this new feature.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (4 Images) #Microsoft#Office#Apple#MacBook#Touch Bar subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Office support for MacBook's Touch Bar (4 Images) 01 02 03 04 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Surface Exec Thinks Apple Will Build a Touchscreen MacBook Microsoft Trashes the New Apple MacBook Pro on Its Official Website Microsoft Announces Its First All-in-One PC Called Surface Studio Microsoft Launches the Surface Book i7 OnePlus 4 Rumors Suggest Mind-Blowing Specs: 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 835 CPU Pregnant Woman Suffers Second-Degree Burns After Falling Asleep on iPhone 7 Google Pixel Gets Hacked in Less than One Minute, Apple's Safari in 20 Seconds Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac Ubuntu Online Summit for Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty Zapus) Starts Today, November 15 darktable 2.2 to Be a Major Release with RAW Overexposure Indication, New Tools Create Your Own Ubuntu 16.10 Live ISO with the New Linux For All (LFA) Distro Vivaldi 1.5 Web Browser Up to RC State, Fixes H.264 and MP3 Support for openSUSE 4 photos    Office support for MacBook's Touch Bar Related Apps Microsoft OneNote: Collect your information in one easy-to-find place, gather all sorts of data, organize them your own way, and share them with others with just a click TalkHelper Call Recorder for Skype: Record all calls you make to Skype friends or you receive from them, and keep track of both voice and video messages with this application Aml Maple: Indicates the keyboard's current language next to the cursor while you're typing text in any application to help you easily juggle tasks in different languages TwinkiePaste: Paste commonly used texts with hotkeys from anywhere, which will save you the time spent on typing a phrase or copy and paste it NotePro: Write your journal or create college papers using this comprehensive text editor which comes with all the features and tools you need CSV To vCard VCF Converter Software: Extract contact details stored in CSV documents and export them to vCard files easily, with this straightforward piece of software QXmlEdit: Easily view the structure of an XML file, split it in smaller fragments and compare two items in side by side panels with just a few clicks Reader comments Microsoft Can Detect Lung Cancer Earlier by Looking at User Search Data more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

RocketNews24 Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese TOP » Japan » Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen cafe set to open in Tokyo for a limited time! Featured Weird Studio Ghibli Jobs Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen cafe set to open in Tokyo for a limited time! Oona McGee Oct 30, 2016 Tweet From the bright exterior to the unusual themed menu, the world’s first official PPAP cafe has a number of flash trimmings that fans will love. After appearing on YouTube on 25 August, the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” music video by Japanese comedian Kosaka Daimaoh’s stage character “Piko Taro” quickly became an Internet sensation, with the hilarious clip receiving over 7.9 million views and 4,000 comments in just one month since its release. ▼ Two months later, the song about sticking a pen inside a pineapple and an apple now has more than 67 million views. The clip’s huge popularity has led to a number of spin-off products and even a Pen Pineapple Apple Bread from a Japanese bakery in Kanagawa. Now, Piko Taro’s management company is teaming up with the Tree Village store area at the foot of Tokyo Skytree, for the grand opening of an official cafe featuring all the flash trimmings you’d expect from anything associated with the leopard-print wearing star and his video. ▼ The front of the store features Piko Taro surrounded by the colours of a golden pineapple, while the store sign includes images of a pen pineapple and an apple pen. Inside, the menu features items branded with the PPAP logo, including parfaits, pancakes, sodas, a burger, and fresh pineapple juice served inside a whole fruit. Prices range from 420 yen (US$3.99) for the tea up to 878 yen for the pineapple juice, and most of the items include a chocolate “pen” and slices of fruit so you can act out the song while eating. Customers will also be able to receive a take-home souvenir with each order, in the form of a coaster featuring the singing, dancing Piko Taro. With the singer recently being awarded a Guinness World Record for the shortest song to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts, where PPAP debuted at number 77, the catchy tune shows no signs of slowing down in popularity. Fans after a taste of Piko Taro and his hit song will be able to enjoy the cafe, which will also sell specially branded merchandise, for a limited time, between 1 – 20 November.

Tags: Saddam Hussein, apple, iphone, Birmingham During his time as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein regularly used body doubles to take his place at public appearances or to disguise his true whereabouts. A political decoy is essentially a person whose role it is to impersonate a politician in order to draw attention away from the real person or take risks on that person’s behalf. But 10 years after Saddam Hussein’s death, a man in Birmingham has been given the shock of a lifetime after being accused, not just of being one of the former Iraqi president's body doubles, but of actually being the man himself, by none other than tech giant Apple. According to The Sun, in a bizzare blunder Apple refused to sell a £799 iPhone to Sharakat Hussein, a 26 year-old father of two from Great Barr in Birmingham, reportedly because he was on the British government’s Denied Parties list. The tech giants, according to the British tabloid, requested Hussain provide proof he was not the former Iraqi dictator — despite the fact that he is 52 years younger than Saddam Hussein would be if he was still alive, and has a different first name to the former Iraqi strongman.  'I thought the email was spam, I was stunned to learn it was real. I was furious to be linked to Saddam,” Sharakat Hussein told The Sun in comments published on Saturday. Saddam Hussein was hung at an Iraqi army base in 2006. Conspiracy theories do exist claiming that the man put to death in 2006 was in fact not Hussein, and that the former Iraqi president managed to escape into exile. But they tend to claim he made it to another “B” — Belarus, although there did used to be a mosque in Birmingham named after the Baath dictator.

Although many customers are excited with the launch of the new MacBook Pro, some customers are disappointed as the latest iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cannot be plugged to Apple's new offering. Apple unveiled the most awaited iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September and the two mobile phones attracted many smartphone enthusiasts across the world. However, some fans were not happy as the company did not include a 3.5mm audio jack in the two devices. Customers have to buy an adaptor if they want to plug in a headphone to the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The MacBook Pro's launch was long due, but the new devices do come packed with impressive features. The new device comes with four USB ports but they are all Thunderbolt 3 or USB Type-C ports. It's worth noting that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with a lightning to USB Type A cable, which means that the new-gen iPhones cannot be plugged to the latest MacBook Pros. Apple devices have a huge fan base and new Apple products need no selling. However, the lack of connectivity between the two latest devices — iPhones and MacBook Pros — has disappointed many fans. "It's clear Apple is a mess internally. No cohesion and no solid vision. It's frustrating and makes me wonder if I made a mistake getting an iPhone 7 instead of looking into android. I love iOS But I also like being able to have unified experiences," complained a redditor. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus owners now have two options if they want to connect their latest handset to the new MacBook Pros: buy a new USB-C to USB adaptor that costs $19 or buy a USB-C to lighting cable that costs $25. Unfortunately, neither the adaptor nor the cable comes bundled with the iPhone 7 or the MacBook Pros, which means customers have to spend a bit more money and purchase them separately. Even though many customers access their files in the cloud, there are still many people who want to connect their phones to their laptops with a physical cable for performing tasks such as managing music, apps via iTunes. These customers will be most upset to find that iPhone 7 cannot be connected to the new MacBook Pros. USB-C is becoming a norm in the smartphone space. The inclusion of only USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 ports in the MacBook Pros also hints that Apple may be thinking of a shift, meaning the next-gen iPhones could come with USB-C.

There’s a Little Black Dress on the horizon, and a couple of months to go before crunch time There are two key moments in the year when your body suddenly comes into focus. When you really want to look your best. The first is the great Summer Swimsuit Unveiling, and the second is when we begin to dwell upon the Christmas party season.  It is at this time of year that the diary starts to fill up with festive bookings: the office party, the Christmas Eve cocktails, the family get-togethers, the New Year’s Eve celebrations… there’s a gorgeous Little Black Dress on the horizon, and a couple of months to go before crunch time.  There is no reason why you can’t be in sensational shape for the party season – and that’s where the Fast Diet Max comes in.  Anyone who’s tried the 5:2 Fast Diet will know that it can really make a difference on the scales. Two days of fasting each week can have a huge impact on weight, and on how we feel about our bodies.  But here, I’ve devised a speedy version of the classic protocol. Follow the simple steps in the pages ahead and you’ll go from the slow lane to the fast lane in ample time for the Christmas events calendar.  You’ll discover how to finesse the Fast Diet rules to access a slimmer, fitter you. It’s not complicated, it’s not even that challenging.  It just takes a bit of planning and a clear sight of the goal ahead. You’ll discover that small adjustments to your daily routine around food and drink, plus a couple of days of committed fasting, can really shift your shape.  The Fast Diet has always appealed to bon viveurs, lovers of good wine and good food. The fact that you’re restricting your calorie intake only occasionally means that there’s still room for treats.  This Max approach requiresjust a little more self-control. You might consider avoiding alcohol in the coming weeks (it will reappear when the parties kick in). We take a look at the timing of your fasts, developing portion control, and eating with mindfulness so that those automatic calories are off the menu.  There are tips to help with introducing exercise, and ideas about how to strengthen your willpower around foods you love. In a few weeks, it’s Party Time. Excellent! But for now, you can take control, one mouthful at a time. This year, you’ll discover your Christmas wishes really can come true...   The runaway success of the original Fast Diet – now one of the best selling diet books of all time THE FAST WAY TO DROP A DRESS SIZE The runaway success of the original Fast Diet – now one of the best selling diet books of all time – was undoubtedly because it was radical, yet simple: you eat normally for five days a week and then, for the other two days – what we call the Fast Days – consume a quarter of your normal calorie intake (600 calories for men, and 500 for women). And thus it became known as the 5:2 diet. This Party Dress Diet adheres to the same principals, with some minor adjustments. It is a bit tougher, both on fast and nonfast days, but it’s just for six weeks. ON THIS REGIME YOU WILL: Lose between 1lb and 2lb a week.  Reduce levels of a hormone called IGF-1, which means that you are slashing your risk of contracting a number of age-related diseases. Improve cardiovascular health and cholesterol levels. Tweak your body into burning fat and increase its insulin sensitivity; this in turn will reduce your risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cognitive decline. Increase levels of neurotrophic factor in the brain, which should make you feel more cheerful (even when contemplating fitting into that favourite little black dress). START THE COUNTDOWN PARTY SEASON So, what’s new? Well, a few years ago, I adapted the 5:2 plan to create The Fast Beach Diet, a six-week ‘summer holiday primer’ regime you could start in May, June or July, and be ready for take-off (clothes, not planes) later in the summer. Now I’ve adapted that same turbo-driven 5:2 diet – I call it The Fast Diet Max – to get you in shape for party season. It is the same as the traditional Fast Diet, but a tad tougher and a bit bolder. The extra commitment is short-lived. Just a bit more effort. For just six weeks. The original Fast Diet involves strict calorie restriction but only intermittently – a term known as intermittent fasting or IF. Scientific studies – and the accounts of thousands of dieters who have had success – show that sticking to a limited number of Fast Days each week is a sure-fire way to lose weight. MIMI SAYS...  Stick a photo of the dress you have in mind for a party on the fridge.  There’s nothing like aversion therapy to steer you away from treats. Our experience is that non-consecutive Fast Days work best, though you can do them back to back if you prefer. Most people divide their calorie intake between breakfast and an evening meal, aiming for a lengthy ‘fasting window’ between meals. But you can skip breakfast and lunch, and have a more substantial evening meal containing your whole calorie quota if that better suits your day. The Fast Diet Max takes a slightly different tack – it’s meant to be an adjunct to The Fast Diet, and I recommend getting the first book to find out about the plan (The Fast Diet, Short Books, £7.99) so once you finish this you can revert to the more familiar version. But in these pages, you’ll find all you need to get started with the Fast Diet Max – including mouth-watering, easy-to-make recipes for dishes to eat on Fast Days, each stating how many calories per portion they provide. I see the Fast Diet Max as a sort of jump-start; a short-term, souped-up Fast Diet. The three-pronged approach is based on ways to: ● Tighten up on Fast Days ● Toughen up on non-Fast Days ● Tune in on any day BEFORE YOU START You need to know what shape you are in. It is helpful to know your body mass index or BMI score – it’s a ratio of height to weight that can tell you if you are normal weight, overweight or obese. Don’t over-think it, but consider what, how and when you’re likely to eat on Fast Days. Empty your snack drawer at work and clear the house of junk food. Shop on non-Fast Days, so as not to taunt yourself with undue temptation. Stock up on herbal teas and make Fast Day food in advance and ready in the freezer. If you don’t have an underlying medical condition, and if you are not an individual for whom fasting is proscribed (see Page 8), then there is no time like the present. HOW TO TIGHTEN UP YOUR FAST DAYS   MIMI SAYS...  Get rid of the snacks idling in the cupboard so temptation is removed. Instead, load up the fridge with fruit and veg for when hunger calls. The original Fast Diet was conceived by the BBC’s Dr Michael Mosley in 2012 (our book which started the 5:2 diet revolution came out in January 2013). He tried several different fasting regimes; the one he settled on as the sustainable was five days off, two days on, which meant that the majority of the time was spent free from calorie counting. In 12 weeks, Michael lost more than 20lb of body fat and his blood glucose fell from pre-diabetic levels to healthy. I lost 22lb and returned to my pre-children body weight (and, more importantly, shape). One Fast Diet suggestion is that, once you reach a target weight, you ease off and stick to a 6:1 regime with just one Fast Day. But on the six-week Fast Diet Max, you should aim to step up the programme by experimenting with extensions to the original plan. One way is to add a third Fast Day for six weeks, amounting to Alternate Day Fasting (ADF). It might surprise you to learn: ● During scientific trials into ADF, when people were ‘allowed’ to feast on a normal day, they tended not to do so. They reported not feeling hungry after a day of fasting and rarely ate more than 110 per cent of their normal calories. ● People lost more body fat than those doing a conventional calorie-restricting regime. If you go on a standard, medically approved diet (restricting your calorie intake every day) you will lose 75 per cent of weight as fat, and 25 per cent as muscle. On ADF, by contrast, the weight lost is almost entirely fat. So, give 4:3 a go. If it appeals, try it for six weeks only, always insuring you meet your nutritional needs – so, plenty of plants, adequate protein, occasional dairy and fats. One way to ensure your non-Fast Days stay healthy is to stick to a Mediterranean diet TRY THE 2-TO-2 APPROACH We’re not over-prescriptive about timings of a fast: the plan should be flexible, so it can be adapted to suit your lifestyle and daily agenda. That said, you can experiment with timing. You may, for instance, choose to fast not from bedtime to bedtime, but from 2pm until 2pm, with reduced calories (or none) consumed at all during that 24-hour period. Here is how to go about it: ● After a normal lunch on Day 1, eat sparingly, amounting to no more than 500 calories for women and 600 for men (or nothing at all) until a late lunch the following day. That way you fast while you sleep and no single day feels ‘deprived’ of food. ● You might choose to fast from supper to supper, which again means no day is All Fast and No Fun. The point is ‘adjust to fit’. If either of these approaches feels wrong, stop and revert to the usual 5:2 Fast Day approach. EXTEND YOUR FASTING WINDOW As an alternative, you might choose to extend your Fasting Window – the time during which nothing at all is eaten. In the classic Fast Diet, we recommend breakfast, perhaps at 7am, then supper about 12 hours later, amounting to no more than 500 calories for women, and 600 for men. It’s what works for me, and for many women who need a little sustenance to get the day going. However, plenty of successful Fast Dieters prefer to ignore breakfast; they are fasting for longer: from supper the previous night to supper on a Fast Day, when they’ll eat all their calories. On this regime, the Fasting Window can be as long as 24 hours – as with the 2-to-2. You might decide to do this on the Fast Diet Max. Perhaps give it a go for one of your weekly Fast Days. Always shut down a fast if it feels overwhelming. For the next six weeks, do not guestimate, do not cheat, do not avoid the chore. Be particular and count all your calories  BE FAST-IDIOUS ABOUT YOUR CALORIE QUOTA If you have been on the Fast Diet for a while, it’s human instinct to feel you know what’s what, so an ‘unconscious non-compliance’ creeps in. While the 5:2 demands you ‘comply’ for only two days a week, it is still a challenge, to measure and count on those days. It is a bit of a chore. For the next six weeks, do not guestimate, do not cheat, do not avoid the chore. Be particular. On Fast Days, renew your vows and be resolute about those calorie quotas.   The advice in The Fast Diet is to ‘eat well for five days and reduce your calories for two’. It is the foundation of the 5:2 approach, but ‘eating well’ remains quite vague. The thrust is that you should not dwell upon the calorie-counting on the five days a week when you are not fasting. But, with the Fast Diet Max, we’re going to really toughen up on no-Fast Days. For a short, contained period, it’s time to really eat well... 1. SWITCH TO SLOW-BURN CARBS  The glycaemic index (GI) is a rating system for foods containing carbohydrates. It shows how quickly each food affects your blood sugar (glucose) level when that food is eaten on its own. Carbohydrate foods that are broken down quickly by your body and cause a rapid increase in blood glucose have a high GI rating. High GI foods include, sugar and sugary foods, sugary soft drinks, white bread, white pasta, potatoes, and white rice. For the next six weeks, choose low- GI foods which are slower burning, such as jumbo oats, brown basmati rice, and stoneground wholemeal bread. A good guide to low and high GI foods can be found at diabetes.org.uk. For the six weeks you are on the diet make sure you cut back on the treats. Stop snaking on biscuits, chocolate and crisps and fill your fridge with fruit  2. COOK FROM SCRATCH This can be tricky if you’re up to your neck in work and children, and the ready meal is right there looking very convenient... But try to make time, just for the next six weeks. Home cooking means you can control the quality and quantity of what you eat. 3. FOLLOW THE THREE-QUARTER RULE Fill your plate with veg at the expense of meat or carbs – a 75:25 ratio is ideal. Studies have found that a vegan or vegetarian diet can be highly effective for weight loss, and vegetarian populations have lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity. Why not try a meat-free day of the week? 4. GO MEDITERRANEAN One way to ensure your non-Fast Days stay healthy is to stick to a Mediterranean diet. It’s a short hand way of saying ‘cut the junk and get real’. Stick to fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, pulses, nuts, olive oil, lean protein and unsweetened dairy. 5. CUT BACK ON TREATS These days ‘treats’ are almost a food group in their own right. You only have to queue to pay at the petrol station to be engulfed in a sea of snacks and grab bags and cookies and chocolate and STOP! Let’s get some perspective here and put the treats back in their box. Not for ever. Just for six weeks.  ...the two cardinal sins (and it's just for six weeks)  1. ALCOHOL  Kicking alcohol for six weeks is the most effective way to kick start your diet This is the most effective way to kick start your diet. It’s not for ever. Just six short weeks. Alcohol is chemically similar to sugar, so drinking it will set off the same hormonal reactions in the body that can promote weight gain.  It’s stacked with calories and devoid of nutritional benefit. It inhibits sleep (which isn’t good for weight loss) and stimulates the appetite. In short, if you are serious about trying to lose weight and improve your health, consider a complete ban on alcohol for the duration of the Fast Diet Max. If you simply can’t reject, then reduce: half fill your glass,  2. THE BIG NO-NOS Avoid packaged desserts, sweet fizzy drinks (even diet versions), commercial cereals and fast food. These are all out of bounds for the next month and a half. Also, junk the fruit juice: it’s ultimately a higher-sugar, lower fibre version of its source. If you’re choosing a juice, go ‘green’ and try a vegetable juice. They’re faddish, possibly, but contain significantly less sugar than their fruit-only equivalents.   FASTING HAS NEVER LOOKED SO TASTY!  So just what DO you eat on a Fast Day? Below you'll find a raft of delicious yet simple recipes guaranteed to keep you satisfied... even when you're counting calories. BRILLIANT BREAKFASTS  1. SHAKSHOUKA  This is a delicious Tunisian feast of eggs, poached in a cumin-infused tomato concasse. Studies have shown that lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes, is boosted in cooking, so you are maximising your nutritional benefit with this slow-cooked sauce, and it provides double the recommended daily amount of vitamin C. The recipe is for two, as it tends to work better when cooked in a larger pan. If you’re cooking for one, simply halve the quantities and use a small, heavy pan. Shakshouka is a delicious Tunisian dish and just 178 calories per portion  INGREDIENTS - Serves 2 - 178 Calories  1 tsp olive oil medium onion, peeled and diced 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 medium red pepper, chopped 1 400g tin chopped tomatoes 1 tbsp tomato purée tsp paprika tsp chilli powder (mild) tsp ground cumin pinch of cayenne pepper salt and pepper 2 eggs 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped HOW TO COOK   Heat a medium-sized sauté pan and warm the olive oil. Add chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes until it begins to soften. Add garlic and chopped pepper, then cook for 5-7 minutes over a medium heat until softened. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato purée, together with the spices, and simmer for a further 5-7 minutes until it starts to reduce. Season, then crack the eggs directly over the tomato mixture. Cover and cook for ten minutes, or until the egg whites are firm, the yolks still runny and the sauce has slightly reduced.   2. JUMBO PORRIDGE WITH JEWEL FRUITS Add a delicate swirl of pomegranate molasses, along with the seeds and cinnamon, to arrive at a ruby-studded dish with inspiration from the Middle East. The fibre in oats can help lower blood cholesterol – use jumbo oats as they promise to keep  you fuller longer than the more processed varieties. Jumbo porridge with jewel fruits is a 284 calorie breakfast  INGREDIENTS - Serves 1 - 284 calories 300ml skimmed milk 30g jumbo porridge oats tsp ground cinnamon pinch of sea salt 50g fruit of choice, but stick to the lower GI fruits such as berries, cherries and pomegranate seeds 1 tsp pomegranate molasses HOW TO COOK   Heat milk, oats, cinnamon and salt in a pan, stirring well until the porridge is thickened – around 4-5 minutes (you can do this in a microwave, stirring halfway through the cooking time). Leave to stand for a minute before adding berries, cherries, pomegranate seeds and molasses.   3. SLICED APPLE WITH CINNAMON DIP  Sliced apple with cinnamon dip is easy to make and 233 a portion  Apples are the ultimate convenience food, though they are quite high in calories. The pectin in them limits the amount of fat that cells can absorb, and causes the stomach to empty more slowly. Eat the whole thing – skin, pips and core – to get maximum fibre. INGREDIENTS - Serves 1 - 233 calories   1 apple squeeze of lemon 100g half-fat crème fraîche tsp honey sprinkling of cinnamon HOW TO COOK  Slice the apple thinly and squeeze lemon over them. Mix the other ingredients into a bowl – and dig in.    FAST-DAY LUNCHES  1. EXPRESS KEDGEREE Much loved British kedgeree has been slimmed here to better suit a Fast Day. For a more delicate dish, use smoked trout instead of mackerel fillets. INGREDIENTS - Serves 4 - 397 calories   cooking oil spray 1 red onion, finely chopped 397 calories: Much loved British kedgeree has been slimmed here to better suit a Fast Day 1 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp curry powder 1 garlic clove, crushed 2 cardamom pods 2cm fresh root ginger, peeled and grated pinch of chilli flakes, to taste and strands of saffron, salt and pepper 200g brown rice, rinsed and drained 500ml water 100g frozen petit pois 200g smoked mackerel fillets, flaked 2 hard-boiled eggs, quartered snipped chives and lemon wedges, to serve HOW TO COOK  Heat a large pan, spray with cooking oil and fry onion until softened. Add spices, garlic, cardamom, ginger, chilli flakes, saffron, salt and pepper and fry for two minutes. Stir in the rice. Cover with water and bring to the boil. Cook on a low heat until rice is almost cooked and the water has been absorbed. Add the peas and cook through. Remove from heat and carefully add the flaked mackerel and the quartered eggs. Check seasoning and garnish with snipped chives and lemon.   2. BAKED FALAFEL WITH WITH HOUMOUS   You can make your own falafel but the packet versions can be just as good. Bake, don’t fry, and you achieve a decent Fast Day supper for relatively few calories. Add veggies and leaves of your choice – my favourites are included here.  INGREDIENTS - Serves 2 - 380 calories     You can make your own falafel but the packet versions can be just as good. This dish is just 380 calories  28 ready-made falafel balls 2 wholewheat pitta breads romaine lettuce, shredded 1 carrot, peeled and grated 2 ripe tomatoes diced red onion, finely sliced sliced green jalapeño peppers from a jar (optional) handful of baby spinach leaves coriander leaves houmous, mixed with a little water to make it runnier HOW TO COOK  Preheat oven to 200C. Place falafel in a small foil-lined roasting tray and bake for 10-12 minutes, turning halfway through. Warm the pittas, slit lengthways and fill with lettuce, carrot, diced tomato, red onion, spinach leaves and coriander. Add falafel and drizzle each portion with 1 tbsp houmous. Serve with a napkin (it’s a messy business).   3. CHICKEN WITH GREMOLATA AND DARK LEAVES  Gremolata is a vivid green Italian sauce made from chopped garlic, lemon zest and masses of parsley, served with osso bucco, but a great way to pimp any plain grilled or seared meat or fish. Use a generous handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for the gremolata. INGREDIENTS - Serves 4 - 140 calories   1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil Gremolata is a sauce made from chopped garlic, lemon zest and masses of parsley. A serving with chicken is 140 calories zest of a lemon 1 tbsp lemon juice 1 tsp fresh oregano, finely chopped 1 tsp fresh thyme, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, very finely chopped 4 chicken thighs, boneless and skinless 2 tsp olive oil salt and pepper HOW TO COOK  Dark salad leaves or blanched green beans, to serve. In a small bowl, combine the parsley, most of the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, oregano, thyme, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir well and set aside. Slash the meat several times, drizzle with remaining olive oil and season well, then place on a hot griddle pan. Cook on a medium heat until golden and sticky, then turn and continue until meat is cooked through (approx 5 minutes each side). Serve drizzled with 1 tbsp gremolata and a side of dark salad leaves such as watercress, rocket, lambs lettuce, purslane, sorrel or baby spinach.   MAKE SURE YOU DON'T EAT ON AUTOPILOT  You’ll have already absorbed that 5:2 is a limited but effective discipline; what it requires is a change of behaviour. A change of mind. Part of its intention (and one of the prime reasons for its success) is that it encourages you to be observant, ‘mindful’, around food – certainly on your Fast Days. To make the Fast Diet Max a success, it’s important to get a handle on habit, temptation and cravings – a trio of trips that can upend you on the fast track to weight loss and good health. It’s time to retrain your brain. Mindfulness is a fashionable concept these days, but it is rooted in age-old wisdom that can affect your relationship with everything in your world, including calories.  Here are my tips for mindful eating.  1. Don't eat on auto pilot  Throughout the diet, eat with awareness, absorb the fascinating fact that you’re eating. Don’t eat on the way to doing something else. Don’t read, watch TV, text, Facebook, drive or juggle at the same time. Tune into the food on your fork. Look at it. Really taste it. That way you’ll enjoy each mouthful. You’ll also know better when you have had enough. 2. Slow down  During the Fast Diet Max, sit down to eat. Stay put in one place. Make it an event. Eat at a table. Drink a glass of water first. Put your knife and fork down between bites. Let your body know what’s just hit it, recognising that it takes your stomach a few minutes to catch up with your mouth. Wait again before embarking on pudding. You may not need it today. 3. Guard against portion distortion    This is the thinking that convinces us that the food piled on our plates – our ‘serving’ – is the quantity we want and need. It’s a habit, nothing more. So break it. Learn to say ‘when’. Have a care for the amount of food you are putting on your plate at every meal. Bear in mind that a person will eat an average of 92 per cent of any food they serve themselves. So for the next six weeks, serve a bit less. 4. Wait before you eat  Don’t eat as soon as the clock says ‘lunchtime’. If you feel hungry during a Fast Day, or a non-Fast Day, for the next six weeks, try to resist for ten minutes. See if the hunger subsides. 5. Keep a food diary   Dieters who keep food diaries are known to be more successful at losing weight than those who don’t – one study found that it can double weight loss as part of a managed programme. During the Fast Diet Max, catalogue your intake on Fast Days and non-Fast Days. CAN WE HAVE A QUICK WORD ABOUT WILLPOWER?   When you are on the six week plan try not to see self-control as a virtue, but as a muscle  What do we know about willpower? It’s a slippery beast, the workings of the mind, but recent studies have provided new insights which make stimulating food for thought, offering ways to galvanise you during your Fast Diet Max. Try not to see self-control as a virtue, but as a muscle – as suggested by Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal in her book The Willpower Instinct. It gets tired from use, but regular exercise makes it stronger. This means the going gets easier if we persevere. Feeling bad about giving in to a craving only leads to... more giving in. Self-compassion is a far better strategy than self-flagellation. Inner acceptance seems to improve outer control. So, make a positive commitment rather than a negative one: instead of saying No, say Yes; not ‘I won’t eat the muffin,’ but ‘I will have the apple’. Similarly, re-frame the motivator. Rather than thinking, ‘Arrgh, I don’t want to be fat’, focus on ‘I’d like to be slimmer, healthier and full of energy... and fit into that party dress’. Write it down, and read it every day.   SUPER-FAST SUPPERS  1. PRAWN LAKSA This spiced Malaysian noodle soup is a proper meal in a bowl and has a fairly generous number of calories to match (but it’s worth every last one of them). INGREDIENTS - Serves 2 - 400 calories   150g fine rice noodles 2 tbsp laksa paste from a jar This spiced Malaysian noodle soup is a proper meal in a bowl and has 400 calories a serving  400ml half-fat coconut milk 500ml chicken stock 2 spring onions, finely sliced on the diagonal, a few slices reserved for garnish 1 red chilli, halved and deseeded, finely sliced 100g prawns, fresh or cooked 100g beansprouts 1 pak choi, thinly sliced cucumber, peeled, deseeded and cut into fine strips a handful of fresh coriander leaves, to serve HOW TO COOK   Prepare noodles according to packet instructions. Heat a large pan, add the laksa paste and 1 tbsp coconut milk. Fry for 3 minutes, then add the rest of the coconut milk, stock, spring onions and chilli. Stir, and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the prawns, beansprouts and pak choi and simmer for a further 3 minutes until the prawns and vegetables are just cooked. Place the prepared noodles in bowls, and cover with the hot soup. Garnish with delicate strips of cucumber, a little more finely sliced spring onion and coriander leaves.   2. PUY LENTIL, ORANGE AND HAZELNUT SALAD  To make this a more substantial supper, top each portion with 40g cubed and marinated tofu, which will add only 60 cals. INGREDIENTS - Serves 2 - 400 calories     Puy lentil, orange and hazelnut salad is 60 calories a portion For the dressing 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 2 tbsp orange juice 1 garlic clove, chopped salt and pepper For the salad 1 250g pouch ready-to-eat puy lentils red onion, finely chopped 1 large carrot, peeled and grated 30g roasted chopped hazelnuts generous handful of curly parsley, chopped 1 tbsp orange zest, to serve HOW TO COOK   Combine oil, vinegar, orange juice, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Microwave the lentils in the pouch for 1 minute, then add to the bowl and stir in the red onion, carrot, hazelnuts and parsley. Mix well and serve at room temperature, scattered with orange zest.   3. EASY LAMB KEBABS  INGREDIENTS - Serves 4, making 8 kebabs - 358 calories   For the marinade 2 tsp ground cumin Lamb kebabs are easy to make and 358 a portion  2 tsp ground coriander 1 tsp chilli flakes 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves zest and juice of a lemon 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp olive oil salt and pepper For the kebabs 700g lean lamb, cubed 2 red onions, cut into wedges (keep the root intact) 2 courgettes, cut into 3cm rounds 2 yellow peppers, deseeded, cut into chunks 2 red peppers, deseeded and cut into chunks 1 lemon, cut into 8 wedges HOW TO COOK  Combine marinade ingredients in a bowl or plastic bag. Add the lamb and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour, or preferably overnight. Prepare the kebabs on metal skewers, alternating meat and veggies. Brush with any remaining marinade. Cook under a hot grill for 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally and spooning over marinade. These are great barbecued, of course, or cooked on a hot griddle pan.   DELICIOUS FAMILY FEASTS  1. PANKO 'FRIED' CHICKEN  Panko 'fried' chicken is not actually fried and comes in at 335 calories a portion  Not fried, of course. But the panko – a Japanese-style breadcrumb that doesn’t absorb as much fat as traditional crumbs – delivers a crispy-crunchy coating which is just as good to eat.  INGREDIENTS - Serves 4 - 335 calories    250ml buttermilk salt and pepper 1 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground turmeric 2 tsp ground coriander 2 tsp paprika 4 chicken drumsticks 4 chicken thighs cooking oil spray 100g panko lemon wedges, to serve HOW TO COOK   Combine buttermilk, salt and pepper, ginger, turmeric, half the coriander and half the paprika in a large bowl. Add chicken and toss. Leave to marinate in the fridge for 3 hours, or overnight if possible. Preheat oven to 190C. Put panko in a bowl and season with remaining coriander, paprika, salt and pepper. Coat each chicken piece in seasoned panko. Place on baking tray lined with non-stick foil. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until golden brown, turning once if necessary. Serve with lemon wedges and a simple green salad. Cheat’s tip: if buttermilk is hard to find, substitute with 200ml lowfat plain yogurt mixed with 50ml semi-skimmed milk.   VENISON SAUSAGES WITH BEAN MASH Venison has a similar nutritional profile to beef but is lower in fat. You can bump up the veggies at negligible calorie cost – perhaps adding fennel wedges or chunks of aubergine. Add a halved red chilli if you want heat. INGREDIENTS - Serves 2 - 417 calories      Venison has a similar nutritional profile to beef but is lower in fat. This sausage and bean mash dish is 417 calories  4 venison sausages 2 red onions, each cut into 8 wedges 1 leek, trimmed and cut into 4cm chunks 2 peppers, deseeded and sliced 1 tsp olive oil salt and pepper For the cannellini bean mash 1 400g tin cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 2 tbsp semi-skimmed milk 1 veg or chicken stock cube 1 tbsp olive oil HOW TO COOK   Preheat oven to 190C. Place vegetables in a shallow ovenproof dish, season, drizzle with oil, cover loosely with foil and bake for 10 minutes. Stir well and lay the sausages on top. Bake under the foil for a further 30 minutes; halfway through, turn the sausages and remove the foil for the final 15 minutes of cooking time. Heat the cannellini mash ingredients and purée with a hand-blender, or mash well with a fork. If too thick, add a dash more milk. Serve with sausages and veg.   MONKFISH CURRY This curry goes well with nutbrown rice: for 4 people, boil 200g brown basmati; dry-fry 75g mixed chopped nuts and stir into the cooked rice. Top with a scant grating of nutmeg and serve. If you’re up against your quota for the day, just have plain brown rice. INGREDIENTS - Serves 4 - 137 calories   For the paste Monkfish curry is low in fat and goes well with nutbrown rice cooking oil spray, 1 onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves 1 tsp nigella seeds 1 red chilli, deseeded 2 tsp ground coriander 2 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp chilli powder 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground turmeric 2 tbsp water For the curry 1 400g tin cherry tomatoes 250ml water 2 tbsp low-fat natural yogurt 1 tsp mango chutney juice of half a lemon 3-4 monkfish tails, cut into chunks (approx. 600g) 100g baby spinachleaves salt and pepper 2 tbsp low-fat natural yogurt and coriander leaves, to serve HOW TO COOK   To make the curry paste, heat a large frying pan, spray with oil and fry the onion and garlic until soft; add the nigella seeds and cook for a further 2 minutes. Place this cooked onion mix in a blender and add all the other paste ingredients. Blitz. Put this paste in the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes before adding water and chopped tomatoes. Cook until sauce is slightly reduced, then add mango chutney and lemon juice. Add monkfish and simmer until cooked through, throwing in spinach leaves for the last 2 minutes of cooking. Remove from heat, check seasoning and swirl in yogurt and fresh coriander. NOW, ADD A DASH OF EXERCISE  Exercise means different things to different people. Try high-intensity training and strength training for muscle tone  Exercise means different things to different people: a Zumba class, a tennis match, a morning jog. To maximise results on the Fast Diet Max, it’s helpful to consider two key areas and introduce an element of each into your weekly plan: HIGH-INTENSITY TRAINING   We can get many of the important benefits of exercise from just three minutes of intense activity. If conventional cardio – whether it’s a spin class or a game of squash – is more to your taste then commit to doing that.  But give HIT a go, as research has shown it helps keep blood sugar stable and suppresses the appetite. Try three sessions a week. To turn a normal run into an HIT session, you have to inject real Intensity, which means including sprints – either running or on an exercise bike or rowing machine. If you’re not especially fit, build up to this gradually: Warm up by jogging/pedalling/rowing for 1–2 minutes. Run/pedal flat-out for ten to 20 seconds. Recover for 1-2 minutes. Repeat. Increase to three or four 30-second bouts. STRENGTH TRAINING FOR MUSCLE TONE  Getting fit is about more than doing cardiovascular exercise. An LBD ready body requires some tone, too. Weight training while fasting can help your body build more lean muscle and maintain bone density. Do HIT on three days, and on two other days introduce strengthening exercise for five minutes. We recommend exercises that don’t need any equipment – pushups, jumping jacks or star jumps, wall sits, ab crunches, squats, the plank and lunges. Don’t avoid exercise on a Fast Day but ensure you have two rest days, free of exercise.    SIMPLE SIDES  Spring greens with mustard seeds serve four as a side dish at 27 calories each 1. SPRING GREENS WITH MUSTARD SEEDS   INGREDIENTS - Serves 4 - 27 calories  1 tbsp mustard seeds 1 tsp olive oil 1 small onion, finely sliced 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 tbsp fresh root ginger, grated 500g spring cabbage, shredded 2 tbsp water HOW TO COOK   Dry-fry the mustard seeds until they start to pop.

They’ll last for 2-3 weeks.    GETTING SLIM ISN'T JUST FOR CHRISTMAS - IT'S A WAY OF LIFE  SO WHERE’S THE CATCH? There isn’t one. Fasting, in one form or another, has been practised for centuries. There is no evidence of significant side effects (though some people may experience headaches and constipation, particularly at first; these can generally be prevented by consuming lots of water or calorie-free fluids, such as black coffee and herbal tea, and foods rich in fibre). Indeed, the Fast Diet has helped debunk some of the myths that have developed around the way we eat, for instance: MIMI SAYS... When choosing THAT dress, think about colour. Navy is no-nonsense and benevolent, like a Norton nanny, and a softer alternative to black.  You need to eat whenever you are hungry. Eating every few hours will increase your metabolic rate. If you don’t eat every few hours your blood sugar will fall and you will feel faint. None of these widely held beliefs is backed by science. You will discover that short bouts of hunger are manageable. THE FAST DIET AND WEIGHT LOSS While clinical studies into IF in general, and the 5:2 in particular, are still in their early stages, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that the approach can be startlingly effective. Many thousands of people have adopted the plan and witnessed significant improvements in their weight, cholesterol, and general health (a few have are featured in these pages). My father, for instance, lost four stone over the course of a year on the Fast Diet. That’s the weight of an eight year-old child. I can now get my arms all the way around him when I hug him. It’s a seismic change, and a joy to behold. STICKING TO YOUR PLAN… Hopefully, having read this fabulous pull-out you’ll rearing to go. But what happens in a week or so, when you might need a boost? That’s the time to turn to friends, and take yourself to one side for a stern talking-to. Here are practical ways to help yourself out of the rough… CUSTOMISE HOW SHOULDN'T DO THE FAST DIET    People who are underweight or have an eating disorder Children (under 18 years) Type 1 diabetics and diabetics taking medication for their diabetes (other than Metformin) Pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers People recovering from surgery Those who are frail or have a significant underlying medical condition should speak to their doctor first Those who are not sure about whether it may affect their prescribed medications should to speak to their doctor first People feeling unwell or have a fever Those taking Warfarin should consult their doctor first The key – whether you are doing the Fast Diet or the Fast Diet Max – is to find a plan that works for you. Experiment a little until you find your best fit. Once you’ve completed the six-week regime presented here, your aim is to arrive at a sustainable, lifelong plan. So relax a little and return to classic 5:2 Fast Diet. In fact, rather than think of 5:2 as ‘a diet’, see it as stemming from the classical Greek ‘diaita’. This roughly translates as ‘a manner of living’. A way of life. A commitment to health and wellbeing. BE SENSIBLE It’s vital that this strategy should be practised in a way that’s flexible and forgiving. Take each day as it comes. It’s OK to break the rules if you need to. If you’re concerned about any aspect of the regime, see your doctor. BE KIND… TO YOURSELF Try not to associate fasting with discomfort; be gentle to cultivate the changes you desire and deserve; don’t dwell on the downside, for instance, if a Fast Day is broken. Move along. Do, however, congratulate yourself: every completed Fast Day means potential weight loss. BUDDY UP A supportive friend may well be one of your greatest assets in the weeks ahead; you might even find that they join in. Although the idea of dieting in order to slip into a favourite party dress might be more female territory, the Fast Diet appeals to men equally: couples report that they find it more manageable to do it together, as it makes mealtimes on Fast Days (and, in this case, toughened-up non-Fast Days) infinitely easier. GO TO THE FORUM What’s interesting to me is that the Fast Diet has developed such a lively conversation online. To tune in, go to thefastdiet.co.uk, or check the Facebook groups.  Adapted from The Fast Beach Diet, £7.99; Fast Cook, £9.99; and The Fast Diet Recipe Book, £14; all by Mimi Spencer and part of The Fast Diet series.

Not To My Eyes By Scutify Oct 28, 2016 3:15 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Apple reported earnings this week and the latest numbers have some some pounding the table bullish. For example, here's Forbes from an article titled "Why Apple Is Very Undervalued": Apple still trades at 13x earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 16x. Apple trades at 13x next year's projected earnings. The S&P 500 trades at 16.5x. Clearly it's undervalued compared to the broader market. What about Apple's monster cash position? Apple has even more cash now-a record $237 billion. If we excluded the cash from the valuation, Apple trades at 8.6x earnings. Though not an apples to apples (pun), and just for a reference point, that valuation would group Apple with the likes of these S&P 500 components that trade 8x earnings: Dow Chemical, Prudential Financial, Bed Bath & Beyond, a Norwegian chemical company (LBY), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's safe to say no one is debating whether or not Hewlett Packard is at the pinnacle of its business. Yet, if we strip out the cash in Apple, AAPL shares are trading at an HPE valuation. There are a few things that are problematic with this analysis. First of all, the S&P actually trades at 25 times trailing earnings not 16. I assume the author is using operating not net earnings in arriving at 16x. So an apples to apples comparison (please excuse the pun) makes Apple look even cheaper relative to the broad market. But I've never found this to be a terribly valuable way to determine whether a stock is cheap or not. The other problem with this analysis is that if you want to back out Apple's cash you also have to consider all of the debt the company has piled up in recent years. In fact, as MarketWatch reports today, Apple actually added more debt to their balance sheet than cash last quarter. The $237 billion in cash is not nearly so impressive when you consider the company is now on the hook for $87 billion in debt. Net cash then is only $150 billion. I agree that factoring in a company's net cash or net debt gives you a better picture of their overall financial valuation but looking at just the cash and not the debt is deceiving. Subtracting the net cash out of Apple's $620 billion market cap yields an enterprise value of $470 billion. Still, to compare this number to earnings is also deceiving when the company earns more than a billion dollars per year simply in interest income. Yes, that might be a trivial amount for a company of Apple's size but we should still be diligent about comparing apples to apples. Backing out the interest income, Apple earned $44 billion last year. It currently trades at an enterprise value roughly 10.7x that number, not 8 as the Forbes author would have you believe. Again, 11x might look cheap relative to the 25x the broad stock market trades at but I find little utility in this approach. In fact, Apple has traded at a discount to the broad market for years now and investors might want to try to understand why it has been persistently "undervalued." Apple trades at $115 per share today. It first hit this level almost two years ago. That was the last time I wrote about the stock, revealing why I was selling it. I first bought the stock in early 2013 because I thought it was cheap back then. At the time, I wrote: The current market capitalization is $422 billion (938 million shares times $453 per share). Back out the cash of $137 billion [Apple had no debt at the time] and you get an enterprise value of $285 billion. That amounts to a mere 6 times the company's free cash flow over the past twelve months. In other words, investors get a 16.6% free cash flow return on their investment at the current share price. What's more, Apple, on an enterprise value to EBITDA measure, is now cheaper than the likes of Microsoft and Radio Shack. Even when you don't back out the cash in its bank accounts the stock currently trades at its cheapest valuation at any time over the past decade. Over that time, Apple's stock price has typically found a bottom near 10 times gross cash flow. In 2011, it bottomed at 8.5 times cash flow before running 75% higher over the next 12 months. Today, it trades at 7.5 times cash flow. Any way you slice it that's damn cheap and for one of the most admired brands/most profitable companies in history. I like to compare a company's valuation to its own history and to its peers in determining whether it's cheap or not. In early 2013, it was cheap by both standards but let's update these numbers to see if it's still true today. Apple's enterprise value today is nearly 9x its free cash flow, versus 6x back in early 2013. And if you look at any number of other valuation measures, the stock currently trades right in line with its own 5-year averages. Based on its own history, then, the stock is not cheap; it's just in line with average. The real thing investors need to consider, though, with Apple is the fact that sales back in 2013 were still growing very fast. The stock traded 6x free cash flow while sales were still growing 18% year-over-year. Furthermore, Apple hadn't even begun to sell iPhones in China yet so it still had a huge growth opportunity in front of it. Today, the stock trades 9x FCF and sales are fallingnearly 8% year-over-year. Operating income is falling at an even faster 15% clip. Furthermore, there is no layup growth opportunity out there like there was back then that I can see. Sure, Apple is spending very heavily on research and development that may pay off in the future. As an investor, though, this is very difficult to value (and this might have been why the greatest value investor of all time recently sold out of his position). Can Apple come up with another product as popular and as profitable as the iPhone? Or is the company just a one-hit-wonder? Personally, I think this is an open question. And investors are free to gamble on this outcome but that's not really investing, is it? This article was written by Jesse Felder for The Felder Report on Oct 27, 2016.

But is the added price worth the upgrade?  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple recently unveiled new MacBook Pro models after a long time of not giving enough attention to the MacBook Pro. One of the biggest features in the new 13-inch and 15-inch models is Apple's Touch Bar, a secondary OLED multi-touch panel that changes interfaces depending on the app currently used. Also on board the new MacBook are sixth-generation Skylake processors and Touch ID. Apart from the aforementioned features, there's not much to say about the new MacBook Pro models, aside from having extra power and losing some of the ports from before. This begs the question, is it really worth the upgrade? What's New? The base 13-inch model MacBook Pro doesn't come with the Touch Bar or the Touch ID, but it does come with a 2.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an SSD with 256 GB. It has 8 GB of RAM that can be configured to 16 GB, and it sports an Intel Iris Graphics 540 GPU. Another 13-inch model with the Touch Bar is available for an extra cost, which comes with a more powerful 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Iris Graphics 550 GPU. The 15-inch model comes with the Touch Bar as a standard feature, and the most expensive model has a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, an SSD with 512 GB, integrated Intel HD Graphics 530 and a beefed-up Radeon Pro 455 for its GPU with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic graphics switching. The new butterfly-style keyboard and Force Touch trackpad are also present in the new MacBook Pro models. Beyond that, the changes aren't huge. It's the same Retina display that came with the MacBook Pro in 2015, only 67 percent brighter. Aside from slight cosmetic changes and a considerably thinner chassis, the new MacBook Pro models don more powerful processors, with the higher end 13-inch and the 15-inch model coming with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Overall, it's not a colossal departure from last year's models. Are The New Features Worth The Added Cost? Despite the sizable possibilities with the new Touch Bar, it's safe to say that there was never a demand for the feature in the first place. In fact, what users actually wanted more from an Apple laptop was a touchscreen. There's no telling what developers can come up with Touch Bar, but for something largely unexplored, the Touch Bar seems like a nice add-on instead of a compelling selling point. Consumers aren't likely ready to break bank on the newer models just for the Touch Bar alone. If anything, maybe they'd put more consideration into the sixth-generation processors on these models as a defining factor. For now, the Touch Bar and Touch ID are nice bonuses for the more powerful MacBook Pro models, but it's an exaggeration to call it something revolutionary since the MacBooks are perfectly functional even without them. Should You Upgrade? One of the best deciding factors to arrive at a conclusion is to ask yourself what exactly will you use the MacBook for. Will you use it as an all-around laptop that can do basic functions such as web browsing, word processing, intermediate photo or video editing? Or are you intending to use graphics-intensive software as part of your profession? Apple is targeting filmmakers, editors, designers and creative professionals in trying to sell the Touch Bar as a necessary innovation in the way we interact with software. So if you're not part of that demographic, it's highly unlikely that you'll find the Touch Bar a compelling feature to have to justify the added cost. If you're itching for a MacBook Pro but you aren't that enthusiastic about the added bells and whistles of the newer models, then last year's MacBook would serve you just fine. In fact, those who are planning to get the new MacBook pro models are in for some hefty dongle purchases since they only come with two to four USB-C ports compared with last year's model that carried an HDMI port, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, an SD card reader and two USB 3.0 ports. In conclusion, if you're willing to shell out the added cost and upgrade, then do as you please. But if you're a bit skeptical, it's probably best to trust your gut. A comprehensive comparison of last year's MacBook Pro models should equip you sufficiently and let you know exactly what you're getting if your eyes are set on the older MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro 2015 model starts at $1,299, while the newer base model sans the Touch Bar starts at $1,499. The 15-inch MacBook Pro 2015 model costs $1,999, while the newer 15-inch model costs $2,399. You can compare different models directly at Apple's website.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Study: Firefighters face battles with cancer more than public as a whole Saturday Oct 29, 2016 at 5:33 PM Nov 1, 2016 at 9:40 AM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz APPLE VALLEY — While residents continue to praise firefighters for risking their lives battling the recent Pilot and Bluecut fires, many first responders are battling another danger. Several research reports found that 68 percent of firefighters develop cancer compared to about 22 percent of the general population, no matter the race or gender. “Years ago, a firefighter would fight a structure fire and deal mostly with burning wood,” Chief Sid Hultquist, with the Apple Valley Fire Protection District, told the Daily Press. “Today, our men and women are dealing with all types of burning materials that emit toxic inhalants.” Hultquist said even with breathing and body protection, many carcinogens enter the body through the skin, especially in the exposed neck area. “Not only are we dealing with burning material from a structure fire, we also have to deal with burning chemicals and also contaminants from drug labs,” Hultquist said. “When we go into a fire, we now have to battle more than just the fire.” San Bernardino County Assistant Fire Chief Ron Walls and Hultquist said even trying to clean fire gear after a blaze has been problematic, with firefighters unsure if all toxins have been removed from their gear. “Unfortunately, little is known about what it takes to remove chemical toxins and biologic pathogens in gear — and at what point the gear is clean enough to not be a risk to the firefighters they are supposed to protect,” according to a consortia of researchers, led by Casey Grant at the Fire Protection Research Foundation. Cory Norton, an engineer/paramedic with the San Bernardino County Fire Department, who has served with the agency for nearly 10 years, said he’s battled a rare form of cancer since being diagnosed earlier this year. Norton, a father of two young children with his wife, Tawni, is battling an aggressive epithelioid sarcoma near his lumbar spine, which has metastasized into his lungs. The 29-year-old firefighter has endured several treatments including chemotherapy, radiation and multiple surgeries. “It’s been a daily battle, but I have a great support system,” Norton told the Daily Press after he was awarded a Hesperia Hometown Hero award from Walls last month. “I just have to keep fighting the fight.” County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig said it was the heroic efforts of firefighters like Norton who risked their lives that stopped both the Pilot Fire and the Bluecut Fire. After meeting with a physician, Norton discovered his cancer was so rare that his doctor had never seen it in his 28-year career. Because of the rarity of the cancer and its location, the outcome of treatment and Norton’s prognosis remain uncertain. Several studies have reported nearly 30 forms of cancer have been commonly found among firefighters, including bladder, colon, intestine, kidney, lung, stomach, testis and prostate cancer, as well as leukemia, malignant melanoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. At the beginning of his career, Norton was injured after a high elevation fall where he broke several vertebrae. After several surgeries and time off, Norton returned to work but later began experiencing back pain. When he sought medical treatment for his back, doctors discovered the malignant tumor. Norton did not battle the Bluecut and Pilot fires, but did spend two weeks in August at the River Complex in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest protecting structures in Trinity Village. Norton, along with several county firefighters, were among those from 19 states went to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to battle 40 lightning fires that converged to burn 45,000 acres. “Everybody with county fire and our fire district knows Cory and his family,” Hultquist said. “He’s from a firefighter family and the entire firefighter community is praying for him and his family.” In a two-year span beginning in 2013, more than 160 firefighters died in the line of duty, but cancer claimed more lives than fire. A combined population of 30,000 firefighters from three large cities had higher rates of several types of cancers, and of all cancers combined, than the U.S. population as a whole, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Cancers of the respiratory, digestive and urinary systems accounted mostly for the higher rates of cancer seen in the study population. The higher rates suggest that firefighters are more likely to develop those cancers, research found. Also, the population of firefighters in the study had a rate of mesothelioma two times greater than the rate in the U.S. population as a whole. This was the first study ever to identify an excess of mesothelioma in U.S. firefighters. The researchers said it was likely that the findings were associated with exposure to asbestos, a known cause of mesothelioma. “I know they’re working on new gear to protect firefighters and that’s a wonderful thing,” Hultquist said. “We’re urging our people to get regular checkups and to keep their health in check.” For more information, visit www.firefightercancersupport.org.

Spend a little more time on the Internet and you’re sure to see the plethora of articles pointing out how Apple seems to become less and less innovative as years go by, many even pointing to Microsoft as a great example of innovation with their really fantastic Surface Pro line of portable computers and the newly announced Surface Studio. Microsoft more innovative and creative than Apple? Let’s dig in and figure out what happened. In his book, "Start With Why," Author Simon Sinek discusses the concept of a company’s “why,” emphasizing the idea that people don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. Sinek frequently references Apple as a company that established their why from the beginning of the company and have held true to it through the life of the company. "Start With Why" was released in 2009, however, and I am fairly certain that Sinek has a different opinion on Apple’s direction seven years removed from the publishing of his book. Sinek has a concept that he refers to as The Golden Circle, a way of defining your company that keeps you centered on why.   He uses Apple to demonstrate how they hold true to their why, and what they would look like if they didn’t. If Apple were like most other companies, a marketing message from them would move from the outside in of The Golden Circle. It would start with some statement of what the company does or makes, followed by how they think they are different or better than the competition, followed by some call to action. With that, the company would expect some behavior in return, in this case a purchase. A marketing message from Apple, if they were like everyone else, might sound like this: 'We make great computers. They’re beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. Wanna buy one?' Sinek contrasts this example by laying out how Apple actually markets themselves (or at least, how they used to): Let’s look at that Apple example again and rewrite the example in the order Apple actually communicates. This time, the example starts with why: 'Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly. And we happen to make great computers. Wanna buy one?' That line right there is what used to encapsulate Apple as a company, “We exist to challenge the status quo.” Apple has done this since their inception, challenging the idea of what a personal computer should be, what kind of expertise it should take to use one, and what the experience of the user should be like. Even during the Jobs-less period of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Apple continued to push against the status quo of what a computer was, and what the experience of using one was supposed to be like. Let’s rewind back to ‘80s for a moment. Remember this gem?     This isn’t just challenging the status quo, it’s shattering it (literally and metaphorically). Apple’s drive to inspire users and not just sell them features was as foundational in their company as the idea of freedom is for Southwest Airlines (Sinek has a great writeup on Southwest in the book, won’t get into it here). The point is that, for over 20 years, Apple has stood for something, and it’s something their users have identified with, but now that something is disappearing and we’re no longer as captivated as we used to be. I grew up as a lover of computers. Our very first computer was an Apple IIc, and I swear to you that thing was magic. A few years later, we moved to PC, and I was captivated again. By the time I was 11, I was foraging parts to build bastardized PC’s in my bedroom, dumpste- diving and hitting up resale shops to try and upgrade every part I could. I was so deep into the PC mindset you wouldn’t believe it. I made fun of Macs and the people who used them. I built my own stuff; I didn’t need some gimmicky purple laptop to feel cool. Did those people even know how to edit their registry? Then I graduated high school, and someone gave me the white MacBook as a graduation gift. I was going to sell it and use that money to get the Alienware laptop of my dreams, when I thought “what the hell” and I opened the box up, booted up my first Mac, and I was done.   You’ll call it being a fanboy or drinking the Kool-Aid or whatever, but I went from thinking Apple was a joke to thinking they might be the greatest company of all time. Everything just made sense. The operating system was intuitive, even for a hardcore Windows truther like me. The aesthetic fit me, the experience was not just enjoyable, but relatable, and I fell hard. No really, I fell hard. Two months later I was working at the local Apple Store where I spent the next year seeing how Apple’s why inundated not just their products, but their culture and business practices. Since then (2008), I have owned four different Apple laptops (and just ordered the new one, more on that later), a Mac Pro, every generation of iPhone, several iPod Touches (and an iPod shuffle, we can all agree that was a mistake), a few iPads, and an Apple TV. I’ve gotten my family on Macs, my wife on a Mac, I’m the guy friends come to with their Apple questions, and I answer them gladly. But for the last few years, I have felt less and less connected to the brand that sucked me in and more like I’m buying a product for the features. Nothing wrong with that, but feeling marginal contentment is quite a dropoff after years of feeling inspired. At the core of it, that’s what Apple did: they inspired users, not through clever marketing or manipulations, but through genuineness in vision and purpose that came through in their products. Remember that line from Sinek’s book about how Apple challenges the status quo and they do that by making beautiful products that are simple to use and user-friendly? The how of that is still the same; their products are still beautiful, they’re simple to use, and they’re user-friendly, but the why behind that seems to be gone. Why does Apple make beautiful products? Because that’s what they do and that’s what they believe their brand is built on. So what’s the reason for this loss of why? The easy answer is that Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 and that he was the driving catalyst behind Apple’s why. Well, sometimes the easy answer is the right one. Many pundits and industry “insiders” have said much of the same thing, but it’s not just the simple absence of Jobs that explains the slow decline of Apple and the loss of innovation. He was absolutely relentless in the pursuit of Apple’s why. Users shouldn’t be content, they should be inspired. User experience was everything, not because that would help drive the bottom line, but because it was the right way to make something. Think about Apple’s advertising. The ads you remember weren’t about features or upgrades, they were about inspiring a certain aesthetic, a certain personality. Remember the awesome “Get a Mac” TV spots? No one wanted to be John Hodgman; everyone wanted to be Justin Long. Well, maybe not everyone, but Jobs (and Apple) would have told you that they didn’t care about the consumers that wanted to be PCs; they wanted to inspire the users that wanted to be Macs. To do what Apple did in their advertising took balls, no way around it. They had absolute confidence in their vision and in their why. “Here’s a commercial of some silhouettes dancing around on color backgrounds. Why? Because we love to dance to our music. Music should be simple; there shouldn’t be a barrier between you and your music. We don’t have to wow you with the features of our music player because it’s not about how much storage the iPod has or what formats it supports; it just makes enjoying your music easy. Why a click wheel? Because buttons for music are dumb, so we did something better. We think of experience first first, and the features that experience dictates are what we make.” Apple used to be relentless about its pursuit of features that might seem trivial, but enhanced the user experience beyond normal computer specs. I present as Exhibit A the MagSafe. Yeah, magnetic power adapter, whoop-de-doo, but it was small touches like these that made Apple stand out and that elevated the user’s experience. Do you know what feature I bragged about to people when I took my MacBook places? It wasn’t the processor or the amount of RAM I had put in or even the cool, sleek design of the computer’s body, it was that silly little magnetic power plug that popped into place with no effort at all and popped right off if someone or something tripped on the cord. The MagSafe was one the many tiny ways that Apple told its users: “We get it, we’re one of you, this thing about computers sucks, and we don’t care how other people do it, we’re going to do it better.” Well, now the MagSafe is gone, and sure, it’s gone for good reasons; USB-C is a great standard, and it needs to be driven forward for the market to adopt it fully. But the MagSafe is more than just a nifty feature that we all need to move on from for the good of the computing industry, it’s symbolic of the mindset of a company that for so many years seemed to be in lockstep with creatives, understanding our needs and operating as a partner and not just a vendor. Watch the video above again; it’s not a spot about a great feature, it’s saying: “Well yeah, our computers do this because that’s how computers should work, we don’t care how everyone else charges their laptops.” And now, that “feature” is gone. I get it. A large contingent of PC users out there haven’t even read this far and have just scrolled down to the comments to explain all the reasons why they never used Macs, and that’s fine. When it comes down to it, this is just a computer company: they sell a commodity that we buy. But what made Apple different from the IBMs, Toshibas, HPs, or whatever company is making PCs now (is Gateway still a thing?) was how they connected with the needs of their users, and that difference seems to be slipping away, keynote after keynote. So all of that brings me to Microsoft, who announced their Surface Studio the day before Apple’s MacBook announcement. Sure, the announcement felt more like a dressed up infomercial than a TED Talk, but I can’t deny that I felt that same spark of inspiration that I used to feel from Apple announcements. Of course it’s a touchscreen with a stylus! I don’t want to be divorced from my images when I work on them, constantly looking down at my keyboard (or Touch Bar) while I work; I want to be in my images. And of course the display tilts down to a usable angle! It just makes so much sense! Now, do I think that Microsoft has suddenly discovered their why and are on their way to supplant Apple and take back the creative market from the longtime leader? No, I don’t. I honestly think Microsoft has stumbled into something great with the Surface Pro and now the Surface Studio. I almost get the sense that they don’t necessarily understand why those two products are so compelling, but they sure are excited that they are. If they discover that why and embrace it, then awesome. I have no beef with Microsoft. I want companies to succeed, and I want them to make inspirational products for users and not just iterative ones, so if Microsoft heads that direction, then fantastic. All of this to say, I bought the new MacBook Pro. I bought an (almost) maxed-out model, and I’m actually pretty excited to see what sort of additional functionality the Touch Bar adds to my workflow, but that’s really it. My current MacBook Pro is three years old, and I need the latest tech features to help maximize my productivity. This was a purely feature-based decision. When it comes down to it, I think that the Surface Pro might be a better product for my needs; I just really don’t like Windows. It’s a decision that was all about features, not about inspiration. The days of feeling like I am buying a product from a company that understands me, that has the same values as me are gone. I no longer feels inspired by my Apple products; I just feel...productive.

I'm late to the Mac train. I used to build PCs as well. I still love my Mid-2014 MacBook Pro but more than that, I love the customer service that comes with it. I remember the days of being on hold for literally two hours to get 7 minutes worth of customer service. When I don't understand something on my Mac or iOS device or just yesterday, my AirPort Extreme, I get helped nearly immediately and they stay on the line long enough to ensure themselves that I completely understand. Honestly, I can deal with a features based purchase as long as the people keep me excited. While I haven't been on the Mac train ling enough to notice a loss of why, who knows, the people who I speak with in CS might just be able to inspire the why back into Apple. 2 0 Usman Dawood - October 29, 2016 I was almost someone who didn't read the article and just left a comment instead haha. 2 0 Tomas Ramoska - October 29, 2016 13-inch MacBook Pro powered by dual-core processor and Intel Iris Graphics 550 no dedicated video card this is joke yes? :) I will remind you we almost in 2017. UK price £1,949 should be not more than £999 1 0 Alan Klughammer - October 29, 2016 Tomas Ramoska exactly the point of the article... if you want more power, get the 15 inch. But yeah, Apple seems to have dropped the ball with this iteration... 2 -1 Tomas Ramoska - October 30, 2016 Alan Klughammer 13-inch MacBook Pro they should call it just MacBook definitely not PRO 2 0 Kawika Lopez - October 29, 2016 [Edited] This is a great article that grasps a lot of the frustration I've had with Apple lately. I would like to pose a theory though. I think Apple is still operating of of the same 'Why' that it was years ago. Hear me out. They are determined to challenge the status quo and thinking differently. How? They're moving forward and leaving inefficient concepts and dated technologies behind. But then they came to the what, and Steve wasn't there to say, "No." I think the problem is ultimately the "What" and it's execution. Thoughts? 1 0 Oz Photo - October 29, 2016 [Edited] Apple has been going no where now for years, their technology is no different than other vendors, Their electronics are no better, their OS software is still just an OS no better than the others, but they are better at branding. Microsoft has not been good at that. However you can't continue to just change a few things and rely on your branding from one phone and laptop to another. It's boring and not innovative. Branding does not excite me, innovation does. Now I must say that these new products from Microsoft, the Surface and the Surface Studio are very exciting. It remains to be seen whether Microsoft will continue with innovation but for this point in time what they have done leaves Apple behind. 1 0 Daris Fox - October 29, 2016 I use both Windows and macOS and say up front there's no bad OS, but there is a bad PC and both Apple and IBM clone manufacturers are guilty as each other in producing them. In the early days Apple had the conviction to drive their view and people accepted it, why? Because they was often right and they owned their own eco-system so they had total control over it. This is something MS learned the hard way, their hubris culminated in MS Vista but after that you started to see the changes in MS from Win 7 on-wards. The philosophy behind the Surface line is more akin to the original Apple Vision, it's a halo product to be the best that technology can be but more importantly to designed to allow you to be creative and to look stunning. The transformation of MS has taken a better part of the decade, but this article isn't about MS it's about Apple. So you have to ask why didn't they take advantage of MS's own stumbles (and OEM partners) over the last decade? There's been plenty of opportunities and the answer really comes down to mobile devices. The fact that Apple took nearly 4 years to replace the Macbook Pro says it all, and they release a lukewarm make-over (especially against existing laptops on the market like the Surfacebook or Yoga) only when their mobile divisions are starting to flat line or shrink. Sure the TouchStrip is interesting tech, but again it's not attention grabbing, there's been several failures on the PC over the years. However one thing that'll goes against Apple's own philosophy and the reason a lot of people loved Apple computers and the OS is the UI/UX was second to none. taking away the Function keys is a user hostile move. As a touch typist I don't want to be looking up and down trying to find a non-tactile target potentially of varying size let alone finding the esc key. Then you have the removal of other features that photographers my find useful such as video out or even a SD card slot. All this said Apple is pursuing their own vision of the future as is MS. MS sees convergence whereas Apple sees diversity. Neither Vision is 'wrong' but Apple is starting to fray at the edge because before they was relatively unique (especially in the PowerPC days) and didn't suffer the travails of being ubiquitous, before when they was a niche product they had a prestige and a sense of Elitism to go with their marketing. When Apple started to get popular you started to see the cracks in the quality control and also security. In delaying the release of the Macbook Pro so long they've lost some of their mindshare that existed and allowed the competition to steal a march on them and even surpass them. Also Apple was looked to produce the 'Next Big Thing', the tech press always looked to Apple as the weather gauge as to the future of tech. Last year they got lambasted for being a "Me Too" company copying the Surface Pro with their own iPad Pro. However this year more than any other year the Press hasn't been kind to Apple, something usually unheard of as Apple is notorious for being ruthless about not inviting press that says things detrimental to the companies image. Add into the fact the decisions they've done over the last few years with software (OS X Server, Final Cut Pro, the Macbook Pro being limited to 16Gb RAM and so on) has alienated large swathes of their user base. 0 0 1 0 As a multitasking creative content creator: Oh why didn't they give an option of more than 16GB of RAM, whyyyyy? And why did they not make the touchpad Pencil-compatible? Fergal O'Callaghan - October 29, 2016 I think Apple has lost its way. iPhones and iPads are easy to use but the Mac Operating system is awful and so is iTunes . Both very poorly designed and a poor user experience. MacOS makes Windows 10 look good. Apple got a lucky break with Samsung battery issues. It's very hard for Apple to make their IPhones different. The operating system was perfected in the first version. Every new phone looks remarkably like the previous one. I was surprised Apple didn't bring out a large IPad first before the large Surface Pro. They were miles ahead of Microsoft but Microsoft have caught up. A lot of users still want a keypad and Microsoft caters for it. A number of Cop shows have large touch computers - that was pointing the way to the future. I can see a lot of executives wanting that large Surface Pro. Hopefully it will spur on Apple. The industry seemed to be running out of ideas. 0 0 Scott Villalobos - October 29, 2016 I switched to Mac about two years ago, have been very happy I did. But like you, since Steve Jobs is gone, I feel like the innovation is gone as well. It's like no one is pushing them anymore. I hate Windows, seems to be updating for 30 mins everytime I use my PC. No so with my Mac, updates take seconds, it runs like a champ and no virus'. But, I have to say, when I saw the Surface Studio ad I was wow'd. Apple needs another Steve Jobs at the wheel, someone who will push his people to think beyond, to say good enough just isn't. I was pretty bummed to learn they won't be making a 5K Cinema display, that I would have to go and buy an LG or something. Not impressing me with this years offerings. 1 0 michael andrew - October 30, 2016 I use my computer to edit photos and videos. It does not get in my way, once it does I will update it. I use my phone for nearly everything else. I read the news, blogs ect on my phone. Many are like me. I believe computers are literally becoming less relevant, compared to tablets and phones. I hardly browse the Internet on my computer anymore. I work so much on my computer that I simply loath being near it when I don't have to be. 0 0 Steve Urkel - October 30, 2016 [Edited] Apples inability to "Think Different" Is easy to explain. Jobs was a visionary. Cook was a bean counter. Ive was a designer. All three were necessary to bring Apple to greatness. But with Jobs gone and no one to replace him then the company is pretty much exactly what you'd get with a bean counter and designer in charge. Products that are over-designed and over-priced but are uninspiring and unfocused. 2 0 Scott Weaver - November 1, 2016 [Edited] Steve Urkel Exactly. Remember that Cook promoted Ive to a level next to godhood at Apple. I wonder if he can say no to him? Ive needs to be told no, and Apple is melding its fading iPad line with the laptop, because that's the direction Apple needs to go in. 0 0 Paulius Palaima - October 30, 2016 I must say, I agree with almost everything you said. I myself have set up everything apple in my home, not going into details it is just simpler that way. Yet, in the end your essay starts sounding like someone with Stockholm syndrome. It does seem like you regret that purchase yet for some reason have difficulties admitting it. While I love OS X, and absolute despise using Windows (for me it is just naturally backwards to how I work), Apple as a whole has become rather a gimmick. 1 0 Alessandro Bondielli - October 30, 2016 Thats exactly how I feel right now! The main problem though is that here in Italy Apple raised the prices of MacBook Pro so much (e.g. old 15'' is still sold at 2300 euros, new base model 15'' is 2800 euros + dongles) that even if I dislike windows with all my heart, now that I have to buy a new computer I am unsure what to do. 0 0 Doc Pixel - October 30, 2016 I think the next (obvious?) headline is probably, "How Apple Ruined My Chances of Ever Being Considered A Professional Photographer". I wish I was kidding. 0 0 Frederic Dupoux - October 30, 2016 @Andrew this was an interesting read and well written article but allow me to tell you that you're are missing the point here. Apple is again and still fighting the status quo, and you like most consumers are immersed in the idea that innovation means doing something that you have never seen before. Touch screen laptops and desktops are the worst "innovations" of our time it has been done before i.e the cyntiq and many pc hardware companies have tried it a long time ago and failed. Now that the touch screen technology is nicer and more accurate they are trying to bring it back. It's failing for the simple reason that it is not natural to tap on your laptop's screen or desktop's screen it is far more natural to hold a tablet or a phone and work with your fingers. With the new touch bar Apple is fighting the idea that every new computer should have that same touch screen tech. Instead of adopting the trend like everybody else they actually just came out with the perfect combination of touch input and computer use kind of like adding a tool that will become a standard and always present on your machine not an external device like that scroll wheel microsoft just came out with the day you loose it or it stops working you'll only become handicapped from your work routine. To sum it all up, theTouch Bar is innovative and the right thing to do because people can't use touch screen laptops like they use tablets. This is innovation, you can't grasp it just yet like everything that's NEW and INNOVATIVE. p.s i don't understand the move of removing the magsafe but there must be a valid reason to it we will find out. 1 0 Andrew Richardson - October 30, 2016 Frederic Dupoux With all due respect, I don't think you understand me. I have no illusions about what innovation "should be". I still consider Apple to be an innovative company, but I believe they now innovate for the sake of features and not out of a primary drive for user experience and inspiration. Pointing to things that Apple did before anyone else is an easy way of illustrating my point, but it's not the only thing that Apple used to do that "challenged the status quo". Apple's entire retail concept was wrapped around the idea of challenging what a retail experience should be for the consumer. None of what they did in their retail stores were all the revolutionary, but the small things they did created a retail experience most consumers had never had before. Even that experience is now being lost as the Retail directive becomes more and more focused on systematizing everything to such a degree that the customer is no longer the focus and going to the Apple store no longer feels like a personal relaxing experience; it feels like most other retail shops. Again, I did not say that Apple is no longer innovative, I said their core direction and 'why' have changed, therefore their innovation has changed. 2 0 Robert Feliciano - October 30, 2016 Frederic Dupoux @Frederic "i don't understand the move of removing the magsafe but there must be a valid reason to it we will find out." Why do most companies do anything? It's to make or save money. Why add another port when the USB-C port will charge it? I think it's a good idea, now I can bring my laptop to my office, my client's office or home without an AC adapter, just the cable. I can plug it into a monitor to power it. Though I'm sure I'll miss it the next time I knock my laptop to the floor instead of just pulling out the cable. 1 0 Sergio Tello - October 30, 2016 I have been using Apple computers since the Power Mac 6500, about 20 years ago. I used and replaced 7 other macs since then. Personally, I think the problem with Apple is their success, especially with the iPhone. They used to be cool but functional, now days they are trying to be cooler, but they are rendering themselves nonfunctional. It's style over substance all day long at Apple now days. Such a shame. I bought my first PC last year, now I use both Apple and PC, maybe in the future I'll just stick with PCs. 0 0 Allan Higa - October 30, 2016 I would have to disagree and say that their why has not changed. You stayed that their why is challenging the status quo, making computers that are easy to use, and beautifully designed. The status quo is currently hybrid touch screen laptops that double as tablets. Apple is clearly making a stance by saying that keeping the computer, a keyboard and mouse driven idea that requires precision a finger can't replicate, and the iPad, a touch interface, separate gives their customers the best experience possible. Making computers easy to use, the touch bar accomplishes this. Realize that people who read this site are the 1%, the power users who memorize Photoshop keyboard shortcuts, know how to switch between safari tabs without clicking on them with the mouse, etc. For the other 99% of their customers, macOS is easy to use, but these shortcuts are not intuitive and remain completely unknown to them. The Touch Bar is a beautiful piece of technology that brings productivity to the masses by allowing them to get the same app specific productivity without having to reach for the mouse or trackpad and dig into the menus to find different actions and tools. For us here, the 1%, the Touch Bar may not prove to be useful as you know that the [ and ] keys adjust photoshop brush size, but for everyone else learning to use the program, its game changing for them. Yes I do believe force touch on the iPhone is not as intuitive for this same population, but their same why and innovation is there in the hopes of making a product that is beautifully designed and easy to use. Yes the MagSafe is gone, it Apple is clearly moving to a wireless world where you're not plugged in for the sake of mobility and battery life enables this. If Apple's belief is that you should be able to use it unplugged, completely free of cables, the MagSafe is no longer relevant. Yes it's a Pro device that will have most professionals plugging in externals and displays, but in that case, the MagSafe wouldn't save your computer anyways. Craig Federighi just did an interview with CNET he clearly paints this same ideologies, it's a great watch and it assures their user base that they are still focused and have a clear understanding of where they are and what they want to be. 1 -1 JAS Square - October 30, 2016 "When it comes down to it, I think that the Surface Pro might be a better product for my needs; I just really don’t like Windows." Honestly, I don't think so. I have no MacBook but iPhone and iPad + AppleTV (not the latest but the one before). And I have a SurfacePro4! I work in Germany (IT Consulting) and I do that on windows now since the early nineties. First at university I had a PC desktop, later at work I had a PC notebook. Mostly I had Thinkpads. First when the were still from IBM and later the Lenovo versions. My last was the X1Carbon. That was the best PC I ever had, not just by absolute measures, but also by relative means, judging the PCs in relation to their time. Now I have the SurfacePro 4 connected to the dock and to that attached I have two monitors. Maybe the surface is a nice tool if you don't do that, (dock + external monitor) but if you want to be productive I guess, you do not want to edit pictures on that tiny display. Judging by the above mentioned standard, relative to the time I went from the best PC to the worst PC in my working history. I can explain why I think like that, but that way I would continue to be off topic, as this is about the why of Apple and not about Microsoft... so sorry for that detour, but your quote made me think I need to tell Andrew, that the SurfacePro is nothing to look jealously into the PC block. Best wishes J. 0 0 0 0 Fascinating how 2 announcements can so immediately clarify: 1. I love my Macs. 2. But I merely skimmed their announcement 3. While I immediately fantasized my life with the Surface Studio. Luke Adams - October 30, 2016 I was a long-time PC user (and one constantly rolling my eyes at the people who bought Macs and had no idea why they were buying one other than it was trendy). My last PC purchase was a SP3. Not long ago, I started a school program that required me to have a Mac. Now I own a MBP 15". The end result is that I won't be going back to PC for a long time. Even with the nice SP3 running the nice windows 10, there's just something about the MBP that just "works". No, it's not a night and day difference, but those few percentage points of more reliable, better cohesive, less buggy behaviour really goes a long way towards keeping me sane in a world of technology where something always seems to be wrong. MS is always annoying me too with always being late to the game and feeling the need to make their own version of this and that, and then abandoning it or drastically changing it because it doesn't catch on. All that said, I agree that the tides seem to be turning against Apple. Some of it does seem to be their own doing, and some of it just seems to be inevitable. Hats off to MS for a really cool new product. But, that said, I think Apple did something really cool with the new MBP as well with the touch strip. I think it's a fantastic idea and for someone who doesn't really like a full touchscreen - a real ingenious alternative. Anyway, yeah, I hate how the need for profits result in having to make a new model every year which must have new features, which are often not really helpful, and also can be a real pita for existing users as we have to update the OS, update different programs, buy dongles, etc. Bleh! 1 0 Dean Allman - October 30, 2016 Nice article. As an Apple shareholder, former Windows user, current Mac user (including a 3 year old MacBook Pro), I found this latest product announcement put me over the edge. For the first time in years I am worried about the direction Apple is going. I am sure people will buy the new MacBook Pro, but Apple has made this machine a lot harder to want to buy for many other users. How many USB-C devices are currently on the market? Smashing the status quo by abandoning the SD card, USB-3 and HDMI inputs, and the MagSafe connection, and raising prices, and giving us the TouchBar which may be nifty and sleek but has yet to prove it's utility, and not letting us even plug our iPhones into the damned thing, may make management feel like they are living up to their mantra, but for many of us we are simply wondering why they are going this way. It only seems to have the effect if decreasing the number of users who will want to upgrade their machines. Surely that is not the kind of "why" that Apple intended. . 0 0 John Deir - October 30, 2016 I do not agree with the concept of what, how, why. I believe that the PC is a tool and as such I use it to perform and complete a project. And that project can be different for every end user. Example: I need a hammer so I go to the hardware store and there's all types of hammers from finish, roofing, framing, furniture, demolition...and so on. I'll purchase a hammer for the purpose of the job at hand and may have several different type for other purposes intended. There are a few multi-use ones but none that cover all uses. Thus the same concept should be implemented with PC's: types for photographers, videographers, bloggers, musicians, designers, graphic artist, construction, architects... another words from the point of use and need with efficiency and purpose. Nowadays most PC's are developed/built to do this or that, but do not mix well with all the software and applications that the purchaser installs. If the PC is made specifically to function at its maximum related to the software recommended to perform with and different ones per a person's level of need then that to me would be innovative. Microsoft's latest Surface product is meeting that nich need. Apples is just adding revamped features upgrades that do not meet a specific need. I wished Adobe would come out with a PC unit which would work exclusively with their CC products. Think about it, a tool that works in the environment they create. 0 0 Mark James - October 30, 2016 I switched to a macpro a little over a year ago. I'm a photographer with a fairly standard work flow and I have never been able to get comfortable with the mac trying to take control of how I want to do things. I assumed it was just a learning curve and in a few months I'd be praising the glory of macs to everyone. That has not happened. Many things take to many extra steps and I find it frustrating. I also found the mac is just a big marketing tool and it is always trying to get me to spend more money an apple stuff. I hate marketing like that and refuse to be forced to use their stuff just because I have one product. Have you ever priced thunderbolt products!!!! I had to buy aftermarket SW just to sort my photos by date taken because none of the mac users I know in the graphic arts industry could show me how to do it. I needed yet another aftermarket program to get basic EXIF data from my images. The list go's on and on and I will go back to a more user friendly windows device at my next upgrade. Needless to say macs are not for everyone, but if you prefer to be lead and are a natural follower then it might be the right product for you. I personally prefer to have my equipment work the way I do and not the other way around. 0 0 Andre Goulet - October 31, 2016 Mark James This is so typical: each of the things you say you can't do on the Mac are readily available with the built-in tools. EXIF data is a right-click away, sorting photos by date can be done very easily in several places. You can even merge PDF's, fill out PDF's forms, resize photos, change their dpi, rotate them, etc, all with the built in tools. 1 0 Art Altman - October 31, 2016 I was disappointed in the new MacBook Pro until I tried it!!! Go to the Apple Store. They have the 13" with function keys on display now and soon the models with the OLED display replacing the function keys. The new MBP is much smaller than the old one. It looks and feels like a jewel. It feels right. I ordered the 15". :-) I am very curious about Windows but when I look at the best options (Surface pro maxed out) how different is the pricing relative to power really? Is Microsoft support as good as Apples? Is Windows as well integrated with iPhones (or Androids?). I have zero interest in a touch screen on a computer. Much prefer keyboard, mouse, track pad and soon a Wacom. Some months ago my current MacBook Pro stopped working at around 9pm on a weekday. I went to the 24 hour Apple Store, got it diagnosed, and walked out with a new one to use as a temporary by midnight. (Ok, how many cities have 24 hour Apple Stores like NYC, but still ....). I think that a lot of what we pay for in the price of the Apple is for service and high quality construction and design. I went to the Dell web site to check on their computers and yes, you can get similar power and features for $1000 less but even just navigating the web site was a pain in the butt and dealing with their "chat" person was agonizing. I have heard horror stories before about Dell support (please post here about your experience, I am curious, probably others as well). 0 0 Pages 1 2 next › last » Follow @Fstoppers Featured Products Fstoppers OriginalNew Architectural Photography Mike Kelley's Where Art Meets Architecture 2 Fstoppers OriginalNew Swimwear Photography Joey Wright: Swimwear Photography - Lighting, Posing, and Retouching Fstoppers OriginalNew Cityscape Photography Photographing the World: Cityscape, Astrophotography, and Advanced Post-Processing Fstoppers Original Lighting Peter Hurley: Illuminating The Face Support Fstoppers   Popular Articles How to Get Perfect Colors from Your Raw Files Straight Out of the Camera with Capture One Planning for the Shot of a Lifetime - Supermoon 2016 Photography Book Review of Landscape Artist Extraordinaire: Alexandre Deschaumes - Voyage Éthéré First Impressions of the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8 L III Tips and Tricks for Photographing Groups of Dogs Can the New MacBook Pro Handle 5K ProRes Video Editing at Ease?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     MacBook Pro Touch Bar Pro Runs EOS, A Variant Of WatchOS Posted: Oct 29 2016, 1:55pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Apple     The 2016 MacBook Pro is finally out. The general public opinion and analyst view may vary. But Apple thinks Touch bar is definitely the right way to introduce Touch on a PC and this inclusion is here to stay. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals When a new hardware or software is usually announced individuals with technical knowledge dig in deep to see what they can find out. This is what Steve-troughton smith has done too. He has discovered that Apple’s Touch bar is powered by variant of the SoC which is also used in the Apple watch. Granted, the ‘watchOS’ the T1 runs is presumably only ‘watchOS’ by dint of the CPU it’s designed for. T1 must be very similar to S1— Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) October 28, 2016 Apple calls it the T1 chip. Steve has also found out that the T1 chip that Apple mentioned on October 27 seems to run off a disk image. This disk image is a direct descendent of the watchOS. watchOS was the operating system used for the Apple Watch. In addition, it also seems like Apple has christened the operating system powering the T1 chip as eOS. This may be a reference to the fact that the eOS is a true operating system incorporated into the macOS to power the Touch bar specifically. Troughton Smith Steve gave information in his tweet.

(AP) — All of Minnesota's 201 legislators are on the ballot on Election Day, but the fight for control of the Legislature won't be spread evenly across the state. The fight is taking shape in suburbs like Apple Valley, one of several Republican-held districts that Democrats are targeting in their quest to win back control of the House. In the Senate, a Republican challenger's campaign to defeat the incumbent Democrat in rural southeastern Minnesota will be pivotal for the GOP. Democratic House candidate Erin Maye Quade says she's undaunted by all the outside attention to her Apple Valley race. Her Republican opponent, Ali Jimenez-Hopper, says focus is keeping her going. Democrats need to win seven seats to regain control of the House. Republicans need six seats to win control of the Senate.

As far as Microsoft’s VP of Surface Marketing is concerned, the Touch Bar that Apple has added to these new models is just the first step towards a touch-capable MacBook. Touch and detachable MacBook coming In a series of tweets posted a few hours ago, Brian Hall explains that he’s 100 percent sure that Apple will make a MacBook with touch display at some point in the future and there are 95 percent chances that this screen would be detachable. “I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable.

Daily Deals: Amazon Echo $120, 23-inch HP display $87, and more   skip to main content skip to main menu     Sharp exec confirms iPhone 8 will have curved OLED screen & all-glass design By Christian Zibreg, Oct 29, 2016 Tweet 55 Comments Sharp President Tai Jeng-wu—who is also a high-profile executive at Foxconn, Sharp’s parent company and Apple’s favorite contract manufacturer—said publicly that Apple’s next iPhone will use a curved screen based on organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology akin to that on Samsung’s Galaxy S7 smartphone, Nikkei reported Saturday. As you know, Apple currently uses OLED screens on the Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. All iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices to date have used traditional LCD screens. Here’s what Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater: The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels. We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity. Sharp is one of the several suppliers of LCDs for Apple products. At present, however, the Japanese company has very limited OLED production capabilities. According to Tai, Sharp could even build OLEDs in U.S. if Apple asked it to. “We are now building a new OLED facility in Japan. We can make OLED panels in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” Tai was appointed President and CEO of Sharp in August after Foxconn finalized its purchase of the century-old Japanese consumer electronics corporation. He is a close associate of Foxconn CEO Terry Gou. Nikkei said in August Apple would launch three iPhones in 2017—speculating that only a premium model would have an OLED screen and all-glass design. A recent Nikkei report clarified that all iPhone 8 models may use an all-glass chassis with a metal frame after all, but insisted there would be three new iPhones next year. “As part of Apple’s overhaul efforts, all three products will reportedly sport a glass cover and back joined together by a metal frame, a departure from the metal casing of previous versions of the device,” reads today’s Nikkei report. AppleInsider rebuffed Nikkei’s claim of a new five-inch iPhone model launching in 2017, saying there would be two flagship phones next year, one with a screen measuring 4.7 inches diagonally and the other with a 5.5-inch screen. Taiwanese media said Apple’s switch to OLED or AMOLED technology for the Tenth Anniversary iPhone may be short-lived because the company has been researching even more power efficient and brighter Micro-LED panels for iPhones. As we explained, Micro-LEDs could improve the iPhone’s battery power by a significant margin while helping boost screen resolution, improve color gamut and provide two to three times the brightness of OLED technology under the same power consumption. Apple in May 2014 acquired Micro-LED developer and semiconductor maker LuxVue Technology, adding its talent to its own hardware innovations team.

Jeffrey I think he’s joking Tommy Ask LG. They started it with the V10. siddique Touch bar will be for special function like short cuts and one handed use features ..mark my words YaBoyLilMayo Yall don’t know how to take a joke on this site….so take this L Sohail Wahab OLED screen sounds cool but losing that crazy gorgeous aluminum back would hurt like hell. Picapollo So true Leslie Bee Unless they replace it with a crazy gorgeous glass back. Tommy Use an aluminum back cover/case. You’re gonna use a case anyways so this time get an aluminum one. Rowan09 Well if according to reports OLED is temporary until Microleds are ready. :D Won’t he get into trouble for leaking that info? Storm Well, it sounds like he’s violated an NDA, so yes. Franklin Richards So much for Tim Cook doubling down on leaks. Apple’s secrets are pouring out like a broken tap. Prasoon Singh At least we know it will have an OLED display. That’s all I care about. 5723alex . Hope Apple won’t use the horrible OLED. Rowan09 Horrible OLED? 5723alex . Yes. Look at the washed, green turn to brown, over saturated… colors on a Samsung Galaxy. Mike Apparently you haven’t seen the Galaxy screens before. jOn Garrett lol, clearly he hasn’t. Storm Doesn’t the Sharp president only say that the next iPhone will use an OLED display? The quote attributed to him doesn’t mention a curved-glass or all-glass form factor, which makes the headline misleading. Jayy Bring on oled, but I’m not sure how I feel about a completely glass phone. My iPhone 4 was all glass. Mike M. Powell Already huh, did he also say we’re getting 512Gb storage and 8gb ram now to? .-. therealjjohnson So once my screen curves…then what? Tommy You can do cool stuff like on the S7 therealjjohnson What are those cool things? I don’t see a need for it beside it being different. Can you give me an example? rockdude094 I mainly use the edge to get to shortcuts and widgets. While the screen is off you can gesture on the edge to give you instant information like weather, notifications and news. if the phone is laid down on its face the edge turns into a massive notification light with a waves pattern with specific lighting tariq I use it for quick SMS or call. Also wallpapers with glowing edges look amazing on the curves Muhammad Faraz Khan Also one can shove it in their ass easily with a curved edge. 😉 jOn Garrett I use the edge for the night clock. My wife works nights and I have 2 kids so throughout the night I roll over to look at my phone. The edge plus lock screen notifications let’s me do everything without even touching the phone. These things plus the benefit of having it on a charging pad means I can pick up my phone and put it back down without fusing with a charging cable in the dark. hkgsulphate RIP Sharp Jeffrey Question. Can a Retina screen be OLED? Because I’m sure Apple called the Touch Bar in the new MacBooks ‘Retina’. george Yes Anonymous It look like the board is gonna fire that ceo. lol especially if they lose the apple contract because of it. Lol. What was he thinking! tariq Tim Cook is complete trash. Anonymous Lol that why he’s the ceo of the most profitable company in history and currently. tariq he is only ceo cuz Steve Jobs is gone. Tim cook is just money hungry… Tim is just a flaw in the system Anonymous Nhaw, steve is given all the credit, cook has created the far better company, steve just planeted the seed. tariq I agree to disagree Anonymous Okay, i wont push it anymore. Can i ask why you commented on my comment about tim cook being trash though? tariq i read the first sentence and thought u were saying “Ceo” as in “Tim Cook ” is gonna get fired. so i was just agreeing that he should get fired lol. turns out you werent talking about him so we ended at a disagreement. But youre the first person i know that supports Tim Cook (just fyi). Anonymous Oh i know alot of apple lovers love steve over tim. Lol i ger yelled at alot for that here at idb. Its not that i think steve was a bad ceo though. He was not, but i do think tim has done better. But yes your right i was talking about sharpes ceo. tariq I was looking at alternatives for Macs. Seems like everyone else is using type-c and ditching other ports. Maybe this is how things are going to look in 2017 Leslie Bee So we no longer get to hear Jony Ive say “aluminium” anymore?!! BTW, in the U.S. it’s spelled and pronounced “aluminum”. Prasoon Singh I’ve never truly experienced an OLED display before. The iPhone 8 will be my first device with it. jOn Garrett You won’t be disappointed. rockdude094 That would explain why the there is a little space left beside the control centre’s edges. Seems as if the whole os is prepping to integrate curved edges in the next generation iPhone tariq The back of the phone doesn’t matter. Everyone will have cases anyways. Especial apple users.. Ya be having otter boxes lol george So stupid.. another year of slippery phones. The King iPhone 8 or iPhone 7S? Or is the 7S going to be called the 8? I skipped both the 6S and 7 after I got my Edge. I miss iOS a lot, but since the 6, I haven’t seen much change and going back from an edge screen to a iPhone screen is so noticeable. Dao Sasone Lets see if Apple will implement vr with micro led. jOn Garrett All glass curved AMOLED display with wireless charging water and dust resistance.

AfterDawn > News > This is the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar This is the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Written by Matti Vähäkainu (Google+) @ 29 Oct 2016 14:00 User comments (8) Apple unveiled this week the next generation MacBook Pro. As you might imagine it is more smaller, thinner, lighter and more powerful than ever before. It also has one completely new feature, the Touch Bar. Apple celebrated the 25th anniversary of their first notebook by releasing a new MacBook. The new MacBook Pro comes in 13-inch and 15-inch variants with lots of customizability as expected. One thing that separates the cheapest 13-inch version from the other is that there is no Touch Bar in it. But what is Touch Bar? The Apple's new groundbreaking feature is a touch screen above the updated keyboard with new flatter butterfly mechanism keys. The Touch Bar replaces the old function keys – which are still available on the Touch Bar by pressing the function button – and shows different functionality depending on the application and even inside the applications. For example, in Safari the Touch Bar can show bookmarks, open tabs or quick links to most used features. In Mail app the Touch Bar shows for example CC suggestions or autocomplete depending what you are doing. The software developers can obviously use Touch Bar in their own way to make the application more intuitive. On the right edge of the Touch Bar there's a expandable quick links list to most used system settings, such as brightness and volume. You can customize what to show straight from the system settings from where you drop them to the Touch Bar. On the right side of the Touch Bar you can find Touch ID which makes it debut on MacBook as well allowing easier online payment and login. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is available starting at $1499 with old function buttons, and starting $1799 with TouchBar. The 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399 and features always the Touch Bar.

I have a macbook pro that i bought late 2015. Damn thing cost me 3k (with apple care). Needless to say, it will be quite some time before I consider buying a newer model. The new version isn't compelling enough for me to even be slightly interested. I would have a windows laptop but I needed to be able to run xcode for some app programming. Comparing models with similar specs between win/lin/mac devices, the prices were very close so it just made more sense to get the macbook pro and dual boot windows vs getting another device and go through the hassle of turning it into a hackintosh. 430.10.2016 21:54 xnonsuchx Send private message to this user Senior Member At least they still sell one of the older models with useful ports built-in! ;-) I wouldn't get the basic MacBook unless it at least had a USB-C port on each side. And like the iPhone 7 'normal' headphone adapter being included, for the price of the units, all the MacBooks should at least come with a few basic adapters (minimum, a USB-C to dual USB 3.0 one). I'll be happy with my mid-2014 13" MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display for quite some time. CPUs haven't been getting that much greater the past few years, so it's going to be sufficient for anything I need it for until it probably has some major malfunction. 51.11.2016 15:54 Bozobub Send private message to this user Senior Member Originally posted by Rezer: Macbook Pros are incredible devices, though. Any improvements on the specs make it a must have, touch bar or not. Um, whut..? At those specs, it should cost half as much or less. 61.11.2016 17:27 fb2075 Send private message to this user Newbie The only thing Apple is good for is the huge lack of viruses and spyware. And yes, we do have Macs because of that. However, we have never paid full price and have bought all of our computers used or refurbished. 73.11.2016 5:00 megadunderhead Send private message to this user Senior Member Actually did you guys hear about there bug.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma) Share Written by Mike Murphy October 29, 2016 This past week, Apple spent 82 minutes unveiling a new app, a computer screen made by another company, and three laptops with the same name. They weren’t exactly the major overhauls that many were hoping for, and the event comes not too long after the company released a new iPhone that looked much like the last two it put out, and its other notable innovations of late have been making its products in different sizes and unleashing a sea of dongles on the world. In an old interview that’s making the rounds online today, former CEO Steve Jobs explained, in his mind why companies like Xerox, a company that once had one of the most innovative research labs in the world, failed. He compared the product cycles and the corporate structures of strong, stable consumer brands, such as PepsiCo, which John Sculley, the CEO that once replaced him at Apple, previously ran. “If you were a product person, you couldn’t change the course of that company very much,” Jobs said. “So who influenced the success of PepsiCo? The sales and marketing people—they were the ones that got promoted, they were the ones that ran the company. ” Jobs then added: “It turns out the same thing can happen at technology companies that get monopolies. If you’re a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or a better computer, so what? When you have a monopoly market share, the company’s not any more successful.”   steve jobs talking about what happens when the marketing/sales people take over from a 'product' founder is… eerie pic.twitter.com/LQgpaZ6OyU — Owen ⚡️ (@ow) October 29, 2016 Apple doesn’t technically have a monopoly on smartphones or laptop computers or the other categories of products it produces. But its extremely high prices for things such as add-on iPhone and MacBook memory attest to the market power it has over consumers. And its notoriously rapturous marketing-speak about upgrades that merely bring its products up to par with competitors is wearing thin with its critics. Then there’s this Jobs critique of other tech companies that resonates with those critics today: “The product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rotted out,” Jobs said. “The companies forget what it means to make great products.” While Jobs was explaining why he thought old tech giants had fallen from grace, he probably wasn’t thinking about Apple at that time. It’s unclear when this video was shot, but given that there appears to be a NeXT logo behind him—the logo of the computer company he founded after getting ousted from Apple in 1985—it’s likely from before his return to Apple in 1996. It’s also unclear whether he was thinking about working on a device that could fit 1,000 songs in your pocket, an industry-defining smartphone, or any other device that has made Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world, and a company that has started to make a habit out of small iterations on past successes.

Apple just took the wraps off of its brand new 2016 MacBook Pro models, and the new Touch Bar feature is just as cool as we hoped it would be. A long OLED touchscreen replaces the top row of function keys on the new MacBook Pro’s keyboard and it dynamically changes based on your needs in the current app. So in Messages it might show Quick Type word predictions or emoji, and in Photoshop it might show image cropping tools. Of course, there is one big downside to Apple’s new MacBook Pro models: they’re expensive. But guess what — despite the fact that Apple just announced them and they’re not even shipping yet, Amazon has already discounted Apple’s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and you can order them right now. Amazon’s pricing is already well below Apple’s full retail prices, less than one day after the new MacBook Pro models were announced. Thanks to the current sale, users can get the entry-level MacBook Pro 2016 model, which does not include the new Touch Bar or Touch ID, for $1,299 in silver or for just $1,139.92 in space gray. This model starts at $1,499 on Apple’s website, so that’s a savings of as much as $360. Moving up to the high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar model, which obviously includes the Touch Bar and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner, Amazon is offering the shiny new laptop for $1,799, which is $200 off Apple’s $1,999 retail price. You’ll find specs for both models below, and orders are expected to begin shipping in the coming weeks.

How much will she use it? [video] Friday Oct 28, 2016 at 2:31 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post Two seconds into using Apple's Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro, and I'm in love. The new touch-sensitive control bar, a second display that will display different controls based on the program you're using, is silky smooth, beautiful to behold and incredibly easy to use. What I'm not at all sure about, however, is how much I'll love the control bar once it's no longer in front of me. There are two models with the Touch Bar, a 13-inch and a 15-inch one, which cost at least $300 more than the model without it. (The Touch Bar itself isn't the only difference; the more expensive models also have better processors, more ports and other upgrades.) When you're in front of these machines, it's hard not to be wowed. Both are impressive to look at, with their huge trackpads and bright screens. Both have Touch ID's fingerprint sensor built into the power button, which works as snappily as on the iPhone. Apple also provided me with a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar to review, and I found the keyboard very pleasant to type on. I use a 12-inch MacBook myself as my usual laptop, and found that I liked the keyboard on the new MacBook Pro much better than on my own machine. Both use the same, slimmer "butterfly" technology that Apple introduced with the MacBook in 2015, which cuts down on bulk but can also feel too shallow to some users. Apple improved the design on the MacBook Pro by making the keys feel like they're traveling a little more deeply into the keyboard. Even in the short time I've had the computer, it feels more powerful and impressive than its predecessors. If you're upgrading from an older MacBook Pro, this will feel like an upgrade: the screen is brighter, the performance is noticeably better and the computers themselves are lighter. Not bad, as a total package. But the focus of this new line really is the Touch Bar. It changes depending on what program you're using. For example, if you're using Safari, the bar may feature your favorite sites. I have nothing bad to say about it - apart from the fact that it may require some creative ergonomics to use comfortably. The display on the Touch Bar is impressive, particularly when showing off color much more vibrantly than you'd expect from that tiny strip. Apple's made it easy and intuitive to customize. I'm a person who likes physical, clicky buttons, but even I have to admit that the added functionality of the adaptable software controls on the Touch Bar is intriguing. Not all of the Touch Bar controls are necessarily time-savers. For example, some observers of Thursday's event remarked that the Touch Bar adds steps in Photoshop. But some of the controls do save you having to go through annoying drop-down menus, instead putting them at your fingertips. Being able to customize the Touch Bar is a huge perk for often-used functions. For example, if you have an abnormal devotion to flagging messages, or if you're an "Archive" person instead of a "Trash" person in Mail (or vice-versa) you can add those quick shortcuts right to your keyboard through the Touch Bar. In other programs, it gives you finer, more visceral control - you can slide through a spectrum to get just the right shade in Photos, or hit just the right decibel level in iTunes without making your finger do a jackhammer impression on your volume keys. And, in any case, the Touch Bar controls are about intuition - not necessarily about saving time for power users who've memorized all of the keyboard shortcuts, but for making various features more available to the average user. With zero training, I knew exactly how to use the Touch Bar. That's not nothing. So, in a vacuum, these are really exciting and excellent computers. In the real world, they are still excellent - but there are other things to consider. Price is a big one. The MacBook Pro line has always been Apple's premium line, and that's never been more apparent. The new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar is $1,500. If you want the Touch Bar, you have to pay at least $1800. If you wanted, you could spend about $4800 on a fully tricked-out 15-inch MacBook Pro with all the bells, whistles and software that Apple offers. That's not insignificant. There's also the fact that Apple is really pushing its users into new technology - which means we're going to have a transition period here. While the MacBook Pro fixes one of users' greatest laments about the MacBook - the MacBook has a single USB-C port; the new MacBook Pros have four - people will still need to use adapters for most of their accessories. Which, quite frankly, can be annoying. I personally have forgotten adapters on business trips before, making my job unnecessarily harder. (In my case, I need an adapter for my digital voice recorder. Your mileage may vary.) That problem won't last forever; USB-C is likely to become the new standard. But that isn't the case now, and prospective buyers should know they're going to have to wait for an adapter-free existence. Transition periods can be annoying like that. Even the Touch Bar itself, while an intriguing addition that gives an honestly wonderful experience, will take some time to get used to. And if developers other than Apple don't embrace the technology and add some tricks of their own, a worst-case scenario could see the Touch Bar going down in history as a great missed opportunity: a piece of tech that was interesting, but never lived up to its full potential. That grim picture of the Touch Bar's future is not a prediction, by any means. It could easily become second nature to swipe, tap and slide at the top of my keyboard. I sort of hope it does, because it's a lot of fun in the demos. But it will take me - and, likely, most other Mac users - some time to figure out just how to make the Touch Bar personally useful to justify the MacBook Pro's price tag for all but the most faithful Mac users. That hurdle may prove a hard one for Apple to overcome, and it will have to make a strong case to users and developers to get all of us to jump it. --- < Author Information:   Hayley Tsukayama covers consumer technology for The Washington Post. @htsuka Washington Post Bio Download Mugshot More stories by Hayley Tsukayama About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Reader Services Subscriptions Subscriber Controls Contact Us Submissions Photos Events Letter to the Editor Corrections Announcements Obits Story Ideas Alerts Email Alerts RSS Feeds Text Alerts Advertise Media Kit Products & Services Ad Rates Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

"The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels," Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. "We don't know whether Apple's OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn't walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity," Tai said. Sharp current has limited OLED production capabilities but is looking to expand and likely capture orders for future iPhones. "We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too," he said. "If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?" Nikkei previously reported that Apple was preparing three new iPhone models for next year with only the premium 5.5-inch handset getting a curved OLED display. The three models are all expected to feature glass backs. Click here for more details. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

With the goal of building or designing its own Apple-branded autonomous vehicle all but buried, the Industry Focus guys discuss what it might do on the automotive front instead. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Oct 29, 2016 at 12:01PM Interest in the elusive Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) car finally seems to be grinding to a halt. In the wake of the never-to-be project, Motley Fool analyst Sean O'Reilly and senior auto specialist John Rosevear talk about how Apple might be looking to get into autonomous driving technology instead, a few problems they might run into if they do, and whether or not shelving the car project was the right thing to do. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Oct. 20, 2016. Sean O'Reilly: Mr. Rosevear, what is Apple going to do if they're not going to throw $200 billion at building a car? John Rosevear: Well, it would probably only take about $15 billion. O'Reilly: Oh, well, sorry. (laughs) Rosevear: Bloomberg reported that Apple has refocused Project Titan on the idea of developing an autonomous driving system, an Apple-branded autonomous driving system. This would allow Apple to either partner with an existing automaker, or at some point in the future, if it looks good, to go back to building their own car. So here's a problem with that. Everybody else is already attacking that problem, and they're already well along. We've talked about this on past podcasts. Ford (NYSE:F) says it will be mass-producing fully Level 5 self-driving cars, no steering wheel, for ride-hailing services by 2021. That's a little over four years out. Delphi (NYSE:DLPH) and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) -- we talked about this, too -- they will have a full self-driving system that will be available to any automaker in 2019 ... O'Reilly: I'm going to build my own in my garage. Just kidding. Rosevear: Yeah, good luck getting the Feds to approve it. (laughs) There is that guy, I don't recall his name, who has built one in his garage, who says, "Mobileye blah blah blah." But, it's one thing to build something in your garage that mostly sort of works. It's another thing ... O'Reilly: To mass-produce something that works. Rosevear: Right, that passes an automaker's tests for "this will be perfect for 200,000 miles." And it's not just the traditional automakers. NVIDIA in this, Baidu's in this, Uber is throwing a lot of money in, they want their own system, self-driving vehicles are a key to their business model in the future -- O'Reilly: We have the Volvos in Pittsburgh. Rosevear: Yeah, the Volvos and the Fords. They're all making huge investments. Just last night, Tesla came out and said, "We're going to start shipping our cars with available hardware that will enable fully self-driving software when we have it done," which is sometime, they hope, in the next year and a half or so, if they can get it past the regulators. Why would any of them need Apple? You might see a little company -- we've talked about this before, too -- the companies that might be natural customers for the Delphi-Mobileye effort, the smaller companies that maybe don't have the $1 [billion] to $2 billion to blast into this, companies like Subaru or Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU), some of the Chinese automakers. O'Reilly: Let me ask you -- correct me if I'm wrong: It almost seems like if Apple wanted to do this, they should have done it five years ago. Rosevear: Yeah. There's another problem in this whole thing, too, and that's the problem that [Alphabet's] Google has bumped up against -- the automakers may not want Apple. I've talked to senior executives at some of the other companies. They know what happened in the phone business. They don't want to be making "dumb cars," like dumb phones, the self-driving equivalent of Android. They don't want to be HTC or whatever. They don't want that situation. They're mindful of that. O'Reilly: You mean they don't want to break even at best? John?! Rosevear: It's hard enough to make money in the car business, give me a break! (laughs) And, they don't want to give up control of the data, too. They know: You partner with Google, Google wants the data. Google will monetize the data. You're just a box the data is being collected from. They aren't going there. There have been hints. About a year ago, Google and Ford were reported to be in close conversations. Those talks reportedly broke down. Nobody officially ever said anything. There have been some hints that Ford said, "We're not giving you the data," and Google said, "Then we can't do business." It was all very mindful of the phone example. Like I said, there might be an opportunity with some company. [Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] is the one we always point to because they have a ton of debt and they're scrambling to keep the basics going. They might be willing to compromise to come in here. But then, Apple is in a position where, what is it offering that is special? Because, they're going to be competing with the Delphi-Mobileye effort, probably others, maybe Google even trying to get in here to offer the prefab solution to some automakers. What are they going to do that's special? This is the interesting question. O'Reilly: It sounds like they're making the right decision here, unfortunately. Rosevear: Yeah. Again, it comes down to the question. There are things Apple does really better than anyone else. When it crafts a special, gotta-have project with that Apple magic, it's a lot about user interface, it's a lot about how it works seamlessly with other devices, it's a lot about how it anticipates the user's needs. How to translate that to an automobile, I think, it's a question that they may be haven't answered yet. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

For one man in the Ukraine, the prospect of getting his hands on this year's latest offering from Apple was enticing enough that he actually changed his name. iPhone 7, or as he was once known Olexander Turin, took up a local store on their promotion to hand out the latest Apple device to anyone willing to give up their birth name.

Why not to do that in this way?"

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan) NEW YORK—Apple isn’t the first to add GPS functionality to a smartwatch, but it’s the first to make something that feels like a running watch. And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch.

I’ve logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. The Importance of GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. Improvements for All Series 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: — Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn’t use to, even with access to the phone’s GPS. — You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn’t help when you were running laps or loops that weren’t precisely that length. Nike Extras Nike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it’s time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. Beyond Running Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. What’s Still Missing Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that’s Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all. For these reasons, I’m sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it’s a minor annoyance, both Apple’s and Nike’s app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit “start.” (At least with Nike’s, you can disable the countdown deep in the phone settings.) Do You Need Apple Watch? Because this review is focused on runners’ needs, I haven’t gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don’t offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don’t need the “smarts,” a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper.

Apple, Microsoft, and the Coolest Kid in Tech GO The new Microsoft is the old Apple and the new Apple is the old Microsoft; Redmond's stealing Cupertino's cool factor Oct 29, 2016 15:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is no longer cool. I know, this is certainly one very risky way of starting an editorial and there are many Apple fanboys out there who’d want to discuss the matter in private with my relatives, but this is exactly why I and so many other tech watchers out there seem to believe after this super-busy week. Let’s rewind a bit first. On October 26, Microsoft held its Windows 10 event where it discussed things like the future of its operating system and introduced new hardware, such as the Surface Book Performance Base and the all-new Surface Studio PC. Redmond’s press conference was full of announcements, although some of them were of less interest for consumers (but this the direction where the company is heading) and several high-profile executives took the stage to discuss and detail what’s to come for Microsoft products (by the way, has anyone noticed that there were more female executives on stage than male? Quite a neat way to tackle gender discrimination accusations after all the scandals). Without a doubt, the star of the show was the Surface Studio, which was introduced by none other than Panos Panay, a man who loves Surface so much that it’s fascinating to listen to him describing new models (which he always refers to as “the product”). Panos admitted that the Surface Studio might look familiar (hint at the resemblance with the Apple iMac), but promised that it’d feel entirely different. And by the looks of things, this is exactly what is happening. The Surface Studio is an All-in-One PC that comes with a built-in Zero Gravity hinge that makes it just perfect for drawing and writing and boasts features such as i7 processors, 32 GB RAM, 2TB storage, and a 28-inch Perspective Pixel screen with touch support. Microsoft’s event was a celebration of new hardware and software, and although there were some boring moments here and there, it was definitely worth watching. Moving over to Apple, Cupertino had its own event planned for October 27. I’m not sure that Apple wanted its press conference to be exactly one day after Microsoft’s, but if it did, whoever made the decision probably regrets it. Apple’s event was all about the new MacBooks, as Cupertino refreshed its laptop lineup with hardware upgrades and new features such as the Touch Bar, more powerful speakers, and little things that few people care about actually. The conference unfolded like pretty much any recent Apple unveiling and it was fairly boring most of the time, with the introduction of the new MacBook generating less enthusiasm in the tech world, pretty much because we already knew most about it thanks to leaks that surfaced recently. Furthermore, the hardware upgrades that Apple introduced on the upgraded MacBook series are nothing to be excited about, as they only bring the devices in line with today’s laptops. The Touch Bar is indeed a neat addition, but this simply can’t be reason enough to pay more than $4,000 for a new laptop. Because yes, that’s how much you have to pay for the top-of-the-range MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen, as the best the company has to offer right now reaches $4,299 - compare this to the Surface Studio PC, which comes with a bigger screen, touch screens, Pen support and so many others and is available for $4,199 and you get the point. Apple products remain extremely expensive even if they don't bring much over the competition. In essence, the MacBook press event was very similar to the iPhone 7 unveiling in September. Apple introduced upgraded models in both cases, but only with features that somehow make sense. In the case of the iPhone 7, the new CPU and RAM upgrade on the Plus, as well as the new storage options, were absolutely mandatory to stay close to competition. And in the case of the MacBooks, new processors, bigger batteries, and improved displays are things that every manufacturer offers on new products. The point here is that Apple is no longer surprising, pretty much because it lost its power of innovation. Apple no longer takes you by surprise with features that you never imagined, but only with dull upgrades that just make sense and nothing more. Apple is no longer cool. I know, I’m playing with fire here, but I’ll say it again. Apple is no longer cool. If we look at the bigger picture, Apple has become the old Microsoft. And the new Microsoft has become the old Apple. Microsoft is right now exactly what Apple represented a few years ago when it brought new technologies to the market. This is what made it so “cool” and helped it become the most innovative company in the world. But it now lost its cool factor and the declining sales are just living proof. In the case of Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella seems to be the right man at the right time. Under his guidance, Microsoft is truly inventing new categories, a thing that the company has bragged about so many times. But it’s true, so why not saying it on every occasion? Just look at the Surface. There was a time when no one believed in it and Apple’s CEO Tim Cook himself made fun of it, claiming that putting a keyboard on a tablet is like mixing a toaster and a refrigerator. Fast forward a few years later and here’s Apple launching the iPad Pro, its own tablet with a detachable keyboard that’s essentially its version of the Microsoft Surface. Apple has never been interested in a stylus, and Steve Jobs himself wasn’t a big fan of this little accessory. Microsoft, on the other hand, invested billions of dollars into releasing the Surface Pen and improving it with every generation and now it has become an essential tool on 2-in-1 devices. Apple launched its own Pencil last year, once again a few years after Microsoft. In the end, it’s pretty obvious that Apple is no longer the innovator, but the follower. And the dropping iPhone sales are just the living proof. In the meantime, Microsoft is improving in a way that nobody ever imagined, and it’s all just because they are listening to customers. Yep, that’s true, the new Microsoft is really listening to customers, even though there are departments where they still need to do better, as is the case of mobile. But they’re on the right path here, there’s no doubt about it. The worst thing for Cupertino, however, is that without innovations, there’ll be a time when its products will no longer sell just because they bear the Apple logo. The Apple brand appeal is dropping, and it’s all because of a single reason. And I’ll say it again for the last time. Apple is no longer cool.

But Apple also gave plenty of stage time to the Apple TV’s new TV app. (And, no, we’re not overly keen on these brutally generic app names either.) Having boldly claimed last year that the future of television was here and that said future was apps (with existing app-centric telly device makers presumably receiving said news in bemused fashion), Apple’s seemingly banking on a single app to be the hub of your viewing habits. The snag: it’ll be US-only upon launch in December. And the thing is, I don’t care. Convenience factor It’s not that it's not a good premise. We’re all sick of bouncing between several telly apps, regardless of the device we’re using. Digital was supposed to make things simpler. Instead, our favourite shows remain chained to individual apps. Want to watch the latest Mr Robot, Walking Dead, Stranger Things, or some other fantastic telly? Best remember where to find it, then. It’s like the commercial world hasn’t moved on from traditional TV channels, despite people of a more nefarious bent merrily torrenting everything and selecting whatever they want to watch next from a big list of files. In other words, those that pay get a worse user experience yet again. Hence: TV. Apple iPhone everything together inside one app, marrying discovery of new content and a watch list. Finish an episode of something and the next tempts you to continue. Live news and sporting events can be accessed, too, using Siri, which is smart enough to provide links to related stories and scores. And cable TV customers can use single sign-on for all related pay-TV subscription apps. This all works across iOS devices as well, resulting in a truly unified experience. Missing pieces Only it’s not that simple. Even in the US, there are restrictions. Amazon’s ongoing cold war with Apple means there’s no Amazon Prime Apple TV app. And although a Netflix app exists, the streaming giant’s approach to Apple’s TV is ‘wait and see’. In the UK, things are far worse. When we reviewed the Apple TV, we noted “Apple’s partnerships appear to be very US-focused”. A year later, we now at least have Sky’s NOW TV and BBC iPlayer, but the majority of networks remain conspicuous by their absence. If you want to watch Channel 4 shows (beyond news), ITV, Channel 5 or UKTV, you’ll need to AirPlay it from an iOS app – assuming AirPlay isn’t blocked by it. Most of these networks offer stony silence or noncommittal noises when it comes to Apple TV – baffling given Stuff having heard from developers about how simple it is to get an app up and running – especially if you already have something working on iOS. It seems perverse than 4oD exists on Samsung tellies, but not on Apple TV. It’s absurd ITV’s on Amazon’s Fire TV Stick but not Apple TV. And what the hold-up is – money; control; licensing; the heads of all these networks having been driven to despair by using iTunes – we’ve no idea. But until the UK’s selection of TV apps expands, Apple’s TV app not coming to these shores is no great loss. Liked that? Read this...

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Polar M600 review: For Android users who want to be more connected during workouts Is a true Android Wear sports watch worth $330? by Valentina Palladino - Oct 29, 2016 2:52 pm UTC Login to bookmark 41 Video shot/edited by Jennifer Hahn. There's no shortage of Android Wear watches to choose from. Companies including Huawei, LG, Casio, and Fossil all have smartwatches that run on Google's wearable operating system, and all of them can use Google Fit's activity tracking. Now, the fitness company Polar is getting into the mix with the M600 Android Wear-based fitness watch, which is the first device that integrates Polar's existing exercise software with Android Wear. The M600 wants to appeal to a specific kind of user: one who is into fitness and wants a heart rate monitor and onboard GPS in their tracker, but who also cares about getting wrist notifications and using wearable apps. But at $329, Polar's device is right up there with the Apple Watch in price, and that might be too steep for some consumers, considering the experience it offers is much different. Design: Too bulky for its own good Like most hardcore fitness watches, the M600 is chunky. And since it is running Android Wear, that design almost works against it. The watch module, which can be removed to fit into different bands, is rectangular and holds the square 1.3-inch, 260 PPI touchscreen and two physical buttons: one on the left side of the device that opens the Android Wear app menu and one underneath the display that opens the Polar Flow app. The display is bold and bright, and while it can fall victim to glare in direct sunlight, it's easy to read most of the time and easy to navigate. Inside the M600 is an optical heart rate monitor and a GPS chip. That makes the device fairly thick at .5 inches, and while it's not particularly heavy, it looks monstrous on my small wrist. The band is made of a durable silicone which is much thicker than the regular silicone used in others like the Apple Watch's sport bands. It does have a double-prong watch-like closure, though, making it easy to tighten just enough so that the heart rate monitor can do its job, but also not cut off circulation. The M600's design is perfectly fine for working out, which is no surprise since it's basically just a wider, bigger vision of the $199 Polar A360. It's comfortable and also has an IPX8 waterproof rating, so you can swim in water up to 10 meters deep with it as well. But as a device you may want to wear all day long to take advantage of Android Wear and all its features, the M600 is simply way too big. Only if you don't mind bulky wristbands will you be able to wear the M600 without it feeling ostentatious. The M600 comes with a proprietary charging port that sticks magnetically to nodes on the back of the band. Connecting can be hard if you don't position the charger correctly and allow the nodes to attach in every location. Since this is an Android Wear-based device, I used our battery test to see how long it would last. On average, the M600's 500mAh battery lasted 784 minutes (roughly 13 hours) on a single charge. Our battery test continuously sends messages to the watch to ensure its display never fully turns off, so that estimate is based on never-ending activity. Polar estimates the M600 can get up to two days during normal activity (when connected to an Android phone and regularly receiving notifications) and 8 hours while training. So our test results fall in line with this. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Polar's $330 M600. Valentina Palladino Removable silicone band.

Valentina Palladino Inside is a GPS, optical heart rate monitor, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, and mic. Valentina Palladino Android Wear apps on the M600. Valentina Palladino Polar Flow looks much like how it does on Polar's other devices. Valentina Palladino Sport profiles always track heart rate, and some that are outdoor activities automatically the turn GPS on. Valentina Palladino "My Day" shows you how much you've moved during the day so far. Features: Fitness made more practical with Android Wear At first, you may not even realize the M600 runs Android Wear. The default watch face shows the time and date in large blue and white text, and it looks like Polar's other devices. As you move throughout the day, a bar slides up the display to show you how far you've gone to reach your activity goal. Of course, thanks to Android Wear, you can change the watch face to whatever you'd like. But since this is a Polar device first-and-foremost, the default display works with the embedded Polar Flow app to make sure you don't forget who made it. On any other Polar device, the button directly below the display would open Polar Flow. But on the M600, it just feels like the default workout program (and it is). There, you can start a new workout session or tap "My Day" to get an overview of your activity progress thus far. You can program up to 20 sport profiles to appear on the watch under Training, so choosing the one you want to start is easy, and the watch will track you. As soon as you tap on Training, the watch starts to glean your heart rate and kick the GPS into gear. Depending on the activity, GPS may not always be activated (it's turned off automatically for indoor workouts) which is convenient since I don't want to have to remember to turn on or off the GPS myself. The sheer number of sport profiles that Polar can track will intrigue well-rounded athletes. But those sport profiles are available on most other Polar devices, so the M600 is just working with the software that wearables like the A360 already have. What makes the M600 so expensive (even for Polar) is not just that it runs Android Wear, but it also has the embedded heart rate monitor, GPS, and GLONASS technology. When compared to the $370 Apple Watch Series 2 during a treadmill running session, the M600's heart rate monitor was a little slow to catch up to the Apple Watch's reading. At its worst, the M600 was nearly 20 bpm lower than the Apple Watch. However, as my heart rate plateaued and started to remain steady at about 168 bpm, both watches remained within 5 bpm of each other. The M600 is also compatible via Bluetooth with Polar's H7 heart rate chest strap. So if you have an H7 already or prefer the precision of a chest strap, you have that option. The one thing you can't do with Polar's interface is take a manual heart rate reading. The monitor isn't on 24/7 and there's no option to read your pulse when you're not working out. You can get around this by going into Google Fit and using that app's heart rate detection screen. However, I prefer the interface on Samsung's $180 Gear Fit 2 that lets you take a manual reading and tag it with descriptors like "resting," "after workout," and "happy." The M600's GPS is automatically on for all non-indoor workouts, and it doesn't take long for it to grab your location. You can start an exercise session before the GPS kicks in fully as well, so there's no waiting involved. Every session recorded with GPS will have a Google Map included in Polar Flow underneath that session's stat breakdown. The GPS is quick, easy, and accurate, which are the most important traits for wearable GPS chips to have. Unlike Samsung's Gear Fit 2, Polar hasn't said it will allow you to view mapped routes on the watch itself. So you'll have to stick with Polar Flow on your smartphone to see all of your maps. Long-pressing the side button or swiping left on the display are your entryways to Android Wear. Both will bring up the app drawer where you can access a bunch of Google apps and any third-party apps you've downloaded. Other Polar devices like the A360 can receive smartphone notifications, so what you really get with Android Wear on the M600 is Google's own spin on those notifications, as well as access to full apps. Notifications are certainly richer on Android Wear compared to the native alerts on Polar's other devices. You can scroll to see full messages and reply from the watch as well. You can't do that on the A360. Even if you aren't excited by the third-party apps for Android Wear, at least you have the option to use them. I mostly stuck with Google's native apps like Maps, which let me view a map of my location and find destination spots from my wrist. This experience could get even better when Android Wear 2.0 is released and you can download apps directly to your wearable without needing a companion smartphone app. But that update won't be available until next year, and when the M600 will get it is uncertain. Google Now-powered voice control is another feature you can use on the M600 but not on any pure Polar device. I used this a lot at home when I didn't want to unlock my smartphone, and it translates my voice to text more accurately than not. You also don't need to go into the Google app on the M600 to start Google Now either: simply saying "Ok Google" with the watch on your wrist will make Google listen, as on any Android Wear device. The M600 can save music locally to its 4GB of internal storage, too. You can download tracks from Google Play Music or other sources and save them to the watch, pair some wireless earbuds to it, and go for a run without your phone. I had a pair of Jabra wireless buds on me for part of the time I spent with the M600, and the watch immediately sensed when the earbuds were within pairing range and asked to sync with them. These music features, combined with the onboard GPS, will be a huge convenience for outdoor runners and cyclists.

Ogg October 29, 2016 9:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Investors have had to interpret a lot of data in this aging bull market and ahead of the election. Despite the recent volatility, the one undeniable trend is that investors have been willing to buy stocks into every market sell-off. That won’t be the case forever, but that has been true for five years or so. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week. The goal is to find new investing ideas and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and some of these end up covering the top stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Investors need to consider many sorts of issues when it comes to buying a stock. How much risk is there? How much potential upside is there? Is the stock viewed as cheap, or does it have a premium because of its position today? Does it pay a dividend and/or does it buy back stock? How is its balance sheet and how solid are the business prospects? The ending on October 28 was the week that the earnings floodgates flew wide open. High valuations in general and the notion that the bull market is seven and a half years old just are not stopping investors from having an appetite. 24/7 Wall St. tracked three unusual research patterns emerging out of the 30 Dow stocks in the week ending October 28. The Big Apple Isn’t Just New York City Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a very unusual earnings report. Earnings and guidance were all in all pretty good, but CEO Tim Cook seemed uncertain how to capitalize on Samsung’s smartphone woes. Despite these issues, Apple’s consensus analyst price target has now climbed back above $130. Right before Apple’s earnings report, its consensus price target was $128.81, and was $126.73 just 30 days ago and $124.11 some 60 days ago. Within two days of earnings, 24/7 Wall St. tracked 13 key analyst changes. These were from the likes of Stifel, Credit Suisse, Mizuho, Merrill Lynch, S&P, Barclays and many more key firms. Apple shares were trading at $113.69 upon Friday’s closing bell, down from $118.25 earlier in the week before earnings. Apple has a 52-week range of $89.47 to $123.82. Conglomerate City General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) has seen a moderate downward trend on its consensus analyst price targets going into and after its third quarter earnings failed to impress. But with shares still trading under $30, it was interesting to see that Merrill Lynch not only reiterated its Buy rating but maintained its $37 price objective. That is a full $5 higher than what is now the consensus target, and the report even noted how GE’s third quarter was underwhelming and that the $2.00 earnings per share target would require more cost cuts and more cash deployment to hit. Still, the firm noted: We expect GE to stand out as one of the better growth stories in our large-cap space at the end of 3Q earnings season. GE did not back away from the $2 EPS by 2018, but highlighted that more cost-cuts and buyback are required to get to the goal. It is important to know that this is a tie for GE’s highest analyst target price. GE closed at $29.22 on Friday, and that was after a 2% gain on hopes of a Baker-Hughes partnership for its oil and gas services. GE’s consensus analyst target is $32.00 (versus $33.71 just 90 days ago), and its 52-week range is $27.10 to $33.00. Big Pharma This past week, Argus reiterated Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) at Buy, but what stood out was that the drug giant’s price target was raised to $80 from $65. That was up over 30% from the $60.87 prior close, plus there is the 3% dividend yield. Argus sees earnings growth driven by strong sales of oncology drug Keytruda, Zepatier for hepatitis C,and Gardasil for HPV. The Argus report said: Merck shares trade at 15 times our 2017 earnings per share estimate, above the average multiple of 13.9 for our coverage universe of pharmaceutical stocks. While Merck carries a premium valuation, we believe the company has a strong pipeline of new drugs that could contribute meaningfully to revenue over the next five years… We believe that Merck has a strong product pipeline and that Keytruda has substantial opportunities as a treatment for solid tumors, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. Recently approved and forthcoming indications for Keytruda, along with growth from Zepatier and Gardasil, should contribute significantly to future sales growth. Investors might want to notice that the consensus price target was $68.32 on Friday, and that consensus target is up over 10% in the past 90 days. Also note that Merck’s absolute highest price target is now up at $82.00, and it has a 3% yield. Merck shares closed down 4% at $58.84 on Friday, in a 52-week range of $47.97 to $64.86.

And the company is doubling down on that with a Nike edition out Friday, while Nike is bringing features from its phone app directly to all models of Apple Watch. I’ve found devices without GPS typically awful at measuring how fast and how far I’m running. And those with GPS typically do little more than measure how fast and how far I’m running. The basics are great for casual runners, but anyone who becomes a serious runner needs much more. I’ve logged more than 400 miles over the past six weeks with the GPS edition of Apple Watch, known as Series 2. I’ve also run 34 miles with the Nike Plus version over the past few days; it’s essentially a Series 2 watch with a custom wristband and watch face. With both, Apple addressed many of the shortcomings in the original watch, GPS being just one of them. I’m not ready to ditch my Garmin running watch yet, but the Apple Watch comes close to meeting all my needs. ——— THE IMPORTANCE OF GPS The original watch does a fine job of latching onto your phone’s GPS if you’re running with the phone, but with built-in GPS, you can leave the phone behind. Accuracy is on par with other good GPS watches, which is to say, measurements are sometimes off, especially when tall buildings block GPS signals. The watch automatically calibrates to my running style, so it’s better than non-GPS devices even when there’s no GPS. Though GPS drains the battery more quickly, the watch still had about an hour of non-GPS use left after a marathon run of about four hours, 40 minutes. For normal use, Apple says you should get up to 90 minutes a day of GPS workouts; I’ve often gone longer without the watch dying before bedtime. It helps that I’ve disabled the heart-rate sensor during workouts. While Series 2 is meant for stand-alone running, many people carry phones anyway. With it, I get slightly better accuracy and battery life. ——— IMPROVEMENTS FOR ALL Series 2 watches start at $369, though it’s $30 more for a larger screen — the optimal size for larger wrists. Non-GPS models, now called Series 1, are $100 less. All models get software updates that address two gripes with the original: — Apple’s Workout app now records your route, something other GPS fitness devices and apps have long done. The Apple app didn’t use to, even with access to the phone’s GPS. — You can double tap the screen to record splits, or manual snapshots of how long it takes to run a stretch. Before, that was limited to mile or kilometer intervals, which didn’t help when you were running laps or loops that weren’t precisely that length. ——— NIKE EXTRAS Nike’s app offers a lot to like, including big yellow numerals for easy reading during runs and voice updates every mile and halfway toward your goal. Nike keeps things simple for beginners by displaying just distance and time; turn on advanced mode for current pace and heart rate. My gripes: no manual splits, and average pace appears only when pausing or through the voice updates. Nike excels in trying to motivate you even when you’re not running. It will keep asking “Are we running today?” by reminding you the weather is nice or that a friend (with a watch or just the phone app) is just ahead of you for the month’s total. A scheduling feature shows you weather forecasts in half-hour increments. After making a selection, you get a notification when it’s time to run. Though the app is available for all models, the Nike watch also has a colorful wristband sporting holes to help sweat dry. It offers custom watch faces with one-touch access to the app, plus a reminder of your next scheduled run. Most people will be fine with just the free app, but running enthusiasts can get the Nike version for the same price. ——— BEYOND RUNNING Cyclists get similar speed and distance information, though the watch doesn’t measure how fast you’re pedaling, something hard-core cyclists might want. You can swim with Series 2, even with chlorinated or salt water, something most water-resistant gadgets don’t allow. The watch measures distance indoors by counting laps, though you need a pool large enough for at least five strokes per lap. ——— WHAT’S STILL MISSING Recording splits during runs is great, but I also want to know my average pace and time since the last split, rather than the beginning of the run. I find it useful when I want to go faster in the middle of a run before a gentle cooldown. And while Apple Watch syncs workout data with the phone’s Activity app, many long-time runners already have their favorite online repository, whether that’s Nike, Strava or Garmin. The ability to move data around is limited. While Nike offers an Apple Watch app, it’ll take time for others to catch up. Strava’s still requires running with a phone, while Garmin doesn’t have one at all. For these reasons, I’m sticking with my Garmin Forerunner 220. And while it’s a minor annoyance, both Apple’s and Nike’s app do a three-second countdown before workouts. I just want to run when I hit “start.” ——— DO YOU NEED APPLE WATCH? Because this review is focused on runners’ needs, I haven’t gotten into all the other features, such as maps, weather and shopping. Running watches and general-purpose fitness trackers such as Fitbit don’t offer as much. The ability to reply to messages by voice came in handy when coordinating with friends waiting at the finish line, for instance. But if you don’t need the “smarts,” a decent GPS fitness device is more than $100 cheaper. ——— The story has been corrected to show that Nike challenge is based on month’s total, and not by week.     Tags: watch, running, apple, series, while, phone, Other stories from today: Apple double downs on running with Nike-edition smartwatch Stocks wilt after FBI inquiry into new Clinton emails Chevron tops Street 3Q forecasts     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   What do you think of Donald Trump's election as president of the United States?

By Matt Thomas October 29, 2016 15:00 BST A new MacBook Pro is priced at up to 20% higher than before at the tail end of 2016.REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach Under the guise of releasing a new high-spec range of laptops, Apple has raised prices across its entire computing range. The updated MacBook Pros are more expensive than the machines they are replacing, but computers that have had no change to their specifications at all have also had their prices increased. The price increase has been introduced to offset the new low exchange rate between the US dollar and pound sterling, with no increases being applied to the computers in America. Apple raised the price of its Mac computers by about 20% on Thursday, adding £100 to the 13-inch MacBook Air, its cheapest laptop, to £949. In the US, before VAT, the price is still $999. The iMac 4K and 5K are now £300 more expensive in Britain. The 12in MacBook, currently Apple's smallest computer, starts at £1,249 – although the very same model sold for £1,049 24 hours earlier. And the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros with Retina displays – the older model of MacBook Pro – are still on sale, starting at £1,249 and £1,899 respectively. On Thursday, those computers cost £999 and £1,599. Similar price increases hit the company's desktop computers. The Mac mini, still the lowest priced computer that Apple makes, has gone from £399 to £479. The cheapest iMac is now £1,049 up from £899, while the Mac Pro has seen its base price increase by £500, from £2,499 to £2,99 In a statement, Apple told The Guardian: "Apple suggests product prices internationally on the basis of several factors, including currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes, and the cost of doing business. "These factors vary from region to region and over time, such that international prices are not always comparable to US suggested retail prices." But some commentators were unconvinced by this reasoning. David Buik of Panmure Gordon & Co told the Daily Mail: "To pass on the drop in sterling in one hit is completely unnecessary and unwarranted. "Apple are using Brexit and the drop in the value of the pound as a convenient excuse to impose huge hikes in their prices." Fans of the computers took to Twitter to express their disappointment: Apple is not the only technology company announcing price increases. In order to offset the slide in the value of the pound, Microsoft has warned it will be raising the prices of its software by 13% and its cloud services by 22%.

October 28, 2014 Apple faces class-action lawsuit over 2011 MacBook Pro GPU issues 9to5 Staff - 2 years ago MacBook Pro Mac Apple Graphics GPU Comments (161) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following a petition with thousands of signatures related to GPU complaints, Apple has been named a defendant in a new class-action lawsuit filed against the Cupertino-based company in the United States District Court for Northern California over system failures and graphical issues affecting 2011 MacBook Pros. The class-action lawsuit was filed by Kentucky-based law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason on behalf of plaintiffs Zachary Book, Donald Cowart, and John Manners, a trio of individuals that accuse Apple of failing to rectify the graphical issues that have affected both 15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models released in 2011. The lawsuit covers California and Florida residents that purchased an affected MacBook Pro model between approximately February 2011 and May 2012. According to court documents, the issue stems from a defective AMD GPU that did not function correctly because of lead-free soldering that caused short circuiting among other problems. MacBook Pro models that were affected by this problem would often have visual banding or malfunctions on the screen, especially when users were performing highly intensive tasks like watching high-resolution videos or using multimedia programs like the Adobe Creative Suite, Final Cut Pro and similar software. Apple did offer a free video card replacement on some mid-2011 iMacs exhibiting similar symptoms, though the cards in the MacBook Pro are different, and recalls as a whole are rare. The most recent was in August, when Apple offered free battery replacements for some iPhone 5 models that were deemed to have defective batteries. The lawsuit alleges that Apple has failed to reimburse customers that were forced to pay for out-of-warranty repairs that could cost between $350 to $600 to fix the GPU issues. The legal filing also accuses Apple of largely ignoring customers that have complained, even those that attempted to reach out directly to CEO Tim Cook. Apple has yet to comment on this lawsuit and, given that it generally remains tight lipped on matters such as these, it might not ever provide any official word regarding the case. Nevertheless, we’ve reached out to Apple for comment and we will update this post if we hear anything back. Whitfield Bryson & Mason is examining this issue further and there is a possibility that legal action could extend beyond the jurisdictions of California and Florida.

When my Macbook first died of premature death, roughly a month before the end of my extended AppleCare. Luckily, Apple Repaired it, but it died again, of exactly the same problem, about 3 weeks ago. What caused me to wonder at first was the fact that all my other Macbooks before that one have lasted more than 5 years, and in fact, that’s why I used to be happy to pay a premium to buy Apple gear. Although, I feel it might not be worth it anymore. And then, just last week, one of my friend also lost a similar macbook from exactly the same problem. And since, like me, he’s now out of waranty, we both had to buy new computers. How can we get in this class action ? Can we do so, even if we live in Canada?

And it overheats so much that it is unbearable. I can’t wait until we get all the needed signatures. I hope we win this case because this is not fair that we receive a product that doesn’t function as advertised or “fails” as soon as the 3 year applecare runs out. LikeLiked by 1 person Victor DeejayRid Gutierrez - 2 years ago Reply A temporary fix for this problem is going to the top left corner and clicking on the Apple sign, click on System Preferences. Then click on Energy Saver. Then uncheck the option for Automatic Graphic Switching. Basically the major issue has been when switching from the on board graphics card to the Nvida Graphics card. Doing this will use your Nvidia card full time but it will over heat your Macbook and that is the down side at least when you are on photoshop or something graphic intensive. Even watching Youtube makes it get hot. Anyways, I hope this helps and I hope you can get some work done with this temporary fix.

I took it in today and they said 500$ to fix on site, 350$ and several days wait to ship it out. i had a think. went on my cell and searched about the graphics card (that’s what they told me was the problem after about 2 seconds) and i found this lawsuit. i went back in and spoke to the manager. i was complaing also that i had to replace the top case, the hard drive, AND the battery in the 3 years i had the thing and now this? i was like seriously, forget this. go get me the print out on all my repairs. i know about this class action lawsuit, i know that mac is at fault, so if you want to feel happy about selling me a piece of garbage i have to make a major repair on every 8 months, then thank you very much. the manager went into the back for a long time and came back without my paperwork, and without the number he said i should call about the lawsuit… and tried to make some sort of deal. dude seemed very unhappy when i mentioned this case- APPLE MUST KNOW THEY ARE TO BLAME because i played hardball with the guy and they are FIXING MY LAPTOP FOR FREE. ahaha. that’s right. i got those evil trolls who never want to help to pay my 320$ (as it turned out) bill. don’t worry if you’ve already payed… i’m sure the company is paying you back one way or another. i am SO unhappy with my mac and iphone… maybe it was bad luck but i’m running away from apple.

It seemed to occur if I had several programs open when I attempted to ‘switch users’. I made several calls to Apple support and they were tight and counter-accustory, particularly as I made the way up the chain of support “command”. They started by complaining I had programs from as old as eight or nine years (transferred by apple store/data transfer when I migrated stuff from the ol’ Powerbook G4… They also started inisting I send my entire OS to an external drive, and kept harping on me for the fact it didn’t happen all the time. They were particularly snooty when I started making noise about how they should replace the computer. Absolute human firewalls against that issue! I finally worked around it by changing the “automatic” switching from high intensity graphics to just the continual high intensity. Even though it said it might use more “power”, I have rarely had freeze ups since, so I guess I was lucky. Thing is, mine is the 17″, and I’ve had failed logic boards from a2008 Macbook..for whatever reason. I can’t tell if these machines are any better these days, but it really annoys me there’s no mirroring available on an early 2011, except by 3rd party like AirParrot.

I thought it was just a fancy way of taking care of the issue without naming the problem a “recall.” However, I was wrong, Apple not only replaced the logic board, but they also replaced the whole keyboard assembly, the right speaker, the Magsafe charging board, and the Clutch barrel joint, which holds the screen and body together. I guess when Apple decides to extend coverage (even for a specific issue) it qualifies the machine for the same coverage that fully warrantied computers receive.

November 25, 2015 AAPL: 118.03 -0.85 Review: Urban Armor Gear’s Composite Case for iPad Pro kills 3 birds with 1 stone Jeremy Horwitz - 12 months ago @horwitz iOS Devices Reviews iPad Pro IPad Pro Apple Pencil Comments (19) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Two weeks into using the iPad Pro, I’m even more convinced of something I believed during week one: the 12.9″ iPad is good on its own, but if an accessory adds enough bulk to make it feel like a poor man’s laptop, it starts to stink. I suspect that’s why Apple let another company release the first iPad Pro keyboard case; once you’ve tried something as big as Logitech’s Create, you’ll start searching for a “smarter” solution. From where I stand, Urban Armor Gear’s new Composite Case for iPad Pro ($80) is a much better alternative to both Logitech’s and Apple’s solutions — so well thought-out and polished that it’s bound to inspire copycats. It begins by offering a ruggedized case and two highly distinctive features — a three-angle metal kickstand, and an integrated Apple Pencil holder — that would in and of themselves fully justify the price tag. But UAG went further, including optional Apple Smart Keyboard compatibility, and offering MIL-STD-810G anti-drop protection. While there will eventually be slimmer and simpler iPad Pro cases, Composite Case currently offers every feature an iPad Pro owner could want… Key Details: A polished iPad Pro case design with multiple bonus features Includes an aluminum, 3-angle stand for video viewing + typing Apple Pencil holder MIL-STD anti-drop protection Smart Keyboard-compatible thanks to a pop-off edge piece I’ve long favored iPad cases with integrated stands; ZeroChroma’s Folio Slides and earlier Vario-SC cases literally transformed the way my standless iPads get used every day. But even though I love their adjustability, ZeroChroma’s plastic stands tend to wear down over time, requiring replacement. Based on a design previously introduced for Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets, UAG’s Composite Case instead includes a stand made from silver aluminum, with an internal hard plastic hinge mechanism that supports three different angles. It’s an excellent stand, and the single best feature of the case. The strongest recline is a deep lean that works well for typing on an external keyboard, akin to Logitech’s Create, while the shallowest angle is around 10 to 15 degrees behind a fully upright 90-degree angle. Between them is a third angle that’s a gentle, Apple-like recline. I love the versatility these angles permit; by comparison with Apple’s iPad Pro Smart Covers, the only thing missing is an angle to support on-screen virtual typing. The rest of the case is also made from sturdier materials. Like ZeroChroma’s cases, it’s made mostly from a slightly flexible plastic that mostly preserves its shape, but in typical UAG style, it sports rear panels with “Frogskin” accents that give it a “near-future military” look. In the jet black version (called “Scout”), the Frogskin accents merely add textured grips, but blue (“Cobalt”) and red (“Rogue”) Composite Cases pop with spots of color. I’d personally favor the all-black Composite for an iPad Pro, but to each their own. Between the grips and the MIL-STD-810G anti-drop protection, your chances of accidentally dropping the Pro radically decrease, while the Pro’s chances of safely surviving a drop radically increase. Composite Case’s deliberately (and thankfully) basic front has a 2mm-thick bezel, which can keep your Pro’s screen from touching whatever flat surface the case comes to rest on. The more complex back is the reason Composite roughly doubles the Pro’s natural thickness at some points, most notably at the center and long edges. My second favorite feature in Composite Case juts out from the front right edge: an Apple Pencil holder. While it’s a risky move for UAG to include a place to hold an optional, $100 accessory, the omission of an Apple Pencil storage solution has been conspicuous in other iPad Pro accessories, so it’s welcome here. Made from the same slightly pliable plastic as the rest of the case, it adds 6mm of width and 3-4mm of thickness to a 30mm box on Composite’s edge. As an Apple Pencil user, I consider it a major selling point of an iPad Pro case; UAG’s design firmly grips the pencil while enabling it to be removed as needed. Another nice touch is Composite Case’s optional Smart Keyboard compatibility — the first practical solution I’ve seen to address the needs of both Smart Keyboard users and the many people who won’t spend $170 on the optional accessory. If you want to attach a keyboard, a hard plastic bracket detaches from Composite Case’s long edge to permit both magnetic and Smart Connector attachment. Should you prefer not use the feature, five pegs and latches keep the bracket in place. I love that UAG included the bracket, but have no desire to use it. Why? Composite Case frees iPad Pro users to adopt what will — in the absence of a better Apple solution — become the dominant “large tablet” paradigm going forward: as-needed access to a wireless keyboard such as Logitech’s K811 or Apple’s Magic Keyboard rather than a bulky, always-connected wired keyboard. Up until now, the key missing piece to enable this for the iPad Pro was an integrated stand, but Composite Case fixes that while adding drop protection and an Apple Pencil holder to the tablet. Apple’s $140 alternative — pairing an $80 iPad Pro Silicone Case with a $60 iPad Pro Smart Cover — is more expensive, less drop-safe, and has no Apple Pencil solution. Having actually used Composite Case with my iPad Pro, I can tell you that it’s impressive enough to keep on the tablet at all times: polished, sturdy, and practical. It adds only a little weight and size to the already large tablet, while radically expanding its utility. The only way the iPad Pro fits into my life is when it has an ever-present stand to support it on flat surfaces, preferably with both protection and easy access to the Apple Pencil. I’m genuinely thankful that Composite Case is here already to deliver on all these fronts; it’s worthy of my highest recommendation.

October 2, 2015 AAPL: 110.38 0.80 iPhone 6s Plus: Living with Live Photos Zac Hall - 1 year ago @apollozac Opinion AAPL Company iOS Devices iOS iPhone 6s Linked to this still iPhone 6s Plus photo are both motion and audio that further capture the moment Comments (24) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Live Photos aren’t perfect. The video shot in a Live Photo is a mediocre 12 frames per second, compared to the 30fps iPhones generally capture. Low-light photos are noticeably less vibrant when Live Photos are enabled. Shoot a Live Photo in the wrong orientation then rotate it, and you’ll revert back to a standard photo. Sharing Live Photos is fairly fragmented by Apple standards, even on Macs running the latest versions of OS X El Capitan. And it’s not easy to frame the perfect Live Photo; great ones tend to happen by chance, not technique. But despite obvious day one omissions in the Live Photo experience, I’m honestly quite surprised at just how much I appreciate the new iPhone 6s/6s Plus feature. Using my iPhone 6s Plus for a full week now, my take on Live Photos has evolved from “curious but confused” to “I get it but when should I use it?” to wishing I had Live Photos years ago. Read on for how I believe Apple can improve the Live Photos experience and how the new iPhone 6s feature has changed my approach to shooting photos and videos… [youtube https://youtu.be/-EmYJ14wcrA] Okay, so what is a Live Photo exactly? Apple describes a Live Photo as a full-resolution still image that captures movement and sound just before and after the photo was taken. That means 1.5 seconds of video and audio are captured both before and after you tap the shutter button and snap the picture. Note that Apple won’t call a Live Photo a video, and iOS doesn’t treat Live Photos like videos. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus let you watch Live Photos only by 3D Touching (deep pressing) the still photo. Older iPhones can play shared Live Photos by long pressing the still images. Apple marks a Live Photo with a special icon in the image’s corner. The video captured during a Live Photo is both low-resolution and low in frame rate (12fps), so the footage plays back with a murky but somewhat dreamy look. It’s noticeable on 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, and it’s just not pretty on even larger displays like iPads and Macs. The 12MP still photo dramatically contrasts with the dated, stuttering video footage wrapped around it. It’s like pairing an iPhone 6s photo with an iPhone 3GS video. I would love to see the 12fps frame rate increase, or at least provide an option if storage is the issue. Live Photos can be used as lock screen wallpapers on the new iPhones, but the motion is so stuttery that it isn’t as compelling as I’d hoped after Apple’s presentation. You also need to deep press the lock screen for it to animate, likely to keep battery life in control, but would anyone regularly do that? For now I’m using a Live Photo as my wallpaper, but only because I like the way the still photo looks. Once you grasp what a Live Photo is for yourself, the first time you share one with someone else necessarily requires teaching them how to engage it. My experience with both power-user friends and less-savvy family members when sharing a Live Photo to other iPhone users is this: 1) send Live Photo 2) include instructions to open image full-screen, press and hold 3) just hope that makes sense. And that’s just from iPhone to iPhone. (There is a Live Photos icon in the photo’s corner, but it’s not a play button.) There’s a software component to making Live Photos work, too, and not even Apple has caught all of its platforms up. This is what you can expect when sharing Live Photos across Apple’s apps and platforms. iCloud Photo Library can sync Live Photos to the Mac, and Photos allows you to play them back within the app. A button labeled LIVE in the lower right hand corner lets you click and play the Live Photo. Just like on the iPhone, Photos for Mac lets you edit a Live Photo and enable or disable the live part of it. Click edit then toggle the yellow or white Live Photos icon in the top center: yellow is on and white is off. Similarly to iOS, auto-enhancing a Live Photo preserves the motion and sound, but rotating, cropping, applying filters, or adjusting light and color will revert it to a non-Live Photo. Somewhat frustratingly, Messages for Mac currently has zero support for Live Photos. Messages on iPhone and iPad work with Live Photos just fine, but the Mac version of the app treats every Live Photo as a traditional JPEG still image. There’s not even an icon to let you know you should view the Live Photo on your iPhone or iPad. This also happens when sharing a Live Photo directly from Photos for Mac through Messages using the share action. This is the case on both the public version of OS X El Capitan 10.11.0 and the developer beta version of OS X 10.11.1. More reasonable is Apple’s lack of support for Live Photos on the web. This is the case when using iCloud Photo Library on both icloud.com and beta.icloud.com, which sometimes has future features before the main site. You can playback video from both versions of icloud.com, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it eventually caught up with Live Photo support. For now I don’t spend much time viewing my photo library online, though, so the omission is less annoying than no Live Photos on Messages for Mac. And what about Apple Watch? Testing with watchOS 2, Live Photos work as expected when you sync an album that includes them. In my case, I sync photos that I favorite to Apple Watch. This lets you set these photos as your watch face, and Live Photos will animate your watch face each time the display lights up. Viewing a Live Photo in the Photos app presents an icon in the lower left corner that shows motion but not audio when tapped. Live Photos in Messages on Apple Watch work like Messages on the Mac, just still JPEGs with nothing to clue you in to watch it. Sharing a Live Photo online is also tricky. My videos are captured using QuickTime on the Mac with a wired connection to my iPhone, and the result is really just a video that you play and pause. Apple said that Facebook plans to support Live Photos sometime this year, but it’s not clear what that will look like. Still, with Apple behind it there should be a fair amount of support coming. Live Photos aren’t as straightforward as traditional photos and videos, but are they worth the trouble right now? All of these software pieces will come together in time, but the wow effect of what a Live Photo can offer is not something I expect to get over anytime soon. As I mentioned at the top and discussed on our podcast ‘Happy Hour’ this week, my feelings about Live Photos have quickly changed since first trying the new camera feature last Friday. [tweet https://twitter.com/apollozac/status/647786199722119168 align=’center’] The iPhone’s Camera app lets you decide before shooting whether or not you want Live Photos to be on or off. You can quickly toggle it on or off before each shot if you want. After my first couple of days with Live Photos on my iPhone 6s Plus, that’s exactly what I was doing: shoot a photo of a person with Live Photos on, snap a pic of an interesting looking coffee cup with Live Photos off. That’s a lot of work, though, and the extra step of processing that decision isn’t worth missing a good shot. Adjusting my approach (and taking advantage of my 128GB of storage plus iCloud Photo Library with optimized storage turned on), every photo I shoot now starts as a Live Photo then I decide in post if I should revert it to a still image afterwards. I have one exception to this approach. Live Photos capture 3 seconds of motion and audio, including 1.5 seconds after you snap the image. That means taking a Live Photo is noticeably not instant because it can’t be. It’s similar to taking an HDR photo on an old iPhone before the processor got so fast. That process involves taking and mixing multiple images and shooting without moving. Live Photos are the same. They take an extra second and a half, so I toggle the feature off if I want to shoot something very quickly in succession. I joked on Twitter that every iPhone reviewer should have a toddler around when testing Live Photos because that’s when the feature really shines. Parents need Live Photos. It seemed gimmicky when I tried shooting the flag waving in my front yard and getting my cat to pose for one was more annoying than pleasant, but nearly every Live Photo of my daughter just impresses me over and over. [youtube https://youtu.be/qCDVRDAu_EM] iPhones are getting really great at shooting video. My iPhone 6s Plus has optical image stabilization even for video and shoots in 4K resolution, and while I sometimes decide to shoot a video and not a photo, it’s still a fraction of the time. Photos are fast to share, easy to enjoy, and don’t ask for much of your time. Videos catch the moment much better but rarely get re-watched around my house. I’m finding that Live Photos strike a really nice balance between the two formats. I have way more photos than videos of family and friends, but I wish I’d have shot more videos over the years. Live Photos makes that decision much easier for me going forward. I don’t have to change my approach, but I get the benefit of details previously only captured in video. Live Photos seemed ambiguous when first announced and ranked low on my list of reasons for upgrading from my iPhone 6. Yes, the motion quality has plenty of room to improve and Apple’s software still needs to catch up in some corners, but consider me completely sold. Android phones and App Store apps may have been first to the photo format, but being built into the camera and apps that I use everyday in a way that isn’t intrusive is perfect.

July 17, 2015 Confirmed: New iPod nano and shuffle won’t get Apple Music to prevent piracy Jordan Kahn - 1 year ago @JordanKahn Apple Music iPod nano iPod Shuffle iOS iPod Comments (52) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit You might have heard some discussing the state of Apple Music on the iPod nano and shuffle, two products that just got a minor facelift alongside a larger refresh for their bigger brother, the iPod touch. And you might have already guessed that streaming to the devices was a no-go from the lack of Wi-Fi capabilities, but it turns out you won’t even be able to store your offline Apple Music collection on the devices either. The reason, according to sources, is simply to prevent piracy… By not allowing users to sync their offline songs to the iPod nano and shuffle, Apple can guarantee that users aren’t able to keep a collection of songs on their device after cancelling their Apple Music subscription. That’s unlike other iOS devices that have access to the iOS Music app and Wi-Fi that Apple can use to authenticate an active Apple Music subscription. So, if you try to sync offline Apple Music tracks to your iPod nano or shuffle, you’ll simply get a warning from iTunes that “Apple Music songs cannot be copied to an iPod.” It seems like Apple could have worked around this problem with new software to accommodate authentication of Apple Music subscriptions through iTunes once a month, at least for users that want to take that step to get their offline tracks into their new iPod nano or shuffle. But for now, your non-touch iPod will be limited to your purchased iTunes or DRM-free music, and Apple Music won’t be much use if you’re planning on keeping the nano or shuffle alive by picking up one of the refreshed units in new colors launched this week.

August 28, 2015 AAPL: 113.29 0.37 Apple to retire One to One Apple Store training program Sept. 28th Mark Gurman - 1 year ago @markgurman iPad iPhone AAPL Company Apple Inc Apple Store Comments (27) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple is planning to retire its long existing One to One training program within Apple Stores on September 28th, according to a memo sent this week to Apple retail employees. One to One launched in 2007 as a $99 per year subscription program where a Mac user could make appointments with a “Creative” at an Apple Store to learn more about using their Mac and creating content with either consumer or professional applications. Apple cites “fewer customers” signing up for One to One as the reason behind the service’s upcoming closure: On September 28th, we will be ending One to One sales and renewals. Since 2007, there One to One program has given the opportunity to teach members how to get the most out of their products and acquire new skills. As our products and programs have evolved, fewer customers are taking advantage of One to One. We want to offer rich learning experiences to all members of our community, and elevate Creatives as leaders of these experiences. Apple’s memo tells employees that One to One training will be replaced with the recently upgraded Workshops program.: Open Training and Thematic Workshops are great options. Thematic Workshops offer dynamic learning where customers learn from the instructor and other participants. Open Training encourages a collaborative learning environment for One to One members to work on their goals. We’ll be providing guidance to increase the number of Thematic Workshops that your store will offer to customers. MacRumors reported yesterday that One to One would be retired in favor of Workshops. Apple tells retail staff that the September 28th shut down will mean both new signups and renewals will stop, but existing memberships will remain active until they expire. A key component of One to One sessions has been data migration, and Apple has indicated that it will be launching updated standalone migration programs for a fee in the fall. Apple’s One to One website will also begin to shut down toward the end of September, and Apple tells employees to inform members to transfer notes saved to the One to One portal to a word processor by the 27th.

I didn’t grow up with cell phones, but amazingly I learned to use one. I don’t pop out of my mother knowing how to drive, but guess what, I learned. The computers I did grow up with were nothing compared to today’s computers, but yep, I learned to use the new ones. Let’s really face facts here. Those lamenting the closing of One to One are simply to lazy to learn how to use their computers or come in for sessions where they want the trainer to do everything for them. Trust me I had plenty of those sessions. In fact, most people didn’t come in to learn, or follow a curriculum, they just came in to ask rapid fire questions, get answers and not learn one damn thing. In fact I wonder how many of you know we did have a curriculum for you to follow so you could learn all you needed to know? I’d say most don’t because they forgot that after their first meeting with us and next time would come in wanting to work on a photo book without knowing their butt from a hole in the ground about computers. It’s like saying, I want to fly the space shuttle, but don’t teach me any of the basics. Most of you really never took the time to learn. You just wanted hand holding. And your neediness and lack of willingness to truly learn is why this program is closing down. I doubt there was a shortage of people wanting to become one to one members. Most of you were so expensive to support it wasn’t feasible for the company to keep the program going. So enjoy the fruits of your laziness folks. LikeLike Jan Rivers - 6 months ago Reply …Wow!

February 19, 2015 Apple launches Repair Extension Program for 2011-2013 MacBook Pros with video problems Mike Beasley - 2 years ago @MikeBeas MacBook Pro Mac warranty repair program video problems Comments (66) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following a number of complaints from consumers regarding graphics issues with Apple’s 2011 MacBook Pro, the company today announced a replacement program to remedy the issue for customers still experiencing problems. The affected models include 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros built in 2011, as well as 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros built in 2012 and early 2013. MacBook owners who believe they may have one of these machines can check their warranty coverage on Apple’s website to determine whether they are eligible for a repair under this program. Apple is offering in-store and mail-in options for repairs, providing customers with some flexibility in how they wish to handle the situation. Customers who previously paid for a repair related to this issue will be contacted by Apple and possibly issued a refund. Those who have not yet been contacted may reach out to Apple to speed up the process. The program will lauch tomorrow in the United States and Canada, with other countries being added on the 27th of the month. It will run until February 27, 2016 or three years from the original purchase date of the affected laptop. Complete details about the new repair program are available on Apple’s website. In October of last year, court documents surfaced showing Apple was facing a class-action lawsuit over the 2011 MacBook Pro GPU issues. The lawsuit claimed a defective AMD GPU that did not function correctly because of lead-free soldering causing short circuiting and other problems. In addition to the lawsuit, the graphics problems have been a frequent complaint among a large number of users in Apple’s support forums and petitions online garnering thousands of signatures from users demanding Apple fix the widespread graphics card related issues. The graphics bug often results in screen-tearing and other display artifacts, as pictured above. In the past Apple has offered similar replacement programs including for the graphics card in some mid-2011 iMacs back in 2013. More recently Apple offered free battery replacements for some iPhone 5 models that were deemed defective.

How will they guarantee that the repairs last, as they didn’t for me? I see others also have had repeat failures with this issue once repaired. LikeLiked by 2 people freestateguy - 2 years ago Reply This is exactly my problem and Apple first tried to fix it (I was told) by replacing the motherboard and the display. That didn’t work and they then reinstalled Yosemite which wiped out most of my files and had to be restored from my Time Machine over a two day period. That didn’t work although the graphic distortion problem seems to occur now only when I use the Safari browser. Fortunately, I was covered by Apple Care so there was no out of pocket cost – just 10-14 days without my laptop. When I took it back in to my local Apple store ( with the distorted display in tow) again last week, I was told that they had done everything that that could do and that the problem must be the “environment” where I use the computer regularly or some corruption of my existing user account. The Apple Store person suggested that I check the environment (which I subsequently did, but the problem still persists) and that I should create a new user and copy my old libraries and files into the new user home folder. While I will attempt to do this when I have the time, I must confess that I am unhappy with all this inconvenience and am worried that I will do the file transfer imperfectly and that it will end up being a very time consuming effort for naught. I was never told that there was a systemic defect in my model. Apple did not offer to replace the the 2012 laptop for a new one despite having tried to fix it twice.

I sent it to a professional UK GPU repair shop to replace the GPU for a brand new one with lead solder. I don’t know if people realize that part of the problem with electronic components failing has been the stupid move to “green” circuit boards. So maybe Apple should have given Greenpeace the finger, when they constantly downrated them with their phony environmental ratings. Unless you have a damaged MBP sitting around and can carry it into an Apple store and get it repaired for free, or sent to and back for free, it might be a better idea to get it repaired the right way, which is re-balling with a new GPU. Unless they have logic boards with revised chips lead solder mounted, which I doubt. LikeLike djmindblender - 2 years ago Reply This doesn’t matter still doesn’t fix the issue!

Trending in Apple Poll: What is your view of the all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro? June 24, 2015 Review: Apple’s new 15-inch MacBook Pro is a dream for media professionals and creators (Video) Dom Esposito - 1 year ago @macmixing MacBook Pro MacBook Apple Reviews OS X Comments (40) Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit It would be silly to say that Apple’s latest iteration of the 15-inch 2015 MacBook Pro with Retina Display is the best MacBook yet, because that’s mostly the truth with every new model. Unfortunately, you won’t find a shiny new processor setup this time around, as Apple stuck with the trusty old Haswell configuration, but there are some nice improvements here. The good news is, there’s a bump in clock speed across the board if that matters to you and we have a new GPU setup thanks to AMD in the high-end model. Even with these modest upgrades, the MacBook Pro I purchased is a beast for content creation… This year I decided to splurge and pick up the 2.8GHz configuration and 1TB of flash storage, but I felt like it was worth the extra cash considering what I do for a living. I plan on using this thing for the long haul as the last MacBook Pro I had was a late 2013. As expected we have a beautiful Retina display here, with a resolution of 2,880 x 1,800 that’s good for 220 ppi. For full specifications on Apple’s 2015 MacBook Pro lineup, check out the Apple Store online. There’s also the new Force Touch trackpad which comes along with some cool features, but none of them are particularly useful to me. If you’d like to check out all of the Force Touch features available with the new MacBook Pro, check out our top features article/video here. Instead of focusing this review on how great (or poor) this MacBook is for everyone, I’m going to tell you how it works for me. I make videos. Most of those videos happen to be in 4K resolution, so it should be no surprise that I’d need something powerful to get the job done when I’m on-the-go. Also, if you’re interested in the carbon fiber skin I’m rocking on this MacBook Pro (shown in the video below), you can find it here. Check out our 2015 15-inch MacBook Pro review video below: I actually edited the entire review video above and the original unboxing video on this MacBook. If you’d like to check out that unboxing video with benchmarks and comparisons to the other 15-inch configurations, you can find it here. Premiere Pro CC, After Effects, and Photoshop run like a boss on this thing. If you need something completely capable of any media-related task, I’d highly recommend it. I was able to export my 3:14 unboxing video of this MacBook with After Effects compositions in under 10 minutes. My last MacBook Pro was clocked at 2.3GHz which is pretty fast, but I can definitely tell the difference in performance. As for benchmarks, Geekbench 3 produced a single core score of 3,894 and a multi core score of 14,807. Over in BlackMagic Disk Speed test we have read speeds as high as 1700 MB/s and write speeds over 1400MB/s. I’m not a huge gamer, but I did test a couple of titles for those curious out there. In Counter Strike: Global Offensive, I saw a consistent 30-35fps with all settings on maximum and full resolution of the MacBook’s panel, but the game was a bit laggy, bringing down the resolution a bit made it completely playable. I also gave BioShock Infinite a run and it played buttery smooth at the max settings and full resolution available. I’m not a gaming expert, but from my testing this MacBook is more than capable of handing a few good titles. This MacBook Pro has been a dream so far. It’s a very powerful laptop for my needs, but obviously it’s not for everyone. This specific configuration will set you back roughly $3,200 (or around $2,499 without the upgraded CPU and storage). If you’re in search of a 15-inch for everyday use, I’d recommend the base model 15-inch MacBook Pro which comes in at $1,999. Overall, it’s also nice to know that I’ll have a very reliable editing machine when on-the-go and a laptop that can handle pretty much anything I’d throw at it. I plan to keep this MacBook around for a while and it looks like it’ll be able to keep up with me.

PMZanetti - 1 year ago Reply Amazing how worthless PC Games are on even the fastest hardware any normal person would buy, yet the same games run beautifully without a hiccup on consoles with far less power. Maybe game developers need to stop doing what they’ve been doing for 20 years and start building with normal hardware in mind, instead of designing around only the fastest water cooled 8 core 3 GFX machine. LikeLiked by 5 people Rob Ribeiro (@azurelogic) - 1 year ago Reply The Radeon M370X that this thing is packing is actually about half as powerful as the aging GTX 660 desktop card. The 660 did fine with games a couple of years ago, but even now it is starting to show its age. For reference, the PS4’s GPU puts out about the same number of FLOPS (~1.8 TFLOPS). So, it makes sense that the M370X can’t keep up. Also, it’s worth factoring in that console games get tuned specifically for the hardware they are intended for. PC games require a multitude of switches and driver optimizations to run well on a wide range of hardware. There is no such thing as “normal hardware” when you could be running on Nvidia or AMD and the horsepower available varies wildly based on model.

PC hardware is the exact opposite of cookie cutter…and games made for them, can run at whatever resolution you want, provided you have the power to drive them. Almost every game gives you the option to tune the game for your system — if that means running it on a lower resolution with not as many effects, well, then I think they might be saying hey borzef, if you got a few more graphics cards and ran them in SLI/CrossFire, you could turn the effects on ‘high’ and run it in a higher resolution at a higher frame rate.

LikeLike Full Name Here (@Onerunjunior) - 1 year ago Reply You couldn’t be more wrong. Fastest hardware? In what? This macbook? Not even close. It’s a couple generations old and they are running these games at the native panel resolution in OS X. The resolution is pretty challenging but the real reason it doesn’t run as well as you think it does is because graphics drivers in OS X are really poor, and the performance is pretty bad. Throw windows on this and play the same games and you’d get easily a 50% in a lot of games. Playing Dota on my 2011 MBP in OS X and Windows 7 is a night and day difference. I have to run it on medium settings at 720p in OS X and I can play in Windows maxed at 1080p with faster framerate. OS X sucks for gaming performance compared to Windows. Consoles run so well because they are rendering at a far lower resolution and using a scaler to get to 1080p. VERY few games run at native 1080p on any console and they are very hard pressed to hit a consistent 60fps if they aren’t capped at 30fps. The console hardware is AT LEAST three generations behind PC hardware when they were released and neither would ever hold a candle next to even a mid-range PC. Consoles are holding back PC development because they know they can sell barely functional games on consoles and make a killing and then they port over very shitty ports to the PC and complain they can’t make any money there. The reason they don’t make any money is because they release horrible ports of low performance games from the console. When the “next-gem” consoles were released they were four to five years behind in terms of hardware and they will never catch up. Steam metrics show that the average PC is running a mid-range card at around $250-300 and they are running a mid-range CPU like an i5 2011 socket. That’s a cheap PC, around $800 all in and they’ll last just as long if not longer than any console could ever hope to. I’ve got less than a grand in my PC from the CPU to the monitor and it will DESTROY anything a console would every try and do in comparison. The really good part is Steam sales. I can get games for stupid cheap unlike a console. Maybe you should actually play some PC games before you make hilariously ignorant comments praising hardware you clearly know nothing about.

Imagine how fast the SSD / RAID storage is going to be for that model! And I bet it can drive at least two external 4K displays at once as well…but we’ll have to wait and see.

I have no intrest in downgrading to a 15″ model and would gladly shell out for a 19″ or 21″ mobile workstation.

It’s obviously modeled after the same ideas that go into other streaming devices that expose content rather than app icons, so why is this a siloed launcher I have to navigate into and out of? Why is this bolted on to the bizarre springboard-like interface of tvOS when it reproduces so much of it? You could argue that people want to have access to apps that are not for movies or TV shows, but I would suggest that that probably occurs less often and would be satisfied by a button in the TV app that showed you the inane grid of application tiles if you wanted to get at something else. As I argued yesterday on Connected, I think the new TV app should be the main interface of tvOS – the first thing you see when you turn on the Apple TV. Not a grid of app icons (a vestige of the iPhone), but a collection of content you can watch next. It's safe to assume that the majority of Apple TV owners turn on the device to watch something. But instead of being presented with a launch interface that highlights video content, tvOS focuses on icons. As someone who loves the simplicity of his Chromecast, and after having seen what Amazon is doing with the Fire TV's Home screen, the tvOS Home screen looks genuinely dated and not built for a modern TV experience. I think Apple has almost figured this out – the TV app looks like the kind of simplification and content-first approach tvOS needs. But by keeping it a separate app, and by restricting it to US-only at launch, Apple is continuing to enforce the iPhone's Home screen model on every device they make (except the Mac). That's something the iPad, the Watch1, and the Apple TV all have in common – Home screen UIs lazily adapted from the iPhone. I wish Apple spent more time optimizing the Home screens of their devices for their different experiences. The Watch is doing slightly better than the other ones thanks to watchOS 3 and its Dock, but the odd honeycomb Home screen is still around, and it doesn't make much sense on the device's tiny screen. ↩︎ Tags: apple tv, tv, tvOS Join Now Like MacStories?

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (52) Post your comment Apple really wants developers to take the Touch Bar seriously 29 October 2016 As we are sure most of you already heard, Apple finally brought an arguably overdue refresh to its Mac Pro laptop lineup on Thursday. It consists of a trio of new laptops, two in the 13-inch and on in the 15-inch form factor. All of them are more powerful and significantly thinner than their predecessors, have better screens, improved touchpads and lets call it a "different" approach to the keyboard and I/O, now entirely made of Type-C ports. However, all that was totally overshadowed by the introduction of the Touch Bar - Apple's new touch-screen strip, that courageously sits above the keyboard (yes, we do think it fits, since the Escape and Function keys are now completely tactile-free) and promises to revolutionize and totally change more than a few familiar workflows. Regardless of your or our personal opinion on the new tech and the respective willingness to look at the keyboard, rather than the screen in order to take advantage of some of the new Apple magic, we can't straight up deny that the input does open up the possibility for more than a few interesting implementations and concepts. A few such definitely caught our eye during the unveiling. However, if you are a developer, anxious to get your hands on the new MacBook Pro and start playing around with the API's, be warned that Apple has already stated loud an clear it wants you to play nice and play safe. Cupertino has a design guideline for using Touch Bar in the proper Apple-sanctioned way on its website and its tone is borderline scolding all throughout. It is almost as if Apple realized a bit too late that it had given developers and tech-savvy users what is essentially a second screen that if used in anything short of an "all-business" serious manner could definitely undermine the whole "Pro" tier essence of the product. To put things into perspective, Apple explicitly states things like: Use the Touch Bar as an extension of the keyboard and trackpad, not as a display. Although technically its a screen, the Touch Bar functions as an input device, not a secondary display. The user may glance at the Touch Bar to locate or use a control, but their primary focus is the main screen. The Touch Bar shouldnt display alerts, messages, scrolling content, static content, or anything else that commands the users attention or distracts from their work on the main screen. Strive to match the look of the physical keyboard. Avoid using the Touch Bar for tasks associated with well-known keyboard shortcuts. Avoid mirroring Touch Bar interactions on the main screen. There are a few other points as well, which you can check out at the source link. However, it seems Cupertino can't decide exactly how it envisions the usefulness and implementation of the Touch Bar, but is already pretty determined that it is no place to have unsanctioned fun. Since this is a design guideline and definitely not set in stone or enforced by Apple in any way, we are sure more than a few "bad apples" (horrible pun intended) will definitely go out of their way to fit an entire browser or GUI inside the tiny strip, or simply an endless looping Nyan Cat animation from end to end. But, hey, its your Touch Bar and if that's what you want from it, we don't believe anybody should ever stop you.

Apple continues its patching ways and Pangu has been left eating their dust. With whittled down operating system signings, the best chances of hacking groups is to come up with an iOS 10.0.2 jailbreak. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Any form of crack for the iOS 10 series has hardly gained any ground though it doesn’t necessarily mean that Pangu, TaiG, and other hackers have given up. They may have been trying but Apple has magnificently thwarted all attempts for a potential iOS 10 jailbreak. Advertisement As most know, Apple delivered a big blow when they said that only operating systems starting from iOS 10.0.2 and above will be signed. This means that downgrading and hoping for support will no longer be feasible, further closing the window of opportunity from jailbreaking groups. With limited options, Pangu, and other hacking groups need to decide on when to start. Right now, the baseline operating system that it bests targets is iOS 10.0.2. Curiously, this is the same iOS that comes with a lot of flaws in security though tied up to iTunes. iOS 10.0.2 was released primarily to address call audio issues on the iPhone 7, Engadget reported. It was the second update week after iOS 10 came out, proving that the current operating system is buggy. If that is the case, would it not hint that iOS 10 would be an easy target to crack? Security leaves a lot to be desired as well. So adding the issues one by one, it becomes a mystery why the hacking groups have not rolled out an iOS 10 jailbreak. From here on, the roadmap indicates an iOS 10.1 coming. Aiming that high could be suicide for Pangu or TaiG at least for now. What is important is that they crack an iOS 10 code and fast. Apple may be inadvertently frustrating Pangu’s efforts, and such is believed from the hackers’ apprehension. Just the same, Pangu should have had one out outside that beta version iOS 10 jailbreak that never saw the light of day. Advertisement If there is one in the works, the best bet is iOS 10.0.2. But for Pangu to prove itself, one has to come out soon. With Apple's frequent adjustments and iOS 10 updates, hackers need to come up with some kid of life to prove that they have not waived the white flag of surrender to Apple in terms of jailbreaks, Neurogadget reported.

 Don’t buy the MacBook Air Jeff Dunn Oct. 29, 2016, 9:00 AM 81,349 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple rolled out three new MacBook Pros last month. They look interesting! Especially when it comes to that multifunctional Touch Bar that lives above the keyboards on the two higher-end models. They're also expensive. The most affordable new model starts $1,499, and doesn’t include the Touch Bar. The other 13- and 15-inch models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. Lots of people don’t want to pay that. But lots of people also want a Mac. That could make the cheapest MacBook model Apple now sells, the 13-inch MacBook Air, seem appealing. After all, if you look at Apple’s Mac page, it’s now the only notebook that’s available for less than $1,000. Note that the "MacBook Pro 13-inch" on the right isn't the newest model. A little confusing!Apple That said, you shouldn't buy it. Though there’s always a certain allure to buying an Apple product, you can get better for your dollar in late 2016. It’s been more than 600 days since the MacBook Air received a significant refresh. (Apple quietly updated the base model from 4GB of RAM to 8GB this past April, but that’s it.) The company did not respond to a request for comment on whether or not a one-to-one update is coming, but considering how it pitched the Touch Bar-less 13-inch MacBook Pro as superior to the Air on Thursday, you probably shouldn’t hold your breath. In any case, that age shows today. What was once a significant leap forward for notebook design has been surpassed on all fronts. There are several thinner and lighter laptops available now. Their bezels are slimmer to boot. Flickr/Tim Trueman The entry-level MacBook Air runs on a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 chip. For a few hundred dollars more, you can go up to a stronger 2.2GHz Core i7 processor. Both of those processors sound fine, and for the most part they are, but they’re the 5th-generation “Broadwell” chips Intel launched in 2015. We’re on the 7th generation (“Kaby Lake”) now. That doesn’t mean the Air can't do most everyday tasks. Much like the iPhone and iOS, the MacBook can get more out of lesser specs because Apple intertwines hardware and software so tightly. But it’s still not great. “Fine” is not what you want when you’re shelling out $1,000 for a new computer. It’s a matter of futureproofing. You don’t buy a laptop for today — you buy it for three or four years down the road. In 2019, you’ll want a Kaby Lake or Skylake (the 6th-gen chip found in the most recent MacBook Pros) machine more than a Broadwell one. Worse, the Air is notoriously stubborn about letting you upgrade other components like the RAM or hard drive. Reuters/Robert Galbraith Along those same lines, the MacBook Air has no USB-C ports. While we’ll all miss Apple’s old MagSafe connector dearly, there’s a reason why the company put four of these things on its new MacBook Pros: It’s very obviously where all laptops are headed. It’s where all non-iPhone smartphones are headed too. It’s faster, it’s more versatile, and most future accessories are going to use it. Unless you’re on a budget, it’s a must-have today. The worst offender, though, is the MacBook Air’s display. With a resolution of 1440x900, it is simply not up to par for a $1,000 laptop in 2016. There are notebooks that cost less than $600 with sharper screens, letting you see more things at once. Resolution isn’t everything, but even then, the Air’s colors, brightness, and viewing angles are all just decent by today’s standards. Full disclosure: I look at it everyday for work. It's just not enough. Flickr/Matthew Pearce To be clear, the MacBook Air isn’t a bad laptop. It’s sturdily built, its battery is great, its keyboard is above-average, and its trackpad is second-to-none. It’s just a laptop from 2015. If any other company launched it for $1,000 or more today, it’d be roundly ignored. Everyone else has caught up. This makes it all the more frustrating that Apple opted not to update the device last month. The way to make the MacBook Air appealing again seems simple: Refresh the processor, and update the screen to full HD. There is a big, vocal group of people who do not want to adjust to the super-thin keyboard on the new Pro models. But Apple is a business, and updating the Air would likely cut into the margins made by the iPad Pro and the new MacBook Pros. Yes, that new MacBook Pro looks and feels fantastic. For now, though, if you don’t want to pay that kind of premium, it’s time to leave Mac behind. Try a Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth, HP Spectre x360, or — if you’re really strapped for cash — Asus Zenbook UX305UA instead.

What Apple hasn’t mentioned, however, is that the new MacBook is also more expensive, and when we say that, we actually mean that it’s a lot more expensive. The top-of-the-range Apple MacBook Pro costs no less than $4,299 (as you can see in the photo attached to this article) and this without even opting for pre-installed software such as Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X, which would add another $500. For this price, you get a 15-inch MacBook Pro in silver and powered by a 2.9 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, with turbo speed up to 3.8 GHz, 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD storage, Radeon Pro 460 graphics with 4GB memory, a backlit keyboard, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch Bar and Touch ID. But for the exact same price, you can also get any of the following (which at first glance might actually bring more benefits than this new Apple thing): 1. A Surface Studio All-in-One PC priced at $4,199 for the top configuration, and you still have $100 left to pay dinner at a fancy restaurant. 2. Half of a Dacia Sandero 3. A trip to Paris (from the US, first-class tickets could cost up to $2,000, an exquisite hotel room could set you up to $1,000 for a weekend, and you still have $1,000 for shopping) 4. David Bowie’s hair 5. 4,299 $1 ice-creams 6. A Titanium toothbrush that promises the best dental care ever 7. 635 jars of Nutella at $6.76 each 8.

Apple Inc. introduced the first overhaul of its MacBook Pro laptop in more than four years, demonstrating dedication to a product that represents a small percentage of revenue. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg   Mark Gurman and Alex Webb Bloomberg     Apple Inc. unveiled new Mac computers as it seeks to revitalize a product line that co-founder Steve Jobs once said would be rendered redundant by the iPad. Overhauled MacBook Pro laptops and a new computer monitor were presented in a press conference at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. While laptops are traditionally more profitable for Apple than the iPad, customers often spend more on films, music and apps with the iPad, making it a long-term moneymaker. The new MacBook Pro has a fingerprint scanner which makes it easier to buy online using the Apple Pay payments system. Jobs heralded tablets as laptop replacements by calling the iPad a "post-PC" device after it launched in 2010. But products like the MacBook Pro have shown surprising resilience. While Mac revenue has fallen from its 2015 peak, the decline in iPad sales has been more precipitous and the laptop now outsells the tablet. Cook has meanwhile sought to expand services revenue from the App Store, iTunes and iCloud to offset slowing hardware sales. The new version of the MacBook Pro comes with either a 13-inch or 15-inch display. The new laptops are lighter, thinner and narrower than their predecessors, and include larger trackpads and faster chips. The highlight was a new digital function display at the top of the keyboard called the Touch Bar, replacing physical buttons. The thin organic light-emitting diode screen allows functions to change based on the application currently in use. Apple also announced a 5K monitor developed with LG Electronics Inc. that connects to the new MacBook Pro, and a new TV app. Apple last released new laptop computers in the middle of 2015, and has gradually lost customers in the intervening period. The iPhone-maker's personal computing market share fell to 7.4 percent in the three months through September, down from 8.1 percent a year earlier, researcher IDC said this month. "Apple is going to be able to regain some of the market share that they've lost in the higher end notebook market because so many of their products have got so long in the tooth," Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research, said before the event. If Apple is able to sell more services through Macs, they can become far more profitable than iPads, Needham & Co. analyst Laura Martin said before the product launch. "Then you really do want to sell more Macs, because it's not only a higher upfront fee but then if you can get the same services revenue that's a more powerful growth engine." The Mac's average selling price is almost $800 more than the iPad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and Apple got 11 percent of its $216 billion annual revenue from the computer, with the iPhone accounting for most of the rest. Siri, introduced to the Mac operating system in September, could also help guarantee a cut of revenue from taxis, meals and other services ordered with the virtual assistant via computers. Siri can be activated more easily using the new Touch Bar.

Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     CUPERTINO, CALIF. -- Apple unveiled a redesigned MacBook Pro, which incorporates smartphone-like touch-screen features into the keyboard and carries a higher price tag of $1,800. Apple has been furiously updating its smartphones every year, but it has been years since customers saw much more than basic refreshes of the company's highest-end laptop. At its event here, Apple spent considerable time showing off its newest innovation for its new MacBook Pro. The company called it the "touch bar," which replaces the long-standing function keys at the top of the keyboard with a small touch-screen strip. The touch bar changes depending on the program that is running on the computer. It offers quick typing suggestions in a word processor, emojis in a texting program, or volume and play buttons in a music program. It also offers "touch id," allowing the computer to be unlocked with a fingerprint. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without the touch bar costs $1,500. The new feature brings that price up to $1,800. The 15-inch screen starts at $2,000. Previously the MacBook Pro line started at $1,300. The rising price of Apple's notebooks is unusual in the consumer electronics world, where products such as big-screen TVs and computers become cheaper over time. But Apple has been making a bid to become an upscale retailer, something some analysts long ago thought was difficult to do in mass-produced hardware computers. "The price points for the new MacBook Pro models sit in a rarefied stratum of the PC market," J.P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester, said Thursday. Laptops and tablets designed by Microsoft, he added, "have eaten away at Apple's lead among both high-end buyers and creators, so Apple had to fight back ... but Apple's deep brand loyalty will make the products successful among the target audience anyway." Price also appears to be the way that Apple is distinguishing its somewhat confusing lineup of laptops. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro is actually thinner and weighs the same as Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air, which was originally intended to be the company's ultralight laptop. The MacBook Air is priced at $1,000 and is Apple's cheapest notebook. Beyond these computers, Apple also offers its traditional MacBooks at various screen sizes, starting at $1300. Apple said its new MacBook Pro has a 67 percent brighter screen, a faster processor, and is lighter -- four pounds for the 15-inch notebook, which Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said was "almost unheard of" for a high-performance professional notebook. It can be ordered online starting Thursday. The Apple event comes just a day after Microsoft introduced two new expensive computers -- the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Studio desktop. Microsoft took aim at its rival by noting that the Surface Book was three times faster than Apple's best 13-inch MacBook Pro. On Thursday, Apple had its chance to hit back. Apple kicked off its announcements with a somewhat unexpected subject: Apple TV. The company did not announce a new version of its set-top box, but it announced some new apps that could make the device more appealing to consumers. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said that Minecraft, the popular building game owned by Microsoft, will hit Apple TV by the end of the year. Twitter's Ryan Troy, the company's global lead for TV devices, also took to the stage to show off the new Apple TV Twitter app, which is being held up as a prime example of interactive viewing apps. Apple is trying to simplify the Apple TV for users -- a key move as more cord-cutting services flood users with more options than they may be willing to sift through. With a new Apple TV app, simply called "TV," the company is aggregating users' many streaming options into one spot, making it easier to search and surface content. It looks somewhat like iTunes, but with television content. And it works with Siri for search. The app will look the same across Apple TV, iPhone and iPad and will be part of a free update in December.

October 29 AAPL: 113.72 -0.76 iPhone 8 Plus model likely to use OLED display says Sharp CEO, company could make future iPhone OLEDs in US Seth Weintraub - 2 weeks ago @llsethj Sharp iPhone 8 View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Japan’s Nikkei again reports on upcoming features for Apple’s next iPhone just a month after the launch of the iPhone 7. Three days ago, it reported that there would be 3 versions of the all glass-backed iPhone 8 line including a 5-inch screen model. Today the news organization is reporting that at least the biggest model will use a OLED and Sharp could be making some of those future OLED displays in the US. “The iPhone has been evolving and now it is switching from LTPS (low-temperature poly-silicon) to OLED panels,” Tai told students at Tatung University, his alma mater, during a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree. “We don’t know whether Apple’s OLED iPhones will be a hit, but if Apple doesn’t walk down this path and transform itself, there will be no innovation. It is a crisis but it is also an opportunity,” After the Foxconn purchase of Sharp was finalized in August, Tai, a close associate of Chairman Terry Gou, was appointed CEO of Sharp. Foxconn, known as Hon Hai, is of course Apple’s principal manufacturer of iPhones. Apple’s next iPhone, called ‘iPhone 8’ by many because of its rumored sweeping changes, is also expected to do away with the physical touch button and place touchID behind the display among many other innovations. Bloomberg previously reported that Sharp OLED iPhones would have to wait until 2018. OLED displays offer sharper color contrast compared to LTPS screens that iPhones have traditionally used. Apple’s competitors including Samsung, LG, Motorola and others have been using OLED for quite some time and Apple and its proxies have often labelled OLED technology as “oversaturated”. Apple began using OLED displays on Apple Watch last year. Perhaps most interesting about the report is that the displays could be made, at least in part in the US. Sharp only does very limited OLED production currently. “We are now building a new [OLED] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” Previously it had been reported that Samsung would make the curved OLED display for Apple’s iPhone 8 but as we know, Apple likes to have multiple suppliers for key components, especially when one of those suppliers is Samsung.

Home Industry Tech Microsoft takes on Apple: Here is how iMac is too late and Surface so great; which desktop should you buy? Microsoft takes on Apple: Here is how iMac is too late and Surface so great; which desktop should you buy? Microsoft's Surface Studio is probably the bravest product with innovative tech, the company has produced in recent memory years, and it will take on Apple's iMac which has dominated the global creative tech industry for a long time now. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Updated: October 29, 2016 6:03 PM The basic model of the newly launched Apple iMac series is much less powerful than Microsoft Surface Studio, yet it works as one of the best desktop computers ever built. Microsoft’s Surface Studio is probably the bravest product with innovative tech, the company has produced in recent memory years, and it will take on Apple’s iMac which has dominated the global creative tech industry for a long time now. The basic model of the newly launched iMac series is much less powerful than Surface Studio, yet it works as one of the best desktop computers ever built. But if you are a user who constantly looks to expand his horizon and explore possibilities of imagination and innovation, not matter the budget, Microsoft Surface is just for you. If talking purely on numbers, Apple iMac wins by a small margin, yet since Surface is a hybrid the pricing is justified. With the Surface Dial, the all-in-One Desktop and the awesome base support, Surface clearly has made big inroads into Apple’s tech. Surface gives its users Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M-980M at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. Apple iMac initially seen in 2015, meanwhile, uses Intel Core i5 or i7, 8GB to 32GB RAM, using AMD Radeon R9 M380, M390, and M395X at 2GB-4GB GDDR5 memory. Microsoft chose to use Nvidia GeForce though Apple went for AMD. The decision to include a 980M is very little disappointing since it belongs to Nvidia’s last generation of mobile graphics card, and it can be easily outclassed by Nvidia’s new graphics cards of 1000-series. Apple wins the display round. The Surface Studio has a big 28-inch display at 4500×3000 resolution. The display uses PixelSense, which gets the user higher than 4K resolution. While it is awesome, the iMac’s top-of-the-line model is 27 inch Retina 5K display with 5120×2880 resolution, that comes around 14.7 million pixels. That is is 1.2 million higher than that of Surface Studio. Personal computers, once a workhorse for consumer tech industry, has risen from the ashes. They have made a comeback and just shown how they have aged well. With global tech giants Microsoft and Apple, releasing their PCs a day apart, it is an indelible fact that they are convinced that desktops are not dead. The interesting thing to note here is that both the companies who chose to put a stamp of authority on personal computers have a long history to look back to, and however strong they may be with their respective technologies, they are the opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to the kinds of user bases. Microsoft seemed to be an afterthought in the tech world, having slept through the mobile revolution. But Satya Nadella’s steps prove that we just can’t write off Microsoft and that the CEO is making good on his promises to bring ‘innovative products that people loved’. Microsoft, with productivity as its forte, was once known for a no-option desktop for workers in cubicles. But the way the company presented its products in New York on October 26, speaks volumes about its innovation and passion. Microsoft unveiled a new desktop, with technology earned through Surface tablets – touchscreen and pen. The big-screen 28-inch PC known as the Surface Studio rests on a sleek chrome arm, adjustable to flat angles; different for different professions. Writers can sit straight and write, while sketchers can lay it flat and use the screen as a huge canvas. The Microsoft PC also comes with a hockey puck-like dial and a mouse. The dial can be used to change things directly through the screen, or off it. The minimalism of the Surface Studio is reminiscent of Apple Macs’ love for design. At a time when creativity is taking over the world, where the lines between work and play domains are blurring, Microsoft after a long time seems to be joining the race at the right time. It is a race for devices for creative types, where Apple has always been leading, but Microsoft seems eager to push open the space of old rivalry. Interestingly, Apple will also launch the refreshing new MacBooks, which has been a long time coming. With Apple aiming for productivity and Microsoft setting targets on creativity, it remains to be seen whose innovation gets more consumer love. Not so long ago, tablets were touted as devices to begin the massacre of PCs. While being great for internet and movies, eventually users realised that they cannot replace desktops for writing, designing and hardcore gaming. Apart from that small touchscreen keyboards were no substitute, added to the revolution of smartphones. All of this has now lead to a start in the resurgence of the PCs, and tablets have started writing their own premature obituaries. Apple has made it clear with its launch of new MacBooks that it want to make its foray into Microsoft’s domain of the world of business. With the way both of them will sell high-end products clearly indicate the target of premium buyers. But the sales will indicate how they perform and whether newer products will be launched for budget buyers.With 3D models and augmented and virtual reality being the new in thing, it is only a matter of time when we will see them being a part of every range and lineups.With Windows 10 Creators edition, it is clear how they are innovating with its software as well. Peoples bar, personal emojis and Beam, Microsoft is luring in consumers by making streaming and communicating easier than ever. There are a few other things to note, which will mark the milestones for the revolution. Encryption will make it less of a hardware-based security, and more of virtual guarding like TPM, Secure Boot and Credential Guard. Biometric support will minimise the friction of sign-ins. The fact that with the ever evolving technology the focus on CPU specs will be lesser than the comfort of usage. And add to all this, not being biased with legacy, instead of accepting drastic changes will be the key to innovations like USB type-C. Nevertheless, one has to accept, that desktop computing may never make it to the central position in personal computing, as mobile devices have already made deep inroads. But PCs will always be easier and the first choice for offices, business and wealthy homes. Apple is quite late into the reimagining of its MacBooks, yet with the way both Apple and Microsoft are betting on new premium devices, it is clear they are going to stay and their place in certain spheres are more secure than what tech watchers imagined it to be. So, what is the price of progress and what are the things that you wish for, in order to jump into the revolution? Please Wait while comments are loading...

Call it an iPad Super-Pro or whatever you want, there's a gap in the lineup. Sarah Tew/CNET Deny it all you want, Apple, but Macs and iPads need to fuse 0 Share: Computers by Scott Stein October 29, 2016 5:00 AM PDT @jetscott Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech The first time I saw the Touch Bar on Apple's new MacBook Pro laptops, I thought: hey, there's a little strip of an iPad grafted onto that Mac. Macs don't have touch. At this point, they're the outliers in the computing world. Windows and Chrome touch computers have flooded the world for years, now. There are tablets. There are phones. There are, well, the iPad and iPhone. Apple says that the Mac and iPad probably won't combine, and that a hybrid touchscreen laptop computer isn't in the company's current plans. Instead, it seems, we have the Touch Bar. The idea of Mac computers not having touchscreens is now so odd that my wife was surprised when I told her. No, she doesn't follow tech. But she hasn't used a Mac in years, either. Apple's new MacBooks Does the Mac still matter? The Mac and iPad aren't merging, get over it The new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar I like the idea of a Touch Bar, or at least having a more customizable keyboard and second-screen controls. I haven't used one yet. And my colleague Dan Ackerman was impressed with his brief hands-on demo of the tech earlier this week. All in all, it seems like a useful way to evolve keyboard interfaces. But the Touch Bar is small. And the Touch Bar isn't a full touch interface like a touchscreen. It feels like Apple's just dipped its toes into touch on the Mac, instead of exploring the full range of what could be. Like, for instance, what you can do on an iPad. That's what makes Apple's statement that the Mac and iPad will never meet even more curious. Maybe they won't. But I bet that hybrid still happens. In fact, it's already happening. And until a new iOS super-device -- or, maybe, a post-iOS super-device -- emerges to take the Mac's place, I'm not thrilled with the divide at all. Pencil support, anyone?Photo by Josh Miller/CNET Hi, meet the iPad I've used iPads to do work. I've tried to make them do everything. I'm writing this story on an iPad Pro, and a MacBook. I alternate. The iPad is something that's so close to a full computer, even Tim Cook beckons us to make the switch. But it's still not fully there. It does around 70 percent of what I need. The rest, due mainly to OS design and some software and hardware limitations, is a challenge. Apple's software engineering chief tells us why there's no touchscreen Mac Craig Federighi discusses the thinking behind the Touch Bar, describes the challenges of adding Touch ID - and reveals that Apple had built several touchscreen prototypes. by Connie Guglielmo 5:21 Close Drag We're well past the time when a touchscreen of any sort should be considered cool. It's standard issue. From here on in, it's all about touch as a tool. Apple's iPad tablets and Windows PCs are useful because their entire canvas can be versatile. You can touch. Or, you can not. Sliders or palettes can be anywhere. Microsoft is already pushing into something different: tools that interact with touch. Microsoft's new Surface Dial, a haptic metal wheel that rests on Windows displays to create an instant pop-up interface, feels like an augmented expansion of the touchscreen. Gimmicky? Maybe. But when everything's touchable, controls can be anywhere. Compare that to the Touch Bar, which is one strip, one place. Do I think the Mac is going touch in the future? Maybe not. But I think Apple's already got the pieces to the puzzle of touch-screen computing lying right in front of us. The Touch Bar is the start of bringing some form of a touchscreen to the Mac.Photo by James Martin/CNET Why Apple's probably waiting The iOS and MacOS operating systems remain separate beasts, year after year. I think I know why. Apple effectively makes its own chips for iOS devices. (They are manufactured by companies such as TSMC, but custom-designed by Apple.) And they're getting more powerful every year. Good enough to replace the Intel chips used in a power professional Mac? Not yet. But there's already some anecdotal evidence that they're getting awfully close. One benchmark, as highlighted recently by Apple pundit John Gruber, suggests that the iPhone 7's A10 processor can go toe-to-toe with the Intel CPU found in the 2013 MacBook Air. Whether the comparison is 100 percent accurate or not is almost besides the point. In the next few years, Apple's "mobile" chips look to be on target to meet or exceed Intel's computer CPUs in terms of raw processing power. At that point, the only thing holding back an iPad is software and accessories. And Apple actually is positioning it as a full-fledged Mac replacement. A future, more powerful hybrid computer with Apple's own processors could mean more flexibility in design. Or it could mean Apple controls the future of its product even more. The future of magic do-it-all tablets is already here...let it happen As Apple's Craig Federighi said regarding iPads and Macs, "To attempt to bend one into the other is at its root to make a compromise." Fair enough. While a touch-based Mac is easy enough to envision from a hardware perspective, bringing its cursor-based interface along for the ride could indeed be a bridge too far. Windows did a few years ago, but at a great expense: remember the rough years of user discontent that was Windows 8. But those "compromises" Federighi aims to avoid are already happening on the Mac, to some degree. Some people have already grumbled about the disappearance of MagSafe, or the shift to USB-C type ports that will require more dongles for now. And there's skepticism about the Touch Bar. After all, it requires app support. The iPhone's 3D Touch has taken a while to develop meaningful uses across iOS 10, and many third-party apps I use were slow to support it. Will Touch Bar be better? Change is perpetual. I read Apple's executive comments on the Mac and how it would weaken with touch, and how the iPad shouldn't necessarily be like a Mac, and I thought...regular people can't afford two expensive, large-screen devices with an increasingly large functional overlap. I bought a laptop last year because my previous one was eight years old, and no iPad has the software underpinnings to replace the needs I have. But, I bought it for utility. Meanwhile, iOS is the touch-friendly landscape. It's also where Apple's next-gen creative tools lie, like Pencil. But you know what? Apple can converge the two. It should. My son recently had a birthday party where he and his friends played Minecraft. They gathered around touch laptops, touched the screens and had fun. They know how to use them because that's what they do: use touchscreens. The iPad can be a utility device too. And if the iPad Pro can have a keyboard and a stylus, it can have a lot more. If the Mac won't evolve to accept touchscreens, then bring on the advanced iOS hardware...because my kids, and the rest of the world, are waiting. I don't care what they're called.

Marina Shores development stands in California, on Oct. 17, 2016. Bloomberg photo by David Paul Morris.   Prashant Gopal Bloomberg     In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirt sleeves next to a turned-down king bed. "Good morning, Siri," he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted. "Your home is ready to rise and shine," the virtual assistant replied. Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar Corp., was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC's "Back in Black" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com. The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. "We want to bring home automation to the mainstream," said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. "The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created." The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage "touchscreen deadbolt," which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot. In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook's headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity. With the words "good night," the light turns purple. With a "good morning," it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, "which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month," according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties. and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics Inc. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. "Give me a break," he said. "That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool." Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing Java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail -- or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. "The smart home will get there but it's not there yet," Reck said. "Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted." As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. "Certain devices obey, and some do not," Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand Plc. Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a "halo effect," helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a "cool" alternative to an existing one. No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds. "I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds -- apparently it's just too much for me at that point," Bieber said. "I'm so used to saying things and they just happen." --- Bloomberg's Alex Webb contributed.

Image by: BECK DIEFENBACH / REUTERS About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. Save & Share Tweet Email Print The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet's Google, which crashed Apple's smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85% of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach — more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google's Android operating system. The town that's got everything - except people  Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. "We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information," Rakowski said in an interview. Leaf from Apple's book The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. Great Wall of Africa on the cards  The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colorful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button." The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words "OK Google." By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google "doesn't have to do negotiations with another handset maker — they can make it as tight as they want," said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. Google revives good landline  To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. Apple's privacy stance starting to eat into its bottom line  "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." WhatsApp dumps BlackBerry  Samsung going it alone? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. "If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator," said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. "They will be relegated to just pushing hardware." There’s an app to make you 'shark smart' in Cape Town  Google is coy about its plans. "Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible," Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant — such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company's earnings call on Thursday. Google adds fact-checking to news articles  "The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience," he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it's not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie," he said. "I approach this the same way."

It's what keeps things interesting. It's also what keeps the cauldron of commerce at a full boil. And in the technology industry, change is constant. This week, Apple and Microsoft revealed new computers that'll tempt many — particularly folks working in the creative arts — even if they come with eye-watering price tags. Change can also be cause for consternation. Apple decided to eliminate the headphone jack from its phones a month ago, and yesterday it banished everything without a USB-C or Thunderbolt connector from its laptops. This is the pain of progress. Given enough time, the benefits received will, we hope, be a good bargain. It often is. In other instances, change comes slowly. Jess Conditt wrote about how powerful video games have become as a medium for cultural and social commentary. Yet respect and investment for such projects trail more "traditional" arts, despite games' arguably wider potential impact. And finally, Edgar Alvarez explained Amazon's difficulties in becoming a purveyor of luxury fashion items. It seems that scale and quality can't mix — at least in the minds of those running haute couture. Hey, artists use Windows too!They're used to paying Apple prices, right? Microsoft wants to be the company for creative types. Like in the worst way possible. The company's big Surface event this week was all about creating, building and drawing. There was even a little 3D printing thrown in for good measure. Of course, the biggest news was the launch of the Surface Studio all-in-one PC, but we'd be lying if we said MS Paint 3D didn't kinda steal the show. Apple wants your fingers to caress its new laptopAll in the name of stimulating your artistic sensibilities Apple couldn't let Microsoft hog the spotlight, though. The Cupertino crew held their own big event this week, and the focus was all on the MacBook Pro. The most exciting news was the addition of the Touch Bar on the high-end models — an OLED touchscreen strip in place of those anachronistic function keys. The less exciting news was that Apple ditched basically all the ports except for USB-C. At least they didn't ax the headphone jack. Shhh ... you hear something?That's the sound of sick video game sound effects, y'all Microsoft went all out for the sound on "Gears of War 4." Most games treat the audio like a second-class citizen, but developer the Coalition fired up some elaborate software that simulates how sound reacts in different environments and how it interacts with different materials to make "Gears 4" seem ultra-realistic. Or as realistic as a game set in the future on an alien world can seem. R.I.P. VineWe (most of us) hardly knew ye Twitter announced that it was going to be laying off more than 350 people, and now, it seems, we know where at least some of those cuts are coming from. Vine is coming to an end, and with it the art of six-second video loops. Some Engadget editors will miss it more than others. What are pro designers saying about Microsoft's Surface Dial?No thanks, mostly. We talked to a host of illustrators, designers and other creative types to see what they think of Microsoft's newest devices. The Surface Studio seems to have piqued their interest.

British Airways (BA) has now warned of a price hike after its profits took a hit while Apple said its computers will be £500 more expensive. And gym-goers at a Holiday Inn were reportedly left furious after being told they were no longer entitled to a free towel service 'because the UK voted to leave the EU'. It's the latest in a string of price changes that has sparked controversy for consumers, including the 12% hike in the cost of Marmite - which Morrisons bowed to yesterday. The chief executive of BA's parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) Willie Walsh said on Friday it may increase BA ticket prices to offset the collapse in the pound. He revealed that industrial action and sterling's weakness had dealt a £145 million blow to operating profit in the three months to the end of September. Apple has already increased the prices of its Macbook Pros (Photo: Apple) The group, which also owns the Aer Lingus and Iberia airlines, said it suffered "weak trading conditions" in June - both before and after the Brexit vote - with its premium cabins bearing the brunt of the slowdown. Mr Walsh told the Daily Telegraph: "In time, if sterling continues to be weak, we are looking at increases, not just in fare but in all goods." Read More Morrisons becomes first supermarket to put up price of Marmite just weeks after Tesco refuses Unilever post-Brexit pressure Meanwhile Apple has been accused of using Brexit as an opportunity to increase prices for its customers in Britain after increasing the cost of some of its computer models. The company's most basic laptop, the 13-inch MacBook Air, has risen from £849 to £949 while its highest-powered version has increased from £2,499 to £2,999. A health spa has said its no longer offering a free towel service due to the falling pound value (Photo: Getty) The price hike means after currency conversion and UK VAT, the costs closely resemble US prices as the sterling fell around 20% against the US dollar post- Brexit . Apple said it sets its prices based on 'currency exchange rates, local import laws, business practices, taxes and the cost of doing business', the Daily Mail reports. Read More Microsoft hikes prices for British businesses in wake of Brexit vote But veteran City commentator David Buik told the newspaper: "To pass on the drop in sterling in one hit is completely unnecessary and unwarranted. "Apple are using Brexit and the drop in the value of the pound as a convenient excuse to impose huge hikes in their prices." It comes as a Holiday Inn health club decided to end its free towel service for customers, blaming it on the drop in the pound since the EU referendum, the Telegraph reports. Marmitegate has been one of the most controversial price hikes following the EU referendum (Photo: Getty) A note displayed in the reception of the Spirit Health Club in Portsmouth explained: "We have been informed by our Head Office that... we will unfortunately no longer be handing out free towels upon entry. "The reason the Company has decided to do this is because since the UK voted to leave the EU the pound has dropped significantly." Outraged gym-goers have branded the move as 'ridiculous' with some vowing not to return. Read More Poundland has started selling things for more than a £1 and it's the last straw Una Herman, 64, told the newspaper: "It’s ridiculous to blame Brexit – especially when it’s a UK company they send the towels to be laundered." Kew Green Hotels, which manages a total of 21 health clubs, reportedly said they launder over one million individual leisure towels. Director of Leisure, Justin Andrews, said: “We are one of the very last health club operators to withdraw the issue of free ‘per visit’ towels to members, despite the increasing costs to the business with the widely publicised rise in the cost of utilities and other consumables over the years.”  Share  Comments Comments Show more comments More On Apple European Union Holiday Inn British Airways EU Referendum MacBook Brexit news all Most Read Most Recent World newsTrump and Putin vow to tackle ISIS together as they hold breakthrough talks after billionaire's election The Kremlin said Putin called the president-elect yesterday to begin negotiations over how best to tackle to terrorism World newsNew Zealand earthquake: Live updates as two more earthquakes hit South Island in aftermath of deadly quake People who live along the east coast have been told to retreat to higher ground immediately with officials warning of tsunami waves as high as 10ft SupermoonSupermoon 2016: Live updates as the most spectacular full moon in nearly 70 YEARS happens around the world The spectacular 'supermoon', which can be viewed from the UK, will appear 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than usual.

However in the process, the Cupertino company also removed other features like more traditional USB ports, the DisplayPort, and also the SD card reader, just to name a few. The good news is that if you’re not adverse to third-party accessories, Belkin has taken the wraps off its Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock which will basically bring back some of those ports. On the front of the dock, it will feature a USB-A port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the other side, we are looking at 2x USB-A 3.0 ports, an Ethernet port, audio out, 2x Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a DisplayPort. It will offer users 40Gbps transfer speeds and will also allow users to daisy chain up to five Thunderbolt devices at once. However the only downside is that it will require users to connect it to a power source, meaning that it’s not exactly the most portable solution. It’s not impossible, but it’s not exactly convenient either. We should also remind users that the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has reduced bandwidth on its right Thunderbolt 3 ports, so that should be taken into consideration if you plan to use this dock with it.

The touch-sensitive OLED panel Apple is fitting to its new MacBook Pros lets you access smart shortcuts that change depending on the application you're using: pause music, drop in emojis, scroll through photos, and so on. iOS developer Steven Troughton-Smith has been taking a closer look at this new component and thinks the Touch Bar is basically an adapted Apple Watch, using the same integrated system-on-a-chip as Apple's timepiece plus watchOS. The modified component handles user Touch Bar input separately from the rest of the operating system and then feeds it back to macOS. This should keep performance snappy and keep the Touch ID element more secure at the same time. Will the new MacBook Pro qualify for our best laptops list? Touch Bar future Apple isn't commenting on the internal architecture of its new machines but Troughton-Smith told The Verge that "the Touch Bar theoretically could run while the rest of the machine is turned off, so you get all the low-power and security benefits of an iOS device", opening up all kinds of possibilities - like seeing iMessage notifications come up before you switch your laptop on. Sources speaking to TechCrunch have confirmed this is indeed how the new MacBook Pros are set up, and Apple Pay transactions are another duty that the modified Apple Watch chip is assigned to handle. The revelation probably isn't going to change your mind about whether it's worth shelling out for one of the new laptops, but it gives us some interesting info about how the Touch Bar might be used in the future - a separate, mini iOS device running right above the MacBook Pro keyboard.

Dr. Kevin Campbell Published: October 29, 2016, 4:00 am Updated: October 29, 2016, 4:00 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — Wearable health-related technologies are becoming more common. Despite their growing popularity, little has been done to evaluate their accuracy during exercise.  Now, a new study from Cleveland Clinic found that some monitors are better than others. What is a wearable medical device and how are they being utilized? Heart rate monitors such as Fitbit, Apple Watch and several others are being used by millions of Americans.  Many use it as part of cardiac rehab—certainly professional athletes and others use very advanced wearable technology to maximize their athletic performances. Tell us about the newest study on wearables Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic’s Heart and Vascular Institute tested four different wrist-worn heart rate monitors and compared their accuracy against EKGs and medical quality monitoring equipment used in cardiology offices. In treadmill tests, the Apple Watch and Mio Fuse were the most accurate. The other two devices fell short: Basis Peak, which is no longer being manufactured, overestimated heart rate during moderate exercise, and Fitbit Charge HRunderestimated heart rate during more vigorous exercise, the study found. All of the devices worked quite well at rest. Earlier this year, Maggie Newland and I did a similar test in a local gym comparing Fitbit and Apple Watch for accuracy and we found similar findings in our small test. Based on this new study, how should we use wearables in order to improve health? What does the future hold? I believe that wearable tech is the future. I think that we have to remember that many of these wearables are not classified as medical devices by the FDA and do not have to undergo rigorous clinical trials. Even so, these devices can provide helpful real time feedback to patients and athletes — steps, resting heart rate, etc. are all very important when training or when in rehab. It can also provide target HR information when exercising — just know that it is not 100 percent accurate during peak exercise, but it can give you enough information to reassure you that you are exercising where you intend to. I do think that wearables will only get better. Many companies are now working to produce medical device quality devices. I have a prototype of an EKG that you can do on your phone or on your watch — called AliveCor.

Microsoft Surface Exec Thinks Apple Will Build a Touchscreen MacBook GO The Touch Bar is just the beginning of a touch-capable Mac Oct 29, 2016 07:48 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple has launched its new-generation MacBooks and just like pretty much everyone expected, a touch-capable display is not available on the refreshed lineup, which makes many wonder whether Cupertino plans to ever make the transition to this tech or not. As far as Microsoft’s VP of Surface Marketing is concerned, the Touch Bar that Apple has added to these new models is just the first step towards a touch-capable MacBook. Touch and detachable MacBook coming In a series of tweets posted a few hours ago, Brian Hall explains that he’s 100 percent sure that Apple will make a MacBook with touch display at some point in the future and there are 95 percent chances that this screen would be detachable. “I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable. They're too smart not to,” he said, adding that “they would not have planned just the touchbar. Buy a Surface now & let's let the games really begin when they get (real) touch.” Truth be told, Apple doesn’t seem to be too interested in making touch-capable laptops at the moment, but this device category invented by Microsoft is rapidly gaining ground, so Cupertino might not have any other option at some point than to align with the market demand. There are people who think that Apple doesn’t have to make a touch and detachable MacBook because it already has the iPad Pro, but since it’s powered by iOS, this one is closer to the tablet category rather than to laptops. The iPad Pro does come with touch capabilities and a detachable keyboard, but since it’s not capable of running desktop software, it can’t be considered a Surface Book or Surface Pro rival. Time will tell if Apple is indeed planning the switch to touch displays, but for the moment, the company seems to be betting big on a more traditional approach that Microsoft, on the other hand, is not at all interested in. 1/2 I've had a day to think. officially am calling it. 100% Apple is making touchscreen mac, 95% detachable.

Is it a device meant to complement your smartphone; echoing alerts whilst providing both quick access to information as well as marginally contributing to the inconveniences of a digital life, or a fitness tracking device to help you live one healthier? It’s a fashion statement surely—just look at the fancy watch faces, dials and strap accessories, minimalist UX and design sensibilities that scream “innovative-yet-classic”. In the end, does one turn merely into a piece of jewellery like your uncle’s Omega Seamaster (presumably seldom used for deep sea diving as “intended”), or a daily workhorse (once again, as intended)? All we know is that the world is buying fewer smartwatches than before, but there are some good options for those of us still looking for one. Pebble Time Steel Let’s open with the original smartwatch. Pebble seemed to recognise that battery life was important way before anyone else. Android and Apple smartwatches can barely make it through a day, while Pebble’s e-paper powered devices made it through days of heavy use. The Time Steel will make it through a whole week at least (battery rated at 10 days) without requiring a charge. The Time Steel isn’t a particularly cool looking device, but the E-paper display combined with the battery life, 30m water resistance and all-round solid build quality make it a decent option. Where to buy: Amazon.in Price: Rs.11,999 – Rs.13,599 Samsung Gear S2 With the public release of Android Wear 2.0 being pushed to 2017, it appears that Droid fanboys have to make to with the current state of things (as with the latest versions of the smartphone operating systems). The Samsung Gear S2’s rotating bezel, display, and better-than-average battery life are all solid positives. It’s a cut above the rest of the Android smartwatch competition with some slick design and innovative engineering. It certainly helps if you have an accompanying (non-explosive) Samsung smartphone for optimum effect, but other Android phones will do as well (just not as nicely). It’s still a little thin on apps, but that’s a problem with the ecosystem in general and not the Gear 2 itself. Overall, a solid option if you’re looking at Android wrist companion. Where to buy: Amazon.in Price: Rs.26,999 Apple Watch Series 2 If you’re the sort who gets angry at people calling Apple’s wrist devices “iWatches”, this is the product for you. Not to be confused with “season 2” or “part deux”, the Apple Watch Series 2’s in-built GPS, optimised operating system, 50m water resistance and stunning display truly set it apart from the rest of the pack. There’s not much improvement in terms of battery life, however, so you’re probably going to have to charge this thing every day after rigorous swimming, gym-ing and other outdoor activities. Oh, and you can still use it to provide canned responses to messages, read your email and all of that. If you’re not a lazy slob, you’re likely to get more out the Apple Watch Series 2 than the rest of us lazy slobs. It’s pretty clear that the goal with successive iterations of this device is to help everyone lead a healthier life (the Nike+ version is a good example of this), and if used as intended and not a piece of jewellery, that’s exactly what you’re getting. Where to buy: Amazon.in Price: Rs.27,500 Moto 360 (2nd Gen) Why would anybody recommend the Moto 360 at all? Well, because of the lethal combination of classic looks and basic smartwatch functionality—nothing else, really! When it comes to smartphones, outside of Google’s own Nexus (and now Pixel) series of phones, Moto has always delivered the closest experience to what vanilla Android could deliver, free of bloatware and clutter. The Moto 360, similarly, offers the quintessential barebones Android wear experience, albeit in a stylish package. Keep in mind, however, that the watch’s middling battery life and limited suite of applications are a disadvantage, but there are noticeable improvements over the first generation models, including a better display and improved UX. Just don’t go swimming wearing it on your wrist. Where to buy: Flipkart.com Price: Rs.19,999 Huawei Watch If you’re looking for the best-looking set of Android wear watches, you need not look further than Huawei’s products. They look great, are uber-comfortable, and feature sapphire crystal displays often found only on luxury watches. They’re basically going to do what other Android wear watches are going to do, and as a result, there’s nothing special about the software. But it’s all about the aesthetics with Huawei, and the sheer variety of options on offer. The lack of GPS and average battery life (24 hours on a single charge) are downers, but the IP67 rating means, you can occasionally withstand a test of the elements. It’s all about the aesthetics, however, and if its looks you’re after, you can’t do much better for a smartwatch than the Huawei Watch. Where to buy: Amazon.com Price: Rs.22,500 approx (incl. shipping + duty) Garmin Vivomove Simple, minimalistic, neat and utilitarian are some of the words I would use to describe Garmin’s Vivomove. Treading the fine line between smartwatch and fitness tracker, the Vivomove combines both to great effect. What set it apart? The Vivophone runs on a regular coin batter which lasts up to a year, syncs with both iOS and Android, is waterproof and it’s the most modern looking smartwatch of the whole lot thanks to its minimalist design sensibilities. It can come off as more watch than smartwatch with its activity metres visible on the watch-face (a target activity metre and an idle “warning” metre which fills up red if you sit on your behind a lot). Sync it with a smart device of your choice by simply tapping on the crown. Downsides include sync issues and lack of advanced features, but for a barebones, stylish smart device, you can’t do much better than the Garmin Vivomove.

Less Guilt. Delectable New Items at Tropical Smoothie Cafe October 31st Chicken Apple Club Flatbread and Three Acai-Blend Smoothies Offer Sensible Indulgences     ATLANTA, GA, October 29, 2016 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Cooler weather means appetites start turning towards comfort foods and richer flavors. But this year, thanks to Tropical Smoothie Cafe, those tasty treats don't have to come at the expense of a healthful diet. The fresh, inventive minds behind one of the country's most diverse and nutritious fast-casual menus announced that their fall specials will feature "smart" indulgences that are just as delicious as they are satisfying. The Chicken Apple Club Flatbread is a comfort-food twist on the classic Rustic Turkey Apple Club, featuring three smoked cheeses, seasonal fruit and veggie accents. On the beverage side, Tropical Smoothie Cafe is highlighting its fan favorite, the Acai-Berry Boost smoothie, and also introducing two new variations for the season. The two new options both include acai berries, blueberries and banana, and guests can choose to either keep it simple (Acai Blue), or add a touch of Ghirardelli chocolate (Acai Blue Truffle). "This season can present a challenge towards healthful eating as the temperatures drop and we look towards our favorite comfort foods," said Jennie Hong, Senior Director of Brand Marketing and Strategy for Tropical Smoothie Cafe. "Our goal is to incorporate your favorite flavors - even comfort foods - into a smarter, nutrient-rich recipe so you can indulge in moderation. That is what is at the heart of our fall menu - ways to enjoy your favorite flavors without the added guilt." In addition to the juicy all-natural grilled chicken breast in the Chicken Apple Club Flatbread, fans of flavorful better-for-you eating will enjoy a house-made crunchy kale and apple slaw, country honey Dijon dressing, and a smoked cheese blend consisting of gouda, fontina, and grand cru melted to a creamy goodness and served on a warm toasted flatbread. The Acai smoothies all deliver a powerful punch of antioxidants, fiber, and B vitamins from authentic Zola Acai berries direct from Brazil. Acai-Berry Boost is available year-round, but the new entree and smoothie variations for fall will be available at all participating Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations for a limited time only between October 31st and December 25th, while supplies last.

Microsoft Trashes the New Apple MacBook Pro on Its Official Website GO “It’s easy to switch from Mac to Surface,” Microsoft says Oct 29, 2016 07:01 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft positions the Surface Book as a direct Apple MacBook competitor, and now that both companies have new models available, customers can once again decide if they go Windows or macOS. Microsoft itself wants to make this decision easier, so the company has set up a page on its official store page to highlight how the Surface Book performs against the MacBook, while also providing instructions on how to migrate from an Apple device to its own laptop. A side-by-side comparison between the Surface Book and the 13-inch MacBook Pro published on Microsoft’s website shows that the Windows 10 laptop comes with a detachable and touch-capable screen, while also featuring a discrete NVIDIA graphics processor, whereas the Apple model lacks all of these. Furthermore, the Surface can be used with a pen, but due to the lack of a touch screen, the MacBook is once again left behind here. Microsoft also emphasizes that its Surface Book comes with higher screen solution (267 PPI and 6M pixels on the Windows 10 laptop vs. 227 PPI and 4.1M pixels on the MacBook), but also with a better front-facing camera. Furthermore, the Surface Book also comes with a rear-facing camera. “iTunes will work on Windows too” It’s worth mentioning, however, that Microsoft picked the entry-level MacBook here and those specs improve as you go higher in the 2016 model lineup. But no matter the configuration, the MacBook still lacks modern features such as a touchscreen and support for pen, with Apple apparently more interested in a traditional laptop approach that provides customers with features they’re already familiar with (except for the Touch Bar, of course). “It’s easy to switch from Mac to Surface. Your new Surface will work well with iTunes, iCloud, and iPhone. And many of the gestures, shortcuts and features are similar to what you already know,” Microsoft explains on the page. It remains to be seen how many Apple customers would agree to switch to the Surface Book, but comparisons like these clearly show that Microsoft’s devices are substantially more powerful and offer better quality for the money than the new-generation MacBooks.

(Image: Reuters) About six months ago, people working on hardware and the voice-activated Google Assistant for the Pixel phone started sitting next to each other at the company's Mountain View, California headquarters, hammering out minute details of its first phone. The new seating arrangement illustrated a much larger shift underway at Alphabet Inc's Google, which crashed Apple Inc's ; smartphone revolution eight years ago by giving away its Android software and letting handset makers do the rest. Google software now runs on 85 percent of the world's smartphones, but as voice control threatens to replace touch as the primary means of using a hand-held device, the company is experimenting with a different approach - more akin to Apple's tight integration of hardware and software. The Pixel's hardware and Assistant teams gather for happy hour every Friday and have already received a prototype for the camera on next year's phone, said Brian Rakowski, vice president of product for Google’s Android operating system. Their ambition: to make the company's voice-powered digital assistant better than rivals such as Apple’s Siri and Microsoft Corp’s; Cortana. “We really wanted the Assistant on the phone to feel like a natural extension of the ways you ask Google for information,” Rakowski said in an interview. LEAF FROM APPLE'S BOOK The fusion of hardware and software is key to that goal. Certain specifications are crucial for a high-performing assistant, such as a well-placed microphone and a powerful processor to crunch reams of data. Creating an app isn't enough; that requires a few clicks for users to get to it. The hardware and software teams worked closely on details such as the graphics that appear when users call up the assistant, settling on a flurry of colourful dots, which Rakowski called a "whimsical touch to give a little bit of life to the home button.” The Assistant is always at the ready on the Pixel phone and can be summoned by pressing the home button or saying the words “OK Google.” By integrating the Assistant into the Pixel, Google “doesn’t have to do negotiations with another handset maker – they can make it as tight as they want,” said Charles Jolley, chief executive of Ozlo, which offers a digital assistant by the same name. To make sure users get the best possible experience, the Assistant will live only on Google products such as the Pixel, at least for now. In the long term, however, it is unclear whether Google will keep it that way, or return to its original phone strategy and try to push the product out to the millions of smartphones running on other manufacturers' Android phones, at the risk of offering a slightly lower-quality experience. Rakowski said making sure the Assistant works well on other phones would require a close level of integration with handset makers, beyond the typical work that happens on the Android operating system. "We want all these features of the Assistant to work well and work quickly and be nicely integrated so it gives the right idea of what the Assistant can do," he said "We don't want it to feel limited or bolted on in any way." He admits it could be challenging to execute the Assistant on some current Android phones. "You can't do some of the always-on 'OK Google' detection on some phones because they don't include the right hardware to do that," he said. "In some cases, the microphone is not in a great position." SAMSUNG GOING IT ALONE? Whatever Google decides, there are already some signs that its Assistant may not be welcome on all Android phones. Samsung Electronics Co, the world's top selling smartphone maker and the leading Android manufacturer, recently acquired Viv Labs, an artificial intelligence startup founded by the creators of Siri, and plans to weave the assistant into its phones. Having already ceded their operating systems to Google, Android manufacturers may be reluctant to delegate the digital assistant as well, people in the industry said. “If we get to the point where the face of the brand is the assistant itself, that is totally a differentiator,” said Babak Hodjat, co-founder of artificial intelligence company Sentient. “They will be relegated to just pushing hardware.” Google is coy about its plans. “Over time, we want to bring the Assistant to as many people as possible,” Steve Cheng, product management director for the Assistant, said in an interview, without giving details. Analysts expect that eventually Google will try to make money by taking a share of transactions brokered by the Assistant - such as when a user buys flowers from a store the Assistant just located. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai appeared to hint at that possibility during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. “The Assistant team talked about conversational actions as a way by which we can integrate third parties into the voice experience,” he said. But he did make clear, whether on its own or others' hardware, the shift from touch to voice-controlled assistants presents a prime opportunity for Google. "As we went from desktops to mobile, it’s not like one replaced the other... It expanded the pie,” he said. “I approach this the same way.” Google Google Assistant Samsung Siri Trending Articles Trump Terms Obama as Terrific, Says he has 'Great Sense of Humour' Hillary Clinton Blames FBI Director Comey For Loss: Reports At Least Three Indian-Americans Win State Assembly Elections Kent State University Course Examines Hillary Clinton's Life Trending Articles Trump Terms Obama as Terrific, Says he has 'Great Sense of Humour' Hillary Clinton Blames FBI Director Comey For Loss: Reports At Least Three Indian-Americans Win State Assembly Elections Kent State University Course Examines Hillary Clinton's Life 'Whole' BJP is Against Demonetisation, Alleges Arvind Kejriwal 'You See More Liberal Opinion from RSS Because Educated Middle-Class is Fuelling its Growthâ Modi Armour: Crackdown on Benami Property & Mega Rural Package Coming RBI Directs Banks to Waive ATM Charges on All Transactions From Our Network - FirstPost Naxal-hit village in Latehar gets electricity for the first time - Pradesh18 Thousands throng gurdwaras to mark Gurpurab - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News 'Whole' BJP is Against Demonetisation, Alleges Arvind Kejriwal Australia vs South Africa Live Score: 2nd Test, Day 4 at Hobart 15 Dead in Iraq Suicide Bombings Claimed by Islamic State Syria Conflict: Scores of Pakistani, Afghan and Iranian Fighters killed in Aleppo Watch: India@9 With Zakka Jacob & Bhupendra Chaubey Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

The Apple iPhone 7 and Air Pods. Picture: Beck Diefenbach, Reuters. Credit: REUTERS Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar, was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC’s “Back in Black” blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30 000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple’s free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com. Video doorbells? The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn’t hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. “We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of product marketing. “The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.” The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn’t come cheap. A single motorised, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage “touchscreen deadbolt,” which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot - and there’s always hiding a key under the flower pot. $2 000 upgrade In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook’s headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the colour of the light underneath a vanity. With the words “good night,” the light turns purple. With a “good morning,” it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2 000, “which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,” according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn’t include $30 000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that’s a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. “Give me a break,” he said. “That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There’s too much crap out there, it’s only diluting stuff that’s really cool.” Wi-Fi onesie Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant’s breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home’s lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail - or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. “The smart home will get there but it’s not there yet,” Reck said. “Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.” Disobedient devices As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. “Certain devices obey, and some do not,” Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand. Lennar’s Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a “halo effect,” helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a “cool” alternative to an existing one. True believer No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357 000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it’s time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1 000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbours ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorised blinds. “I’ll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds - apparently it’s just too much for me at that point,” Bieber said. “I’m so used to saying things and they just happen.” Bloomberg Connect with us on LinkedIn Like us on Facebook Follow us on TwitterSHOW ALL International Primedia CEO Terry Volkwyn quits Trump plans worry dreamers Mozambique seeks debt deal Dollar hits 11 month high Dollar weighs on emerging markets Most Read Eskom leadership: Koko tipped to succeed Molefe 'Molefe's exit a blow to SA's nuclear plan' Trump plans worry dreamers Primedia CEO Terry Volkwyn quits Zuma reprimanded mines minister Advertisement MORE business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| business internationalMenu News| Personal Finance| Budget| Companies| Startups| Markets| Indicators| International| Opinion| Leadership| Financial tools| Savings| WEF| INFO About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather SITES BabyNet.co.za Glamour.co.za GQ.co.za Ilisolezwe Isolezwe IOL Jobs IOL Property IOL Sportzone Loot.co.za Classifieds WomanOnline SECTIONS News Business Sport Motoring Tonight Lifestyle Travel Scitech About IOL Front page Market indicators Movie guide Newspapers TV guide Weather

Picture: Beck Diefenbach, Reuters Boston - In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. “Good morning, Siri,” he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted. “Your home is ready to rise and shine,” the virtual assistant replied. Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, California, Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar, was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad. Tap your phone, and AC/DC’s “Back in Black” blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30 000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple’s free HomeKit app. As iPhone sales growth slows, Apple is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com. Video doorbells? The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of models homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells? Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn’t hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem -- and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets. “We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of product marketing. “The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.” The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn’t come cheap. A single motorised, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage “touchscreen deadbolt,” which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot - and there’s always hiding a key under the flower pot. $2 000 upgrade In Fremont, California, about 15 minutes from Facebook’s headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the colour of the light underneath a vanity. With the words “good night,” the light turns purple. With a “good morning,” it switches to white. KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2 000, “which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,” according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn’t include $30 000 worth of gadgets. Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale. Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that’s a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020. For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day. “Give me a break,” he said. “That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There’s too much crap out there, it’s only diluting stuff that’s really cool.” Wi-Fi onesie Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target Corp. opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture. In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie -- made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant’s breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home’s lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents. You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail - or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck. “The smart home will get there but it’s not there yet,” Reck said. “Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.” Disobedient devices As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada. When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do. “Certain devices obey, and some do not,” Giesler said. Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand. Lennar’s Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a “halo effect,” helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a “cool” alternative to an existing one. True believer No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357 000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Florida. With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it’s time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog. Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1 000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system. Neighbours ask him for advice on their own smart home device purchases, and he plans to add motorised blinds. “I’ll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds - apparently it’s just too much for me at that point,” Bieber said. “I’m so used to saying things and they just happen.” BLOOMBERG Hungry for more business news?

It will offer a variety of controls that change according to the app or website that's open. It also has functions that will be familiar to many iPhone users — showing word suggestions as you type, for example, or letting you scroll through a library of emojis. The company unveiled the laptops at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where executives showed how the Touch Bar works with a variety of apps and software — providing playback and editing controls for videos or music, for example, and search functions for Apple's maps and photos apps. Apple is also opening the Touch Bar to work with outside software, including Adobe's Photoshop editing program and Microsoft's Word, PowerPoint and Skype. Along with faster processors and brighter screens, two of Apple's new laptops will also get a fingerprint sensor, similar to the one on iPhones. The sensor can unlock the device, authorize software installations or recognize a different user and quickly switch to that person's settings. It works with Apple Pay, so users can authorize an electronic payment for online purchases. At least for now, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID features will be available only on higher-end models — a 13-inch MacBook Pro that starts at about US$1,800 and a 15-inch MacBook Pro at about US$2,400. Both ship in a few weeks. Starting Thursday, Apple is selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar or Touch ID, but with other improvements, for about US$1,500. Older versions sold for prices starting at about US$1,300 for 13 inches and US$2,000 for 15 inches. Apple will still sell older MacBook Pros at those prices, along with less expensive MacBook and MacBook Air models. But its cheapest laptop, the 11-inch MacBook Air for about US$900, will be sold only to education markets. The company is also replacing some computer ports with new outlets compatible with USB-C standards, which can be used both for charging and transferring data. Connectors with USB-C technology can transmit data faster than older USB jacks. They are also smaller and have a symmetric shape, which means the USB-C jack can be inserted with either side facing up. But older USB printers and other devices will need adapters. The new Macs still have traditional headphone jacks, unlike the latest iPhones. Sales of the Mac have been in a slump this year, after a streak of growth in 2014 and 2015 that seemed to defy global trends. Consumers generally are buying fewer PCs and using smartphones or tablets instead.Apple itself has promoted its latest iPad tablet, the iPad Pro, as capable of replacing the laptop for many users. And in contrast with the Mac's earlier years — when Apple marketed its computers to people who saw themselves as creative professionals or just independent thinkers — Apple also has begun promoting the Mac as a computer for businesses, which once mostly used competitors' PCs running Microsoft's Windows software. Microsoft, meanwhile, has begun selling its own line of high-end Surface laptops and this week introduced its first Surface desktop PC. Analysts say the new Surface Studio has a premium price and features that will most likely appeal to visual designers and other creative professionals — an area that has been Apple's strength. Microsoft has boasted about modern controls with touch screens; the Touch Bar is Apple's answer to that, placed near the keyboard where people's fingers are already. For Apple, the Mac line has been eclipsed financially by other products — first the iPod and now the iPhone — that have made far more money in recent years. But the Mac has been important for Apple since co-founder Steve Jobs introduced the first model in 1984. It commands intense loyalty from fans. “The Mac is more than a product to us. It's a testament to everything we do and everything we create at Apple,” CEO Tim Cook said Thursday. Cook also used the event to promote a newer endeavor, Apple TV, and a new unified menu feature that shows recommendations and new episodes of recently watched shows, so viewers don't have to search through different apps to find them. Amazon's Fire TV is taking a similar approach with a software update, though the unified experience will be part of the home screen, not an app. Tweet < Prev Story   Next Story > ENTER COMMENTS - 3,000 Characters max ENTER IMAGE CODE  Receive China Post promos  Respond to this email Submit Terms Close By submitting your comments, you agree to the following conditions: Submissions are subject to review and edit, although The China Post is under no obligation to monitor your comments.

Home Auto Gadgets Hardware Internet IT Science Software Blogs Polls Submit News Hardware Apple Launches New MacBook with Two Missing Items Saimin (Blog) - October 29, 2016 1:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Apple’s new MacBook Pro comes in two sizes, 13 inch and 15 inch. It comes with a touch bar and touch sensitive display along with a touch ID sensor.       It will go in the market from $1400.00 to 1,700.00 and higher. The Apple TV, iPad and iPhone has TV app in USA.  TV app allows you to select the show that you want to watch from one central location and moves straight into the correct app.   As this has been the case in the past, the Apple app does not support Netflix, and jumping to correct app does not work in this case.  MBP 13 inch does not have new Touch Bar but it is repudiation of the top-end laptops layout.  The new MacBook Pro is a thinner and lighter Laptop with Touch ID fingerprint scanners but nether USB-A ports and SD card slot nor MagSafe power adapter. Instead it has quick access to emoji with Touch Bare, and 3.5 mm headphone socket.   To use existing accessories with the new Laptop, you will need adapters, which are not included.   EMOJI:  to use the Emoji feature, position the cursor in any text field that you would like to insert an emoji like a tweet then press the command + control key+ press the space bar and click on the Emoji icon on the sidebar. Here is an emoji box example.           The new laptop has OLED panel, which is better than standard keyboard, which replaces multi—function F keys and allows shortcuts to control window management and volume functions.  According to Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing for Apple: “It’s a retina display, multitouch, responding to gestures and taps. We call it Touch Bar. First it replaces the standard system functions, but it goes way beyond that. It adapts to whatever software you’re using.”     Stephen Lam- Getty images     You could see emoji or Emoticons on the keyboard displayed, which was demonstrated at the Apple Event on October 27,2016 in Cupertino. Also, more about the functionality of Touch Bar was discussed and shown by Graig Fedeighi senior vice president of software engineering for Apple.           According to Apple media discussion at Cupertino’s event, the new 13 inch MBP can be upgraded with the Intel dual–core i5 or i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, 256 GB storage and Iris 550 with a faster gaming, video editing and 3D graphics performance, than previous versions.   According to Tony Avelar/ EPA.  Four Thunderbolt 3 USB–C mean that all old USB accessories will require adapter to connect them to new MacBook Pro.                                    If you are in the market for purchasing one, make sure to shop around, also it would be a bad idea if you wait a week or so for more reviews to come out with real pricing. However, we recognized in the past that Apple products do well with testing and this may be another one that just took or will take over the market. It sounds too phenomenal to ignore.   "So if you want to save the planet, feel free to drive your Hummer.
