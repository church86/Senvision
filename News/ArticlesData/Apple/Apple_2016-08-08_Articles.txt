The latest scheme is its own TV guide that would work across the existing Apple TV boxes and other devices such as iPhones. Recode says the universal EPG would allow users to see what was available across a range of video providers without the need to open individual apps. It’s effectively the next stage on from last year’s plan that would have seen the Cupertino company create its own pay-TV bouquet. That plan stalled over a reluctance from the broadcasters. Then, the plan was to reduce the cost of TV packages when compared to US cable companies with a package of popular channels for a monthly $40 – half that paid for a typical cable subscription. However, the networks that include NBC, CBS and Fox are seemingly unwilling to lower their prices. Arguably, the universal EPG would also be easier to implement internationally. Apple is not commenting on the report.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated August 9, 2016 1:53PM SHARE ALSO SEE Apple iPhone iPad Enterprise IT iOS Mobile Apps Apple Pay Cisco Google Android Technology News Despite recently weakening consumer sales for both the iPhone and iPad, Apple devices and software have enjoyed a growing presence in business enterprises. Out of net sales of nearly $234 billion in 2015, some $25 billion came through sales to large business customers, according to Apple's most recent annual report, released in October. While those sales were just a small fraction of the company's overall revenues, they grew by 40 percent over enterprise sales in 2014, significantly more than Apple's overall sales growth of 28 percent, the New York Times reported earlier this week. Over the past couple years, Apple has hooked up with several other large technology partners, including IBM, SAP and Cisco, to boost its reach into the enterprise market. In 2014, for example, it began rolling out iOS applications aimed at specific vertical markets through the IBM MobileFirst program. Enterprises Seeking Standardization "Apple's iPhones and iPads have become the preferred mobile computing devices for corporations, as industries from insurers to airlines aim to ditch bulky PCs and give their employees the ability to do their jobs from anywhere using smartphones or tablets," the New York Times reported Sunday. Those inroads have come in part, thanks to some business customers seeking alternatives to the Android operating system, which dominates the consumer mobile market, according to the Times. Some enterprise users worry that "Google's Android software, which are generally cheaper and popular with consumers, have lagged in the security technology and the standardization that companies want," the Times noted. Earlier this summer, for example, IBM -- long the go-to provider for corporate IT -- annouced it was giving businesses the option of offering Apple Pay to their customers through the cloud. Apple's mobile payment system would help enterprises ensure quick, easy and secure transactions for their users, IBM said. 'Unique Collaboration' a Trend In September, Apple announced another "unique collaboration" with Cisco in which the companies would work together to optimize Cisco's network services for Apple devices and apps. "What makes this new partnership unique is that our engineering teams are innovating together to build joint solutions that our sales teams and partners will take jointly to our customers," Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins wrote in a blog post at the time. In May, Apple also said it would partner with SAP to develop iPhone and iPad apps for business users. That program sees the companies working together to release a new software developer kit and create a training academy focused on native iOS apps for enterprises. That program will focus on "industries where the demand for consumer applications is high and there is immediate value add," noted SAP enterprise platform and analytics president Steve Lucas. Both the IBM and SAP partnerships with Apple have targeted specific enterprise verticals, including retail, professional services, healthcare, transit and financial services. In addition to meeting the needs of enterprise customers, such collaborations have also benefitted Apple, especially in light of its recently declining iPhone and iPad sales. Earlier this summer, Apple reported that third-quarter iPhone revenues declined by 23 percent compared to the same period last year. And Apple reported it sold 40.4 million iPhones for the quarter, down from 47.5 million units from the previous year. While iPad revenues grew, the number of units sold in that quarter was also down by 9 percent to 10 million from the 11 million sold in the same quarter last year. Apple is hardly the only device firm to see declining tablet sales. That trend has been consistent for most companies in recent years. At the same time, however, Apple has seen its services revenues grow. Earnings from services ranging from iTunes to iCloud and Apple Care grew by 19 percent in the third quarter.

(REUTERS/Damir Sagolj)  (REUTERS/Damir Sagolj) The next iPhone will feature a dual-camera system, a re-engineered home button, and no headphone jack, according to Bloomberg. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Apple will ditch the headphone jack found on earlier versions of the device. Instead, headphones will be connected to the device via Bluetooth and the phone’s charging port, the sources told Bloomberg, making room for a second speaker. Rumors of Apple ditching the headphone jack on the iPhones have been swirling for some time, sparking concern from a number of users. Critics have warned that the move would be "user-hostile". Apple is widely expected to unveil its latest smartphone, possibly called iPhone 7, next month. The tech giant traditionally makes a major September product announcement ahead of the lucrative holiday season. Last September, for example, Apple launched the iPad Pro and its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.

The dual-camera sensors take pictures simultaneously, but capture colors differently, according to the report. The unnamed source also told Bloomberg that the dual-camera system can sharpen photos taken in low-light environments. Bloomberg also reports that the new iPhone home button will respond to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than the current “physical click.” The people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that the new iPhones will look similar to their predecessors and have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen size, respectively, as the iPhone 6s and 6s plus. It was rumored earlier this year that the smaller version of the new iPhones will not offer dual-camera technology. Last week Apple’s arch-rival Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note7 phone, which offers iris-scanning technology to unlock the device.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Best Black Friday deals on iPhone 7, Galaxy S7, FitBit, and the Apple Watch 2 Apple just patented an iPhone that clips to your clothes 3 Twitter fail: CEO Jack Dorsey accidentally suspended from platform 4 Facebook has reportedly developed News Feed software to suppress posts in China 5 President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Plans to Focus on New Profits from Next-Gen Auto Components | Main | Apple Granted a Patent for the iPad Pro's Continuous Handwriting UI and Processor System » August 09, 2016 Surprise! Apple Granted their First Vehicle Related Patent UPDATE AUG. 10, 2016 4:15 A.M. PST: APPLE LAW FIRM CLAIMS THEY MADE AN ERROR IN FILING. SEE THE FULL UPDATE HERE.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officially published a series of 80 newly granted patents for Apple Inc. today. This is Apple's first patent clearly indicating that they are inventing some kind of future vehicle. This particular invention covers a steering device for an articulated vehicle. The invention also relates to an articulated vehicle. An articulated vehicle is a vehicle which has a permanent or semi-permanent pivoting joint in its construction, allowing the vehicle to turn more sharply. There are many kinds of articulated vehicles, from heavy equipment to buses, to military vehicles, trams and trains. Apple is the assignee of this invention from BAE Systems Hägglunds AB designs Sweden. The company manufactures and markets military vehicle systems. The company's primary products are infantry fighting vehicles (IFV), armored all-terrain vehicles (ATV) and turret systems. It's unknown at present what Apple has in mind for this specific technology and it's a far cry from a dreamy popcorn for your mind iCar that we're all hoping to see in a future patent, but at least it's proof that Apple has a an automotive division that needed this IP for something that they're working on related to vehicles.     Background   The patent filing states that steering members for an articulated vehicle, particularly an articulated tracked vehicle, comprising a front vehicle unit and a rear vehicle unit steerably interconnected by means of the steering member are known. The front and rear vehicle units are interconnected over a link mechanism of the steering member comprising link shafts about which both vehicle units are mutually pivotable by means of hydraulic cylinders.   Articulated vehicles with such steering member comprises a driveline for operation of front and rear vehicle units, wherein the driveline is arranged to run from the front to the rear vehicle units in connection to the steering member/through the steering member for drive of the rear vehicle unit. Further, according to a variant of such steering members, electricity, fuel, brake fluid and fluid for air-conditioning device are arranged to be transferred in conduits between the vehicle units in connection to/through the steering device.   Due to the fact that the steering member is exposed between the vehicle units it constitutes a weak point of the articulated vehicle. A problem with such a steering member is consequently that it is subjected to external impact, e.g. effective fire in a war situation, such that e.g. the steering of the vehicle or other sensitive function such as braking, drive function, electricity is put out of operation.   Granted Patent: Steering Device for an Articulated Vehicle   Apple's newly granted patent covers an invention relating to a steering device for an articulated vehicle. The invention also relates to an articulated vehicle. More specifically, the invention is to provide a steering device for an articulated vehicle which improves the reliability during drive.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 noted below schematically illustrates a side view of an articulated vehicle with a protection device; FIG. 2 schematically illustrates a plan view of a part of the articulated vehicle in FIG. 1.   According to the invention the objects are achieved by a steering device comprising a steering member for mutually steering a first vehicle unit and a second vehicle unit of an articulated vehicle comprising means for mutually pivot said vehicle units, wherein the steering device comprises a housing configuration arranged to form a supply space between said vehicle units, comprising means arranged for removal of stuff in the supply space incoming from the surrounding. Hereby the risk of stuff in the housing configuration affecting the steering is avoided/reduced, wherein the reliability thus is improved.   According to an embodiment of the steering device said means comprises a heating device arranged to heat air intended to stream through the housing configuration. Hereby removal of snow and/or ice introduced from the surrounding if facilitated through heating of said snow/ice by means of the air streaming through the housing configuration and/or prevention of ice formation in that the space is kept warm by means of the air streaming through the housing configuration. Thereby the risk of snow and/or ice in the housing configuration affecting the steering is avoided/reduced, wherein the reliability thus is improved.   According to an embodiment of the steering device said means comprises an air intake arranged in a vehicle unit, a radiator arranged downstream of the air intake, wherein air heated by means of heat exchange downstream of the radiator is arranged to stream through the housing configuration.   According to an embodiment of the steering device air intake and radiator are arranged in connection to the first vehicle unit, which constitutes the front vehicle unit. Hereby efficient stream of air through the housing configuration during drive is obtained.   According to an embodiment of the steering device said steering member comprises an essentially vertical link shaft about which said vehicle units are pivotable. Hereby easy and efficient pivoting of the vehicle units is facilitated. According to an embodiment of the steering device said means for mutually pivoting said vehicle units comprises a first and second steering element. Hereby efficient steering of the vehicle is obtained in that the steering is facilitated by two steering elements. The steering elements are preferably constituted by steering cylinders which preferably are hydraulic.   According to an embodiment of the steering device said means comprises the bottom part of the housing configuration, which comprises two mutually movable protective elements arranged to, in a non-pivoting state of the vehicle, partly overlap each other, and, in a pivotable state of the vehicle, provide a drainage opening of the bottom part. Hereby removal of stuff such as rocks, gravel or the corresponding introduced from the surrounding is facilitated. Thereby is avoided that rocks, gravel or the corresponding in the housing configuration affects the steering and drive shaft through the steering device, wherein the reliability is thus improved.   At this time it's unknown what Apple's application for this invention is for. One of the applications for this technology could relate to a double bus as noted in the patent figure below. Considering that Apple loves the word Magic, as in Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, perhaps their working on a Magic Bus. I can hear the Who's tune now as part of the ad for Apple's fantasy bus. Okay, it's just a joke, but Apple has surely captured our curiosity with this newly granted patent and we hope that more are on the way. Hopefully one that's a little more dreamy, like the design that popped up in a new Korean report this morning about Apple signing a deal for a next generation car battery that has a completely new design than anything on the market today. The concept iCar design found in that same article looks like a suped-up Magic Mouse on wheels.    Apple's granted patent 9,409,599 was originally filed in 2015 and published today by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Below are photos of 'articulated vehicles' found on BAE Systems website.     Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any Granted Patent should be read in its entirety for full details.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Software iOS 10 & macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 Released – Download Now By Uzair Ghani Posted Aug 9, 2016 29Shares Share Tweet Submit iOS 10 and macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 builds for compatible devices are now available to download. The pre-release software is free to try. iOS 10 & macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 Arrive The Same Day As Their Developer Counterparts It seems as though Apple has really sped up its development process of its upcoming software. Not only did we see a new pre-release iOS 10 beta build today, tvOS 10, watchOS 3 and macOS Sierra got new betas as well. And surprisingly, the new betas arrive just one week after the previous betas are released. Normally Apple has a two week time period to release new software for both developers and public beta testers. Usually, public beta software gets an update the day after developer oriented builds are released. But Apple is doing things a little differently today, as iOS 10 and macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 builds are available today as well. How To Download iOS 10 Public Beta 4 Assuming you have a previous public beta build of iOS 10 already installed, connect to a WiFi network, navigate to Settings > General > Software Update. Tap on ‘Download and Install’ and wait for the installation to complete. If you’re downloading iOS 10 Public Beta for the first time then head over to this link. It’s absolutely free to try if you’re willing to take the plunge. Advertisement How To Download macOS Sierra Public Beta 4 Connect your Mac to a stable Internet connection and launch the Mac App Store. Now click on the ‘Updates’ tab at the top and wait for the page to refresh. Click on the ‘Update’ button next to the available Public Beta update. iOS 10 Beta 2 And Public Beta - Baby Steps But Massive Refinements Everywhere If you want to give macOS Sierra Public Beta a shot on your Mac then head over to this link for details. Wrap Up Just like the developer oriented release we urge public testers to update their devices right away to the latest public beta build. It’s packed to the rafters with bug fixes and performance enhancements, something which you direly need at this hour. The final build of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10 and watchOS 3 will land in September alongside new hardware from Apple.

It arrives one week after the release of developer beta four, which included new emoji along with a visual update to the current MacOS 10.12 Sierra emoji library. With the launch of Apple’s fifth developer beta of MacOS 10.12, the company has introduced the ability for Macs to discover Apple Pay-compatible Apple Watches and iOS devices lurking nearby. Another change involves Setup Assistant, which no longer walks users through their iCloud preferences. There’s also now Microsoft OneDrive credential support in the keychain feature too. Related: Russian agency investigating Apple for allegedly engaging in price-fixing on iPhones Developers wanting to get their hands on the latest build of MacOS 10.12 can grab beta five through the Update Software tool provided in the Mac App Store, or by downloading the platform through the Apple Developer Center. Also available are the latest betas for iOS 10, WatchOS 3, and tvOS 10. If you’re a consumer looking to check out the latest features provided by Apple, these betas are not for you. That said, if you’re wanting to get a taste of what’s to come with MacOS 10.12, Apple offers a public beta program for test-driving pre-release versions before they hit the public, and in turn offer feedback through the built-in Feedback Assistant app. In some ways, it’s like the Windows Insider program although Apple’s model may not be an ongoing process. Interested participants can thus sign up using their Apple ID account and register an iOS device or Mac. The process begins by backing up the Mac using Time Machine, and then clicking on a redemption code provided by Apple that automatically opens the Mac App Store. Once users click “Redeem” within the store, the download will begin. The installer will automatically begin once the download has finished. OS X El Capitan public betas are also up for grabs. Related: Eddy Cue: Apple’s public iOS beta is thanks to Maps’ disastrous launch In addition to the obvious name change, the big deal with Apple’s upcoming MacOS 10.12 is that it will finally bring Siri to the Mac. The popular personal assistant that made its debut on iOS will be expanded to support multitasking on the desktop, such as sending message by using a voice, quickly searching for an important document, pinning Twitter feeds, searching and dragging images into a document, and more. Additionally, the new MacOS platform will include an updated Photos app with a “Memories” feature, the ability to purchase items online with a Mac using Apple Pay and Safari, and the ability to automatically unlock the Mac using an Apple Watch. The new Universal Clipboard will even allow users to copy images, video, or text on an iOS device, and paste those items on a nearby Mac. The Desktop and Documents folder will automatically back up into the user’s iCloud Drive too. That all said, MacOS 10.12 Sierra is slated to arrive on Macs this fall, along with iOS 10 and WatchOS 3 on Apple’s mobile devices, and tvOS 10 on its Apple TV set-top box.

This comes just one week after the company made the fourth build of the future software update for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch available to devs and the third build available for public testers. Minor tweaks made to the Apple Music app alongside the widgets panel can be found in beta 5 of iOS 10. There’s also another new locking sound when putting your device to sleep, however not many seem to be a fan of it. Already found in previous builds of iOS 10 is a new lock screen UI complete with a dedicated widgets panel, an all new Messages app, lots of improvements to Photos such as facial recognition and Memories for you to revisit past events, a Siri SDK alongside some slight tweaks to the personal assistant, an updated Maps app, an overhaul News and Apple Music app alongside the addition of lyrics in the latter, an official Home app to control smart home devices enabled with HomeKit integration, a much improved Phone app, universal clipboard, and much more. Beta 5 may be one of the final betas of iOS 10 before the GM release of the update for iDevices begins rolling out. We may see a sixth build for developers alongside a fifth build for public testers before this time comes, however I could be wrong. If anything else notable we feel you need to know is discovered in the latest build of iOS 10, we’ll let you know. To install beta 5 of iOS 10 (or beta 4 if you’re on the public beta program), head over to Settings > General > Software Update on your registered iOS device and tap “Download” when you see the option to install the latest build. You’ll then need to sit and wait for the update to install on your device, however that should be a relative quick process as the  update appears to relatively small in size.

Photo: Ste Smith/Cult of Mac One week after releasing macOS Sierra beta 4, Apple is already back with a new beta build of its future operating system for Mac that is set for public release later this fall. Apple mentions in the release notes that it has made bug fixes for Apple Pay, iTunes, Keychain Access and even Microsoft OneDrive in the new build. The upcoming update brings a ton of new features, including Siri for Mac, auto-unlock with Apple Watch, Apple Pay, better iCloud integration and more. The new macOS Sierra beta 5 can be downloaded by developers directly from the Mac App Store if you have macOS Sierra beta 4 installed already. If not, you can download it directly from the Apple Developer Center. The last macOS Sierra beta brought a couple of minor changes, the biggest of which was the addition of 100 new emoji that add more gender diversity to the character set. We’ll let you know what new stuff we find as soon as we get it installed.

AP Share on twitter by James Eyers Apple has launched a blistering attack on three of Australia's big banks, saying their request to collectively negotiate over digital wallet access to the iPhone will compromise the handset's security, reduce innovation and blunt Apple's entry into the payments market in Australia.  In a sign of growing acrimony between the world's largest company and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp, Apple told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that "allowing the banks to form a cartel to collectively dictate terms to new business models and services would set a troubling precedent and delay the introduction of new, potentially disruptive technologies".  The three large banks made an application in late July with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank seeking authorisation to collectively negotiate with the technology giant, which has locked the banks and other third-party providers of digital wallets off the iPhone platform in favour of its own Apple Pay. In a pithy, three-page submission to the ACCC, Apple says providing access to the phone's transmitter to allow bank applications to facilitate contactless payments would compromise the security of Apple's hardware.  "Apple upholds very high security standards for our customers when they use Apple devices to make payments," it said. "Providing simple access to the NFC antenna by banking applications would fundamentally diminish the high level of security Apple aims to have on our devices.  Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full quote Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements "Unfortunately, and based on their limited understanding of the offering, the [banks] perceive Apple Pay as a competitive threat. These banks want to maintain complete control over their customers. The present application is only the latest tactic employed by these competing banks to blunt Apple's entry into the Australian market," said Apple in a document signed by Marg Demmer, a former cards executive at ANZ Banking Group.  ANZ is not a party to the ACCC application after breaking ranks with the other major banks in April in a deal that allows its cards to be loaded on to Apple Pay. It is understood that ANZ agreed to give up some of its interchange fee to Apple, but the terms of the deal have not been disclosed. The other big banks are understood to be reluctant to give up to Apple millions of dollars which they earn in interchange fees from merchants each year.  Apple said the banks want to force Apple to accept their terms, including allowing them to charge consumers that choose to use Apple Pay. It said it had "struggled" to negotiate agreements with the other Australian banks, although it is currently in negotiations with some Australian institutions.  It told the ACCC that the banks had relied on "innuendo and misstatements" in their submission and "if granted, the request would harm consumers, lead to less competition and less innovation, and create a troubling precedent."  Apple pointed to the market power in cards and payments of the incumbent banks and said "given their scale and market share, the applicants are essential to Apple's ability to offer Apple Pay on a meaningful basis within Australia". However, it said one of the banks that has brought the application has refused to even enter into a confidentiality agreement with Apple to allow for preliminary discussions about the terms under which it would participate in Apple Pay.  Apple said if the ACCC were to allow the banks to engage in a collective boycott during the term of negotiations with Apple this would slow innovation and prevent customer choice. It said the ACCC should not provide any interim authorisation this month, and instead should take the six-month statutory period to assess the application properly.   About 3000 banks around the world now offer Apple Pay to their customers.  Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit Advertisement Advertisement Related articles Westpac gets another shot at Australia's biggest banking contract Don't forget about BHP in Anglo coal sale Deutsche Bank's wealth rivals plot $500m funds carve up Banks should be pushed on data ELMO Talent Management hires Blackpeak Capital to consider IPO Latest Stories ASX poised to slip, miners steady 8 mins ago What you need to know about new super rules Westpac gets another shot at Australia's biggest banking contract Advertisement Luxury gifts with the Midas touch Fashion to make you bloom for summer The best 20 wines of 2016 Cartier takes a shine to Australian market Rare diamonds in a remote place Where the business crowd meets in Paris Why women shouldn't be called 'guys' Why you should start charging for your data Bloomberg, Goldman, which would you work for?

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Foxconn Reportedly Working On All-Glass Casing For 2017’s iPhone By Tyler Lee on 08/09/2016 16:16 PST A report from back in April this year suggested that Apple had an all-glass iPhone in the works for 2017. If you’re wondering how legit those rumors are, we suppose they’re as legit as rumors come, but it looks like they’re being reinforced thanks to a report from Nikkei (via The Next Web) that claims that Foxconn is currently working on all-glass casings for the iPhone. According to the report, apparently this is something the company has been working on for a year. An all-glass iPhone isn’t new as we have seen Apple attempt that in the iPhone 4/4S, which we have to say is one of the more beautifully designed iPhones we’ve seen to date. The report also claims that Apple is turning to the use of an all-glass design to help boost sales and renew interest in the iPhone. While we’re not sure a redesigned iPhone will do the trick, iPhone sales have been on the decline over the past half a year or so. It is possible that this could be due to the smartphone market maturing, and also the fact that there are tons of Chinese OEMs who are offering up handsets with high-end specs and builds for a much lower price. In any case we guess we’ll just have to wait and see, but in the meantime how do you guys feel about an all-glass iPhone? Yay or nay? Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about iPhone.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 09, 2016 6:39pm   Comments Share: An analysis of Stockal data shows that the Confidence Meter, a 1-100 scale measuring the combined perspectives of over 200 Wall Street analysts, can be an indicator for potential price action as far as several months in advance. Stockal took a look at four major tech stocks to see how correlated the two are. Here are the results. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) The Chart: The Breakdown: Looking at the chart above, you can see that right around March 2015 the Confidence Meter for Apple fell from around 80 to below 60. Around the same time, Apple’s stock began to trade down from around $130 to $123. In late 2015, the Confidence Meter fell from near 90 to all the way below 60. Apple’s stock followed suit by trading down from nearly $120 to below $100 as it entered 2016. The Confidence Meter has been bullish on Apple as of late, and the stock has traded up over 11.5 percent over the past month. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) The Chart: The Breakdown: From January until early July of 2015, heading into their second quarter earnings, the Confidence Meter trended upward from 50 to 96. During that same time the stock followed suit, going from around $350 to over $700. The sharp subsequent drop in price was preceded by a few days by a drop in the Confidence Meter. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) The Chart: The Breakdown: The spring of 2014 saw the Confidence Meter shoot up from about 75 to 96. Near the end of the year, the stock traded up from about $65 to $80. When the Confidence Meter fell from about 90 to 75 in January of 2016, Facebook stock followed suit by simultaneously falling from about $104 to $94. The Stockal Confidence Meter is bullish on Facebook currently, and the stock is trading up over seven percent over the past month after a successful earnings report in July. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) The Chart: The Breakdown: In late 2014 the Confidence Meter on Google fell from around 90 to just under 80, and Google stock responded by falling from around $590 to $540. When the Confidence Meter rose from around 75 to just above 80 in late 2015, and the stock spiked from around $610 to $750. The Stockal Confidence Meter has been bullish on Google as of late, and the stock is up over 10 percent over the last three months.

The device, which launched 10 months ago, can be had for a discounted price that varies depending on the variant that is chosen. The 32GB WiFi-only iPad Pro can be had for $679, a $120 discount off the normal $799 price point, and is available in Space Gray, Gold, and Silver. Additionally the 128GB WiFi-only model can be had in the same three colors for $809, a $140 discount. As for cellular offerings, the 128GB variant is going for $919, down $160 from the normal price point. There are a handful of benefits to buying from Apple’s official online refurbished store versus other third-party retailers. For one, all products include a 1-year warranty through Apple and all products are tested and certified by Apple prior to being sold. It’s worth noting that we are 10 months into the life cycle of the 12-inch iPad Pro and Apple will more than likely release a new model this fall. We’ve also seen deeper discounts, albeit from resellers, on the iPad Pro. To be 100 percent up-to-date with all of the iPad Pro deals, keep your eyes on 9to5Toys. Nevertheless, if you like play it safe and only buy from Apple, now is the time to do it. Products sold in the refurbished online store are in limited supply, however, and could sellout very quickly. Apple does refresh availability on a regular basis, though. If you’ve been thinking about buying an iPad Pro, head over to Apple’s refurb store to see the discounts. Read Zac’s full iPad Pro review here, as well as his Apple Pencil review.

Samsung is mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and sells its handsets exclusively to hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to Olympic venues - but Apple is tempting some of them outside with its own unofficial Games merchandise. It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands. Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media. The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word "Olympics", which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colours, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week. "While they don't appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing," said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the US Olympic Committee. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment on the bands, which are selling for 296 reais ($92.80) each - and only from the US tech giant's store in Barra de Tijuca. Another top Olympics sponsor, Swatch Group's Omega, which makes an Olympic watch and is Games timekeeper, showed no concern. Omega president Raynald Aeschlimann said that unlike his firm, Apple could not talk about its Olympics history. Apple is also not permitted to display its limited-edition bands alongside the Olympics logo, or any other obvious Games symbol, but that has not stopped some Apple fans from doing so. US sprinter Trayvon Bromell has tweeted a photo of himself wearing the USA-themed band of red, white and blue on the same arm as his Olympic rings tattoo. Defending decathlon champion Ashton Eaton has also shared a photo of himself on Twitter wearing the band. Top Olympic sponsors can pay about $100 million over four years to the International Olympic Committee for exclusive marketing rights to the Games, and they keep a close watch for any guerilla marketing during the event by their rivals. So far, Apple is in the clear. "As long as they do not use the Olympic logo, the Rio 2016 logo or our look, there is no infringement," said Sylmara Multini, director of licensing and retail for the Rio 2016 organising committee. Athletes can also fall foul of Olympic rules if they market a non-official sponsor's products during the Games - but not if they do it well before the event. Bromell shared his photo of the Apple band and his Olympic tattoo on July 21, six days before the blackout period began. Apple is not promoting the new bands directly - many buyers say they are reading about them on blogs - but at least one customer says he regards the band as Olympics merchandising. Nelson Imana, a visiting sports fan from Chicago, bought two bands on the way to watch Olympic volleyball. He said they reminded him of the kind of exclusive merchandise sold at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. "If you see somebody with Masters gear, they'll ask you about it because you can only buy it there," Imana said. "So if they see this band, they'll say OK, you've probably been to Rio and the Olympics."

A filing by the iPhone maker in early August describes, in essence, a page from Samsung’s playbook: edge-side controls for a device with a curved screen a la Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7. The phone depicted isn’t identical to the Note 7 or any other curved-screen handset on the market, granted. According to the patent, its screen — a single panel that theoretically stretches from the phone’s left-hand side to its right and bends around its bezels — would feature a thin demarcating line between its flat and curved surfaces. The separation would be achieved artificially “by one of three means: patterned” glass, printed or painted masking material, or “selectively [activated] and [deactivated] display pixels” — i.e., portions of the screen that would dim as needed. Related: Victory is fleeting: Judge voids patent troll’s $626 million victory against Apple Apple sees those screens around the margins as ripe for control scheme potential. They might contain “virtual buttons” or “virtual switches” which could trigger or control “lenses, haptic feedback … audio … or other components” when pressed. The document goes on to describe a gesture-based system of control — tapping or sliding across the edge could bring up video or music playback controls, for instance, or a truncated display settings menu. If any of that sounds familiar, that’s because it’s reminiscent of the curve-centric software that ships on the Galaxy S7 Edge. Apps Edge, Task Edge, and People Edge, and lets you assign shortcuts to applications, functions, and contacts that permanently inhabit the display’s curved bezels. Information stream, meanwhile, relegates at-a-glance feeds like missed calls, messages, news headlines, and Facebook status updates to the handset’s curved screen. It lights up when someone calls or texts — you can associate colors with certain contacts — and third-party tools extend it further (one, coincidentally, allows you to control music playback from S7 edge’s side-facing screen). Related: Apple patent could force you to put down your iPhone at “sensitive events” Patents aren’t always great predictors of future products. Apple’s “magic” glove system has yet to make an on-stage debut, as does its ultrasonic Touch ID sensor. But that’s not to say a curved-edge iPhone display with killer accompanying software features will never see the light of day. Patently Apple notes that the patent has been revised “three times in 15 months,” suggesting internal development is ongoing, and the company filed a design concept for a handset with a flexible, wraparound, bezel-free display earlier this year. It’s not out of the question that a future iPhone may sport a few of the aforementioned features described. But Samsung, no doubt, would have something to say about it.

One unlucky man described how he was singled out by an expert hacker after having his phone stolen from a car through a broken window. Joonas Kiminki immediately logged his phone as lost and asked the Find My Phone app to send him an email if it was found. The iPhone user later received an email saying his iPhone had been found and asking him to follow an email link to log in to his iCloud account to view its location. Kiminki was almost caught by the elaborate scam, but cleverly noticed the URL led to show-iphone-location.com, and not a legitimate Apple address. He believes the thieves who stole his phone found his name through Medical ID and used it to reverse-engineer his email address — a smart trick used by hackers to gain access to people’s personal details. If the scammers had gained access to his ID and password, they could have marked the iPhone as found, unblocked the handset, wiped it and sold it as a fully functional device. Writing on Medium, Kiminki warns: “If you ever lose your iPhone, iPad or iPod, be extra alert for upcoming identity theft attempts. “This is what Google.com and Apple should’ve told me 12 days ago when I searched for what to do. “The scam was so professional with perfect English and mobile responsive web pages that I consider myself lucky not to have given away my password.” Kiminki’s tale comes after a fresh batch of iTunes scams were sent to customers across the globe. Customers were sent a fake invoice charging $30 for a song and urging them to log in to their iCloud accounts to cancel the purchase. Official Apple invoices do not contain this link, but the scam email takes customers to a fraudulent web page. A statement on the technology firm’s website addresses the scam: “The iTunes Store will never ask you to provide personal information or sensitive account information (such as passwords or credit card numbers) via email. “Email messages that contain attachments or links to non-Apple websites are from sources other than Apple, although they may appear to be from the iTunes Store. “Most often, these attachments are malicious and should not be opened. “You should never enter your Apple account information on any non-Apple website.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy This article originally appeared on The Sun.

Taking to the stage at its "Hello Again" event in Cupertino, Tim Cook and chums announced a completely new MacBook Pro, simply called the MacBook Pro.  This new model for 2016 brings in a whole range of changes, sweeping the 2015 MacBook Pro model aside. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Pro. Apple MacBook Pro (2016): Thinner, brighter, faster, and very touchy feely Apple MacBook Pro (2016) preview: Air apparent MacBook Pro (2016): Design Apple has announced a brand new design for its MacBook Pro family of devices, coming in 13 and 15-inch models. The new MacBook Pro (2016) evolves the unibody design of the previous MacBook Pro, sticking to the compact form factor, but reducing in size once again. It will be available in silver or grey. The new 13-inch MacBook Pro measures 14.9 x 304.1 x 212.4mm and weighs 1.37kg. The new 15-inch MacBook Pro measures 15.5 x 349.3 x 240.7mm and weighs 1.83kg. The reduction in volume as lead to a complete redesign for the internals, with a new cooling system to move air through the body and exhaust out the back. The display is as thin as the little 12-inch MacBook, while the Force Touch trackpad increases in size. However, the biggest changes are the stripping out of all the ports and replacing them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. The second biggest change is the inclusion of a new OLED Touch Bar, sitting in the space where the Fn keys used to sit. Unfortunately, to muddy the waters a little, the entry-level device is slightly lesser-specced, so although it sits in the same design, it only has two ports and no Touch Bar. This is the basic breakdown of new MacBook Pro models: 13-inch MacBook Pro, two Thunderbolt 3 ports 13-inch MacBook Pro, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch Bar 15-inch MacBook Pro, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, touch Bar Pocket-lint MacBook Pro (2016): Touch Bar The Touch Bar is the real talking point of the new MacBook Pro, and likely to be the feature that sells this new design to a wide number of people. The Touch Bar replaces the Fn keys and is a second Retina display. This OLED panel supports up to 10-points of touch and is full colour, designed to change its options depending on what you're doing on your Mac. It will offer things like volume sliders, shortcuts in your browser, text predictions when typing and tools when using more advanced programs. For example, Apple demonstrated how Photoshop tools would appear on Touch Bar, how Microsoft Word tools could appear on the Touch Bar and how basic system controls could appear there too. There can also be a full emoji bar on Touch Bar, making it really easy to respond to messages with minimal fuss. The Touch Bar will also incorporate the power button, which also integrates Touch ID, with a secure chip in the MacBook Pro, meaning you can touch to make payments. Apple Touch Bar: What can I do with it and what apps are supported?

Slate Sign In Sign Up ASU | NEW AMERICA | SLATE Learn more about Future Tense » Slate Future Tense The Citizen's Guide to the Future Aug. 9 2016 5:02 PM Apple Has a New “Bug Bounty” Program. It Could Be a Game-Changer. By Josephine Wolff   You don’t have to hide to be an Apple hacker, but you do need to be good at what you do. cyano66/Thinkstock Apple’s announcement that it would launch a bug bounty program to pay hackers who identify security vulnerabilities in their products was one of the big stories coming out of the annual Black Hat conference in Las Vegas last week. The decision shows that Apple is finally catching up with the rest of the tech world by adopting a practice that many of its peers and competitors—including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Samsung—have been using for years to reward non-employees who report security flaws. But Apple’s new program is no mere imitation of their competitors’. Rather, it’s a significant and striking departure from the standard model in which companies offer anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand to anyone who finds any vulnerability that the company deems sufficiently important. Instead, Apple plans to offer much larger rewards, with bounties of up to $200,000 for certain types of vulnerabilities. (Compare that to Google, where bounties top out at $20,000, or Microsoft, where the maximum reward for finding a single vulnerability is $100,000.) Advertisement But the high payouts mark only one way that Apple has altered the traditional calculus of bug bounties. Even more significant is the company’s decision to limit the program to a select number of individuals and five specific targeted categories of vulnerabilities. Rather than throwing open its program to anyone with an aptitude for bug hunting and security exploits, Apple will invite only a few dozen researchers to participate at the program’s outset, though others may still submit vulnerabilities to the company in hopes of being invited to join. This model is even more exclusive than the approach taken by the Department of Defense when it piloted its Hack the Pentagon program earlier this year for nongovernment employees to win money for finding vulnerabilities in public DoD webpages. The DoD allowed anyone who was a U.S. citizen or resident and was not on a terrorism or criminal watchlist to register for the bug-finding competition, but they then had to undergo a background check before they were cleared to participate. Apple, by contrast, will go out and identify the people it believes will have the most to offer the company. Besides narrowing the field of potential participants, Apple has also scoped out very specific types of vulnerabilities it’s interested in. And they are for hackers with very precise expertise: The $200,000 bounties will be only for vulnerabilities in Apple’s secure boot firmware, the mechanisms that protect against the downloading of untrusted software and thereby prevent jailbreaking (among other things). Apple will also offer bounties of up to $100,000 for exploits that successfully extract information protected by the Secure Enclave Processor, and smaller rewards (up to $50,000) to people who find ways of accessing iCloud used account data stored by Apple or of executing code that can control the operating system’s core functions, or kernel. Finally, participants who find a way to circumvent the “sandboxes” Apple uses to isolate processes (so that someone with access to one app on your phone, for instance, does not have access to all the data stored by every other app on your phone) will be eligible for rewards of up to $25,000. So if words like secure boot, Secure Enclave Processor, kernel, and sandboxing don’t mean anything to you, well, you’re probably not about to be invited to compete for $200,000 rewards. But what’s worth noting here is not so much the particulars of which vulnerabilities Apple is and is not interested in, rather it’s the specificity with which they’ve pinpointed the security issues they care about and are willing to shell out for. Compare that to how Google describes the types of vulnerabilities that qualify for its bug bounty program: “Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program.” Or Microsoft’s explanation of what qualifies for its maximum $100,000 bounties: “truly novel exploitation techniques against protections built into the latest version of our operating system.” Apple is targeting the people it wants, telling them exactly which vulnerabilities it’s interested in finding, and promising them five- or six-figure payouts for their trouble. This isn’t a bug bounty program for amateurs or hobbyists looking to flex their security skills and earn a little spare cash; it’s a program for Apple to cultivate a small, dedicated corps of hand-selected experts who can potentially support themselves quite comfortably by finding a few high-value vulnerabilities for the company. All bug bounty programs have a certain element of recruiting to them in that they introduce companies to new security talent, but Apple essentially seeks to hire non-employees to work on its most pressing security problems. Apple will hand-pick these people, just as it does employees, it will tell them what security vulnerabilities to look for, just as it does employees, and it will pay them sums of money that, at least in some cases, will probably be on par with full-time employee salaries. The difference being that the security researchers will still retain their independence to work on other projects and escape some of the confines of corporate culture, company reorganizations, and performance reviews. That could turn out to be a very attractive offer for smart people who like to break things and like to be their own bosses but don’t like meetings—and there are a number of very talented security researchers who fit that description. Apple’s bug bounty program could transform the model that many companies have relied on, replacing the open-door, all-bugs-matter and all-security-researchers-are-welcome philosophy with a more focused, exclusive, and lucrative approach. That would mean that instead of sending off lots of checks for $500 or $1,000 to hackers who find small bugs that can be used to crash a program or exploit obscure applications, companies increasingly tailor their programs to provide larger rewards for those who find a smaller number of high-value vulnerabilities that target the heart of their systems’ security protections. This model has the disadvantage of potentially discouraging newer, untested hackers, who are not yet established experts and may not be up to the challenge of finding the vulnerabilities in the most highly secured segments of a company’s software, but could be spurred on in acquiring those skills by the occasional $1,000 reward. It’s important that there be intellectually and financially rewarding challenges for those people to cut their teeth on as they hone their skills—and wait for their invitations from Apple to vie for the $200,000 prize.

Apple Releases Fourth iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra Public Betas, Update Now GO iOS 10, macOS 10.12, watchOS 3 & tvOS 10 Beta 5 out for devs Aug 9, 2016 21:03 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  This was unexpected, but it looks like Apple is almost finished with the development cycle of the upcoming iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 Sierra operating systems, and it has just released the fourth Public Betas to public beta testers. The Public Beta 4 builds of iOS 10 and macOS Sierra are here, just a few hours after Apple seeded the fifth Betas of iOS 10, macOS 10.12 Sierra, watchOS 3, tvOS 10, and Xcode 8 to developers enrolled in its Apple Developer program. We said it was unexpected because we don't even remember the last time Apple released a Public Beta a few hours after a Developer Beta, so this can only mean that work on the upcoming operating system is almost over. Of course, this doesn't mean that these are the last Betas to be made available to public beta testers and developers. There might be just one more before the final releases of iOS 10, macOS 10.12 Sierra, watchOS 10, and tvOS 10 hit the streets. Final iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 releases coming this fall When do they hit the streets? Well, that's a very good question, but no one can answer it because Apple never reveals the release schedule of its development cycles. However, considering that they are about to unleash some new iPhone and Apple Watch devices next month, that's when they'll also introduce these new OSes. So expect to see the final iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, and tvOS 10 releases this fall, most probably in the first or second week of September 2016. They will be available for all supported devices, so we recommend that you update yours as soon as it's out. As for this new Public Beta, you can now update your devices. #iOS 10 Public Beta 4#macOS Sierra Public Beta 4#macOS 10.12 Public Beta 4#Apple#iPhone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Seeds Fifth Betas of iOS 10, macOS Sierra, tvOS 10, and watchOS 3 to Devs Apple Investigated over iPhone 6s Price Fixing in Russia How the New iPhone 7 Dual-Camera System Could Work Apple Watch 2 to Launch in September with GPS, Bigger Battery iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    iOS 10 Public Beta 4 released new ios apps NeuroNation: Train your brain to improve your memory and focus with NeuroNation Flipagram: Create cool videos by mixing up your photos with music Timer+: Set up dozens of timers and control them all with ease Nutshell Camera: Create some pretty cool videos with Nutshell Camera IKEA Catalogue: Check out the IKEA Catalogue for more than just furniture Complete: Complete puts a social twist to your regular to-do list/ task manager WebMD Baby: WebMD Baby offers help in how to best tend to your baby Reader comments Load old comments   Apple Seeds Beta 3 of iOS 10.2, macOS 10.12.2 and tvOS 10.1, Videos App Removed - Updated more on: iOS 10.2 Beta 3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The AtlanticAugust 9, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share In the rapidly growing world of self-driving vehicles, Google is a clear leader. And Chris Urmson has been the human face of the company’s Self-Driving Car Project since it launched back in 2009. So it’s big news that Urmson is leaving Google, a move he announced over the weekend in a blog post. It’s also, so far, a big mystery as to what that means—for Urmson, for Google, and for any of its competitors. The biggest question is: Was he poached? Uber, famously greedy for autonomous-car talent, has recently announced several expansions to its own self-driving car ambitions—including testing driverless vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, and a new mapping effort in Mexico. Uber also has a track record of scooping up Google’s best. It hired the software designer Brian McClendon, previously one of Google’s most high-profile executives, to head its maps division last year. Recommended: Trump's Second Amendment Comment Cannot Be Excused Urmson makes it seem like his next plans are uncertain: “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky.” But Silicon Valley’s tech giants are famously secretive, especially in the realm of driverless cars. It wouldn’t be shocking, for instance, if Urmson wound up at Apple. What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen. Little is known about Apple’s work on self-driving cars, though reports of mysterious middle-of-the-night work makes it sound like a Willy Wonka-run shop. The company has been ultra-cagey about discussing its ambitions for autonomous driving, though public records—including a patent filing revealed this week—offer some clues. “There is a joke in the Bay Area that if you know somebody in the vehicle space and they left their old job but they haven’t updated their LinkedIn, they must be at Apple,” Chris Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University, told me last fall. And there are other clues that Apple continues to ramp up its efforts on autonomous driving, like recently reassigning one of its most influential executives, Bob Mansfield, so that he can focus on the project, according to The Wall Street Journal. Then again, as one roboticist pointed out to me, many tech companies try to prevent people from company-hopping this way. “He likely has a non-compete clause for at least one (but probably more) years,” Missy Cummings, the head roboticist at Duke told me in an email. “I bet he pops up in a related field like drones or some other robotic field.” Recommended: The Audacious Plan to Save This Man’s Life by Transplanting His Head Adding more intrigue to Urmson’s departure are reports that he isn’t the only one leaving Google. John Markoff, writing for The New York Times, characterizes Urmson as “the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project.” Markoff also points out that the staffing changes come after Google hired John Krafcik, who was previously a chief executive at Hyundai America, to lead the car project as it spins out as its own company under the larger umbrella of Google’s new(ish) company, Alphabet. So maybe this is just one of those moments where a company is changing enough to prompt some of its big names to move on. That’s not unheard of—and Urmson did write that he is “ready for a fresh challenge”—but his departure still raises questions about how the Self-Driving Car Project will fare without him. Several people who have either worked directly with Urmson, or closely followed his work at Google, declined to speculate on what’s next, but underscored how important his contributions to Google have been. “His departure is certainly a loss for the project,” Mark Bergen and Johanna Bhuiyan wrote for Recode. “Urmson was the main engineer who built the code running Google’s autonomous software, according to one person who worked with the team.” Urmson didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment on Monday. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands,” he wrote in his blog post. “There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they’ve chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people.” What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen.

While Apple’s release notes for iOS 10 beta 5 (build number “14A5335b”) mention no new features as we inch closer to a Gold Master, there are a few tidbits and tweaks to wet your appetite. Aside from other changes, for instance, iOS 10 beta packs in a new lock sound and lets you download apps from the App Store after a reboot without needing to re-authorize Touch ID purchase with your Apple ID password. Video hands-on: iOS 10 beta 5 My colleague Andrew O’Hara has put together a video walkthrough of everything new in iOS 10 beta 5, which runs four minutes and fifteen seconds long. If you don’t see the embedded clip, watch it on YouTube. Don’t forget to subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube on your way out to ensure you remain in the loop with the latest in Apple news, jailbreaking, reviews and how-tos. Here’s a running list of what’s new in iOS 10 beta 5. New Lock sound With the Lock Sound switch in Settings → Sound set to the ON position, you will hear an all-new sound when locking an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10 beta 5. I’ve embedded a short YouTube clip below so that you can get a feel for it. Kinda reminds me of the sound of a door closing. Plus, existing keyboard clicks are definitely louder than in the previous beta, which is nice because those new clicking sounds were too quiet. Downloading apps after a reboot with Touch ID Normally, when an iPhone or iPad is set up with Touch ID, a passcode is required to unlock the device after a reboot, and you must also confirm your Apple ID password to re-authorize buying apps with Touch ID. iOS 10 beta 5 seems to have gained the ability to download apps from the App Store after a reboot with Touch ID authorization—without needing to re-authorize yourself with your Apple ID password. This goes for both free and paid downloads. Digital Touch splash screen In the fifth beta, taking the Digital Touch interface within Messages full screen now pulls up a splash screen explaining the different gestures for sending animated kisses, heartbeats, heartbreaks and fireballs, in addition to sketching and tapping. I could be wrong, but none of the previous betas put up that screen when tapping the full screen button in the lower right corner of the Digital Touch interface. RELATED: iOS 10 Messages does apps, stickers, animations, effects & more You can dismiss the info screen by tapping the “x” in the upper left corner, but the splash screen would re-appear for me every time I took Digital Touch full screen. Tweaked AirPlay audio icons A feature for switching audio output inside Music, within Control Center and elsewhere in iOS now uses an updated visual style and device icons. Previously, sending audio from an app to a speaker, a Bluetooth headset, an AirPlay device or your iPhone required tapping an icon resembling stylized headphones. Updated device and audio output icons in Control Center and Music. In iOS 10 beta 5, a new audio output icon is used within Music and Control Center—it kinda looks like an AirDrop icon with a solid black triangle at the bottom. Widgets from apps have dark background The new widgets panel in iOS 10, which you can access to by swiping from left to right in the Notification Center or on the Lock screen, now distinguishes visually between Apple’s stock widgets and those from third-party apps. Stock widgets have light background, at left. In iOS 10 beta 5, a darker background is used for widgets from third-party apps. As you can see for yourself, in the fifth beta widgets from apps have a dark background while Apple’s stock widgets retain their light background. Speaking of widgets, the widgets panel in iOS 10 beta 5 now displays the date on all devices. Tidbits Photos on iOS 10 beta 5 needs to re-process any facial recognition data carried over from a previous, which will also reset all your people names and merged face data. Go to Photos → Albums → People and you’ll see a message saying that your iPhone must be locked and connected to power for Photos to re-scan the library so that its facial and scene recognition algorithm can re-process the images. Note that no data about your photos leaves your device, thanks to Apple’s use of a novel Differential Privacy technique that allows Photos to take advantage of the underlying hardware to process objects, faces and scenes directly on the device. In the fifth beta, the Home section has been removed from Settings on the iPhone (it’s still available on the iPad). As you know, iOS 10 lets you remove stock apps from the Home screen. In iOS 10 beta 5, third-party apps are now able to play back music even if the stock Music app has been removed from a user’s device. In Messages, photo thumbnails should no longer draw with incorrect zoom, which resulted in gray padding surrounding images. People who use Bluetooth Low Energy-based hearing aids with their iPhone that is also connected to an Apple Watch should no longer hear occasional audio dropouts or skips. Next, Pass update banners will no longer fail to show unless previous pass notifications are first cleared from the Notification Center. After enabling speaker during a call in the Phone app, subsequent calls will no longer use speaker by default. Speaking of Phone, iOS 10 be 5 also fixes UI issues when making back-to-back Emergency CS 911 calls as the dealer interface no longer displays “911 calling” instead of “911 Emergency call-calling”. Release nots mention that the fifth beta now works as intended with Apple’s Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. “Devices will no longer panic when using iPhone 6s Smart Battery Case,” according to Apple. iOS 10 beta 5 also fixed a bug that prevented setting up an Apple TV using a Tap to Setup feature on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. “You should be able to proceed beyond the Network Connected screen,” as per release notes. While testing In-App Purchases in the App Store sandbox, the first authentication dialog should no longer appear twice. And last but not least, new content is available in the Swift Playgrounds app on iPad, including Learn to Code Part 2. iDB previews iOS 10 We’ve explored other aspects of iOS 10 in rich detail: Beta 5 changes Beta 4 changes Beta 3 changes Beta 2 changes Messages with animated effects, stickers, apps & more Overhauled Lock screen with Raise to Wake, widgets, rich alerts & more Siri meets apps & powers smarter QuickType keyboard suggestions Bedtime and Wake alarm help keeping you well rested For other hands-ons, see our previews of macOS Sierra, watchOS 3 and tvOS 10. iOS 10 availability iOS 10 Developer Preview is available to members of the Apple Developer Program. iOS 10 Public Beta is available to non-developers who are signed on the Apple Beta Software Program.

Sagar Rana Apple release iOS 10 Public Beta 4 too @iDownloadBlog Chindavon Nice. Downloading it now. Sagar Rana Hope you will enjoy 😉 @Chindavon [RECON1] Seems like the third-party Widgets have the darker background, but the stock ones aren’t. I think it would be better if it was all the same. ericesque I’ve read elsewhere that the dark background is for apps where widgets haven’t been updated for iOS 10. Makes sense since developers would have designed those widgets to look right on iOS 9’s dark widget screen. ConduciveMammal I wonder why my phone needs to be locked in order for Faces to be processed Henrik Frey Maybe because of the processing power it needs to recognize Faces. Christian Zibreg Because it takes a very long time if you have lots of photos and is processor and battery intensive. Makes sense when you think about it as otherwise people would complain about iOS 10 battery life. Similar to how iCloud backups occur automatically only when iPhone is on Wi-Fi and connected to power. ConduciveMammal Ahh yeah, I see what you mean there. Although surely a simple warning message that those might occur would suffice? Liam J. Kowalski People are stupid sometimes and don’t read warning messages while clicking them away. Or they forget about it some week after. You would need to show that message every time which isn’t really Apple-like. CaptainHappy I should think it’s very processor intensive for a phone/tablet (Google use data centres to do similar tasks), so would probably have an impact on the user experience , introduce lag, etc.. as well as battery life. Safer just to impose these criteria and avoid all the grief that will go with it. dklebedev Because the design is a mess. Files get downloaded scanned and then removed. It reaps both battery and performance. Wish Apple would use iCloud if it’s enabled. Ben Gareffa I can confirm that the Digital Touch splash page is not new in this beta. It was present for me in Public Beta 3 (last weeks release). Christian Zibreg Yes, but was it present every time you took Digital Touch full screen? It used to be a one-time thing. Ben Gareffa Oh, you’re right. I don’t believe it was persistent like that before. I wonder why they would make it that way… edwilk55 Public beta is out Matthew Are these betas stable enough now to use on my daily driver? I have been holding off… Y2J I used dev betas 1-3 as my daily driver and even those were pretty stable with minimal issues. Christian Zibreg Definitely stable.. Ben Gareffa You may notice some slowdown and a bit of an increased battery hit, but they’re quite stable at this point. /’S they get better in terms of speed and battery usage with every update. ConduciveMammal I’ve been using it since the first PB and rarely have issues, never any major issues. Only a few glitches here and there. CaptainHappy Since beta 4 arrived with the new animation tweaks it’s felt like the best iOS ever, so much ‘snappier’ now! You get the odd stutters in framerate when using the multitasking view and some 3rd party apps crash. I’d say that’s it really – if you depend on a lot of 3rd party apps, hold off but if you’re mostly using the built in Apple apps or only a few 3rd party apps you’re good to go. dklebedev Looks pretty good from up here. Sony I’ve been using it since the first developer beta. I had problems only in the first beta, but right now beta 5 feels stable and i use all different kind of apps (Whatsapp, Snapchat, Facebook, Games etc). The only problem is that my phone isn’t running as smoothly as ios 9, which is normal. Shafittey They missed one changes that i know in iOS 10 beta 5. When you put the lightning port in your phone it will warn you if there is any liquid and so to get rid of the warning from your phone screen you have to ignore it twice.but now it has changed as easy as turning off your iPhone. In iOS 10 Beta 5 you can get rid of the warning by sliding the X at the bottom of the warning just like turning your iPhone off. thank you Y2J That’s from the previous beta. Shafittey i didnt see that changes in the Beta 4 Matthew Does anyone know if these work with Good Technology work app? I need that functional for work…. daniel rivera Do you mean the red icon app used for mail? I use it in PB4 and it works fine Matthew Yeah the red one that says “Good”. CaptainHappy I’d say if you need your phone for work to hold off, probably only just over a month until full release now anyway… ΞLSVNATE The music app…………………. is really disappointing. I thought after 5 betas it would get better but… still sucks. Music is really a big deal for me in terms of sticking with Apple. WHY are “Songs” sorted by artist and not alphabetically? we have an Artist tab for that…. the overall design is terrible. I wish they would have at least kept the color schemes the changed based off of the album cover art that is playing… Change it back!!!!!!!!!!!!! and While they’re updating this Music app and switching Music Videos On/Off between the Video App and Music App……….. Can the Video App get a much needed overhaul? Marlon Criss You can choose to sort songs by Title(which means alphabetically), or by Artist(which means artists alphabetically). Been that way since iPods. Don’t like the service use one of the many other streaming options. Steven Rogers Do you happen to know if you can change it back to the list view with small icons like in ios 9 rather than having big huge square album icons? The design is absolutely atrocious. czbird This design is something some of us were waiting for for years 🙂 dklebedev Do you actually scroll through the list? Y no use search? Owen Is the 5 star rating system still missing from the beta music app? This is by far my biggest annoyance with the uodate. CaptainHappy Dude, it’s not the answer to all your problems but… Settings > Music > Sort Songs and Albums > By Title That will arrange songs alphabetically. Andrieux Querido Sierra Public beta 4 is out too. Andrieux Querido Sierra public 4 saiu tbem Duraid Abdul Digital Touch splash screen was here since beta 4… MrSolo816 Will IOS 10 beta and the current watch os play nice together? I don’t want to update the watch cause you can’t go back… DT I had nothing but problems with Public Betas 1-3 and watchOS 2.2.2 with it not syncing anything. Can’t confirm on PB4 yet. 5723alex . My iOS beta 1-4 work flawlessly with Apple Watch 2.2.2 Devin Rajaram Is it just me or the brightness is no longer as bright as iOS 9.3 or lower. And the lowest brightness is really hard to see. It happened on Beta 4 and still present in 5 ChrisLinke Check your accessibility settings -> Display accomodations -> Reduce White Point. I’ve had this switched on to try and save battery (whether or not it does is a different matter). You could be right and I haven’t noticed the dimming because I’m using this setting anyway, but play with this first. drurichman whet, not wet— something to whet your appetite: stimulate, excite, arouse, rouse, kindle, trigger, spark, quicken, stir, inspire, animate, waken, fuel, fire, activate, tempt, galvanize. (sorry, don’t mean to be a Grammar Nazi) Brett Kessner ios tiger… it’s like iphone the 2005 imac edition…. yuck Jason Brain I think apple is using the minecraft wood sound for the lock sound Sony exactly what i thought lol zebonaut the lock sound should be a bit louder; and more metallic and strong Gabriel Lodi You guys from iDB have terrible taste for music. iFlasher No. You have a different taste for music than iDB guys. Mark Idk if this was done in previous betas but I noticed if you have your screen on and you turn your phone upside down, it turns the screen off Mark Also noticed they fixed the quick reply bug they had in beta 4 Alim I’m in the beta testing program, and I was only notified of iOS 10 beta 4 today. I wonder if that’s because of the regional I’m in. Luizo Val Digital touch screen I saw it since beta 3 public Hendo27 So the video finally comes out. There were many videos out before this one with more new features. Why was the IDB bar lowered when Jeff left????? Yazdan Khazeni Has anyone installed this beta on air2? I installed and it’s awful 😐 zebonaut How so? Yazdan Khazeni Some hangs in safari And dock has bugs that I can’t explain it. I just need to show it and I can’t anymore because I’m on 9.3.3 now. ticky13 I noticed after installing the new public beta this morning, my available storage space increased significantly. Can anyone else confirm if this is me related or beta related?! Thelumpster Messages has several different tones depending on what letter/punctuation/delete button you hit… It’s driving me crazy!

Foxconn is not developing a “glass” chassis. If anything, Foxconn is working on reliable methods of producing what Apple has developed and ordered; Foxcon is working on getting to acceptable yields. “Apple is expected to redesign the iPhone, including giving it a glass chassis,” Wu reports. “‘Foxconn has been trying glass chassis since last year,’ a person with knowledge of the Apple supply chain in Taiwan said. Foxconn is now a key iPhone assembler and a key metal casing supplier for the U.S. company.” “Whether Foxconn will eventually become a glass casing supplier for Apple remains to be seen,” Wu reports. “The Nikkei Asian Review reported in May that Catcher Chairman Allen Horng said there would only be one iPhone model to use a glass chassis next year, the first official confirmation of Apple’s new design.” “Apple killed off a premium iPhone 7 model in the second quarter, less than six months before its official launch in September, according to a source. Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched, the source said,” Wu reports. “‘This never happened before. Before this year, Apple never made changes to iPhone’s product line mere months before the launch. It has been a volatile year for Apple,’ a source said.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: Glass? As in bulk metallic glass (Liquidmetal) or “glass” as in iPhone 4/4s? The timeframe would be right for Liquidmetal and the difficulty of preparation for producing acceptable yields would as well (Gorilla Glass-backed iPhone production has long since been been perfected ). I estimate that Apple will likely spend on the order of $300 million to $500 million — and three to five years — to mature the technology before it can used in large scale. — Dr. Atakan Peker, one of the Caltech researchers who invented Liquidmetal, May 2012 As for the single lens “iPhone 7 Plus” being ditched, as we just asked yesterday, “Our only question is, if these rumors are true, who’s going to buy the iPhone Plus? The pricing of the next-gen iPhone, especially if there are three variants, is going to be crucial for Apple to get right.” If these rumors are true, obviously Apple asked themselves the same question and had no satisfactory answer.

(Once trading at $20 a share, LQMT now trades in a range of $0.06 – $0.40 a share. Today it is at $0.15. Since all Apple’s research into LQMT gets shared back with the company for free use in any other product on earth except Consumer Electronics (for which Apple has a complete, perpetual, already paid-for license), if Apple can make this mass-producible Liquidmetal is going to become premium big time! yojimbo007 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 4:05 pm · Reply I truly dislike these rumors..specially when threy are spread righ before the launch of the new iphone. It feels like they are designed to take attention and excitement away from the upcoming iphones. That said.. I cant wait for either a blue or space black iphone7 plus …. Spark Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:09 pm · Reply I think someone should check the translation. This article is weird. 1283merridale Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 7:06 pm · Reply Like Cinderella’s glass slipper, and Samsung’s Galaxy S7/S7 Edge glass backs, glass has a tendency to shatter when dropped (see the drop test videos of the Galaxy S7 on YouTube). Apple learned its lesson with the glass back on the iPhone 4/4S, which had many people complaining about how breakable it was, and how often the glass back needed replacing. This rumour of a glass bodied iPhone 8 is “iPhoney”. cgmpowers Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 8:51 pm · Reply I for one am extremely over “breakable and fragile” iPhones. I don’t care how “strong” this glass is, its glass and its prone to chips and shattering… I don’t want a fragile phone, I wand a sturdy device that doesn’t need an otterbox to protect it.

However it is heard that Apple has been approaching innovativeness even though they started off with totally different concepts from design, function, and performance perspective from the start. Industries believe that Apple is focusing on securing creative battery technology that will only exist in Apple’s self-driving vehicles.” “This Korean battery developer, which is comprised of 20 or so employees who are expert technologists in batteries, holds international patented technologies for hollow batteries,” The Electronic Times reports. “These batteries are cylindrical lithium-ion secondary batteries that have thickness of 2 fingers and they are different from other batteries that their centers are hollow.” “Apple did not choose standardized circular or rectangular batteries that are widely used for current electric vehicles, but it is planning to develop its own independent batteries for electric vehicles based on this Korean company’s hollow battery technology,” The Electronic Times reports. “‘Because we made a NDA with Apple, we cannot discuss any information regarding this project.’ said a high-ranking official from this Korean company.” Read more in the full article here. MacDailyNews Take: “These batteries are cylindrical lithium-ion secondary batteries that have thickness of 2 fingers and they are different from other batteries that their centers are hollow.” Interesting. This reminds us that, in April 2014, Apple was granted a Liquidmetal-related patent for “counter-gravity casting of hollow shapes.” Apple’s patent application abstract: “The embodiments described herein relate to methods and apparatus for counter-gravity formation of [Bulk Metallic Glass] BMG-containing hollow parts. In one embodiment, the BMG-containing hollow parts may be formed by first feeding a molten metal alloy in a counter-gravity direction into a mold cavity to deposit the molten metal alloy on a surface of the mold cavity and then solidifying the deposited molten metal alloy.” Patent illustration from US 8701742 B2: Counter-gravity casting of hollow shapes – Apple Inc., Crucible Intellectual Property, LLC SEE ALSO: This battery breakthrough could change the world – July 12, 2016 Professor behind Liquidmorphium Turing Phone invests in Liquidmetal, named to Board, enters into cross-licensing agreement – March 14, 2016 The Turing Phone is not made out of Liquidmetal – July 15, 2015 Why does Apple keep extending their partnership with Liquidmetal? – June 25, 2015 Apple extends Liquidmetal exclusivity deal through February 2016 – June 23, 2015 Two new Liquidmetal patent filings from Apple revealed; list watch and jewelry among potential uses – April 23, 2015 Apple’s biggest revelation this week: Those revolutionary terraced batteries – March 13, 2015 Liquidmetal’s Apple alliance yet to bear fruit – September 30, 2014 Apple’s new Liquidmetal-related patent sparks speculation – July 7, 2014 Apple patents method for embedding sapphire displays in LiquidMetal device chassis – May 27, 2014 Liquidmetal-Visser agreement paves the way for more rapid adoption of amorphous metal manufacturing – May 21, 2014 Apple extends Liquidmetal exclusivity deal through February 2015 – May 21, 2014 Apple granted Liquidmetal patent for hollow structures in possible future product designs – April 23, 2014 [Thanks to MacDailyNews Readers “Fred Mertz” and “Dan K.” for the heads up.] Categories: News Tags: amorphous metal alloys, Apple Car, Apple patent applications, Apple Watch, bulk metallic glass, Crucible Intellectual Property, DongGuan EONTEC Co., EONTEC, iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, iWatch, Liquidmetal, Liquidmetal technologies, liquidmorphium, Lugee Li, Protect Titan, South Korea, Turing Phone, Turing Robotic Industries, U.S. SEC, USPTO Thank You for supporting MacDailyNews!

KingMel Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:41 pm · Reply Perhaps it is a flow battery with a liquid electrolyte. If so, the liquid could be quickly pumped out and replaced at an EV “fueling” station with similar utility to that of existing ICE-based vehicles. The liquid collected at the “fueling” station would be “recharged”/reprocessed for reuse, preferably using renewable sources of energy. Alternately, the liquid material could be recharged in the vehicle like a regular plug-in EV. I find the idea interesting… JimBob Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 8:28 pm · Reply Nice analysis. Would have to be something along those lines because having a hollow battery is otherwise absurd. Normally you are trying to maximize the density (and power density). alanaudio Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 3:08 am · Reply That sounds like an amazing concept. I’ve no idea how practical it might be and how safe the process would be, but it does sound like a tremendously exciting possibility. Having the dual ability to rapidly ‘re-fuel’ on the road or charge from the mains power overnight at home is a particularly compelling idea. At the moment, such things are only possible with hybrid cars, using two power sources. I do hope that you are right. This would be such a perfect solution for Apple. pete2015pete Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 6:57 pm · Reply The battery and the body of the car in one… Telstar Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 8:31 pm · Reply Well I guess it’s not a secret weapon anymore for Apple’s top secret car which I guess isn’t a top secret anymore either.

One-Time Card Numbers for an Era of Endless Breaches By Penny Crosman August 9, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 2 Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Can This Startup Restore Privacy in Payments and Turn a Profit? Collaborators Outnumber Would-Be Disruptors at Fintech Demo Event Countdown to the EMV Deadline: Who's Ready, Who's Not How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Apple Pay popularized the concept of tokenization — creating one-time codes for merchants to validate payment cards so consumers don't have to share sensitive, valuable account information. But Apple Pay works only in stores or apps right now. For consumers who remain rightly uneasy about typing their card information into a web browser, several startups are offering tokenization services. These fintechs are partnering with banks to obtain the real bank and card information that they obfuscate online. If adopted widely, tokenization could limit the risk of major data breaches. Malware trying to steal information from online shopping sessions wouldn't work and merchants like Target and Home Depot would not receive card data, let alone store it, so hackers would have to go elsewhere. Unfortunately, tokenization doesn't prevent the use of stolen card data, so hackers could target the tokenization providers themselves, given all the personal information they'll be storing. "Nothing is foolproof," said Steve Weisman, senior lecturer in law, taxation and financial planning at Bentley University and an attorney and privacy advocate. But "the theory is good. It's a matter of the practice." The effectiveness of the service would depend, in part, on the tokenization providers being better at security than merchants. "If these companies can maintain much better security — and security is not just a matter of hardware and software, it's also a matter of training employees so they don't fall for spearphishing and other kinds of attacks," then they have a good chance of success, Weisman said. They also need to be careful about protecting users, with features like two-factor authentication, he said. Meet the Startups The tagline of token (spelled with a small "t"), a company started by Zohar Steinberg and Yana Zaidiner, is "Let's make payment fraud a thing of the past." The founders, who are married (they met when they both worked at the billing company Amdocs), say their idea stemmed from a personal need. "Our credit cards were stolen a few times," Steinberg said. "Since we were entrepreneurs and security people, we wanted to build something for ourselves to begin with." They came up with a list of requirements for their technology: it had to be free, it had to be globally accepted by any merchant, and consumers had to be able to pay using any bank account, credit or debit card, bitcoins or cash. "We wanted it to be very user-friendly," Steinberg said. "You don't want to take it too far from the original experience." And of course, it had to be secure. Token's app generates a 16-digit number a customer can use online the same way she would a card number. It can also generate a fake yet usable cardholder name. The merchant and bank go through a cardlike authorization process; token works with both Visa and Mastercard. The startup gets a cut of the interchange fee its card issuer partners receive. In return, those card issuers, typically community and regional banks, can court consumers around the country who want to protect their card data, Steinberg said. Fraud protection "is going to be a consumer acquisition play," he said. To forge these bank partnerships, "We're knocking on every door, every window, and leveraging every connection and relationship we've built," Steinberg said. Useful bonds were forged at Startupbootcamp Fintech New York, an accelerator program whose mentors included bankers from around the world. Token is also talking to merchants. Abine is a little older than token. Its founders objected to the prolific use of personal data in advertising. "We looked at that and said, what's the counterpunch you can have? What kinds of controls does a regular consumer deserve over all these companies trying to learn as much as they can about us?" said Rob Shavell, Abine's CEO. "Our founding concept was, anyone should be able to control their personal data; that's why we call it personal, and the best way to do that is through tokenization." Consumers can download Abine's Blur software and use it to tokenize their email address, phone number or credit card number. Abine works with a bank partner to offer a new, one-time-use tokenized credit card, which is really a prepaid Mastercard for the purchase amount. (Consumers are charged a fee.) Consumer data is encrypted using a password only the user knows. "We can never access our customers' personal data. And even if we're hacked, hackers can't access our customers' data because we can't," Shavell said. "The downside of it is you have to remember your password." Shavell said the service has millions of users and all Mastercard-friendly merchants accept it. Abine is working with a couple of banks it cannot yet name, to integrate its technology into their mobile wallets, a way to let customers shop securely from a mobile phone. As the name implies, the founders of Privacy.com, a startup still in beta testing, are marketing their service as an alternative to legacy systems where oversharing is the default setting. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 2 Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION (2) Comments SEE MORE IN Bank Technology RELATED TAGS Comments (2) How on earth did tokenization become the benchmark for card number security, such that NEW platforms seek to implement it, instead of solving the CNP fraud problem properly?? Tokenization was introduced as a stop gap measure to inoculate numbers against theft. It was always imperfect and interim. The mobile platform had the opportunity to do card security properly, using hardware cryptography to sign transactions in EXACTLY the same way as EMV signs card-present transactions to stop replay attack and card theft. Tokenization was never of any intrinsic value in mobiles ... but here we are. See http://lockstep.com.au/blog/2014/03/26/uniform-approach-cnp And http://lockstep.com.au/blog/2012/04/01/kill-two-birds-with-one-chip We could have solved CNP fraud 10 years ago using smartcards online but now, an even better security platform is at hand, literally, with the smartphone and its Secure Element. We could sign every transaction in the app using hardware protected keys, imbuing all payments with the same tamper resistance that we get from merchant terminals. And we would be back to one payment ecosystem instead of this insane fragmentation into Apple, Android, Samsung, LoopPay etc etc. All these approaches have are "innovating" themselves into proprietary and non-interoperable sub-systems. Posted by Stephen Wilson Lockstep | Thursday, August 11 2016 at 4:38PM ET Two banks already offer tokenized, virtual credit card numbers for online purchases: Citibank and Bank of America. If Card-Not-Present fraud is truly a concern to the banks, why arent more of them offering this kind of service? You shouldnt have to go to some fintech startup to be able to use tokenized credit card numbers for online purchases. And as far as fraud still being possible if a (non-tokenized) credit card number is stolen and used online, the solution seems simple. I should be able to instruct my bank that any use of my (non-tokenized), real credit card number for online purchases should be rejected. So the bank should not authorize online transactions using my real credit card number in such cases. Only tokenized number should be authorized when making a purchase. My bank should be able to tell if a credit card number it receives for an online purchase is a tokenized number, or is the real number. Why arent more banks doing something like this? Are they truly interested in preventing CNP fraud? Or is it to hard to make such a change?? Posted by phobos | Wednesday, August 10 2016 at 3:57PM ET Add Your Comments: Not Registered?

Apple is once again being targeted for alleged price-fixing, this time in Russia. The country’s federal antitrust body has today opened a case and investigation into accusations that Apple and 16 resellers formed an agreement to fix prices of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. In a statement, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Services explained that the issue was first brought to light by a citizen. The citizen apparently informed Russian officials that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus carried the same price tag across 16 resellers, suggesting that Apple and the resellers had colluded to set such prices. “The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price-fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones,” the federal antitrust body said in a statement (via Reuters). Apple and the majority of the 16 accused resellers have not yet commented on the accusations. Euroset, Russia’s largest mobile phone retailer, however, denied the accusations that it had coordinated with Apple to set prices of the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. Apple hasn’t had the best relationship with partners in Russia throughout the iPhone’s lifetime, either. In 2012, Russian carrier MTS accused Apple of running a “dictatorship” when it came to selling the iPhone. “They’re more in a dictatorship mode where they say, ‘This is what you have to do or you don’t get the iPhone,’” MTS Vice President of Marketing Vasyl Latsanych said at the time. “Being arrogant with your partners in big markets doesn’t pay off.” Recently, however, it has been rumored that Apple is looking to open a central center for iOS device repair in Russia after accusations that the company does not adequately support customers in the country. In the United States, Apple was of course the target of a price-fixing scheme relating to the iBooks Store. The case accused Apple of working with publishers to artificially raise the price of ebooks. The settlement saw Apple pay out over $400 million. It’s currently unclear what kind of fines and punishment Apple could be facing in Russia if it is indeed found guilty of price-fixing. The company hasn’t yet commented on the accusations, though.

Apple has released iOS 10 beta 5 for developers to test on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. While Apple won’t release the operating system to the public until next month, the company is releasing regular betas to improve the software. In addition to iOS 10 beta 5, Apple has also pushed watchOS 3 beta 5 to developers. If you’re already testing iOS 10 beta on your iPhone or iPad, the update is available via the “Software Update” portion of the Settings app. If you plan to make beta 5 your first time with iOS, visit Apple’s developer page to install the beta profile. For non-developers, an updated beta will likely be made available via the Public Beta program within the next few days. iOS 10 brings a variety of new features and capabilities to iPhone and iPad users. The Music app has received a major overhaul, which we went hands-on with earlier this summer. Additionally, Control Center, Notification Center, and the Lock Screen have all been redesigned. Apple’s beta releases today come slightly off schedule. Usually, the company releases a new beta every 2 weeks, but this time around only a week has passed since the last release. At this point, we are nearing the release of the golden master version of iOS 10. View all of the changes that we saw in beta 4 below: Let us know in the comments or on Twitter, @9to5Mac, of any changes you discover in beta 5… New sound when locking your device (sounds kind of like a door closing) New output icon in Apple Music and throughout the rest of the interface such as Control Center (used to be headphones) Backgrounds for third-party widgets are darker You can now download an app with Touch ID after a reboot Guides iOS 10 iOS 10 is the latest operating system for Apple's iPhone and iPad, slated to be released to the public in the fall of 2016 View THe Guide watchOS 3 View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

If you pay attention to that sort of thing, you saw photos and videos of the device itself, as well as the oft-rumored Lightning EarPods, which are said to be replacing the standard 3.5mm EarPods later this year. And while I’ve already touched on why that potential reality, plus many other factors, has me on the edge regarding future upgrade plans, I want to specifically talk about the change in the 3.5mm headphone jack. Not too long ago, back before I realized that maybe I didn’t need, or really want, to upgrade to the iPhone 7, I didn’t care at all that people expected Apple to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack. After all, I use either wireless headphones, or I use the headphones that come in the box. And simple logic would dictate that Apple wouldn’t include headphones in the box that couldn’t directly connect to the phone they were sold with. My expectations started to waver a bit when those first rumors about an adapter started showing up. For those who missed them: It’s still being shot out into the wild that Apple will include a 3.5mm adapter in the box with the iPhone 7, along with 3.5mm EarPods — but still remove the 3.5mm headphone jack from the phone. So if these rumors are true —and they won’t go away!— that means Apple’s bold enough to remove this jack that’s been around for what feels like forever, but at the same time admit that it might be dumb they removed it by including an adapter for headphones meant for that old jack. The only saving grace here is that I don’t think Apple is that ridiculous. Is Apple ridiculous enough to create an adapter such as that? Yes, absolutely. It’ll probably retail for $30. And Apple will have the Lightning EarPods, too. But they’ll more than likely put the majority of their marketing power on truly wireless earbuds, something we’ve also heard spewed from the Rumor Mill quite often, too. But, ignoring all of that, and just assuming that logic should rule the day here, and Apple does include Lightning EarPods. So they’ll plug into the only port available, leaving no option for charging the device while you’re listening to music. This is something that has been brought up before, even by me, and that’s not really the point. The point here is that, if Apple is going this route — then the iPhone 7 needs to feature wireless charging. As I write this, I’m charging my iPhone and I’m listening to music with my headphones plugged in. There’s a potential future where I can’t do that, and that seems ridiculous to me. I don’t mind that they want to get rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack — I really don’t. It was always going to happen eventually, and technically Apple’s not even the first one to do it. Motorola beat them to it! So if we’re going to blame someone, it’d be them. (Sure, they probably did it because Apple-based rumors, but still.) It has been rumored before that the iPhone 7 will get wireless charging, but then they were quickly shot down by other rumors suggesting the iPhone 7 Plus will be the only new model that might feature it. And no, I don’t think Apple’s crazy enough to include an adapter with their new phones, I do think Apple’s crazy enough to make the iPhone 7 Plus feature wireless charging as one of its standout features compared to the iPhone 7. (It will also probably have a dual-camera, but apparently it needs more.) A scenario where Apple includes wireless charging with the larger model, and uses it as a major selling point, is a future that I can see becoming a reality. And then, next year, both models will feature wireless charging. The iPhone 7 needs wireless charging. Apple’s late to this game anyway, but if they’re going to remove one of the jacks, and force people to use only one, then I need wireless charging to make sure I don’t have to sacrifice listening to music or charging my phone.

The Tucson offers a standard five-inch color LCD display with rearview camera and touchscreen function for intuitive operation. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are also available along with Apple Siri® “Eyes Free” integration. On the navigation-equipped Tucson, popular apps such as Pandora® Internet Radio are already integrated with the multimedia system… The 2017 Sonata is available with many comfort and convenience features like our hands-free smart trunk, 8-inch navigation display, Apple CarPlay ™, Android Auto™, electronic parking brake, and Blue Link telematics system Support in the 2017 Sonata and Tucson models follows the release of an update for the 2016 Sonata in March and an update in May that brought CarPlay support to several 2015 and 2016 models. Currently supported via the update is the 2015 and 2016 Sonata and Genesis models, as well as the 2016 Elantra GT and Tucson models and 2017 Santa Fe and Santa Fe Sport models. The company’s 2017 Elantra was the first to support CarPlay stock, and Apple’s list of vehicles additionally includes the 2017 Hyundai IONIQ We previously showed you a tutorial for how to install the update in a 2015 Sonata and Hyundai started offering installations via dealers for a fee in June. For the 2017 Tucson, Hyundai says that Apple’s CarPlay (as well as Android Auto support) will only be available on “Limited” models. There will also a 315-watt, Infinity AM/FM/SiriusXM premium audio system upgrade option available. Hyundai hasn’t confirmed availability of the 2017 Sonata but says it will start at $21,600. The 2017 Tucson is already arriving at dealers starting at $22,700, but the Limited model with CarPlay starts at $29,775.

Most of the discussion of Photos focused on the huge number of changes from iPhoto and Aperture, burying one very important detail: Apple is changing the way it handles cloud-based photo storage. Before Photos, Apple offered free storage of photos with limitations in a feature called Photo Stream, which didn’t count against iCloud storage. But the new Photos app uses Apple’s beta iCloud Photo Library feature, which was recently added in iOS 8.1. iCloud Photo Library promises to let you synchronize your entire photo collection including edits and albums across all of your devices… but you have to share your iCloud storage with photos, and album syncing and edits don’t apply to the free 1,000 – 25,000 image storage of Photo Stream. As most long-time iOS users know, the free 5GB of iCloud storage Apple offers is often not enough to store much more than a single device backup, and for many that will mean no spare room for a photo collection. Consequently, Apple is suggesting that users should buy additional iCloud storage, paying monthly fees to store and sync their photos. As the Photos app is rolling out, Apple is allowing users to stick with the old Photo Stream feature and continue using the new Photos app without turning on the iCloud Photo Library. But it remains to be seen if that will be an option long-term once Photos is released publicly and how users will respond when they find out their free 5GB iCloud storage isn’t cutting it for their photo collection… Today, every iOS and Mac user gets a free iCloud account with 5GB of storage. The space currently holds device backups, your files in iCloud Drive, your iCloud Mail, and settings data from iCloud-enabled apps. If you use both iCloud backups and an iCloud mail account, there’s a good chance you have already seen an “iCloud storage limit reached” warning that you need to delete one or the other to make space. Your iCloud account will get more crowded when you enable the new iCloud Photo Library feature. When you move from just using Photo Stream, your stored photos will now count against your iCloud storage and appear in a new “All Photos” album, but they’ll also be accessible across all devices and iCloud.com. Photos taken with recent iPhones require around 2.5MB of space each, which means that just your last 1,000 photos from Photo Stream, for example, will consume around 2.5GB of your 5GB of iCloud storage. The number gets higher if you include photos taken with better cameras: each 22MP photo can easily require 6MB as a JPEG or 30MB as a RAW file. Do the math and even your last 1,000 photos (let alone your entire photo collection) won’t fit within that free 5GB of iCloud storage, assuming that it was empty. The new Photos app will prompt you to upgrade if your existing photos collection is too big for your current available storage when upgrading to iCloud Photo library. That’s why upgrading to the iCloud Photo Library might also mean upgrading to a paid iCloud plan with more storage. This will depend on the user, how large the image files are, and how much iCloud space is available. It will be interesting to see how many users will be forced to upgrade to paid iCloud storage in order to use the feature: Apple is selling 20GB for $12 per year, 200GB for $48 per year, 500GB for $120 per year, and 1TB for $240 per year, though it bills monthly and lists its prices by month rather than by year. For now, Apple is allowing users to stick with My Photo Stream and continue using the new Photos app. If you don’t upgrade, you’ll still see the “My Photo Stream” album in the new Photos app, and won’t get to take advantage of Apple’s new system of storing photos with improved syncing, the iCloud.com Photos app, and more. Apple also notes that you can disable iCloud Photo Library in order to recover iCloud storage and (again, for now) just use My Photo Stream. After doing so, iCloud will continue storing the photos for 30 days to give you an opportunity to download them. How long will Apple allow users to continue using the old My Photo Stream feature? Will it eventually require everyone to upgrade to iCloud Photo Library in order to sync photos using iCloud? The answers to these questions are still unclear, and we likely won’t find out until the new Photos app goes public this spring alongside iCloud Photo Library coming out of beta. It seems obvious, however, that something will need to be done to offset the loss of Photo Stream for iCloud users if that happens. Doubling free iCloud storage to 10GB would be a good first step, but with Yahoo offering 1TB of free Flickr space and Amazon offering free unlimited Cloud Photo service to Prime customers, Apple’s cloud photo strategy seems to be a step behind the times, rather than leading the pack.

Jon Ellinger - 2 years ago Reply As an avid photographer Photos for Mac is a huge step back. And the all-or-nothing approach Apple is taking to force people into cloud storage plans is insulting knowing the cash horde the company is sitting on. Yet again, more great software is being shut down to convert the entire OSX platform to mobile-quality. I’ll stick to my free 1TB Flickr account and am packing my media up for the move to Adobe which has been a long time coming. LikeLiked by 5 people PMZanetti - 2 years ago Reply Troll FUD garbage. Go away. This is the Photos app every Mac and iOS user needs. iPhoto is dead in the water, and Aperture is nothing but an imitation pro editing App. If you need pro editing beyond what Photos can do (not that you’d know the difference) there are amazing products out there….that have existed for a long time….and have always been better than anything Apple has offered.

LikeLiked by 1 person chasinvictoria - 2 years ago Reply So many ignorant assumptions in a single post, it’s hard to know where to start debunking. First of all, there’s no forced use of ANY cloud storage if you don’t want to use cloud storage. Want 100 percent locally stored on Mac? Okay. Want Photo Stream but not iCloud Photo Library? That’s fine too. Want the advantages of cloud backup and syncing to free up space on your device? Pretty cheap! It’s up to you. Next, Photos is clearly — at least at this point — a replacement for iPhotos, not Aperture. And as such, it is largely a big improvement (did I mention I’ve actually used it and you haven’t?). There are a few things I think people will actually want back, such as manual geotagging, and I expect they will be returned in due course (also see: iMovie, Final Cut, iWork for examples of features being returned after a rebuild, and that’s exactly what this is). Third, again as someone who has actually gotten to use Photos, the Mac version bears only surface resemblance to the iOS version. As with OS X generally, it borrows good ideas from iOS but is not the same thing as the iOS photos — which you’re probably using already right now, and not whining about. Fourth, I don’t see where Apple owes you a pro-level photo program, but as someone who loves both iPhoto and Aperture, neither one of them can truthfully be called “great” (and neither can Lightroom!). Iphoto is very buggy, in point of fact. Believe me I would love to see Photos gain third-party extension features as with iOS 8, and some Photoshop plug-ins be transferred over, but Apple’s not going to make a program for pros. I get that. So you can jump to Lightroom/Photoshop (which is pretty cheap these days, if you can deal with rental software) or some other organizer. There is no shortage of them, and I don’t see any reason why Apple would want compete (on the editing front) with Photoshop and Pixelmator. Finally, you will take note of the fact that while I criticize your wrongness about Photos, I offer nothing but encouragement if you want to go to Lightroom and use Flickr instead of iCloud Photo Library. That’s fine, sounds like a good idea (I’m already there, in fact, though I really don’t think much of Lightroom compared to Aperture). But don’t move out of ignorance, or a lack of understanding that Photos will add features and get better from this strong but start-over first glimpse (as does most Apple software). Do it because that’s the right thing for you do with your stuff. You can stick with Aperture or iPhoto for the foreseeable future — if you’re happy there, maybe you should consider waiting a year and see how things shake out instead of jumping to a bunch of wrong-headed, reactionary conclusions. To me, this is more an opportunity to take a fresh look at my photo workflow and see what options are rather than a moment where I feel like I have to pack up and move house. Just sayin’.

In fact, it is a replacement for iPhoto, Aperture had been discontinued. I have doubts that cloud storage is going to work for everyone. The majority of consumers who are going to use Photos app are not professionals, that don’t really spend much time sorting their photos, deleting duplicates and leaving only good shots. They tend to keep every photo they made. This basically means that they will run out of their free 5GB or even paid space (I doubt that $240 per year for 1TB is going to be a popular option) so quickly that this will not work for them.

I am a retired professional photographer and have been an Aperture user since the original beta. To this day it remains one of the finest, most fully featured professional photo editing tools available, especially if you add plug-ins like the NIK collection. I know of many world-class pros who still use it. My Aperture library is over 3TB in size. Try sticking that in iCloud! Photos is an excellent app… for novice and amateur photographers, especially the “selfie crowd.” It is vastly superior to iPhoto. For anyone who really knows photography and wants to do serious editing, it’s useless.

That is the one thing I think Apple really needs to do, allow Family Sharing to also combine any paid-for storage. 200GB would be plenty for most families, but as it is I’d have to buy a 200 GB plan for myself, and a 20GB plan for my wife… There are a few things I’ve read saying that turning on family sharing initially showed the other accounts paid for storage, but then it reverted. So I’m hopefully that Apple plans to have family sharing share data as we would all like… LikeLiked by 1 person Bruno Fernandes (@Linkb8) - 2 years ago Reply I’ve been proposing this for a while. Apple should be giving customers iCloud space to match the size of the iOS device they purchase and register. And 5GB with every Mac. Yes, giving, as in FREE.

Wait till the younger generation becomes the ones paying the bills and not wanting to keep a drawer of files like most of us 30’s and up people do. In 20 years, when more or less everything will be in the cloud, Apple won’t be nearly as strong if they’re cloud offerings are as weak as they are now. Drastically reduced iPad consumption is a clear indicator that Apple can’t sustain their hardware growth forever. If their mobile devices eventually peak and slide back down to a more manageable 10-15% market share like their computer line, they will no longer be the financial juggernaut they are now.

I am already paying for the amount of iCloud Storage I need, because I choose to do so for access to the features I want to use. I want to use iCloud Drive extensively, and now the long-awaited iCloud Photo Library. I want to use that. And do so, I have to pay Apple more money. That’s what I’m doing. So again…why would it benefit Apple to give away more storage? Are we talking about the same Apple? They are not in the habit of creating a viable revenue stream, and then just giving it away instead. Releasing Photos and completing the puzzle for iCloud photo storage/syncing is a MORE compelling reason for people to buy iCloud Storage. Not a more compelling reason for Apple to give it away. Cloud Storage should not be Free. Stick with local, and cable syncing, if you think cloud storage should be free.

Personally Icloud photo storage is flawed as you can only store one library, and currently I have 9 libraries totaling over 60,000 photos. When I went to doing this it was because Iphoto can only handle up to 20,000 before its speeds start to slow down, so Apple recommended doing this, instead. But after loading Yosemite, it became apparent that the cloud gets confused, it senses there are other photos in the libraries that aren’t open. [you can only have one library open at a time] And so it doesn’t know what to do and gets stopped and blocked up from proceeding, thus apple recommended to me to just turn off the photo part of Icloud which is what I have done. But what concerns me the most is what happens when and if I am forced by apple to only have storage in the cloud, will I lose all the work I have accomplished?

To this end it only holds 1000 photos at a time, and only keeps them in iCloud for thirty days so your other devices have time to download them locally before iCloud forgets them. And actually, if you use iCloud backups, iCloud Photo Library may actually help *free up* space. iCloud backups right now store the entire camera roll of any device being backed up. With Photo Library on, it no longer does this because all your photos are just in your iCloud Library to begin with, which also means any photos shared between different devices aren’t backed up twice.

They took Motion and, while adding enhancements, crammed it into what is essentially a one-monitor app in which you can no longer spread out your palettes. Using it now is like having your elbows strapped to your sided and you have to dig in order to do something that used to take a single click. I was also hugely PO’ed when FCPX came out – and not for its shortcomings but because Apple instantly killed distribution of the most recent upgrade to the previous version – all new old stock was instantly pulled from all distributors the same exact day and without one word or warning. I ended up switching to Premiere so I could keep moving forward while Apple fixed all the shortcomings in its new wonderkind. Another idiotic thing was when Apple intentionally dumbed down Keynote for the Mac so that it would not be more powerful than the mobile version(!). Frankly, I have found Keynote to be great for quickly knocking together great looking opening sequences for corporate videos. In order to keep doing this, I have to stick with the older version of Keynote. And then there is the Keynote Remote app, which I use for running presentations on my laptop. I have had no success in getting the Keynote app to connect.. It was stupid for Apple to simply kill Keynote Remote. It is a good thing I still have the Remote app because it simply works. Spotlight was another such item. Suddenly you’re having to turn off all kinds of stuff just so you can search for a simple filename (and even now, you have to stop every time and click on filename (which should be the default). In this one respect, Sherlock and before was far better. Why couldn’t Apple have retained that one feature? It used to be that folder states used to be automatically remembered but now, unless you stop and click on a box in the View menu for just about every new window you open, it will default to how your previous window was. This problem has existed for 15 years now and nothing has been done. I’ve also had to slow down with a lot of things. I used to he able to type a couple of characters and hit Tab when creating an email but now I have to wait a half a beat for Mail to fill in the name. What all of this boils down to for me is that Apple is so focused on coming up with sparkly new features that they are ignoring the basics. They don’t just add new cool features, they also throw away superior features This is because of their mega-corporation tunnel visioned, compartmentalized mindset. It is like they’ve turned everything over to a bunch of young geniuses who have tons of talent but not a drop of wisdom.

Android users have had a taste of the first generation, but Motorola’s new Moto 360 is one of the many new options available for both sides for the fence. The question is, should you give Motorola your money? If you’re not familiar with the first generation or Android Wear in general, you can check out our Moto 360 review here. This year Motorola has updated the internals to closely match the other smartwatch offerings on the market, but does it pack enough to win over the hearts of iPhone users? Like Apple, Motorola has two different sizes available for this year’s Moto 360. There’s a 42mm version which is the same as Apple’s largest offering and a slightly bigger 46mm version for those who prefer chunkier watches. Each model packs a 1.2GHz Snapdragon 400 quad-core processor, 4GB of storage, and 512MB of RAM. On the 42mm version there’s a 1.37-inch display with a 360×325 resolution, while the 46mm features a 1.56-inch display coming in at 360×330. In comparison, the 42mm Apple Watch’s 1.5-inch OLED display has a slightly higher pixel density with its 312×390 resolution. Both devices are water-resistant as well, which is definitely a must-have on any electronic device worn on your wrist. Activity tracking is available with heart rate sensors on each device and it’s safe to say you’ll get about a day’s worth of use on a full charge, though Motorola claims the Moto 360 will last up to 1.5 to 2 days depending on which size option you choose. Either way, expect to charge any of these watches at night. Check out our Moto 360 (2015) vs Apple Watch video below: Comparing the sizes, you’ll notice that the 46mm Moto 360 isn’t too much larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, but the difference is really present when worn on your wrist. I prefer the 42mm look of the Moto 360, but anything smaller than that would just look funny on my arm. When it comes to customization, the Moto 360 definitely wins. First off, it accepts any 22mm watch band with the new lugs that were added this time around, but with Apple you’ll need to stick to proprietary bands which can run you a bit of cash if you go with the official offerings. You can even take it a step further and completely customize the colors and variation of the Moto 360 using Moto Maker. For software customization, Apple may have the lead here. Both offer customized watch faces, but there’s a lot more to do (almost too much) with Apple’s watchOS interface than you’ll find on Android Wear. Android Wear’s simplicity may be seen as a positive aspect though depending on who you ask. You can also take phone calls and use Siri on the Apple Watch, while the Moto 360 will only respond to voice search and Google Now. With the Moto 360 your primary method of input is going to be the touch screen. Navigating through menus, apps, and more will all happen with a swipe of the finger, but you can use motion gestures with your wrist to flip through various notifications. On the Apple Watch, most navigation is done with the touch screen, but there’s also a Digital Crown on the side that will allow for scrolling and zoom in certain situations and a couple of buttons to perform various tasks, Unfortunately, the relocated button on the new Moto 360 will simply put the device to sleep when pressed, but again the entire story here is simplicity. If you’re only in need of notifications, it may be safer to stick with the Moto 360, but its $299 entry point for a base model may drive potential customers over to an Apple Watch for native support that starts at $349 for the Sport model. It’s nice to see Android Wear playing nicely with iOS, but there’s an obvious risk taken given that Google can only support so much without being able to tap into the full potential of iOS. At the end of the day, this choice comes down to personal preference, but if you’re aiming for simplicity it’s quite possible that you’ll be happy with the Moto 360 or any Android Wear offering that’s compatible with iOS. Which one do you prefer? Did Google’s latest Android Wear compatibility announcement change your mind about buying or keeping an Apple Watch? Obviously if you’re on Android, Apple Watch isn’t an option, but let us know what you think.

Unless you’re okay with giving up things like Siri, Apple Pay, AirPlay, text message integration, calendars, mail, etc., there’s no reason to invest in an Android Wear device. There’s no real incentive for Apple to make Android Wear more compatible or become more feature-rich than Apple Watch so whatever interaction/integration it has with iOS today likely won’t expand in the future.

Also, is that the 22mm band or the 16mm “women’s” option? If it’s the 22mm, I think the size of the watch would look “off” compared to the band in the women’s option. Right now, if I were considering a watch other than the Apple Watch, I’d probably have to go with the Gear S2, assuming that Samsung eventually makes it work with iOS. It’s the only one that is using the round shape for a purpose (the rotating bezel), rather than just to make it look the same shape as an analog watch. As for customization, aren’t there some third party bands for the Apple Watch now? Some of them have adapters for using 22mm bands.

And the decent looking metal one, the Pebble Time Steel, has a small screen. – Finally, all 3rd party smartwatches for iOS will have only basic functions. No Apple Pay. No answering phone calls. As well as other limitations with using certain apps. – And the price of the new metal watches are getting close to the cost of an Apple Watch Sport. * If I’m going to pay ~$350 for a 3rd party watch (a Gear S2 for instance), why not spend $50 more and get a fully functional Apple Watch Sport? LikeLiked by 1 person dharrison9 - 1 year ago Reply Without the two pictures and one video, it would be easy to read this article and assume the writer had neither and Apple Watch nor a Moto 360. And here’s where 9to5Mac doesn’t seem to understand the Apple News threat. The “article” I should have read above should be titled, “Can you live with a smartwatch that isn’t Apple Watch?” After all, we’re on an Apple fanboy-website, or, at least, a website that caters to Apple supporters and/or product owners. A much more interesting review could be made about how the integration of non-Apple smartwatches leaves whatever price difference between a basic Sport and the competition is the cost of being able to answer a call in the shower or reply to a text from your wrist. The part of the article devoted to how the Apple Watch can take advantage of Siri, dictation, answering phone calls, third party apps, Glances, etc., is reduced to two sentences: ” You can also take phone calls and use Siri on the Apple Watch, while the Moto 360 will only respond to voice search and Google Now.” and, “It’s nice to see Android Wear playing nicely with iOS, but there’s an obvious risk taken given that Google can only support so much without being able to tap into the full potential of iOS.” Immediately following the last quote comes, “At the end of the day, this choice comes down to personal preference […]”. Really? Does anyone at 9to5Mac think that the choice between using an Android Wear smartwatch and an Apple Watch comes down to personal preference? It doesn’t eventually come down to a question of function, extensibility, HealthKit, WiFi, Bluetooth, FaceTime…? Does skipping Force Touch all together make this article any more complete in describing how input methods vary from watch to Watch? And lest we forget mentioning any other additional features that come with watchOS 2.0, probably coming next week. The author forgot. I look at the tiny amount of problems I have with this article and think of the many more I could type up if I could be bothered. The revelation comes in the fact that someone (editor) at 9to5Mac decided that printing (posting) this article was a good idea, and either didn’t bother to read it, or didn’t care about the missing focus, content or information and put it out anyway. So, who is this article for? The core readership knows that the Apple Watch is really the only viable option for a wearable if your on iOS. The competition is on borrowed time, because it takes one security measure or API change to make their watches unable to display notifications. The competition will never gain access to Siri or deep tasks because of the nature of writing programs for iOS (i.e. background processes). They’ll never be able to reply to a text, action a notification from an Apple application, use Apple Pay with your watch or perform many other tasks that we haven’t even thought of yet with ANY Android Wear watch. It’s that simple. You can buy a glorified notifications display for your wrist that can break with any Apple update (which usually hits at least 80% of the install base within a few months), or you can get the Apple Watch. That’s the core readership and the basics of what they should know. If they don’t know these facts, then this article helps them in no way further understand these basics. Which begs the question again, who is this article for? It’s neither informative nor interesting enough to be worth publicizing the publication with, so it must be click-bait. And that’s where the advertising and blockers and tracking that 9to5Mac went in depth about previously has left a more lasting mark on this entire generation of web publications. This article will rank highly on Google, and is most certainly SEO-optimized, but of what real value is it? No offense to the author, but it tells me nothing that reading either company’s product PR page wouldn’t have told me. Nothing about your experience comes out in the article. In fact, I have found it impossible to find the word ‘I’ in the article above. When Apple News comes around, do you think pollution like this will survive the cut, jockeying for space next to articles from The Verge, WIRED, et al at the top of my ‘For You’ tab? It’s not just 9to5Mac, but Engadget and the rest. A post of spec sheet comparisons or apes of press releases from Apple and the rest (this means liveblogs, too) will fall to the wayside as the official sources become contributors, as well. It will be original editorial content, meaningful reviews and in-depth news analysis that will allow web publications to survive the end that print journalists are facing. Only, it will happen much faster in digital. So, anyway. Android Wear, Pebble, and any emerging competitors are all fundamentally flawed and will never be able to compete with the Apple Watch. It’s easy. If you buy a smartwatch, chances are, a friend of yours has one, too. When you meet and compare, there are three possibilities if you have an iPhone and a smartwatch that is not an Apple Watch. Your friend has an Android phone and an Android Wear watch. He shows you how powerful integration is and how much better the experience is when both OSes are created by the same company. Your friend has an iPhone and an Apple Watch. He shows you the very same thing: a much better experience when both OSes are created by the same company. He also shows you a relatively simple pricing structure and easy to find customization options for the Apple Watch. Or, finally, your friend has the same set up as yourself with an iPhone and an Android Wear watch. You confirm to each other how great it is, while lamenting that you don’t have the integration that comes with having both phone and watch OSes created by the same company. It becomes a really easy choice: Apple Watch if you have an iPhone, Android Wear if you have an Android phone. That’s my opinion, of course.

The reason was simple: put an SSD in your Mac instead of the old hard disk, and you’ll be blown away by the speed increases. But as several readers have noted, there is another way to add an SSD to your Mac: you can keep your old hard drive, and instead replace the Mac’s CD/DVD optical drive, also known as a SuperDrive. Swapping a SuperDrive for an SSD has a mix of pros and cons. It’s typically a little easier and less expensive to replace the SuperDrive than a stock hard drive, and you’ll always wind up with more internal storage than you started with. But you also lose CD/DVD reading and writing abilities — things fewer people care about these days — and you’ll need to set up your Mac to properly take advantage of the SSD. Read on for the details… Which Macs Have Swappable Optical Drives? If your Mac has a CD/DVD drive built in, there’s a very good chance that it can be swapped for an SSD. There are millions of Macs with optical drives, including iMacs sold prior to late 2012, Mac minis sold prior to mid 2011, and 15″ MacBook Pros sold prior to late 2013. Apple still sells non-Retina 13″ MacBook Pros with optical drives; this model hasn’t been updated with new hardware in a long time. (Techies will note that the most significant speed improvements will be seen on late 2008 or newer machines, as those Macs support faster SATA II or SATA III storage devices, including most SSDs. The SATA III standard Apple began to support in 2011 is backward-compatible, so an SSD with SATA III support will work in SATA II Macs, just at slower (but still noticeably better than typical hard drive) speeds.) What Does Swapping The Optical Drive For An SSD Get Me? Short answer: much faster speeds. Every Mac’s overall performance is weighed down by the computer’s slowest parts. Even if your CPU, graphics card, and other components are on par with current-generation Macs, your apps and files could be stored on a slow hard drive that takes a long time to load and save things you’re using. Putting an SSD inside your Mac, then moving OS X and your apps over to the SSD, can radically improve the Mac’s speed: it’s possible to get 4X to 5X improvements in OS X and app loading times, a difference you’ll notice every time you wake your Mac from sleep or switch apps. One extra benefit of choosing the optical drive for an SSD swap: unlike a hard drive to SSD swap, there’s no need to buy a special cable with a thermal sensor to install the SSD, since the Mac’s existing optical drive cable already has a thermal sensor attached. Unless you want to add a mounting kit, a sub-$20 part, all you need is the drive itself. What you’ll lose is the ability to read and write optical discs, which at one point was a big selling point of computers but has become less important over time. Some people buy Apple’s external $75 USB SuperDrive to keep around “just in case.” I personally haven’t used my optical drive in around two years, and consider any optical drive purely optional at this point. Which SSD Should I Buy? For most Macs, I’ve recommended Samsung’s 850 EVO drive (rated 4.7 out of 5 stars with nearly 4,000 reviews), the SSD I use and love, and readers have told me they love theirs, too. Samsung just introduced a 2TB version of the 850 EVO, which offers incredible storage capacity for an SSD with the same outstanding warranty and performance found in the 120GB, 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB versions. Personally, I opted for a 1TB 850 EVO before the 2TB version was released, and I’d recommend going for as much capacity as you feel comfortable buying. I feel a lot safer with my important photos and files on an SSD versus an aging mechanical drive. But if you’re going to have both the SSD and original hard drive in your Mac, you could pick a smaller SSD for OS X and your apps, keeping your music, photos, and videos on the old hard drive. Samsung also makes the 850 PRO, which has an even longer warranty and faster performance than the 850 EVO, if you’re willing to pay a premium for them. Image courtesy iFixit Swapping Your iMac’s Optical Drive The excellent DIY repair shop iFixit publishes iMac model-specific optical drive replacement guides for the 21.5″ iMac (late-2009, mid-2010, and mid-2011), 27″ iMac (late-2009, mid-2010, and mid-2011), and earlier 17″, 20″, and 24″ models that are about as far back as you should consider for possible SSD swaps. As each guide notes, the process of replacing an iMac’s SuperDrive with an SSD should take a confident and reasonably computer-savvy person less than an hour; if you don’t feel comfortable opening your own Mac, ask a friend. You’ll need two large suction cups to remove the iMac’s glass front, a T10 Torx screwdriver, and a spudger. If you’re opening a 27″ iMac, you’ll also need a thin and small but solid piece of metal to lift up the screen — iFixit recommends a common paperclip. I’ve gone through the iMac upgrading process before, and while there are a bunch of steps to follow, none is particularly difficult. iFixit’s guides walk you through all of the steps except one: placing the tiny SSD you buy within an adapter/caddy as large as the optical drive you’re replacing. Since the SSD is so small and light, some people skip the adapter and just uses pieces of double-sized tape to hold their SSDs in place. But if you’d like to use a mount to keep your SSD firmly within the old optical drive bay, you have a couple of options. This $9 Micro SATA Cables-branded adapter is inexpensive and praised for its fit in 27″ iMacs. Alternately, this $19 Nimitz hard drive caddy is designed to fit a variety of 2009-2011 iMacs. Pick the one you prefer. Swapping Your Mac mini’s Optical Drive Swapping parts inside recent Mac minis is, in a word, daunting. Although they’re super-simple from the outside, they’re the opposite of user-friendly when it comes to DIY repairs; iFixit’s guides correctly describe many upgrades to unibody (metal-topped) Mac minis as being “difficult.” This is the mid-2010 Mac mini guide, for which you’ll need a 2mm hex screwdriver, T6 and T8 Torx screwdrivers, a spudger, and a Mac mini Logic Board Removal Tool, plus hours of disassembly and reassembly time. Earlier Mac minis are easier to open, requiring a putty knife, Phillips #00 Screwdriver, and spudger. Later mid-2011 and 2012 unibody Mac minis lack optical drives, but can instead get upgraded with a $30 dual-hard drive kit that includes all the tools and parts you’ll need. If you’d like to use a mount to keep your SSD in place within the optical drive bay, this $19 Nimitz hard drive caddy is designed to fit 2009-2010 Mac minis. Alternately, this less expensive $9 Micro SATA Cables-branded adapter can be made to fit inside Mac minis, though you’ll only be able to use two screws to hold the drive — not a problem if your Mac’s going to stay in one place. Swapping Your MacBook’s or MacBook Pro’s Optical Drive MacBooks are probably the easiest Macs for optical drive to SSD swaps for a variety of reasons: they require the fewest tools (a Phillips #00 Screwdriver and a spudger) and the fewest steps, as well as fairly simple parts. You don’t have to remove major components such as a logic board or screen to access the optical drive. iFixit publishes separate guides for the 13″ unibody metal MacBook, non-Retina MacBook Pro 13″ (mid-2010, early 2011, late 2011, and mid-2012 to present day), the non-Retina MacBook Pro 15″, and MacBook Pro 17″, all of which involve little more than using one screwdriver, opening the bottom compartment, and disconnecting some connectors before reassembling the machine. To hold the new SSD in place within the former optical drive bay, this $9 BrainyTrade drive caddy works with the metal 13″ MacBook and pre-Retina, pre-2012 13″/15″/17″ MacBook Pros. What Do I Do Once The SSD Is Installed? If you’ve installed the SSD as a replacement for your optical drive, using the SSD is easy. Open OS X’s Disk Utility app (found in the Applications > Utilities folder or by typing Disk Utility under Spotlight search), and select the new drive. Erase the drive using Mac OS Extended (Journaled) formatting. Then, you can choose to either use the drive as a spare (assisting your prior hard drive with extra files), or turn it into your primary boot disk. There are two easy ways to turn your new SSD into a boot disk. One is to install a new copy of OS X on the drive, then install only the apps and files you want. You can do this by holding down Command (⌘) and R after restarting your Mac, choosing Reinstall OS X from the OS X Utilities list, and selecting the new SSD as the destination for OS X. This will give you a completely fresh start, though your emails, app settings, and other files will need to be separately hunted down and brought over from your other hard drive. The simpler option is to back up your Mac’s old hard drive to an external drive using Time Machine, then restore the backup to the new SSD. Follow the directions here. You may need to go to System Preferences > Startup Disk and select your new drive, or OS X may give you the choice to boot from it after the restoration is done. You should find that your emails, files, and apps have all been brought over intact. Just confirm that the SSD backup is working by using it for a day or three to make sure everything is where it should be. At that point, you can erase your old hard drive and use it for spare storage. More From This Author Check out more of my How-To guides, editorials and reviews for 9to5Mac here!

So I’ve been stuck with this “outdated” 2012 machine that I’ve been incrementally upgrading over the last 3 years. 2012 MacBook Pro 15 – i7 / Dedicated GPU – 32GB Memory – 512SSD + 2TB HDD (replacing the optical drive) As a photographer then I’ve been lusting over a Retina screen for years and actually just bought a Retina Macbook. But what did I get for my $1500? 2015 MacBook Pro 13 – i5 / Integrated Video – 8GB Memory – 256GB HDD Its just sad that Apple gave up on the Power User/Pro market. They kill Aperture. They rarely upgrade Hardware specs. And they release big MacBook Airs and try to pass them off as MacBook Pro’s. LikeLike Josh Lambert (@jml12286) - 1 year ago Reply A new 15″ retina i7 with 512GB ssd, dedicated video card and 16gb ram is $2500 I would say thats not too terribly bad compared to getting the base 2012 non retina pro for $1799 then adding a 512GB ssd, and more ram. Even the higher end model of 2012 was $2200 and didnt come standard with an ssd. Also consider that the Retinas now use a pcie based SSD and are faster than anything you can put in the 2012 or older. Better battery life, awesome display and thinner profile with usb3, full size hdmi and 2 thunderbolt ports. The only 2 things I could consider downsides of the newer retina compared to old pro are: 1. Not have 2 hard drives inside (though portables are cheap and slim now, also you can get slim SD card storage) 2. Not having more than 16gb ram LikeLiked by 1 person Oliver Guy - 1 year ago Reply How did you get 32gb of RAM into that? I have the same computer as you with the exception of replacing the optical drive and I have 16gb of RAM vs the 32. Apple said 8gb was max for that machine, but 16 was the actual limit. How? LikeLike kidonl - 1 year ago Reply I wonder if it’s not better to put the SSD where the old HDD was, and that HDD into the Superdrive spot. At least in my MBP (Late 2011), the link speed on the Superdrive seems to be a lower speed SATA than the HDD one. But I might be wrong as I’m not that into it, I just had someone tell me the Superdrive runs on lower speeds. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply There have been some very interesting discussions on this point, and it is indeed possible, though it can create a need for a thermal sensor-equipped cable for the SSD. The benefit in certain machines is a gain of SATA III speeds for the SSD versus SATA II, if the lines are at different speeds. Some people would be happy to pay the cost of the thermal sensor (and do the extra work to shift the SSD/HD locations) to get the extra speed. LikeLiked by 1 person Piotr Kleina - 1 year ago Hey, I’m just about to swap my HDD in MBP 13″ for an SSD and was wondering if I also need a thermal sensor-equipped cable?

Some fixes worked for some users, but some of us are/were plagues with random drive dismounts and other fun stuff. OWC covered it extensively in their blog. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply Their suggested remedy is basically to move the SATA II drive into the optical slot and put the SSD in the hard drive bay, the same solution as discussed in the @kidonl comment above. It’s a couple of extra steps but achieves the same purpose – improved storage capacity, improved speed. LikeLike Mickey Hancharenko - 1 year ago Reply There is also a SATA link speed negotiation bug with Macs containing the NVIDIA MCP79 Northbridge chipset. This includes the 2008 Aluminum MacBook and I also believe the 2009 Mac mini. If you install a SATA III (6Gb/s) SSD to replace the internal hard drive, link speed is negotiated at SATA I (1.5Gb/s) speeds and not at the full SATA II (3Gb/s) speed supported by the board. You MUST buy a SATA II SSD if you want the 3Gb/s link speed. OWC had a pretty nice write-up on this a while ago (I can’t find the link at the moment), but is still the reason why they still sell a SATA I/II SSD as well as their newer line of SATA III SSDs.

I’m just not sure if Boot Camp requires both OSes to be on the same hard drive. I’ve offloaded all of my important files and media onto a 3TB external, which has been partitioned to also hold Time Machine backups. My wife needs Windows for work, unfortunately, but I’ve been so invested in Apple for years, now, I don’t want to switch back. This could potentially give me the best of both worlds? LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply It doesn’t sound dumb at all. People have been trying to make this work (with some challenging workarounds) for a while. The short answer appears to be that you could install OS X on the SSD, and _both OS X and Windows_ on the HDD in order to use Boot Camp. Another possibility would be to avoid Boot Camp and just use Parallels, which offers great emulation of Windows apps (and even enables you to run Windows apps without leaving OS X).

I have replaced the processor with a 2.8GHz Core 2 Extreme X7900 and added 6GB of RAM and a 1TB WD Black. The SSD would be a nice upgrade. Even though most memory manufacturers claim this unit can only support 4GB of RAM, it does support a 6GB configuration with one 4GB and one 2GB PC2-5300 SODIMM. You’ll lose the slight boost in dual-channel mode, but if you’re hitting your 4GB cap, you’ll see better performance out of having the additional 2GB. LikeLike Jeremy Horwitz - 1 year ago Reply As a general statement, I’d say that if you have an old machine with SATA (particularly SATA II or III, but SATA is OK) that you want to keep using, an SSD has rapidly become the best bang-for-the-buck component you can install. I also wrote a guide on RAM upgrades (https://9to5mac.com/2015/03/04/how-to-boost-mac-speed-ram-upgrade/) which could help you out; 4GB of memory is pretty tight for running recent versions of OS X, so if you can jump to 6GB, that will help a bit. LikeLike Aaron W. (@awolAD) - 1 year ago Reply Making this upgrade is in fact surprisingly simple if you’re not afraid to take apart your Mac. And I was terrified, so that goes to show how simple it actually is so long as you follow the directions carefully. VERY IMPORTANT – I’ve skimmed the comments below, but couldn’t see if someone already posted this or not. For whatever reason on older machines, Apple nerfed the connections at a firmware level. The affected models are 2008/2009 MacBook/MacBook Pro 13″, 15″, and 17″ models. (Model IDs: MacBookPro5,1; 5,2; 5,3; 5,4; 5,5 and MacBook5,1; 6,1; 7,1). Also affected are iMac models 9,1; 10,1; and 11,1. If you’re going to install an SSD in a Mac that doesn’t already have a SATA III SuperDrive or HDD connection, you MUST use an SSD with a SATA II connection. If you rely on the “backwards compatibility” of SATA, you will actually only get speeds equivalent to SATA I.

The iMac in question is the model released in May 2011 with Sandy Bridge processors and Thunderbolt ports. This iMac was sold between that month and October 2012 when Apple launched thinner models with new internals. Apple says that AMD Radeon HD 6970M cards (both 1GB and 2GB configurations) in select versions of these 2011 iMacs could fail: Apple has determined that some AMD Radeon HD 6970M video cards used in 27-inch iMac computers with 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 or 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processors may fail, causing the computer’s display to appear distorted, white or blue with vertical lines, or to turn black. iMac computers with affected video cards were sold between May 2011 and October 2012. Apple says that the issue is connected solely to 27-inch models with 3.1GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 or 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processors. AppleCare, Genius Bars, and Apple Authorized Resellers have been given a series of steps to verify if a customer’s iMac exhibits the graphics card issues. The problems have been documented over the past couple of years on Apple’s own Support Forums. Above is a YouTube video demonstrating some of the noted issues. Additionally, the iMacs must fall in the following serial number configurations: The last four characters of the serial number must contain one of the following groups (for example, xxxxxxxxDHJQ): DHJQ, DHJW, DL8Q, DNGH, DNJ9, or DMW8 DPM1, DPM2, DPNV, DNY0, DRVP, DY6F, F610 If the iMac falls within one of the above the serial number categories and is confirmed to have the graphics card issues, Apple will replace the AMD card free of charge up to three years from the computer’s purchase date. Additionally, if an affected iMac user had their graphics card already replaced at cost, the customer is said to be eligible for a refund. This is not the first time that iMacs have seen component issues worthy of a replacement program. Late last year, Apple announced a replacement program for certain hard drive components in iMacs sold between 2009 and 2011. Guides iMac View THe Guide AAPL Company Breaking news from Cupertino.

They are then free to pair it with any other iPhone. iPhones are protected by Activation Lock, which means that even if a thief performs a hard reset of the phone, it cannot be reactivated without the original owner’s Apple ID and password. The Apple Watch, however, has no such protection, and does not require a passcode to wipe it – as shown in the video below …  Since Activation Lock was introduced in iOS 7 and turned on by default in iOS 8, there has been a dramatic reduction in iPhone thefts around the world, officials noting reductions of 25% in New York, 40% in San Francisco and 50% in London. The Apple Watch is theoretically protected by a passcode which has to be entered if the device is removed from your wrist, but an apparent bug allows a hard reset to be performed without it. A hard reset is carried out by a long-press of the Contacts button until a power-off option is offered. Force Touching this option brings up a dialogue offering to erase all contents and settings, which can be executed simply by placing the watch on the charger – no passcode required. I verified this with my own Apple Watch, and it works exactly as shown.

Milorad Ivović - 2 years ago Reply It’s not completely disappointing. At least the data integrity remains intact, so Watch apps like 1Password aren’t compromised. The physical device is more easily replaced than any havoc created (or data stolen) as a result of exposed passwords. So, it’s not great, but not a complete tragedy. LikeLike Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago Reply Hi, Milorad. You are absolutely correct that the device is easier to replace than the data that’s stolen; however, I believe most people would be more worried about their watch being seen as a ‘quick flip’ to criminals instead of a useless brick to criminals. That’s the difference between getting robbed, and mostly injured during the robbery, or the criminal passing you up and you going home without incident. It’s not the same as wearing a $500 mechanical watch. There’s a reason why, at least in my city, iPhones are more stolen than Samsungs. Both the Galaxy S5 and iPhone 5s were around the same retail price, but it’s something about Apple products that tickles criminals’ fancy more than Android. I see it first hand, my friend.

You are right that the data is the most important thing but we are talking about a programming mistake by Apple. It is very disapointing that something like this happens and it has to be fixed. Just because we do like Apple products we should be able to note when mistakes were made and expect Apple to have them fixed immediately. LikeLike Milorad Ivović - 2 years ago 1) You completely disagree, but I’m right about data being the most important thing. Okay. Sounds partial, but okay. 2) You called it disappointing. I also called it disappointing, just not completely disappointing. I also said it wasn’t great, but simply not a total tragedy. For you to completely disagree, you would surely feel as if it is indeed a complete tragedy. Do you? 3) When in flying figjam did I say it didn’t have to be fixed? Are you on crack? Just because we do like Apple products we should be able to note when mistakes were made and expect Apple to have them fixed immediately. 4) A little less knee-jerk evangelism from you would be great. How about you read my comment again, and this time try to remember that you’re not the only person on the internet, who isn’t a complete idiot. 4a) I never excused it. I simply put the matter in perspective. It’s a $400-$1000 liability, not a potential compromise of an entire corporate network (which it could be, if data could be stolen) 4b) I certainly did note it as a problem, or mistake… but it seems a bit retarded to emphasise that pedestrian little point, in an article which is ENTIRELY about it being a mistake. 4c) You can expect them to fix it immediately if you like. I live in a country with gun laws, and a $16 minimum wage, so street crime isn’t as big an issue for me, as it might be for you — that’s the nature of individual priorities. Yours differ to mine. That doesn’t make either of us wrong, in case you’re wondering. Now enjoy that self-righteous anti-fanboy posturing. Toodles. LikeLike friedmud1 - 2 years ago Reply This is a bummer. As someone wearing the Watch in a big city this has definitely been on my mind. My wife was concerned with me taking the subway late at night (which I do often) with the watch on.

I don’t think the Apple Watch itself is any more in demand by thieves who might steal watches, but combine it with this ability anonymously take it over for a new user, and it becomes very a interesting target. Thefts of smartphones dropped dramatically after wiping them became exponentially more difficult. I see this as an open window Apple must and will likely close soon.

I’ve never been mugged and I don’t plan on starting. It only takes a moment to stick my watch in my pocket before I start a 1AM journey home… so why not? People are making this all about the Apple Watch… when in reality it’s about basic self preservation when you live in a big city. I’m not worried about replacing my watch… I’m worried about being stabbed / shot / beaten while being mugged. These guys don’t ask politely for you to take off your watch! Do any of you people live in a big city? Phones were getting stolen all the time before the activation lock. The Watch is about the same value… why wouldn’t you think that it would be a target? Apple should have had activation lock built in from day one so thieves would never even have started to think about stealing them… Again: it’s not enough for me to be angry about or anything… I just think it’s a bummer and I’ll take steps to guard myself… LikeLike peteostro - 2 years ago friedmud1 says: “Yes.

Anyone with general knowledge of criminality knows that a phone or, in this case a smartwatch, that’s unusable if stolen doesn’t make an attractive target. This is the reason why iPhone thefts have dropped. If a criminal knows he or she can bypass the security to in fact use the Watch (or sell it more than likely), it makes the Watch an attractive target. It’s not just a matter of data being stolen or even just the Watch being stolen- it’s a matter of someone’s life being put in danger by a criminal that knows the Watch is worth something because its security can be bypassed.

I’m sure Apple will fix this.” What is wrong with you? You want Apple to stop muggings? There is no fix for this. A thief will target you if they think you are an easy target, whatever watch you wear. People need some intelligence before they comment on this topic. The most important issue is whether or not your data gets stolen. It does not. It would be nice for Apple to include a remote lock but it won’t stop people getting mugged.

The difficulty to get away with smartphone thefts was made difficult with provisions by the manufacturers, and thefts dropped. i.e. Thieves don’t target smartphones as much anymore. By the way, it wasn’t only Vertu phones that were being stolen – even lowly iPhones and Samsung devices. Your ‘Rolex’ comment is an entirely different topic and discussion. LikeLike Titanium Tate (@TitaniumTate) - 2 years ago You come across as a person who has no idea what happens in the real world and has no idea why people steal. Anything of value, especially something that can be flipped easily and quickly, is a target. There are not many people walking around the streets or riding in the subway with Rolexes on. There will be a lot of people with Apple Watches on. The common thief, in my city and I’m going to say any big city, is going to have an easier time flipping an Apple Watch than the rare Rolex they come across. Why? Because they can take that $400 Watch Sport and sell it to someone in their neighborhood or school for $100-150. That buyer will then sync it to their iPhone and use it before they get tired of it and then sell it. It’s about making a quick buck. The common criminal can not make a quick buck from stealing a Rolex, which again, is a rare find. I never said I want Apple to stop muggings, but if they instituted a fix it would certainly prevent some muggings of Apple Watches, as it did iPhones. You don’t comprehend well, do you? A thief will be less inclined to steal an iPhone or Apple Watch if they know that it’s a brick. This is a fact. You’re right, people do need intelligence before they comment on this topic. People like you, who seemingly live sheltered lives, are the ones who are the biggest targets and the people who say, “I didn’t think it would happen to me” after it happens to you. In what world do you live in where data is more important than your life or well-being? Again, you’re sheltered. I’d gladly give up my SSN, credit card, or my whole damn wallet and deal with the ‘data loss’ as soon as I can, instead of getting stabbed, shot, or even killed. And to the other guy who commented about the discord between watch-wearers and non-watch wearers. You may or may not have been directing your comment towards me, but I stopped wearing my collection of watches when I received my Watch Sport- probably because it’s new. I’ve been wearing watches since elementary school and am rarely seen without one. I’m well aware that any watch has some value to a thief.

By all accounts, that’s happened many times. If I’m standing by the doors and reading my iPad as they open, I turn my back to the open door and hold my device with two hands. Simple precautions are nothing more than common sense. Would I read an iPad on the subway at 1:00 am. No. But neither would I have earbuds in playing music at that time either, since I want to be totally aware of my surroundings. Would wearing a watch make that harder or easier? I doubt it. Are you more likely to be targeted? Only if you flash around your expensive item, which is dumb anywhere, let alone a safe city such as New York.

While the report shows estimates based on overall wearable shipments, which IDC says will go from 72.2 million last year to 100 million in 2016 for watch and wristband products, it also shows a breakdown of estimates for leading smartwatch platforms by operating system… That gives us a good look at the state of the smartwatch industry from the perspective of Apple Watch versus all of Android Wear and other mechanical smartwatch devices. IDC’s data shows that Apple should hold the lead in 2016 with an expected 14 million units shipped, over double the shipment estimate of 6.1 million Android Wear devices for this year. That would give Apple 49.4% of the smartwatch market this year versus 21.4% for Android Wear. That’s despite what IDC points out will likely be “some slowdown in the early part of 2016” for Apple ahead of a second generation device: Apple’s watchOS is likely to see some slowdown in the early part of 2016 as anticipation builds for the second generation device. However, with newer hardware and an evolving ecosystem, Apple will remain the smartwatch leader through the majority of the forecast. Apple is expected to launch new first-gen Apple Watch configurations at its March 21st press event next week that will consist of new colors and bands for the spring, but that will be considered a minor refresh for the first-generation device ahead of a full-fledged Apple Watch 2 expected for later this year. But going forward, IDC expects Apple will only slightly hold onto its lead as Android Wear closes the gap and almost entirely catches up to Apple Watch by the end of 2019. In 2020, IDC expects Apple Watch will sell 31 million units for 37.6% of the market while it estimates Android Wear to sell 28 million units and grab 35% market share. The rest of the market is made up of devices running Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), Tizen, Android, Linux, and Pebble OS, and IDC predicts only RTOS and Android devices to experience minor growth into 2020 as other operating systems drop.

Such a move is a big win for Google’s burgeoning cloud enterprise business. Past reports claim that Apple’s iCloud is powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Apple is reportedly paying Google between $400 million and $600 million for the deal. While Apple is not dropping Amazon entirely, they are presumably cutting back their dependence in order to save costs. Google is third in the enterprise cloud business, but recently hired former VMWare co-founder Dianne Greene to lead and grow their cloud business. The company has big plans to make have their cloud business more profitable than their current ads business within five years. Since her appointment, Greene has been “aggressively forming partnerships and swinging deals to bring in large enterprise customers,” the CRN report says. Google has at least one advantage compared to competitors due to its extensive fiber networks that connect their data centers and help lowers bandwidth costs. Just last month, Spotify also announced they will be using Google’s Cloud Platform to power their music backend. According to Amir Efrati of The Information, it will take a year for iCloud to be fully running on the Google Cloud Platform and it is unlikely to be very profitable for Google, as it was not for Amazon. However, it is a symbolic victory that shows Google is making headway into the enterprise cloud business. It’s true, @iCloud to be partially powered by @googlecloud. But will take a year & unlikely to be profitable. @awscloud lost $ from iCloud. — Amir Efrati (@amir) March 16, 2016 Guides Amazon View THe Guide Apple View THe Guide cloud View THe Guide http://thebestoftheinternets.wordpress.com thebestoftheinternets HA!

I’m willing to go thermonuclear war on this.” Now Apple is paying Google $400 million and $600 million for a deal to power iCloud? Is Apple surrendering on the installment plan?

Apple Looking to Develop a Curved Smartphone Apple are looking at developing an iPhone with a curved screen, similar to the Samsung Galaxy Edge. by Paul TamburroAug 9th, 2016 Image Credit: Nickolay Lamm  Apple is looking to develop a curved iPhone, with the tech giant apparently aiming to follow in the footsteps of Samsung’s Galaxy Edge devices. A patent filed by the company reveals that they are looking to develop a curved smartphone, with similar functionality to Samsung’s Edge devices. This isn’t the first time it’s been suggested that Apple is looking into developing a curved smartphone, with Business Korea claiming back in 2015 that the company were looking to produce devices with edged displays before the end of the decade. The Korean publication wrote: “According to an industry source, Apple is ‘serious’ about transferring its flagship product lineup to one equipped with organic light-emitting diode (OLED), screens as those displays can solve its existing weak points such as color saturation, accuracy, and brightness.” It now seems like these rumors could be correct, with a patent filed on April 21, 2015 by Apple making its way into the public domain. The patent describes “bent flexible displays” that “may be bent to form front side displays and edge displays,” which sounds similar to the Edge but also to the bendable smartphone technology we have been seeing more of as of late. Though bendable smartphones are still a long way off from becoming a mass consumer product, one such device with a graphene-based flexible frame is set to go on sale later this year in China, showing that the seemingly absurd tech may have some legs. Apple’s patent featured images highlighting the flexible screen, which you can view below: Tech companies file patents all the time, so it’s uncertain whether anything will actually come of this idea. However, they at least offer confirmation that Apple is looking at this technology, perhaps indicating that we could be seeing a curved iPhone sooner rather than later. With many feeling that the company’s declining sales are a result of a lack of innovation from them in recent years, perhaps the introduction of a curved screen could be exactly what Apple needs.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more…   skip to main content skip to main menu     Unencrypted iOS 10 kernel poses no risk to platform security or user data By Christian Zibreg, Aug 9, 2016 Tweet 6 Comments Apple’s unexpected decision to leave certain parts of the iOS 10 kernel unencrypted didn’t sit well with some privacy advocates over fears that the move could aid nefarious users to look for security weaknesses in the iOS software. But as it turns out, we now know that an unencrypted kernel allows iOS 10 to run faster: Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture, explained at the Black Hat security conference that the unencrypted iOS 10 kernel has absolutely no impact on platform security nor does it decrease security of encrypted user data. So, what’s a kernel? The kernel manages the system’s memory, communicates with peripherals and controls low-level services, hardware and security. It also contains any necessary low-level device drivers and hardware configuration files, but no user data. In presenting his segment, titled “Behind the Scenes of iOS Security”, Krstić pulled up a slide, which you can see right above, spelling out specific parts of iOS 10’s kernel that Apple’s engineers have left unencrypted. The following parts of iOS 10 are unencrypted: iBoot— iBoot is a boot loader than verifies and runs the iOS kernel Kernel caches—These caches do not contain any user data Boot logos—iOS boot logo images are no longer encrypted Krstić went on to say that the above changes are part of a wider set of performance optimizations in iOS 10 because encryption for these objects “was no longer adding a lot of value”. He underscored that iOS 10’s unencrypted kernel poses “no impact to platform security or encryption of user data”. iOS utilities so-called secure boot chain to ensure that each step of the startup process contains components that are cryptographically signed by Apple. This establishes the chain of trust by ensuring integrity of the bootloaders, kernel, kernel extensions and baseband firmware. “This secure boot chain helps ensure that the lowest levels of software are not tampered with and allows iOS to run only on validated Apple devices,” says Apple. Last Thursday, Apple announced an official bug-bounty program that will pay researchers cash for discovering vulnerabilities in its products. The firm is offering anywhere between $25,000 and $200,000 for an exploit, depending on where it is and what it does. News that the first beta of iOS 10 leaves parts of its kernel unencrypted left some people scratching their head. After the second beta arrived with even more unencrypted kernel segments, Apple went on the record to say that leaving the iOS 10 kernel unencrypted was a conscious choice. “The kernel cache doesn’t contain any user info, and by unencrypting it we’re able to optimize the operating system’s performance without compromising security,” said Apple. Prior iOS editions had a fully encrypted kernel. Source: Black Hat Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Has Apple gone mad? More iOS 10 parts left unencrypted in beta 2 Apple explains why iOS 10 kernel is unencrypted iOS 10 beta kernel is unencrypted, but why? iOS 10 found to store call logs for up to 4 months, Apple explains Related Topics Apple, Encryption, iOS, iOS 10, Privacy, Security Bugs Bunnay Well hey. Only time will tell. Rares Pfeww, I was afraid they will add encryption again when the beta stages are over. ExoticWaves So I have a couple of questions: 1) How does this affect performance? Does iOS 10 boot more quickly than iOS 9? 2) Given the new unencrypted surface: iBoot, Kernel caches, and Boot logs: are any of these used in Jailbreaks? Or do jailbreaks use other components of the kernel/OS? If the latter, then why do we think that un-encrypting these 3 portions of the OS would stop jailbreaks from taking place? rockdude094 Leaving a comment in case an answer pops up John Smith Well, usually a bootrom exploit is needed to look for potential bugs. When you have a bootrom exploit, you can look through kernal caches and boot logs to find anything that will allow you to get access to root. This definitely does have a connection with the FBI case. It benefits the FBI because they can find all the exploits they want, and it benefits the researchers as well, as they can start collecting a shit ton of bugs, and report them all to Apple for a reward. With all the possible bugs to discover, slowly the researchers will find everything that is already known by the FBI, and it would be patched by Apple in the end. It’s a loss in the beginning, but a complete win in the long run. ExoticWaves Don’t google and Microsoft have unencrypted kernels too? And don’t they also have bug bounty programs too? I heard that Apple was one of the last companies to the game in terms of adopting bug bounty procedures. If so, we already know that Windows/Android are exploitable, despite any bug bounty programs in place, so why would we expect iOS to have a different fate?   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines President-elect Trump promises tax incentives for Apple to build “Made in USA” iPhones Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017 KGI: iPhone 8 will have all glass casing to support wireless charging Nomad’s new Lightning cables cross durability with function   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Apple May Be Developing A Fitness Band By Adnan Farooqui on 08/09/2016 11:41 PST A new report out of Taiwan claims that Apple is developing a new health-tracking device that sounds a lot like a fitness band. The company already offers fitness and health-tracking features in the Apple Watch but by creating a standalone band it will be able to tap into the market that wants to have those features but doesn’t want to spend money on an expensive smartwatch. According to the report, Apple is going to unveil its fitness band next year alongside the 2017 iPhone. Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone and Apple is expected to go big with an overhauled iPhone. It may introduce this entirely new product as part of the 10th anniversary celebration of the iPhone. Apple is reportedly in talks with suppliers which include the likes of Foxconn for this product. It’s also claimed that the company’s 3D Touch technology is going to play a big role in this fitness band and that Apple has been working on the software for this device for nearly two years. There’s not much to go on at this point in time so it’s unclear what features this product will have and what it will look like. This is actually the first we’re hearing of a fitness band from Apple so take the news with a grain of salt until there’s more substantial evidence to support the claim. Filed in Apple >Gadgets.

 Apple is squeezing suppliers to keep its profits high, says analyst Kif Leswing Aug. 9, 2016, 2:49 PM 1,959 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple As iPhone sales fall, Apple is leaning on suppliers to keep its profits up.  Apple is squeezing its suppliers for lower prices, RBC Capital Markets analysts Amit Daryanani and Jeriel Ong claim in a research note distributed to clients on Tuesday.  They looked at 11 companies that sell their products and services to Apple, and found that 10 of those companies had projected that their gross margins would be lower than previous expectations for the second half of the year. Some of these companies assemble iPhones and other Apple computers, and others sell Apple chips and other components. The analysts looked at companies including TSMC, Catcher, Cirrus Logic, Dialog Semiconductor, and others.  "We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own profit and loss statement heading into the iPhone 7," the analysts write. This backs up a Asian trade publication report from earlier this month which suggested Apple was starting to drive a hard bargain.  For Apple, RBC analysts believe that this suggests that the company's gross margins could have some upside.  Apple's cash cow, the iPhone, has suffered two consecutive quarters of annual sales declines as Apple's revenue has shrunk during the same period. Apple's margins last quarter were down to 38% from 39% in the year-ago period. When Apple launches the newest iPhone in the next two months, it could return the product line to year-over-year growth, but the growth might be slight.  Still, RBC projects Apple will only sell 209 million iPhones in 2016, which would be down 10% over 2015.  CEO Tim Cook has blamed foreign exchange headwinds for Apple's disappointing year. "We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look," Cook said earlier this year. Given that CEO Tim Cook's background is in logistics and operations, it shouldn't be surprising that Apple drives a hard bargain with its suppliers.  RBC gives Apple stock an "outperform" rating.

Tuesday, August 9, 2016 · 1:44 pm · 37 Comments “That’s a trick question. Apple cares,” Bambi Brannan writes for Mac360. “But it’s 2016. It’s nearly five years after co-founder Steve Jobs died. So, Apple cares different.” “CEO Tim Cook’s Apple is not Steve Jobs’ Apple, and that’s a fact we have to get over,” Brannan writes. “Cook is an engineer. Jobs was an artist. That means we can expect Apple to act more like how an engineer would run the show vs. how the mercurial Jobs ran Apple.” “Right up front we can see that Apple cares differently about shareholders. We can argue all day about what Steve Jobs would have done with Apple’s tens of billions in riches, but it’s safe to safe stock buybacks and dividends were not high on his list,” Brannan writes. “If the average customer doesn’t care that much about a product line refresh, and the enterprise customer doesn’t care as much about massive leaps in new technology, then why should Apple care about those of us who bang the drums and cry to the heavens that Apple is doomed because some products are not refreshed as often as we prefer? Trick question again. Apple cares about us. But Apple doesn’t care about us as much as we want Apple to care about us.” Read more in the full article here.

Because of that, this creates a problem with product refreshing…. Ummmm, is this considered professional journalism when the writer just made a story based on the obvious and what everyone knows… Maybe I’m just being cranky since I don’t see a Mac Pro update yet…😦 Sorry for my rant. yojimbo007 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:36 pm · Reply professional (responsible) journalism…a thing of the past ! professional (manipulative) journalism … Status Quo. jambro Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:05 pm · Reply So we’re to accept no innovation, weak products, lower quality software and copy of competitors? Maybe if Cook spent less time on gay and social-political issues and focused more of his time on working at Apple, we may be at least get 1/50th of Steve Jobs. Rob Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:17 pm · Reply YEP!!!!! Jim R. Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:12 pm · Reply Hopefully Apple understands they screwed up the Mac Pro badly. They probably put a lot of R&D into developing it, designing it to be produced in the U.S., building assembly lines to make it, touting it as the next generation of professional computing. But ultimately it was a failure and I believe Apple knows this. Part of me hopes they were rushing back to the drawing boards over 2 years ago. I seriously hope for the future of Mac computing that they show something truly desirable in the next month or so, otherwise Hackintosh forever. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:16 pm · Reply They could easily still make the new such more upgradeable 2016-17 Mac Pro here, and in fact if they do it right it would be a much simpler & cheaper manufacturing process (and hopefully cheaper prices). Yes a Hackintosh or PC workstation the unfortunate alternative. In this case of a product you DO give the pro people what they are asking for – or risk user abandonment. Wun Dum Gai Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:30 pm · Reply I have two of the Mac Pro “Trash cans” and I love them. I’d prefer a mini-tower, but, these do just fine. BTW, it’s more or less the same price I paid for the original Mac Plus and way more powerful. -hh Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:19 pm · Reply Unfortunately, with the Trash Can configuration, the question on how good/bad of a value it is depends on one’s specific use case requirements. For me, I did a budget drill a year ago and found that the nMP vs cMP came out to roughly $7.5K vs $5.5 per seat … yes, that’s $2000 more per desk with the Trash Can…35% more expensive. This prompted a serious consideration to change over the workflows over to Windows, as the Windows hardware solution would similarly be around $5K instead of pushing $8K. The cornerstone software app to do this has already been purchased, and it is test piloting…. peterblood71 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:12 pm · Reply Hmmm, no Frank/Mac/Joe & the pre-pubescent types moronity spew first up here at this great opportunity to deride Apple and specifically Tim Cook?

I work with a lot of different Mechanical Design Engineers and they would feel the same way! thetheloniousmac Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:28 pm · Reply Ok. Tim comes from an Industrial Engineering background. “…Industrial engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value. According to the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, they figure out how to do things better, they engineer processes and systems that improve quality and productivity…” No one ever bad mouths Apple’s processes, systems, and productivity. That’s for sure. What if Tim is looking at all of OUR major processes, systems, and productivity from a level so high that those of us down here in the forrest of technology simply cannot see it? There are people who are concerned with the differences between 4th, 5th, and 6th generation intel core i7 processors and how that might effect their productivity on a daily basis, but are they not a minority? I personally don’t find a huge jump in productivity between 4th generation and 6th. So maybe, Tim, as an industrial engineer, isn’t looking at those people. He’s looking at the vast majority of technology users who are only interested in appliances, which is what Apple is building now. Apple is perhaps engineering appliances and matching services that not only meet the needs of the majority, but meet those needs more efficiently than the competition. From email to entertainment, Apple is refining products and services. I for one am already wondering how I lived without my desktop being everywhere since playing with macOS sierra. I’m beginning to care less and less how a computer works, and only that it does work. Perhaps pundits have vision that ends with counting the ports on both sides of the computer. They can’t see the forest, they can only see the tree in front of them, let alone see the forest from Tim’s view. Apple might just be 2 or 3 generations in thinking ahead of the punditry. They earned a big enough lead in mind share to take a risk and, enjoy their momentum, and prepare for the next decade. I think I get it. At the same time though, it doesn’t hurt to tweak your existing technology here and there, without years between “here” and “there.” Damn Razor 17″ Pro and Razor Blade laptops are like the dark side of the force calling. -hh Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:30 pm · Reply Industrial Engineering is all about making a manufacturing process more efficient, and Tim Cook does excel at that. However, the relative utility of an i5 vs i7 and core counts doesn’t really show up on that radar, except in terms of foundry yield rates, delivery schedule, parts binning and net unit costs. As such, the hardware innovation is mostly driven by others, and as we’ve already seen with Johnny Ive and “can’t innovate” But Schiller is that stylistic FORM is more important than function. That’s how we end up with unmaintainable boxes that are thermally limited, orphaned software lines, and arbitrary performance requirements that block improvements in products from shipping. Add to that how they’re allowing themselves to work outside of their core competences – – yes, the Mothership of All Trash Cans, as well as My Mother the Electric Car – – it is clear that they’ve lost vision. Herself Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:52 pm · Reply Maybe Apple seems “uncaring” or disdainful or distracted because they’re looking so very far down the road, and are transfixed by what they see there, and keep barreling along whilst blithely sideswiping any nearby traffic, creating roadkill left and right, and ignoring people frantically trying to flag them down! — Including certain people who were given to understand they’d be picked up; but now feel stood up, I sense that to Tim Cook’s way of thinking, in his expansive landscape of people and possibilities — to this man, jilting a relatively small group of users so strongly bound to Apple is, somehow, acceptable collateral damage. He may even know, and not “care,” that such an attitude can transform love into its opposite. thetheloniousmac Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:22 pm · Reply I hear you. But can any company ever remain completely true to their roots? Companies that last for a long time have to evolve right? We’re talking a company that could barely stay afloat while making computer and then they made a phone and became the biggest company in the world. (Depending on the day of the week). They addressed a need that a vast majority of people had, and it paid off big time. So does it not behoove them to keep moving in this direction? And you can’t just blame Tim Cook for this. I still say he is realizing the Steve Jobs vision.

Like I’ve posted before: Barefeats.com shows a 6 year old Mac Pro with slower subsystem and processors but with Upgraded Video card running a GPU intensive game Diablo 3 beating current macs by a wide margin . 2010 Mac Pro with Upgraded Card : 181 fps iMac 5k : 75 fps current cylinder Mac Pro D700 : 73 fps (lowest price with d700 is over $4500 !) Macbook Pro retina : 27 fps A NEWER Barefeats test in July with a GTX 1080 in the 2010 MP pushed it’s fps to 195 ! A hackintosh (with faster subsystem than that 6 year old MP) or high end windows machine will have even BIGGER differences than the above. People have argued that fps is not important as games have a limit for fps playability but that’s not the point, the test shows GPU power. Besides games GPU power is needed for CERTAIN tasks like running multiple high res monitors or doing certain types of 3D etc. The Mac Pro has other issues, the Xeons, subsystems are one to two generations old. Apple provides up to 64 GB RAM (upgradable to 128 by OWC) but PCs can go up to 512 GB (yeah you might not need 512 Ram but that RAM stat is just an obvious indicator — easier to grasp than bus speeds etc — to show the gap in tech now) There is no Mac today where you can upgrade the video card. —– I have a 27 inch Cintiq pen monitor and another large monitor, there is no Mac now that I want to buy to power them. The top iMac has a 4 GB card ( 2GB each monitor is not enough to rotate high polygon models etc and keep multiple programs, many files open ) and the Mac Pro as seen above is 3 years old costs many thousands for the D700 and still dwarfed by PC cards. I and many others find SCREEN REAL ESTATE is crucial and a great time saver. (for example you can have reference files, training videos, manuals open in one monitor and the programs with their palettes open in the other. ) —- I realize that many Mac users with lower needs are very happy with their Macs but there is no denying (people one star me but I’m just printing test numbers) for certain pro users the cylinder was mis-designed (non upgradable GPU etc) and long in the tooth. (I have two upgraded Mac Pros, an iPad Pro 12.9 and a Macbook Pro etc) Birdseed Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:34 pm · Reply When did Apple stop caring? When Tim Cook became CEO. It’s that simple. 24january1984 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:44 pm · Reply Tim’s doing a great job. Nick Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 2:53 pm · Reply If the stock gets back up to $130 i’ll sell my entire position. Its been foolish of me to have a sizeable part of my portfolio in Apple alone, coupled with the company’s weird behavior under Cook. Jobs set up an amazing money-machine for Cook to manage. Apple’s tremendous financial success in the last 5 years is Job’s legacy. Cook may have been ok as a caretaker, and Apple has been strong enough to weather his insane social justice warrior virtue signaling, but he’s no visionary. I don’t think anyone at Apple is anymore, they can’t buy it. DavGreg Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:26 pm · Reply If Apple really gave a shit: 1- There would be a proper Mac Pro tower. 2- You could easily add memory on any Mac- no sealed boxes. 3- A MacBook Pro with Retina Display would have better than Intel Iris vampire video. 4- There would be a 4k Apple Cinema Display. 5- There would be a Quad Core or better Mac mini. 6- The Apple TV eould be able to handle 4k video. 7- Apple Keyboards, Trackpads and Laptops would support Touch ID. 8- Beats would belong to Samsung and iTunes would not suck like a Dyson. 9- I could buy a Thunderbolt Dock at an Apple Store 10- Eddie Cue would be looking for a job. Whizcast Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 4:07 pm · Reply Tim Cook is a good leader and interim CEO otherwise Steve would not have left him in charge but Tim is a supply chain expert and Apple obviously has that down to science (great job Tim!). Apple now needs a visionary leader that can connect with it’s customers the way Steve did. I believe Apple can see the future better by learning from the past. Remember the G4 Cube? It tuned out to be a failure but that was OK because Apple still had the successful Power Mac G4 tower and a road map to the Power Mac G5 and Mac Pro. They could bring back the tower and keep the trash can to see which one sells the best. I agree keeping loyal customers happy is a must. Steve knew this even though tough choices were made to to push technology forward he always took care of the Pro users. If sales numbers are down that is a true indicator for change but since everything was/is heading mobile Apple needs to be fully prepared and not end up like HP. A balance of R&D for desktop and mobile may not be possible, even for Apple right now. I believe you will see Apple branching out into all kinds of technology which makes sense since they certainly have the cash to do it now and take some risks. Steve was a risk taker! Time Shifter Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 5:15 pm · Reply Apple stopped caring about 2pm last Wednesday. I was there. I saw it. It wasn’t pretty. 1 2 Next » Add Your Feedback Name (required) Email (required) Web cancel reply Notify me of new comments via email. Notify me of new posts via email.

Don’t hold your breath Tuesday, August 9, 2016 · 2:00 pm · 6 Comments “As most Apple watchers know, Cupertino tends to watch a new technology enter the market and study closely what type of interest and impact it has,” Tim Bajarin writes for PC Magazine. “Then, if it sees the technology has real demand, Apple introduces its own version, which can be tied to its large ecosystem of apps and services.” “I believe that as Apple is eyeing VR, it’s viewing it as it did the early MP3 player market. While some early VR headsets are picking up steam with gamers and early adopters, I don’t believe this is a market in which Apple has a high interest,” Bajarin writes. “For one thing, these devices are not high volume. And at the low end, with the Samsung Gear VR, they are low quality.” “As I look at what is in the market today, I really don’t believe that Apple will introduce a tethered solution or low-end headset powered by an iPhone. Rather, I think Apple should enter this market with a powerful, standalone device,” Bajarin writes. “I suspect Apple will need at least another one or two years to advance its A series processor before it can go in an Apple-acceptable VR headset.” Read more in the full article – recommended, as usual – here.

Why would Apple waste their time? The devices are ugly, they are uncomfortable if worn for extended periods, IMHO…. yojimbo007 Tuesday, August 9, 2016 - 3:56 pm · Reply Well VR and AR are related technologies . And Tim Cook , at the latest conferance call , pointed out that Apple is very interested in this area and they are making major investments in it. Derek Currie Wednesday, August 10, 2016 - 2:44 pm · Reply For those interested, here is a niche use of similar technology. It applies AR technology to people afflicted with macular degeneration, creating an OLED video image that makes use of still working parts of the retina in order to provide improved vision. How Does eSight Work? When I first saw someone using these special ‘glasses’, I thought they were an AR obsessive. Nope, this is how they better see the real world.

MacOS 10.12 Sierra packs some relatively major features such as Auto Unlock via Apple Watch, Apple Pay via iPhone, and Siri finally makes it debut on the Mac. The update is currently now available for developers only.  It’s not recommended to install this beta unless you’re an actual developer as there’s no reverting back without data loss. Those with access to the macOS developer or public beta can download the update now in the Mac App Store.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Robin Givhan August 9 Follow @RobinGivhan Is design everything? Apple says yes. Samsung says no. The Supreme Court will decide. (Pawel Kopczynski/Reuters) In the ongoing legal wranglings between tech giants Apple and Samsung, a group of fashion industry luminaries recently weighed in on behalf of Apple. They include designers Calvin Klein, Lanvin’s former creative director Alber Elbaz, Alexander Wang, Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Sacai’s Chitose Abe. They’ve all taken Apple’s side in a lawsuit that dates back to 2012 in which the creator of the iPhone accused Samsung of copying some of the smartphone’s technical features as well as its design. Fashion folks might know very little about software and coding, but they understand the importance of aesthetics. And so in a friend-of-the-court brief, they extol the power and importance of design. As attorney Mark Davies, the brief’s counsel of record, noted in an interview: “It’s the design that sells the product.” Fashion designer Chitose Abe of the collection Sacai signed the friend-of-the-court brief in support of Apple. She has created a band for the Apple watch. (Laura Stevens for The Washington Post) Four years ago, a jury awarded Apple just over $1 billion in damages after finding that Samsung infringed on, among other things, the iPhone’s design patents — namely those protecting the phone’s rounded-off rectangular shape, its screen and its grid display. Essentially, the jury found that the average observer could be misled into purchasing one of Samsung’s phones believing it to be an iPhone. As a matter of law, the offender has to turn over the profits made from selling the copy. Over time, the award has been reduced to $548 million. But Samsung believes that it should be reduced even further, saying the company shouldn’t have to turn over all the profits, just a certain portion of them. Samsung says a cellphone is made up of discrete elements that comprise both form and function, each of which is dutifully considered by a consumer. Design is just part of what sells the product. Apple says design is wholly and inexorably linked to function. The debate is headed to the Supreme Court this fall in search of a resolution. A host of companies such as Google, Facebook and eBay have lined up in support of Samsung. They argue that in the case of a product as complicated as a cellphone, Samsung shouldn’t have to relinquish all its profits because of an overlap of a few design elements. Aesthetics matter, but not that much. The counter-argument, which the fashion community has embraced, is that design is everything. And it should be aggressively protected. [Four of Michelle Obama’s Designers Want Protection From Knockoffs] The fashion industry has grappled mightily with the problems of knockoffs and outright counterfeiting. Although the law recognizes some unique and iconic designs, the Council of Fashion Designers of America has tried unsuccessfully to lobby Capitol Hill for legislation that would extend greater copyright protections to clothing designs. Critics believe extending copyright laws could hurt competition and stifle commerce by making it more challenging for mass merchants to create cheaper iterations of designer looks. This trickle-down process has helped democratize fashion and fuels no small number of Instagram feeds. Meanwhile, designers have recounted how distinctive handbags, for instance, have been reproduced lickety-split at bargain basement prices, cutting into their profits and, possibly, diluting the prestige of their brand. The travails have Seventh Avenue testing a see-now, buy-now schedule that would have original products available for purchase before the copies can arrive in stores. [The fashion industry wants to disrupt the runway. It’s missing the real problem.] Rebecca Minkoff is among those designers trying to give shoppers immediate access to her collection — limiting consumer boredom and the opportunity for knockoffs to beat her to market. This dress from her Spring 2016 collection was shown in February. (Ze Takahashi/MCV Photo for The Washington Post) Over the years, in an attempt to protect their work, fashion folks have essentially been arguing aesthetics: That dress looks like my dress. The Apple brief goes further. It argues that “Appearance becomes identified with the underlying functional features and with a particular level of product quality … ” It’s a line of thinking that raises an uncomfortable question: Does a consumer presume that a $200 copy of a dress is the same quality as the $2,000 original? If so, one could say that while fashion may win the battle on copying, it most certainly will have lost something far more valuable, which is the integrity of its wares. Designers, after all, have always noted that part of the high cost of their work is due to the luxurious hand of the fabric, the clarity and stability of the colors, the skill of artisans whose knowledge has been passed down through generations and the magical voodoo in the fit. It might be enraging to have a fast fashion merchant whip up a look-a-like copy of a runway garment, but at least the runway version could be proudly billed as offering more than just a bedazzled bodice. The friend-of-the-court brief casts a shadow of doubt over that assertion. Charles Mauro, founder of Mauro New Media, which helps companies make their technology both user-friendly and useful, rallied Apple’s champions. But many of them already had relationships with the Silicon Valley behemoth. In the past few years, Apple has been strengthening its bonds with the fashion industry by inviting designers to collaborate on assorted projects. Abe created wristbands for the Apple Watch and Wang edited personal playlists for Apple music. Apple has also been drawing top executives from the fashion world. In 2013, Paul Deneve, the president of Saint Laurent, and before that Lanvin, was hired as a vice president at Apple. In 2014, Angela Arendts left her post as CEO of Burberry to head up Apple retail. And this spring, Apple sponsored the fashion industry’s biggest celebration of design, the Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This year’s exhibition is Manus x Machina: Fashion in the Age of Technology. [Apple patents were violated by Samsung, jury rules] Fashion has begun to express its love for technology — beyond simply using high-performance fabrics. At Ralph Lauren, for instance, the company has embedded an athletic shirt with biometric sensors that can give an athlete real-time updates on his workout and make suggestions on how to work harder or smarter. But fashion is not technology. In tech, elegant design may imply a certain level of function and quality. But in fashion, aesthetics tell consumers almost nothing about function and only hint at quality. Beautiful shoes do not have to be comfortable in order to sell. Consumers have purchased dresses that can be neither washed nor dry-cleaned or that weren’t made for sitting. They buy pencil skirts that are hobbling, sheared fur coats that don’t keep them very warm and mohair sweaters that make them itch. They buy for beauty. They buy for function. And every now and then, the gods smile and a gorgeous product is astonishingly practical. Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière is among those designers supporting Apple in its lawsuit with Samsung. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) Apple believes it has blended form, function and quality in a single elegant device. It sees design as essential to its identity as its proprietary algorithms. Fashion has signed onto this notion of the unbreakable relationship between form and function. But it’s still struggling to turn that philosophy into practice. lifestyle style-blog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Apple has unleashed iOS 10 beta 5, giving registered developers a new version of iOS 10 to test. The update is now rolling out over the air and is also available for download through Apple’s Developer Center. As for what’s new in iOS 10 beta 5, it appears that the iPhone 6 and 6s now work properly with Apple’s Smart Battery Case. Also of note is that Apple will reprocess its facial recognition data in iOS 10 beta 5, so existing face data will be reset. These beta updates are meant to help Apple iron out bugs in iOS 10 before its public release and to allow developers to test their apps on iOS 10 so that they’re ready for iOS 10 when it’s release to the public. Apple is also running an iOS 10 Public Beta, and if the past few releases are any indication, those testers could get a new update tomorrow, August 10. iOS 10 will be officially released to the public this fall.

Is Apple working on a new health-tracking device for launch with iPhone 8? by Chris Smith 09 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments Just yesterday, we reported on rumours an Apple Watch 2 may be making an appearance at the company’s iPhone launch next month. Now new speculation suggests Apple has more up - or perhaps on - its sleeve when it comes to health-focused tech. A report from Taiwan’s Economic Daily News claims Apple has been working on a health-tracking device, separate from its smartwatch, which it hopes to release in 2017. According to the report, the “killer” device will feature a heart rate sensor, measure pulse and variances in blood sugar. It’ll also offer pressure sensitive technology similar to the 3D Touch features within the current iPhone models. Related: Apple Watch 2: Everything you need to know Apple is reportedly looking for manufacturing partner for the device, which would seemingly integrate much of its work with HealthKit, ResearchKit and CareKit. While this seems like it may be a wearable, that might not be the case. The report calls the product a “revolutionary idea,” which suggests Apple has thought beyond a wristband. Mashable speculates it could even be a smart scale, similar to those offered by Nokia-owned Withings and sold in the Apple Store, if indeed the product is legit. The 2017 timeframe suggests any release could coincide with the launch of that year’s iPhone models, tipped to be the next major refresh.

 This is the latest hint that Apple could be making an all-glass iPhone Antonio Villas-Boas Aug. 9, 2016, 1:56 PM 31,030 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Apple patent first spotted by Patently Apple suggests that the company is at least considering the idea of making an iPhone that's mostly glass. kedarkulkarni95/YouTube The patent comes after hints from one of Apple's main suppliers of iPhone casings that Apple could be making an all-glass iPhone in 2017. The patent describes an iPhone with rounded glass that wraps around the side edges. It also details how the glass edges could act as a "mini flexible edge display" with customizable "active virtual buttons." It potentially means that the side edges could have customizable touch buttons for certain functions and shortcuts to features like you'd find in the iPhone's control center, such as opening the camera app, turning on the flashlight, or music controls. Patently Apple If that sounds familiar, then that's because you've seen the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge that was released in 2014, which had a single curved glass edge that displayed information and could be tapped to open functions and features. Patently Apple also referred to a patent granted to Apple in 2013 that showed a very similar design concept: Patently Apple/US Patents Office As pretty as an all-glass iPhone might sound, it isn't clear how durable it would be, as the entire surface of the phone would risk being cracked after hitting a hard surface from a relatively low height. And case makers could potentially have a hard time making a case for a phone where it's entire front surface and side edges are made of touch screens. While patents filed by Apple seem more official than rumors, they're not indicators of what Apple has in store for future products. The company has been granted plenty of patents with new product ideas, but many of them have never seen the light of day. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Chris Urmson’s departure raises a host of questions about the future of driverless vehicles.

Hugh White 10:41 AM ET Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook 7:00 AM ET Adrienne LaFrance Aug 9, 2016 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size In the rapidly growing world of self-driving vehicles, Google is a clear leader. And Chris Urmson has been the human face of the company’s Self-Driving Car Project since it launched back in 2009. So it’s big news that Urmson is leaving Google, a move he announced over the weekend in a blog post. It’s also, so far, a big mystery as to what that means—for Urmson, for Google, and for any of its competitors. The biggest question is: Was he poached? Uber, famously greedy for autonomous-car talent, has recently announced several expansions to its own self-driving car ambitions—including testing driverless vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, and a new mapping effort in Mexico. Uber also has a track record of scooping up Google’s best. It hired the software designer Brian McClendon, previously one of Google’s most high-profile executives, to head its maps division last year. Urmson makes it seem like his next plans are uncertain: “If I can find another project that turns into an obsession and becomes something more, I will consider myself twice lucky.” But Silicon Valley’s tech giants are famously secretive, especially in the realm of driverless cars. It wouldn’t be shocking, for instance, if Urmson wound up at Apple. What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen. Little is known about Apple’s work on self-driving cars, though reports of mysterious middle-of-the-night work makes it sound like a Willy Wonka-run shop. The company has been ultra-cagey about discussing its ambitions for autonomous driving, though public records—including a patent filing revealed this week—offer some clues. “There is a joke in the Bay Area that if you know somebody in the vehicle space and they left their old job but they haven’t updated their LinkedIn, they must be at Apple,” Chris Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University, told me last fall. And there are other clues that Apple continues to ramp up its efforts on autonomous driving, like recently reassigning one of its most influential executives, Bob Mansfield, so that he can focus on the project, according to The Wall Street Journal. Then again, as one roboticist pointed out to me, many tech companies try to prevent people from company-hopping this way. “He likely has a non-compete clause for at least one (but probably more) years,” Missy Cummings, the head roboticist at Duke told me in an email. “I bet he pops up in a related field like drones or some other robotic field.” Adding more intrigue to Urmson’s departure are reports that he isn’t the only one leaving Google. John Markoff, writing for The New York Times, characterizes Urmson as “the latest in a string of departures by important technologists working on the autonomous car project.” Markoff also points out that the staffing changes come after Google hired John Krafcik, who was previously a chief executive at Hyundai America, to lead the car project as it spins out as its own company under the larger umbrella of Google’s new(ish) company, Alphabet. So maybe this is just one of those moments where a company is changing enough to prompt some of its big names to move on. That’s not unheard of—and Urmson did write that he is “ready for a fresh challenge”—but his departure still raises questions about how the Self-Driving Car Project will fare without him. Several people who have either worked directly with Urmson, or closely followed his work at Google, declined to speculate on what’s next, but underscored how important his contributions to Google have been. “His departure is certainly a loss for the project,” Mark Bergen and Johanna Bhuiyan wrote for Recode. “Urmson was the main engineer who built the code running Google’s autonomous software, according to one person who worked with the team.” Urmson didn’t immediately respond to my request for comment on Monday. “I have every confidence that the mission is in capable hands,” he wrote in his blog post. “There are many other problems or products this talented group of people could work on, but they’ve chosen self-driving cars because they understand the impact their work can have on making our roads safer and bringing everyday destinations within reach for millions of people.” What Urmson chooses next, and what happens to Google in his absence, remains to be seen.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Electoral College Was Meant to Stop Men Like Trump From Being President Peter Beinart The founders envisioned electors as people who could prevent an irresponsible demagogue from taking office. Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out.

Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000. (The most up-to-date results are here.) Continue Reading Ricardo Moraes / Reuters The Average 29-Year-Old Derek Thompson Forget media archetypes of older Millennials as college-educated singles living in cities. The typical 29-year-old is living with a partner in the suburbs—without a bachelor’s degree. What is the typical life experience for an American on the verge of turning 30? This is a hard question to answer, no matter who is asking. But it’s become especially difficult for an industry responsible with providing the answers: the national press. An irony of digital media is that the Internet distributes journalism, but it concentrates journalists. Jobs at media sites like The Atlantic, BuzzFeed, or Gawker are five-times more likely to be located in New York or Washington, D.C., than television-news jobs. The clustering force is only getting more centripetal: The share of reporting jobs in Los Angeles, NYC, and DC increased by 60 percent between 2004 and 2014. It’s easy to imagine many downsides of this agglomeration, like the dissolution of local reporting, but a subtler risk is that well-educated journalists in these dense cities wind up with a skewed impression of the world, a “majority illusion” based on the extremely unrepresentative cross-section of the country that’s immediately around them. To be fair, being a reporter in Des Moines or rural Nebraska, while it provides a better view of Des Moines and rural Nebraska, doesn’t offer a universal window into the average experiences of all Americans, either. For that, one needs something else, like a national survey. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

The music giant launched its streaming service, Apple Music, in the country yesterday (August 8), offering users subscription plans that account to roughly $7.99 (£6.15) a month for individual plans and $11.99 (£9.20) a month for family plans. These plans are preceded by Apple Music’s customary free three-month trial. But, as reported by Digital Music News, Apple have also now removed paid downloads from their service in the country. Introducing a new version of iTunes to the country yesterday, while the service made Apple Music available to its South Korean customers, it also took away their ability to purchase individual songs and albums on iTunes. South Korea is the eight-largest music market in the world, and Apple Music’s delayed launch in the country is considered to be something of a surprise in the streaming industry. Observers have pointed to Apple’s difficulties in securing licensing for the K-Pop market, which accounts for a huge proportion of the music industry in South Korea, and is largely run through independent labels. This news has cast further doubt about the future of music downloads, after a statistics report in October 2015 showed that song downloads between January and the end of September 2015 were down almost 100 million on the same time period in 2014.

It was granted to both Apple and BAE Systems, a Swedish engineering firm that specializes in military technology and transportation. Now could this have been an opportunity for Apple to get some experience with developing transportation technology, but don't expect to see this on a future Apple car. Now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at what they developed. Patently Apple reported on this today, and based on their findings and the patent's information, the tech company helped develop the pivoting steering section that goes between the two sections of an articulated vehicle. The patent and Patently Apple show that the two companies developed a special bullet-resistant, pivoting connector for steering that contains all of the wiring, hoses, and drivetrain equipment running between both units. Combined with heating capabilities to prevent ice build-up and a design to help remove rocks from the unit, this design offers the potential to be a stronger, more reliable component for articulated military vehicles. Apple may have received some valuable vehicle development experience here, but we'll have to wait a while longer to see what a real car might look like.

Be it the constant hanging of your phone or the upgradations problem, here are the solutions. Take a look and try it at home before you pay hundreds of dollars at the repairing shop. Question- I am using an iPad Mini since two years. Recently, I have upgraded to the latest version but the device has suddenly become slow. When I work with several tabs on Chrome it becomes irksome. Also, the games that used to run smoothly are now hanging a lot. What is the way out? Answer- This is a common problem that most of the Apple users complain about. Older Apple devices tend to get slow if you don’t do maintenance. It is very important that you use Safari instead of Chrome because Apple’s own browser will work much better than other browsers. Secondly, you need to get rid of all the apps that you do not use. Even if you are a new iPhone or iPad user, you should delete all the redundant apps. You would know how many apps accumulate over time and how rarely they are used. You need to go to the  Settings-General-Storage iCloud Usage- Manage Storage (Under storage). Now you need to see which apps are take up most of the space. You may do this by tapping an app to view its contents. If you feel that you no longer want to use the app the simply delete it. Once you clear the unwanted apps, press the Home button and the power switch together. Release both the buttons to let the iPad start up. After this, your tablet will run faster than before. A few more tweaks that you can do is by going to Settings-General-Background App Refresh and turn off the Background App Refresh. You may also clear all your browsing history and Website Data to make your iPad run faster. Question- I have a Microsoft Lumia 640 phone and I am unable to record calls. The phone came with Windows 8 but ever since I have upgraded to Windows 10 I cannot record calls. Answer- Microsoft has added support for voice call recording with Windows 10 mobile. However, it is not enabled by default. You need to turn it on manually. You need to go to Settings-System-Phone. Under the Default apps section, choose the app you want to use to manage the recorded phone calls. You will see the Recorded Calls in the phone app menu at the bottom as an option. Here you will find the list of all the recorded calls. Question- I have a four-year-old Sony Vaio that had come with Windows 7 pre-installed. I recently upgraded it to Windows 10. Whenever I try to connect to the router using Digisol’s Wireless Adapter DG-WN 3150NU, I get a blue screen with an error message. Answer- It is possible that the driver of your wireless adapter is either not functioning or corrupted. You need to try to uninstall and reinstall the wireless driver. Open the Control Panel and click on Device Manager. Right click on the name of the device and select the uninstall option. You need to restart your laptop now and Windows will try to reinstall the driver. If this doesn’t happen then you have to connect your laptop to the internet. You may use a wired connection if that is required. Open Device Manager again and expand one of the categories to find the name of your device.

(REUTERS/Damir Sagolj)  (REUTERS/Damir Sagolj) The next iPhone will feature a dual-camera system, a re-engineered home button, and no headphone jack, according to Bloomberg. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Apple will ditch the headphone jack found on earlier versions of the device. Instead, headphones will be connected to the device via Bluetooth and the phone’s charging port, the sources told Bloomberg, making room for a second speaker. Rumors of Apple ditching the headphone jack on the iPhones have been swirling for some time, sparking concern from a number of users. Critics have warned that the move would be "user-hostile". Apple is widely expected to unveil its latest smartphone, possibly called iPhone 7, next month. The tech giant traditionally makes a major September product announcement ahead of the lucrative holiday season. Last September, for example, Apple launched the iPad Pro and its iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.

Apple thinks so Mountain biker suffers horrific burns after his iPhone 6 exploded when he crashed in Australia Citing a person who has used a prototype of the new iPhone, Bloomberg reports that the device’s dual camera will offer brighter, more detailed photos. The dual-camera sensors take pictures simultaneously, but capture colors differently, according to the report. The unnamed source also told Bloomberg that the dual-camera system can sharpen photos taken in low-light environments. Bloomberg also reports that the new iPhone home button will respond to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than the current “physical click.” The people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that the new iPhones will look similar to their predecessors and have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen size, respectively, as the iPhone 6s and 6s plus. It was rumored earlier this year that the smaller version of the new iPhones will not offer dual-camera technology. Last week Apple’s arch-rival Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note7 phone, which offers iris-scanning technology to unlock the device.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Best Black Friday deals on iPhone 7, Galaxy S7, FitBit, and the Apple Watch 2 Apple just patented an iPhone that clips to your clothes 3 Twitter fail: CEO Jack Dorsey accidentally suspended from platform 4 Facebook has reportedly developed News Feed software to suppress posts in China 5 President-elect Trump still wants Apple to make iPhones in America See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Apple seeds iOS 10 beta 5 to developers By Cody Lee, Aug 9, 2016 Tweet 53 Comments Apple on Tuesday seeded the fifth beta of iOS 10 to developers. Registered developers running the latest betas can access the update via the OTA mechanism in iOS, or as a standalone download via Apple’s developer center. Beta 5 comes just one week after the fourth beta, suggesting Apple has entered the fine-tuning stage as it prepares for a public release next month. Beta 4 added new emoji, new keyboard sounds and several other minor tweaks. Introduced in June, iOS 10 offers a number of new features and improvements. It’s compatible with the iPad 4 and later, the iPad mini 2 and later, the iPhone 5 and later, and the 6th gen iPod touch. We are currently installing today’s beta, and will be sure to report back with any notable changes. If you spot something we’ve missed, leave a comment below or email us at tips@idownloadblog.com.

Gabriel Anaya That was quick. Has it not only been a week since the last beta was seeded? Omar D. Plumey Hopefully it fixed the quick reply in iMessage bug. That’s what made my downgrade back to iOS 9. Kurt That was quite annoying. Nothing to make me go through the hassle of downgrading. Things like that are expected in Betas, but I do hope they got it fixed! Omar D. Plumey Is it fixed? Kurt Not sure yet. Mine on beta 4 would work sometimes and then not work at times I haven’t encountered it just yet. José Tijeritas it´s funny, in my country 99% of the people uses whatsapp and not imessage anymore… ChrisLinke I don’t get the joke. Justin de Vreugd watch os beta 5 is also released ericesque Not a fan. Was hoping they’d polish widgets and notifications a bit more. Maybe my experience is not as good because I’m on a non-3D touch device, but widgets need work and notifications/notification center feels clunkier than iOS 9. Lion Hopefully it fixes notification banners NOT autohiding, most annoying bug in the last beta Kurt Looks as if it doesn’t. I hope thats just a bug and not something they are changing to. Its convenient at times actually but most of the time just annoying! Kurt Ok, after rebooting my device they are autohiding now! Thank goodness! Lion That’s good to know Jose Gonzalez Just downloaded …….. Framboogle Redesigned Now Playing icon in CC Abhijeet Gupta New lock sound [RECON1] I guess it’s a nice touch…sounds like a door closing. Abhijeet Gupta Yep nyangejr Make sense JohannASSburg UGH animations have been slowed down and how that giant date is on Home Screen Zero as well as the widgets page in NC. Lame ericesque Dang. I vastly prefer how it was in beta 4 on lockscreen/lockscreen zero. Big time with readable day/date below. JohannASSburg Lock screen zero is still that way. I have having the date on Home Screen Zero and in NC because it just wastes space ericesque I crave consistency. I already feel like there has been an explosion of inconsistencies in iOS since 8.0. They’ve started adding multiple ways to do the same thing. That’s a page that belongs in Microsoft’s playbook, not Apple’s. JohannASSburg I would say since iOS 7 most noticeably. Isn’t multiple ways of doing the same thing “a sign of a matured platform” and “more user choice and customization”? (Also I’d say that having multiple ways of doing the same thing isn’t in consistent, it’s consistent. ericesque I’d argue that multiple ways of doing the same thing smacks of design by committee. In the past Apple has been much more prescriptive, saying there’s one right way to do something. From their own Human Interface Guidelines, “…it’s essential that the path through content is logical, predictable, and easy to follow. In general, give people one path to each screen. If they need to see a screen in multiple contexts, consider using an action sheet, alert, popover, or modal view.”. There are 3 different paths to widgets right now and you get something very slightly different depending on how you get there. You’ll have to elaborate on how consistency is achieved by providing multiple ways to do one thing. JohannASSburg I see what you mean. You have a point. This is probably a consequence of iOS not having been built with all these features in mind. I meant that (at least in the situation regarding this feature) it makes it more important/slash reinforces its importance to users, if you can access the same screen of widgets no matter where you are on your phone: lock screen, home screen, or in an app without having to leave it. I hear all the time that people forget to even check their Notification Center. nyangejr What’s lockscreen zero nyangejr What’s Home Screen Zero ericesque The home screen has multiple pages. If you’re on the home screen and hit the home button, you’ll end up on page 1. Home screen zero is a term used to describe the page to the left of page 1. In iOS 9 it is the predictive siri page. In iOS 10 it’s the widget page. Lock screen zero is probably not really a thing. I used the concept of home screen zero and applied it to the iOS 10 lock screen which now has 3 pages. The main lock screen in the center, the widget page on the left (lock screen zero), and the camera on the right. [RECON1] One thing I have found interesting is that on a 128GB, there’s usually 114GB capacity. On iOS 10, it jumped to 121.6 something, and now it’s at 121.75 Martin  I haven’t notice it before but on 64 iPad Air 2 I had 56gigs now there is 59.12 Cool 🙂 ticky13 I got a one gig increase in storage on my iPhone going from b4 to b5. Justin de Vreugd wow that new lock sound is much better The Tech Kidd I’m making a video about it right now! Should be out in about an hour or so! Marc Lyrics in the music app are finally working properly. sami I never know how to view lyrics in music all Marc In the now playing screen just click the three dots and an option for lyrics should pop up. It doesn’t work for every song but it’s finally working nOw for most of the albums I listen to. Gil You can bring me one song , for example ? For me it does not work on any song Marc I took three different screenshots of three different songs but you get the point. Also keep in mind it only seems to work with music from Apple Music. At least for me. Gil No , still not working for me sami Same for me still not working. Maybe it’s because of the region? Hisham Public beta is out as well! [RECON1] Wow. Public beta is out now too. Dontwannaknow Seriously. The widgets are too ugly to even try. They should have polished it up a bit more. That design is so similar to iOS 6. I’ll get iPhone 7 anyway. Brandon Valley Alarm clock bug squashed. If you set an alarm and went in to adjust it song/time etc it would turn alarm button off upon saving. Tony Trenkle Jr. The public betas are out too. Omar D. Plumey Maybe it’s just me but I like the old quick reply better. It’s faster and sometimes after replying, like while I’m playing a game, after I reply the game reloads.

The update is available for registered Mac developers in either the Updates tab of the Mac App Store, or in Apple’s Dev center. Today’s fifth beta comes just one week after Apple issued beta 4, and nearly two months after the original developer beta was made available. The software, of course, was first introduced during Apple’s WWDC keynote. Though Apple chose this year to rebrand OS X to macOS, the update isn’t a significant one. There are just a few notable user-facing changes including Siri for Mac, Universal Clipboard support, and Picture-in-Picture support. We are currently installing beta 5, and will be sure to report back with any changes that we feel are worth mentioning.

(AAPL): How Much Does a Better Apple Watch Matter? Don’t expect the Apple Watch to move the needle on revenues for some time By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Aug 9, 2016, 1:02 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Don’t Worry About Facebook Inc’s (FB) Awful Month 3 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for REAL Virtual Reality Profits Recent Posts: Why Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Needs to Catch Up Sooner Than Later 3 Worries About Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Committing Corporate Hari-Kari View All Posts The Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch certainly hasn’t caught fire with the public. Source: iphonedigital via Flickr According to a recent report from International Data Corp. (IDC), the device suffered a 55% plunge in shipments in the second quarter. This also appears not to be an outlier. Consider that analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) significantly reduced their fiscal 2016 shipments from 23.5 million to 11.9 million. So what does this mean for Apple stock? Should investors be worried? Impact on AAPL Stock Well, there is really no need for panic. Something to keep in mind is that the deceleration in Apple Watch shipments probably has much to do with consumers who are waiting for the next version. After all, it’s usually the die-hard early adopters that buy the first iteration, right? 7 Consumer Stocks That Are Worth Your Attention But the Apple Watch has definitely been a worthy first try. On the latest AAPL earnings call, CEO Tim Cook noted that the device is the world’s best seller and got the highest satisfaction rating from J.D. Power. Besides, it looks like there will be two new launches for the Apple Watch during the fall (this is according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo). One, an update of the current version, will have a faster processor and improved waterproofing, which will likely be features that will get attention. But the next model, Apple Watch 2, may be the most important since it is expected to also have better location capabilities, a barometer and a longer-lasting battery. All of these are critical for any mobile device. It’s also important to realize that AAPL has recently launched a new version of the Apple Watch OS with new features to improve the UI and speed. It offers more capabilities for health tracking and sharing. All these investments in the Apple Watch are critical, since the long-term growth opportunity remains compelling. The global shipments for wearables is forecasted to jump from 101.9 million units in 2016 to 213.6 million by 2020 (based on research from IDC). That’s a hefty 20.3% compound annual growth rate. Granted, this is not all about smartwatches. Wearables also include clothing, bands and eyewear. But IDC forecasts that – by 2020 – about 52.2% of shipments will be smartwatches. Bottom Line On Apple Watch In the meantime, the main driver for Apple stock will be the mighty iPhone (about 57% of overall revenues). Even though the category is fairly mature, the company still has been able to innovate and find new ways to gin up demand, as seen with the success of the iPhone SE (especially in emerging markets). And yes, during the fall AAPL should get a boost from the next version of the iPhone. Besides, Apple stock remains fairly cheap, trading at 12 times earnings. By comparison, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is at 28, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) sports a multiple of 17X and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading at 31X. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc: VRX Stock Is Finally Worth a Look Again! Yet more importantly, AAPL is not resting on its laurels as the company continues to focus on innovation. In fact, the R&D budget has jumped by a third during the last year. In other words, it’s a good bet that there will be more than just the Apple Watch to get investors excited.

For the first time, Apple will also offer a touchscreen display to modernise the MacBook. News site 9to5Mac said it has been informed by a "reliable source" that the new MacBook Pro will feature the previously-rumoured Touch ID power button. The range of laptops, set to be launched alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch 2 in mid-September, will be the first substantial update to the high-end MacBook family for a few years. Apple's Windows-based rivals have been getting ahead of it and the company has been slow to respond. It is common for Windows machines to include a touchscreen and a fingerprint sensor, neither of which are available on the current MacBook line-up. With this year's family, Apple will change that, adding features that will appeal to its fans. The power button on the new MacBook Pro will double up as a Touch ID sensor. When the button is pressed to wake the computer up, it will recognise the user's fingerprint and immediately log in. The system will work in the same way as the Touch ID sensor built into the iPhone's home button, unlocking the device almost instantly with a one-touch process. Alongside the option of a full touchscreen, the new MacBook Pro is also thought to feature an OLED "touch bar" display positioned above the keyboard. Sitting where the function keys are usually arranged, the touch-sensitive display will act as a kind of ticker or status screen. Users will be able to bring OS X's status bar down into its own display directly above the keyboard, making it easier to interact with onscreen elements like menu bars and volume controls. A rendering by Martin Hajek showing how Apple could implement an "OLED touch bar" on the 2016 MacBook Pro Martin Hajek Much remains unknown about the purpose and functionality of the touch bar. Nothing concrete has been produced to show its existence, although recent leaked photographs that allegedly show the chassis of the new laptop appear to confirm its inclusion. In June, developer Martin Hajek created a few renders that show how the display could be implemented. He imagines it as a status bar showing controls that are contextually relevant to the open apps on the main display. Apple could be working on something else altogether though. However the touch bar turns out, it will be a MacBook-exclusive feature that can't be found anywhere else. No Windows laptop currently has such a display, although it's possible manufacturers could come up with their own implementations once Apple launches its new MacBooks. Combined, the new features should make this year's MacBook refresh the most substantial update for some time. Apple has neglected the MacBook Pro over the last three years, leaving owners waiting for revised hardware. Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has previously said the 2016 Pro will be "the most significant upgrade ever undertaken by Apple," an informed rumour to excite fans of the powerful range.

Mac sales have been slumping as of late and the problem may have nothing to do with a general disinterest in Apple’s Mac platform. On the contrary, interest in the Mac appears to be strong but consumers simply aren’t willing to fork over their hard-earned cash for machines that, in some cases, are four years old. As we highlighted just a few weeks ago, Apple’s current Mac lineup – the Mac Pro, the Retina MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air – is anything but current when you take a look at when Apple last refreshed them. Apple’s non-Retina MacBook Pro is a particularly bad offender, with the last refresh occurring more than 1500 days ago. DON’T MISS: Pokemon Go update fixes Pokemon catching bugs, introduces new ‘Nearby’ feature In light of Apple seemingly ignoring its Mac lineup and frustratingly keeping its prices high for technology that is years old, a Microsoft executive on Monday called out Apple for selling its customer base short. Taking to Twitter, Brian Hall – currently a general manager in Microsoft’s Surface division – all but said that Apple should be ashamed for selling old technology to its customer base. https://twitter.com/IsForAt/status/761387470197891073 It’s a fair criticism. Over the past few months I’ve had a few friends interested in buying new Macs ask me for some advice. Taking a look at the current state of Apple’s Mac lineup, it was hard to recommend premium-priced machine that hadn’t been refreshed in years. The good news is that Apple hasn’t completely forgotten about the Mac. According to the rumor mill, Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro may be worth the wait, with reports suggesting that it will come with a built-in OLED touch bar, TouchID functionality, and of course, enhanced internals.

Sure, it’s August and we could all use a break from everything else going on in the world — but is reading an interview with Frank’s high school woodshop teacher really it? And how much time will most of us spend combing torrent services tonight to download the album (and will whatever advance Apple gave Frank make up for it)? To put it another way: when everything is a surprise release, is anything actually a surprise? And how much of a surprise can an album be when an artist does “quirky” things that basically stop short of sending out a press release announcing their surprise release. Radiohead “just coincidentally” scrubbed their website and socials a few days before — surprise! — dropping a new album. Frank Ocean has been teasing and teasing for so long that the whole things feels like it’s just too much effort. Amid the breathless social response, I’m already starting to see some backlash from people who just want him to put the damn thing out, already. Surprise releases are entirely a product of the digital age — in the physical age, logistics would have made it impossible to pull something like this off. But now, any artist can wrap an album, have all of his or her collaborators sign their lives away, and then put it out whenever they feel like it. And to be fair, this does have some benefits — if an artist wants to release something timely, they can do so easily, and they are no longer stuck dealing with restrictive release schedules. The downsides of the surprise release trend far outweigh the benefits, though. For one, surprise releases are pretty much limited to big artists — if you’re an up-and-comer and just put something out, it’s the old tree falling in the forest line playing out in the real world. Critics are so focused on breathlessly reporting the latest Easter egg clues that big artists leave that they can’t pay attention to the smaller folks might actually benefit from the coverage, and if one of those artists decides to drop an album on the same day as a smaller musician, it’s game over for them. You used to be able to pretty much predict when big albums would be out and make plans around that, and while real life could always intrude, it made it much easier to have some idea of when an album could land best, Now, all bets are off. Coupled with the surprise album trend is the rise of the exclusive surprise album, which is a further disservice to fans. Want to hear the hot new thing everyone is talking about? Be prepared to shell out an extra ten bucks and make sure to keep track of when to cancel your subscription, because almost every artist gets paid to do some sort of one-platform-only release when they drop something new. Frank Ocean is not only teasing us with his weird table-saw videos, he’s then actively screwing fans by making the album only available on Apple Music. For listeners who already pay for Spotify or Tidal, this feels like a colossal middle finger in the face — and as we saw with the explosion of piracy in the wake of Kanye’s exclusive release, many fans take out their frustration by illegally downloading the album rather than paying up. We’ve established that surprise releases are bad for most artists and terrible for fans — yet why do artists and streaming services keep doing this? For artists, many of them probably do it because it’s the thing to do — all their peers are doing it, and it’s probably more fun to make some daffy online videos and drop clues on Snapchat than it is to do a two-month press tour all centered around one big date. Then there’s the money — streaming services are cutting huge advance checks, and even if the result is massive piracy, the financial gamble can pay off in the short term. Streaming services see this as the best customer acquisition model, although it’s debatable as to whether or not it works in the long term. It certainly jukes the stats in the short run, and if they’re looking to be sold or impress shareholders, those numbers seem shiny. And of course, a certain number of those who sign up for a free trial only to hear one record will forget to cancel and stay on as zombie users. But eventually users are going to get sick of being manipulated to sign up for multiple services that offer virtually the same content across the board — and they’ll likely just go back to torrenting. Hopefully the surprise release trend will start to wane as fans voice their frustration. There are still plenty of ways artists can release content regularly and keep listeners happy without having to put out new releases whenever they feel like it. I’m just looking forward to the day a pop star embraces the cool, “old-school” trend of picking a release date, doing press around it, and putting an album out wide on the selected day. Here’s hoping that comes back around soon.   Related articles Spotify Shares Latest Premium Subscriber Stats "In Case You Are Reviewing Any New Music Services This Week" Bill Siddons, Jeremy Rosen Launch Roxwell Management Last Week's Most Read Posts On Hypebot A Day In The Life Of A Full-Time Musician - hypebot Frank Ocean Teases New Release With Stream Only Available To Apple Users - hypebot Frank Ocean's New Album 'Boys Don't Cry' will Drop Friday Posted by Guest Post on 08/09/2016 in Major Labels, More News, Music Business | Permalink Comments Why Surprise Album Releases Are The Worst [Cortney Harding] As part of a growing trend only made possible in the digital age, an increasing number of high-profile artists are choosing to drop their albums suddenly and without warning, which can be a problem for both smaller artists and fans.

The A11 is reportedly based on the 10nm manufacturing process, meaning that the chips will provide more power while being more efficient. The new chips are said to utilize TSMC’s integrated fan-out and wafer-level packaging technologies. Samsung has previously been a supplier of A-series chips but Apple has gradually been shifting its business to TSMC. It can’t be said for sure at this point in time if Apple is going to rely on Samsung as well for its A11 processors. Nothing has been officially confirmed by Apple as yet, but it’s likely that the new chips will be powering the 2017 iPhones. Apple is expected to introduce a major overhaul for the iPhone next year. It may finally make the shift to OLED displays as well. This is one of the reasons why it’s believed that the iPhones due next month are going to be an incremental update because Apple is saving all of the good stuff for 2017. It’s been a while since the company introduced major updates to its smartphone and a powerful 10nm processor will certainly open up a world of possibility on an overhauled iPhone.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple is expected to release a second-generation Apple Watch with new sensors later this year, but the company could be working on an even more powerful health-focused device for 2017. A new report from the Economic Daily News offers some details on the “killer new product,” but doesn’t go into much detail. The new product would be able to measure your heart rate and pulse, along with your blood sugar levels, the report said. The current Apple Watch can already do two of those, but blood sugar data would be something new. Still, that’s not necessarily enough to make this a “killer” gadget. Let’s also not forget the early original Apple Watch rumors also pointed to these sorts of advanced sensors. It’s also unclear if this alleged new gadget is another Apple Watch or something else entirely. However, Cupertino has previously stated it doesn’t want to push too far into the health arena with its smartwatch. That way the company can skip the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, which might otherwise slow down its upgrade cycle. It seems more likely this mysterious new product will be something else entirely. We don’t have much to go on for now, but we may learn more in 2017 if this rumor is accurate. In the meantime, we’re looking forward to the new Apple Watch models allegedly set to launch later this year.

Apple denies iPhone price fixing in Russia Fortune 8/9/2016 Reuters Apple on Tuesday rejected allegations from Russia’s state competition watchdog it may have been involved in fixing prices for iPhones, saying resellers set their own prices. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.76 -1.04 -0.93% Apple reacted a day after Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said it had opened a case into the allegations after a consumer had pointed out that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. Apple, in emailed comments, said it did not oblige Russian resellers to fix prices for its products. “Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world,” the company’s press office said. FAS said it was looking into the idea that Apple had somehow obliged Russian resellers to treat its recommended product prices as mandatory. It said an investigation had shown that retailers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. FAS has the power to fine firms it finds guilty of price fixing.

Outside of measuring your heart rate and blood sugar, the report is rather vague. While the Apple Watch already measures your heart rate, monitoring blood sugar hardly sounds like a killer feature. Also, Tim Cook himself has said that Apple wants to separate health products from the Watch to avoid FDA approvals slowing down the process. We don’t want to put the watch through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process. I wouldn’t mind putting something adjacent to the watch through it, but not the watch, because it would hold us back from innovating too much, the cycles are too long. But you can begin to envision other things that might be adjacent to it — maybe an app, maybe something else. Tim’s statement holds true, too. The current Apple Watch has a disabled pulse oximeter which could read O2 saturation levels. Tags: Apple Watch, health About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology.

According to a credible new report, it will feature the long-rumoured dual-lens camera, no headphone jack and a capacitive home button. In an article published this week, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said people "familiar with" the iPhone 7 confirmed the various rumours circulating online. Apple will stick with the same basic aluminium chassis as it has used on the iPhone 6 and 6s, focusing instead on improving the hardware and photographic capabilities of the phone for this year's release. Gurman's unnamed insider sources informed him that the iPhone 7's standout features will be a new dual-lens camera system, a revised home key that's no longer a physical button and a single Lightning port to be used for power, data and now audio connections. It is thought that Apple will launch three versions of this year's iPhone, the basic model followed by larger Plus and Pro variants. The dual-lens camera may make an appearance only on the Pro model, due to the internal space constraints of the smaller handsets. The dual camera sensors are said to be able to produce brighter, clearer photos than single sensor systems. Each sensor operates independently and is tuned for different light conditions. When the user takes a photo, both sensors capture an image. The two pictures are then digitally combined to create a single high-resolution photo with enhanced quality. iPhone 7 Plus leaked images [via nowhereelse.fr] Nowhereelse.fr The second major feature, the revised home button, will be present on every version of the iPhone 7. For the first time ever, Apple will launch an iPhone without a physical home button, installing a capacitive touch-sensitive one in its place on the bottom bezel. To replicate the distinctive "click" of the traditional button, Apple will employ haptic feedback. The pressure-sensitive home key, possibly using Apple's 3D Touch technology to handle several different functions, will vibrate each time it is pressed, mimicking the feel of the iPhone 6s' physical button. The final significant change for the iPhone 7 will be the removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack. The move is likely to be highly controversial as Apple pushes its own Lightning port as the standard for audio connections. Apple will need to convince initially sceptical consumers that it's time to do away with their universally compatible 3.5mm accessories. It won't be an easy push and is likely to be resisted for some time. Only a handful of Android phone manufacturers have already removed the 3.5mm jack and replaced it with the more widely accepted USB-C port, viewed by many as a more future-proof standard than Apple's Lightning connector. With quarterly iPhone sales now in decline, Apple needs the iPhone 7 to be a holiday hit. Bloomberg's report confirms what other sources have been reporting for a while, however. The phone won't have any truly innovative features, nor will it offer anything substantial that can't be found elsewhere. The dual-lens camera could prove to be a selling point but previous reports have suggested its technology is currently immature. Rivals like Samsung's Galaxy S7 have surpassed the iPhone's image quality in recent years and Apple is now playing catch-up. In some ways, the iPhone 7 looks to be a reprise of the 6s, further improving hardware but still not introducing a new design. That will come in 2017 with the introduction of a glass and metal body. Apple will make minor exterior tweaks with the iPhone 7, notably removing the plastic antenna bands from the rear of the phone, but will save the complete chassis overhaul for next year. The company will be reliant on the "iPhone 10th Anniversary Edition" to resurrect its flagging hardware sales, finally providing consumers with what they've been requesting.

Reports and leaks suggest that, beyond removing the headphone jack and introducing a touch-sensitive home button, the upcoming iPhone 7 will look pretty much the same as the last two models. However, it may be what's under the hood that counts. Despite last year's iPhone 6s receiving a big boost to processing power, the next generation could see another leap. Benchmark tests, supposedly leaked from China, suggest that the new device could be even more powerful than the high-speed iPad Pro. Leaked iPhone specs Screenshots from Geekbench, a processor benchmarking tool used to determine how fast devices are, appear to have emerged on Chinese internet forums showing details of the iPhone 7, and published by Dutch blog TechTastic. The benchmark shows a device running iOS 10, the upcoming software, with 3GB of RAM and a 2.37GHz processor. In RAM terms this represents a 50 per cent upgrade on last year. Supposed iPhone 7 specs Credit: TechTastic The Geekbench performance scores show 3,548 and 6,430 for single core and multi-core respectively. That compares to 2,490 and 4,405  for the iPhone 6s and 3,224 and 5,446 for the iPad Pro. Although Apple watchers have questioned how reliable the supposed leaks are, the iPhone 7 has been rumoured to have 3GB of RAM before. iPhone release dates 'Space black' colour The iPhone already comes in black, but it seems like the iPhone 7 might come in something that could be described as none more black, or more likely - "space black". Twitter user The Malignant recently posted what they claimed to be the rear shell of a space black iPhone 7. Given that the Apple Watch already comes in such a colour, this isn't such a stretch. #Apple #iPhone7 SPACE BLACK variant 1st act >>> Mute button 2nd act >>> SIM-tray FINAL ACT >>> Real Machine pic.twitter.com/AYnypb2RzM— The Malignant (@the_malignant) August 7, 2016  Apple has also been rumoured to be introducing a blue iPhone 7. Touch ID power button on MacBook It's been a while since we've had a new MacBook Pro, but the wait could be worth it with a number of upgrades to the laptop line possibly going to be announced at the same time as Apple reveals the iPhone 7 in September. According to 9to5Mac, the laptop's power button could be equipped with Touch ID, possibly making the computer more secure and rendering passwords obsolete. The new laptops are also expected to have a touch-sensitive bar along the top, with an OLED panel that can be adjusted depending on what it's being used for. Release date In typical Apple fashion, the iPhone 7 is likely to be unveiled in early September at an event in California, and go on sale a few days later. It is likely to be an action-packed event, with the company expected to unveil a new Apple Watch and MacBook laptops, as well as possibly an upgraded iPad Pro. iphone 7: what will it look like   Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Apple iOS iPhone Show more Technology latest 23 Nov 2016, 4:30pm Parking chaos as payment app RingGo offline across the country  23 Nov 2016, 11:24am Facebook 'prepares to suppress posts in bid to enter China' 23 Nov 2016, 11:02am How much of the UK has mobile phone coverage?

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Report alleges fierce competition forced Apple to ditch single-lens iPhone 7 model By Christian Zibreg, Aug 9, 2016 Tweet 36 Comments Based on leaked components, supply chain chatter and analyst reports, it’s fairly safe to conclude that Apple will release two iPhone models come this fall—a 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. For a while, word on the street was that a third, premium iPhone 7 model was in the works as well, referred to in press reports as ‘iPhone 7 Pro’. The logic was, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus would have regular cameras while the Pro model would come outfitted with a dual-lens system. As alleged by a Japanese outlet, Apple has killed off the iPhone 7 Pro for good earlier in the summer after experiencing soft iPhone demand amid increased competition. Apple originally planned for: 4.7″ iPhone 7 with single-lens camera 5.5″ iPhone 7 Plus with single-lens camera Pricier 5.5″ iPhone 7 Plus with dual-lens camera (that’s your ‘iPhone 7 Pro’) But then changed its mind: 4.7″ iPhone 7 with single-lens camera 5.5″ iPhone 7 Plus with dual-lens camera From the Nikkei report earlier this morning, emphasis mine Since the beginning of 2016, Apple has been grappling with weakening appetite for its premium iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus handsets across the globe. It is the first time that Apple has come under such pressure since it launched iPhones in 2007. The competition is so fierce that Apple killed off a premium iPhone 7 model in the second quarter, less than six months before its official launch in September, according to a source. Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched, the source said. So there you have it. Now we know that Apple has come to the realization that offering two iPhone 7 Plus models, one with a regular camera and a higher-priced premium model with a dual-lens camera, won’t fly with cash-strapped consumers amid heightened competition. Instead, the Cupertino company figured—and I’m glad they did—that they better build all of iPhone 7 Pro’s exclusive technologies, like a dual-lens camera, into the “regular” iPhone 7 Plus model without imposing a $100 premium on the consumers. As a sourced quoted in the report succinctly summed it up: This never happened before. Before this year, Apple never made changes to iPhone’s product line mere months before the launch. It has been a volatile year for Apple. I’m a strong believer in fierce competition. Source: Nikkei Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Report confirms iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus names, no iPhone 7 Pro tier Claimed ‘iPhone 7 Pro’ shown on newly leaked photos Rumor: Apple could add new Jet White finish to iPhone 7 lineup iPhone 7 is water resistant but liquid damage is not covered under Apple’s warranty Related Topics Apple, iPhone, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7 Pro, News, Rumors Farhan What Nikkei said: “Initially, Apple had planned two versions of iPhone 7 Plus, one with a single lens and one with a dual lens. The single lens edition has since been ditched, the source said.” What you said:”Apple killed off the iPhone 7 Pro earlier in the summer after experiencing soft iPhone demand amid increased competition” igorsky How about this brilliant bit of journalism: “Now we know that Apple has come to the realization that offering two iPhone 7 Plus models, one with a regular camera and a higher-priced premium model with a dual-lens camera, won’t fly…” This conclusion was literally pulled out of the writers ass by the editor. Christian Zibreg Yes, that is clearly my opinion. igorsky Is that what it is? Because to me it reads so though you’ve drawn some erroneous conclusions based on reports and chatter. Maybe it’s just me. Tommy Gumbs The article was full of junk based off of junk. It happens. They all can be good….or based on facts. besrate hogsa Not just you igorsky I’ll be the one to think critically on your behalf. You’re welcome. besrate hogsa Oh! thank you for thanking yourself on behalf of us Jurassic “This conclusion was literally pulled out of the writers ass by the editor.” Exactly! Perhaps the “alleged” comment came from someone who was totally unaware that more than a year ago Apple bought a company called LinX that specializes in multi-lens cameras hardware and software. So Apple has been working on developing the dual lens camera for at least that long, and probably longer! Only a person with no clue of how long these types of new technologies take to develop, would think that the dual-lens camera was a “last minute decision” by Apple. Christian Zibreg I’m pretty sure you missed my LinX acquisition post http://www.idownloadblog.com/2015/04/14/apple-buys-linx-imaging/ Nobody said, not the report or yours truly, that it was a last minute decision. Assuming what the source said is right, Apple has been developing three devices in parallel and ditched one of them. Not the first time the did just that. Not sure why the angst… Christian Zibreg Replace “Now we know” part in your comment with “At least we can speculate”, delete the “writer’s ass” part of your comment and you’ll be fine. Thank you… By the way, I haven’t outright deleted your comment, but maybe I should have? There’s no need for that kind of language because we’re not some shit people, you know. Also, it’s unfair to a vast majority of other commenters who can express their difference in opinion without resorting to disgusting remarks. Impreza Christian, that’s part of the problem with iDB and many other (blog)sites, you’re reporting IS below par, full of innuendo, hearsay, the list goes on. Rather than try to improve and accept people express their opinions differently, you choose to focus on the word ‘ass’ as if he used the f word or the c word. Man up (or are you going to get offended by that term) and pay attention to the criticism because it is bloody spot on. Your writing will improve as well as your english and the flow on effect will be commenters not having to resort to such descriptions. But then again you can always delete comments like your colleagues do and carry on with sub pat blogging. Your choice. Anthony Bouchard You can comment and be respectful at the same time. We are very lax here at iDB and are open to criticism, but downright degradation of character in the comments will not be tolerated. We do not talk down to you, and we do not expect to be talked down to either. I would suggest trying to improve your comment scheme, using words more like “please and thank you” rather than dirty words that none of us are frankly interested in reading, much less responding to. YaBoyLilMayo U sound hurt Andrew Fuss Lol. That’s kinda true. Christian Zibreg The semantical differences between the two quotes being? Christian Zibreg Replace “iPhone 7 Pro” in the What You Said part of your comment with “iPhone 7 Plus with a single-lens” and you’ll be fine. Thank you. Timothy Sorry, we don’t have write access to the article. You’ll need to do that yourself. Reading the first paragraph, I assumed the headline was incorrect, as it sounded like they trashed the dual-camera version, not the single-camera. Chindavon Three models would have been really annoying. Xee Would have really pissed me off for sure. armyk Let’s just hope prices will remain the same. Even though I wish it would go 100$ less for all models, but I doubt that… Dany Quirion Cry me a river price went from 729 to 899$ in 1 year in Canada (thx economy) Andrieux Querido In Brazil the 6s Plus 64GB is $1424. Very expensive. Elias Chao I guess they will add extra $50 to the base model since they’re likely to start selling it with 32GB. armyk I don’t think so. I think price will remain the same. 8gb used to be base then 16gb, no price increasse because of that. I was scared to have Pro model which would be 100$ extra to 7 Plus which is already 100$ extra to 7 Dany Quirion They wont increase the price, if anything they will lower it to 600$ in the us, they are already losing tons of sales since the oil crashed and brought down many currencies. Rowan09 Well seeing they are suppose to get rid of the 16GB for 32GB, 64GB for 128GB and add a 256GB it is a $100 less. Ashy Larry ‘Now we know’?!? Lol n0ahcruz3 And the consumer wins! Thank you samsung! It prevented Apple from making another mistake lol igorsky Yes! Samsung’s years of stealing and copying has paid off somehow! Rowan09 It’s because of Samsung says who? Apple was never going to release a Pro model and charge $100 just for a camera, but hey maybe so because that’s basically what Samsung is doing with the Note 7, charging a premium for a stylus and iris scanner. n0ahcruz3 Its a joke lol chill dude why so serious? Rowan09 Prasoon Singh Good. We don’t need multiple iPhones like how Samsung had tons of phones. Just stick with three models and that’s it. Andrieux Querido I hope so , because its ridiculous to make a Pro version. all for the $$$ Apple , cmon James G Good.

 'It's been a volatile year': Apple kills iPhone model months before launch Kif Leswing Aug. 9, 2016, 12:00 PM 78,847 facebook linkedin twitter email print Nowhereelse.fr Earlier this year, analysts predicted that Apple would release three new iPhone models in 2016. Some leaked factory photos have also shown three models, like the one to the right. But in an interesting twist, Apple is likely to only release two new models of iPhone this fall, according to Bloomberg. And now sources have told Nikkei that there were in fact three models in the cards, but one of them has since been cut.  Apple had planned to release two versions of the bigger iPhone, one with two lenses and one with a more traditional single lens. The single-lens version won't be coming out, according to the report.  "This never happened before. Before this year, Apple never made changes to iPhone's product line mere months before the launch. It has been a volatile year for Apple," a source told Nikkei. Instead, Apple is preparing an iPhone for release in 2017 that could drive a "powder keg" of sales. That device is expected to come in a glass body, with an edge-to-edge screen, and wireless charging. Nikkei reports that Foxconn has started to develop glass casings, and one of Apple's aluminum suppliers previously confirmed the plans to release a glass iPhone.  We're expecting Apple to launch its next iPhone in September. Here's what we think we know: There will be two models, one with a 4.7-inch screen and one with a 5.5-inch screen. The larger iPhone will come with a camera with two lenses, which will allow for better zoom and image fidelity. The smaller iPhone will still have an improved camera. Both models will be more waterproof. Both models will lack a headphone port, forcing users to connect USB headphones or plug-in through Apple's charging port.

Marketing Bootcamp 21 Simple Ideas for a Successful Small Business Saturday Marketing Bootcamp 5 Business-Blogging Mistakes -- and How to Fix Them Marketing Bootcamp Beat the Marketing Competition With Data Analysis ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 9, 2016 Apple’s App Store is the second largest app store in the world, with roughly 2 million apps available for download. It follows second only to Android-based apps, which boasts 2.2 million in its store. Related: 3 Essentials for Marketing Your Mobile App Given some predictions that the app market will surge to $101 billion by 2020, anyone seeking to obtain more users and downloads of their app would be wise to consider Apple’s new search ads. These new App Store search ads promise to target users with a power equal to that of the major search engines, and to help companies increase their app downloads and sales. The App Store buzz Apple initially sparked buzz around the changes being made to its app store by announcing two policy changes which opened app developers up to a whole new world of potential. First, the company said it will reward app creators who retain customers more than a year: The company will do this through digital subscriptions by dropping Apple’s cut of its revenues by 15 percent. In other words, if you, the developer, are good at what you do, Apple wants to reward you, because it’s in the company's best interest to have happy, satisfied app store customers. The second big change is that all categories, not just a few, will now be open to the subscription model. This was a huge change -- especially for the gaming world -- creating great profit potential for app developers and the companies behind them. Both of these changes are intended to get more users into the App Store, and to get more apps into the hands of users, with more profits returning to app developers who create apps people never tire of. It’s great news for customers, developers and Apple alike. Related: 25 Creative Ways to Promote Your App For Free App Store ads: now playing near you The next big change in policy Apple made is around its Apple App Store ads: The company will now display search ads for apps in the iOS App Store search results. If you’re used to using Google AdWords, the look and feel of the ads will seem very familiar, as will the back-end panel you’ll use to set up and create your ads and campaigns. It’s hard to improve on an already-solid model that customers are familiar with; and Apple seems to have no desire to reinvent the entire world of search ads. Campaigns, ad groups and keywords can be organized on the dashboard, with ads displayed based on what users are searching for. You can set up your budget based on cost-per-tap (CPT) or cost-per-install (CPA). As other search platforms do, Apple’s App Store search engine ads enable you to target customers based on specific information, such as location and languages spoken, in addition to targets like age, gender and device owned -- information that isn’t available on your typical search-engine advertising platform. The bad news about the platform is that, as of right now, users can’t set up their own ads. Ads are generated based on the content you input into the system to create your apps. That’s why it’s critical to pay attention to the keywords you use when you create your app’s page and description, as well as all other meta data used to create your app’s page on the site. Keep this in mind, too, if you’re running an App Store campaign: You may want to tweak your app-page copy to improve its download stats and to make it more appealing to browsers looking for an app in the search function. Because what you put into the description and title fields is what shows up on your ad, attention to detail counts. Who should try App Store ads? Companies that balked at the App Store’s “Apple Tax,” as Spotify dubbed Apple’s higher-than-average 30 percent fees on user subscriptions, may want to try App Store ads and placement once again. The change in fee structure, along with the move to open up categories for subscription models, is a powerful incentive for placing your apps back on the App Store or developing new ones for customers’ insatiable appetites for games, lifestyle content and social networks. Customers eager to find their next gaming addiction are already searching the App Store for information. Placing ads which target potential customers right at a critical moment of interest and decision makes perfect sense.

Marketing Bootcamp 21 Simple Ideas for a Successful Small Business Saturday Marketing Bootcamp 5 Business-Blogging Mistakes -- and How to Fix Them Marketing Bootcamp Beat the Marketing Competition With Data Analysis ON-DEMAND EVENT STRATEGIES TO GROW YOUR BUSINESS Watch Now August 9, 2016 Apple’s App Store is the second largest app store in the world, with roughly 2 million apps available for download. It follows second only to Android-based apps, which boasts 2.2 million in its store. Related: 3 Essentials for Marketing Your Mobile App Given some predictions that the app market will surge to $101 billion by 2020, anyone seeking to obtain more users and downloads of their app would be wise to consider Apple’s new search ads. These new App Store search ads promise to target users with a power equal to that of the major search engines, and to help companies increase their app downloads and sales. The App Store buzz Apple initially sparked buzz around the changes being made to its app store by announcing two policy changes which opened app developers up to a whole new world of potential. First, the company said it will reward app creators who retain customers more than a year: The company will do this through digital subscriptions by dropping Apple’s cut of its revenues by 15 percent. In other words, if you, the developer, are good at what you do, Apple wants to reward you, because it’s in the company's best interest to have happy, satisfied app store customers. The second big change is that all categories, not just a few, will now be open to the subscription model. This was a huge change -- especially for the gaming world -- creating great profit potential for app developers and the companies behind them. Both of these changes are intended to get more users into the App Store, and to get more apps into the hands of users, with more profits returning to app developers who create apps people never tire of. It’s great news for customers, developers and Apple alike. Related: 25 Creative Ways to Promote Your App For Free App Store ads: now playing near you The next big change in policy Apple made is around its Apple App Store ads: The company will now display search ads for apps in the iOS App Store search results. If you’re used to using Google AdWords, the look and feel of the ads will seem very familiar, as will the back-end panel you’ll use to set up and create your ads and campaigns. It’s hard to improve on an already-solid model that customers are familiar with; and Apple seems to have no desire to reinvent the entire world of search ads. Campaigns, ad groups and keywords can be organized on the dashboard, with ads displayed based on what users are searching for. You can set up your budget based on cost-per-tap (CPT) or cost-per-install (CPA). As other search platforms do, Apple’s App Store search engine ads enable you to target customers based on specific information, such as location and languages spoken, in addition to targets like age, gender and device owned -- information that isn’t available on your typical search-engine advertising platform. The bad news about the platform is that, as of right now, users can’t set up their own ads. Ads are generated based on the content you input into the system to create your apps. That’s why it’s critical to pay attention to the keywords you use when you create your app’s page and description, as well as all other meta data used to create your app’s page on the site. Keep this in mind, too, if you’re running an App Store campaign: You may want to tweak your app-page copy to improve its download stats and to make it more appealing to browsers looking for an app in the search function. Because what you put into the description and title fields is what shows up on your ad, attention to detail counts. Who should try App Store ads? Companies that balked at the App Store’s “Apple Tax,” as Spotify dubbed Apple’s higher-than-average 30 percent fees on user subscriptions, may want to try App Store ads and placement once again. The change in fee structure, along with the move to open up categories for subscription models, is a powerful incentive for placing your apps back on the App Store or developing new ones for customers’ insatiable appetites for games, lifestyle content and social networks. Customers eager to find their next gaming addiction are already searching the App Store for information. Placing ads which target potential customers right at a critical moment of interest and decision makes perfect sense. With their fingers poised, ready to install a new app, these customers are the ones most likely to respond to your ads. Few other advertising methods offer such a time-sensitive way of targeting advertising during the portion of the buying cycle where customers are more likely to buy.

Not just because the “tick” year of Apple’s tick-tock releases is generally the bigger year in sales, but because this version of the iPhone looks and acts different from the last one. While the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus were bigger than the iPhone 5s, and the iPhone 5 was bigger than the iPhone 4s, functionality has been largely the same since the beginning of the device line. Today a new feature rumor has been reinforced. The home button on the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be new. Word from Bloomberg re-affirms the possibility of a pressure-sensitive home button that does not physically press in. There’ll be no moving parts on the outside of this iPhone’s home button, that is to say. This new home button would work with haptic feedback to let the user know that they’ve successfully pressed the button. How this will affect how users take screenshots, we do not yet know. This will also likely give hackers a harder time when hard-rebooting the device and so on and so forth. Have a peek at the (extremely blurry) touch-sensitive home button photo from back in June of this year. There’ll be Touch ID behind the home button, too, of course. The back-facing camera array on the iPhone 7 Plus has been a topic of some controversy over the past few weeks. What will it do? What’s the point of having two cameras? Anonymous tips seem to suggest that the cameras will work – on a basic level – very similarly to other dual-camera smartphone releases from the past several years. Both cameras would take a photo, those two photos are then combined to make one super photo. It’s suggested this week that the cameras also allow the iPhone 7 Plus to capture photos in dark areas far better than any iPhone released before.

M Wednesday, Nov 23 2016 | Updated at 01:26 PM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Video Aug 09, 2016 08:23 AM EDT By Sarene Mae Butao, UniversityHerald Reporter Apple Announces Bug Bounty Program: The Company Will Pay Up To $200,000 For Vulnerabitlities Apple will pay researchers who can hack the company's software. (Photo : Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images) Previously, Apple did not pay security researchers who report security problems, vulnerabilities, and bugs in their software. However, it all changed when the head of Apple security announced the company's bug bounty program. The head of Apple security, Ivan Krstic, announced that the company will pay up to $200,000 to researchers who is able to find and report vulnerabilities in the Apple software. The Apple security bounty program was announced during the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, CNET reported. However, bug bounty program is not open for all. The program, which will initially launch in September, will only include a group of cybersecurity researcher that the company has previously worked with. But if somebody else outside the group makes a report, the company would consider paying him/her. As Krstic said, it is not meant to be an exclusive club. The bounties would include a $25,000 reward for loopholes that let hackers into Apple's digital compartments or customer's data. Apple will pay $50,000 for bugs that makes holes into the iCloud data and a whopping $200,000 to those who can prove vulnerabilities that are critical to Apple's firmware, New York Times reported. Bug bounties have long been utilized by the big software makers such as Yahoo, Microsoft, Chrysler, and even the United Airlines. Last month, Google claimed they paid a total of $550,000 to people who found vulnerabilities in the Android software. Facebook, on the other hand, said that their bug bounty program has given away over $4.3 million to more than 800 cybersecurity researchers around the world. Apple has been known to be a less target for hackers because of two reasons. First, because it has a small market share, and second, because Apple products tend to be more secure. The US Department of Justice has paid an unknown hacker to unlock the iPhone left by one of the shooters in the San Bernardino terrorist attack after the company hesitate to crack the encryption. This scenario could have been avoided if only Apple had been paying bug bounties for critical vulnerabilities, said Securosis CEO Rich Mogull. He also pointed out that Apple cannot out-pay the government who can pay $1 million.     Tags apple, Bug-Bounty Program, Bug Bounty, Hack, Cybersecurity, Ivan Krstic, Software © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

It is now officially licensed to sell clean electricity too, in an rare move that could save the company hundreds of millions of dollars in energy costs and corporate taxes. The California tech giant last week won federal approval to start selling electricity, on top of its iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, watches and headphones. Rather than buying solar and wind electricity from another operator, like most technology firms do, Apple can also sell the juice from its own clean power plants.  The iPhone maker is part of a growing group of companies pledging to run most or all of their operations on renewable energy. Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon, for example, have also invested in wind farms and solar plants to help power their data centers and warehouses — a move that cuts both greenhouse gas emissions and energy and tax bills. While apps, files, emails, Pokémons and other digital trappings seem to exist only in the cloud, the facilities needed to store and process that data are extremely energy-intensive.  View photos The Apple Store in New York City's Upper West Side.More Image: kena betancur/Getty Images Data centers use anywhere from 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. In the U.S., these spaces account for roughly 2 percent of the nation's total energy consumption. Internet-focused companies are facing pressure from environmental groups and their shareholders to power data centers not with coal or natural gas but with emissions-free alternatives. The activist group Greenpeace, for instance, ranks these companies as dirty or green in its annual “Click Clean” report. In response to such scrutiny and their growing energy footprints, more companies in tech and other sectors are investing in renewables. View photos Image: GREENPEACE Last year, large corporations signed contracts to buy a record 3,200 megawatts of clean energy capacity. That equals about half of all the “power purchase agreements” signed in 2015, in an industry usually dominated by utilities. “It's a dramatic change from even five years ago,” Jenny Heeter, senior energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, told Mashable.  The tech sector's focus on renewables has been a big boost for the broader U.S. transition to cleaner energy sources. In 2014, the IT industry bought about 8.3 million megawatt-hours of renewable energy, about 17 percent of all the electricity sold in New York State, according to federal energy data.    By 2020, the tech sector could buy between 18.5 million and 37 million megawatt-hours of renewables, NREL estimated. That's more than 16 percent of all the electricity used in California.   “We have seen more and more companies making these 100-percent renewables goals and looking for ways to buy renewables,” Heeter said. “It’s definitely becoming a large market.” Greening Apple Apple’s latest effort to sell clean electricity — not just buy it — is relatively unique in the tech industry. Among its peers, only Google’s parent Alphabet has federal approval to sell wholesale power, which it won in 2010. The strategy has three key benefits for the tech giants: It bolsters their green credentials and cuts their environmental footprint; it gives them independence from the broader U.S. electric grid; and it eases a portion of their total tax burdens. “It is a big step, and not all companies want to be in the energy business,” Heeter said. “We don’t expect that would be a common strategy for all IT companies,” she added. On Aug. 4, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorized Apple’s subsidiary Apple Energy LLC to sell wholesale energy, power capacity and other services needed to provide reliable electricity. The FERC filing "supports our plan for 100 percent renewable energy," Apple told Mashable. Apple said it sought federal approval so it could sell wholesale power from its California Flats Project with First Solar, a major U.S. solar company, and the utility Pacific Gas & Electric. Apple CEO Tim Cook in February 2015 announced an $850 million deal to buy 130 megawatts of solar power capacity over 25 years from the project in Monterey County.  That should power all of Apple’s California stores, offices, headquarters and a data center. But it's still a tiny slice — 0.01 percent — of America's total power capacity of nearly 1.2 million megawatts, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates.  California Flats will eventually encompass 2,900 acres of land and more than double in size, to 280 megawatts of solar capacity. Apple will then own all of the project's output. With the project, Apple will pay less per unit of electricity than it pays now to buy from a utility company.  The move should save the company "hundreds of millions of dollars" in avoided energy costs, Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environmental initiatives and former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said at Wall Street Journal's ECO:nomics conference in March 2015. Apple consumed 966 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2015 across all its U.S. and global facilities, the company estimated in its 2016 Environmental Responsibility Report.  The company said it also planned to use its power-selling abilities for other future projects. The MacBook producer already owns a handful of large solar projects in the U.S., including a 20-megawatt facility in Nevada and a 50-megawatt solar plant under construction in Arizona.  Additionally, Cook has pledged to make the company’s new “ spaceship” headquarters in Silicon Valley into the “greenest building on the planet.”  The building, still under construction, will run exclusively on renewables when it’s finished in late 2016, Cook said. Apple says the company is 93 percent reliant on renewable energy supplies worldwide, marking progress toward its goal of being a 100 percent renewable energy company.  Still, the company faces plenty of obstacles in its quest for environmental stewardship, including the heavy energy usage of its overseas manufacturing facilities and the lack of recycled materials in its products.  The dilemma isn't unique to Apple. Many major tech companies have set clean energy goals and released their consumption data, yet some of these numbers may not be completely accurate, according to several studies.  For example, in its 2015 "Click Clean" report, Greenpeace graded Amazon Web Services an F for transparency.  The Utility Approach For corporate behemoths like Apple and Google, each with market caps of more than $500 billion, there can be financial benefits to owning clean energy projects outright, rather than just signing long-term power contracts. Companies with a sufficiently large tax liability can tap into a pair of federal incentives designed to encourage more investment in clean energy.  The Investment Tax Credit gives tax breaks to owners of residential and commercial solar projects that is worth 30 percent of project costs. The Production Tax Credit gives wind farm developers 2.3 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity that the turbines produce. The tax breaks not only help make clean electricity cheaper; they also chip away at huge corporate tax bills. For companies that own solar and wind farms, however, they may not need to use 100 percent of the electricity their projects produce. And if they have excess supplies, then it makes sense for their subsidiaries to sell the extra electrons into the wholesale market and generate revenue, NREL's Heeter explained. “It gives them some extra flexibility … and the ability to make sure that any excess electricity is sold into the market, instead of not being used,” she said.  Google said its subsidiary, Google Energy LLC, buys and sells power in the wholesale markets in areas where it can’t directly supply its data centers with renewable energy. View photos The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, owned by Google, NRG Energy and BrightSource Energy,  sits in the Mojave Desert in California.More Image: Ethan Miller/Getty Images But other companies aren’t likely to take the leap toward selling energy, either because it doesn’t make financial sense or they don’t want the extra hassle. The strategy requires a substantial investment in time and resources. Google and Apple, for instance, both created separate subsidiaries to run their energy operations. Applying for regulatory approval is also a long, expensive process laden with paperwork. “It’s not an easy process, and many companies see it as not really their core business,” Heeter said. So although major IT firms are investing heavily in renewables, most are unlikely to see federal regulatory approval.  Purchasing Power  The more common approach for companies is to sign long-term power purchase agreements with another developer, which Google and Apple also do. The deals are generally considered less risky and cumbersome than owning a power plant outright.  “You’re just buying the output. Then it’s up to somebody else to manage how those renewables get put on the grid,” Heeter said. Microsoft, for example, has signed two 20-year power purchase agreements: one to buy 175 megawatts of wind energy from a project in Illinois, and the other to buy 110 megawatts from a North Texas wind farm. With those agreements, and by buying wind, solar and hydropower straight from the grid, Microsoft has been able to power 44 percent of its data centers with renewable energy, the company said. “But this means we have the opportunity to do even more,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.  The Redmond, Washington-based software giant recently announced a new goal to power 50 percent of its data centers with clean power by the end of 2018. When asked if Microsoft would create a Microsoft Energy, a spokesperson said: "We’re committed to playing a role in accelerating the transition to a clean energy infrastructure, whether that is through the purchase of a project, or backing projects through long-term purchase commitments." Facebook said it powered 35 percent of its data centers with renewable energy in 2015 and also aims to reach 50 percent by 2018.   View photos Facebook's data center in Prineville, Oregon.More Image: Facebook Two of Facebook’s data centers in Iowa and in Sweden are powered by renewable energy. Data centers currently under construction in Ireland and Fort Worth, Texas will be entirely powered by wind energy. Facebook declined to comment on whether the Menlo Park-based company has plans to create a subsidiary for energy selling like Apple and Google.  As for Amazon — which is drawing more and more of its profits from powering the internet through Amazon Web Services —  the e-commerce giant set a goal to power 40 percent of its facilities with renewables by the end of this year. The company oversees three wind farms — in Indiana, North Carolina and Ohio — and one solar farm in Virginia.  Other tech giants have taken new steps into renewable energy and have committed to a 100 percent goal. This year, Salesforce signed two power purchase agreements with wind farms in Texas and West Virginia.  “As a cloud company, it is our responsibility to seek out clean energy sources to power our data centers,” said Patrick Flynn, director of sustainability at Salesforce.  This post was updated to reflect the correct figures for electricity use in New York State and California.  Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Hospitalized rapper Kanye West said to be in spiritual crisis Reuters Thinking about buying a Google Pixel?

The regulator accused the company of colluding with retailers to lock prices of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus devices in the country.  ( Pixabay ) Advertisement Russia's federal antitrust regulator has started a suit against Apple and a few Russian smartphone retailers, on account of alleged price-fixing of iPhones. The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) states that it is running an investigation to discover whether or not Apple and 16 Russian resellers agreed to lock iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus prices beginning in October 2015. The regulator underlines that the prices were stable across the board and over a significant period of time. According to its website, the FAS considered that such a coincidence could be the outcome of a negotiation between Apple and local resellers. "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world," the OEM notes. The helm of FAS's anti-monopoly unit, Andrei Filimonov, previously affirmed that his unit is studying the possibility of iPhone price-fixing. Filimonov noted that the culprits could receive fines in value of 15 percent of iPhone sales revenue. As the relations between the U.S. and Russia have hit the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, U.S. businesses in Russia were constantly under fire. It did not help that the European Union and the U.S. sanctioned Russia after its annexation of Crimea in March 2014. In retort, Russia embargoed a number of food products from the E.U. and the U.S. Two years ago, Russia's state consumer regulator temporarily closed down 12 McDonald's restaurants and subjected 100 more to thorough sanitary inspections. In 2015, McDonald's Corp. said that its expansion in Russia will continue. With Russia's increased focus on restricting human rights, tech companies slowly became a favorite dish at the regulators' table. The Russian government aims to have full control over Russia's mainly unfettered internet, which puts it at odds with tech industry representatives. In 2014, Russia passed a law that forced foreign internet companies, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to store Russian users' personal data on servers from within the country. Predictably, Western companies postponed doing so and are pushing back deadlines as much as they can. Earlier in 2016, Google lost one of its lawsuits with the FAS in a Russian court. According to the verdict, Google had purportedly utilized the massive deployment scale of its Android OS to ensure that vendors embed the company's apps and services on their devices. In 2015, Russia saw its economy plunge by 3.7 percent, as a direct result of Western sanctions and rapid decrease of the price for crude oil, the country's main export material. Although the crisis reverberated in handset sales, which dropped by 7 percent during 2015, iPhones represented 27 percent of the revenue for smartphone sellers. Russia's centrally delegated internet ombudsman, Dmitry Marinichev, chastised the regulator for locking horns with the iPhone manufacturer. Marinichev's position makes it easy for him to have a full perspective of the sector, but gives him no enforcement powers. He notes that even though vendors could be disciplined for sealing prices to a certain level, the same cannot be applied to Apple. "It's a commercial company and therefore it works on the free market and defines for itself what the pricing level should be for a given market," Marinichev says.

 Apple's iOS 10 will give users more privacy — but it could affect the advertising industry BI Intelligence Aug. 9, 2016, 11:28 AM 2,259 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Android users aren't switching to Apple's iPhone 7 THE CHATBOT MONETIZATION REPORT: Sizing the market, key strategies, and how to navigate the chatbot opportunity App users are quick to uninstall This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Last week, Apple unveiled a new update to its Limit Ad Tracking on the next version of iOS 10, which will give users much greater control over their Identifier for Advertising (IDFA). Right now, Limit Ad Tracking alerts mobile developers and advertisers that users do not want ads targeted based on their behavior, but it sends the alert with their IDFA attached. With the iOS 10 update, users who have turned on Limit Ad Tracking will effectively become anonymous to advertisers, according to Fiksu. The move is unlikely to affect Apple itself — the company discontinued its iAd business last month, making advertising less important to its bottom line. But it’s very much in line with Apple’s position as a company that upholds its users privacy over all else. The change to Limit Ad Tracking could have a noticeable affect on both iOS users and advertisers: For mobile users, it means more control over data, but could result in an increase in contextless ads. In the post-Snowden era of smartphone users, privacy is paramount. And so it makes sense that Apple would provide users with more control over their user data, especially given its highly publicized stance against the FBI. However, if no data is given to advertisers, users who have Limit Ad Tracking enabled could end up receiving poorly targeted ads. Furthermore, this data tells advertisers which users have received a specific ad campaign, and without it users could end up receiving the same campaigns multiple times.  Advertisers may end up being blamed for poorly targeted ads and will inevitably lose out on revenue. As it stands, roughly 14% of iOS users implement Limit Ad Tracking on their devices, Fiksu notes. However, even at this low number, advertisers are likely to suffer from loss of revenue. Moreover, users are likely to attribute the poor ad experiences to advertisers themselves, rather than to the use of Limit Ad Tracking. This could have the spillover effect of tarnishing a brand's name.  Apple’s increasingly stringent approach to protecting users’ personal data is reflective of a wider trend within the mobile industry. A majority of the top messaging apps likeWhatsApp offer end-to-end encryption for users by default. And those that don’t, like Facebook Messenger and Google’s upcoming Allo, provide an opt-in option for users. These apps offer more integrative features that require access to user data to work properly — like chatbots that run on artificial intelligence infused into the chat app. Turning on secure texting blocks the ability of these programs to tap into a user's messages. Moving forward, it will become increasingly common for consumers to weigh the convenience of these services against their need for personal security. Mobile security is also key for the enterprise sector. Employees are increasingly using their mobile devices to complete work tasks remotely — whether their employer wants them to or not. Mobile devices allow employees to answer emails, schedule meetings, and complete other tasks on the go. Though this practice is great for productivity, it could expose enterprise data and applications that are stored on employees' devices to hackers. We expect mobile workers — employees who use mobile devices in their work — to comprise 72% of the US workforce in 2021, up from 65% in 2016. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on enterprise mobile security that examines the rising security threats from employee use of mobile devices. It also details the policies that enterprises can implement to provide secure access to company information through employees' mobile devices, as well as the challenges in enforcing these policies. Lastly, it explains different types of solutions and offers best practices that can help enterprises keep their networks and data secure amid rising enterprise mobility activity. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: Enterprise mobility is on the rise. We expect mobile workers to comprise 72% of the US workforce in 2021. The number of malicious programs launched by hackers to target mobile is rising exponentially, and malware targeting mobile is becoming more sophisticated. Despite the security risks, companies are increasingly moving to Bring Your Own (BYO) device and app strategies for employees. These strategies improve employee satisfaction, but complicate enterprise security.  Enterprises are still struggling with several basic challenges in securely implementing BYO policies. Companies need to allow employees a fair amount of flexibility in how they use mobile devices for work so they don't bypass basic company security policies.  Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solutions provide tools for monitoring employee devices or apps and ensuring that enterprise data can't be stolen off a device. Aside from using software management tools, implementing best practices can also make BYO policies much less risky from a security standpoint. Enterprises should train employees about cybersecurity threats and gather early input from security teams. In the future, the data that enterprise mobile applications will access will increasingly reside in the cloud.  In full, the report: Looks at the most common channels for spear phishing attacks against employees. Examines the enterprise strategies governing employees' ownership and use of their own devices for work purposes. Discusses the top major security and management challenges related to Bring Your Own practices. Explains the Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) technologies organizations are using to manage employees’ mobile devices and how those devices access enterprise IT networks and data.  Highlights the best security practices for companies when putting BYO policies in place.

(Reuters/China Stringer Network) Share Written by Jean-Louis Gassée Editor, Monday Note August 09, 2016 The iPad really is a strange animal, wanting to be both a dead-simple tablet, successfully so, and trying to replace PCs, less felicitously. From day one, Steve Jobs knew this to be an open question, one the newer iPad Pros attempt to answer as they “fork” the iPad line. Consider the iPad’s eventful and paradoxical first six years: Announced in Jan. 2010, the iPad surprises with its low $499 price. Naysayers are confused and disappointed. First deliveries take place three months later. Actual users are enthusiastic; disappointed naysayers their tune: “this changes everything.” Over the next year, the iPad follows a never-seen-before meteoric rise, faster than the iPhone. Industry savants pronounce it the future of personal computing: (Provided by author) Reality sets in. The iPad is a tease, it’s not really a PC replacement! Sales plunge: (Provided by author) In June 2012, Microsoft breathes new life into the tablet genre with its Surface 2-in-1 hybrid. Looking down from its tower of aesthetic and ergonomic purity, Apple mocks the “toaster fridges.” Three years later, pragmatism bites dogmatism. Apple’s own toaster-fridge, the muscular 12.9” iPad Pro, complete with Smart Keyboard and Pencil, is introduced in Sept. 2015. The more normal-sized 9.7” iPad Pro follows in March 2016. In the most recent quarter, the iPad gained a 7% year-on-year revenue uptick, reversing its three-year-long decline. Units are still down 9%, which pushes the average iPad price up, from $415 to $490. This non-trivial 18% increase is a measure of the iPad Pro’s impact on Apple’s tablet business. And just as the business is being revived, the t-word, tablet, is becoming less fashionable. See the wording on Apple’s website: (Apple Inc.) At the end of the latest iPad Pro commercial, we see three windows (wink, wink.) (Apple Inc.) “Imagine what your computer could do,” the narration exclaims [as always, edits and emphasis mine]. “If it was an iPad Pro.” Subtle this is not. Nor is it particularly clear. On the surface (pun unintended), Apple proffers the iPad Pro as a computer. We don’t begrudge Apple its right to “performance bragging:” Witness Apple’s rightfully proud statements about its powerful homegrown Ax line of processors and the impending A10 64-bit processors that easily outperform Seymour Cray’s supercomputers. But simply promoting the iPad to “computer” avoids the real issue: Is the iPad Pro a PC replacement? Can we toss out our laptops and move wholly to our iPads?  Is the iPad Pro a PC replacement? Can we toss out our laptops and move wholly to our iPads? For some the answer is obvious. Education expert Fraser Speirs makes a clear case for deploying iPads instead of PCs in schools. Students and teachers are better off—no ifs, no buts. (You could do worse than to follow @fraserspeirs on Twitter.) But if your work life revolves around preparing complex documents, a Mac or PC is still more convenient, even as the list of productivity tools in Apple’s App Store continues to grow and delights a growing but still relatively small number of users. One wag sees the notion of “toss your laptop” as akin to using Linux on the desktop. It’s something one should do, but most users keep their PCs and Macs. Apple is known for playing the long game. They’re rarely the first in a new domain, and they’re not always immediately successful when they join, but they often end up with the lion’s share of revenue and, more important, profits.  If we see the device as a recent entrant in the PC replacement race it’s clear Apple is in the “unfinished” phase. If we apply this pattern to the iPad Pro—if we see the device as a recent entrant in the PC replacement race—it becomes clear that Apple is in the “unfinished business” phase, particularly on the hardware side. The iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard is ingenious but lacks a trackpad. To be sure, there is the iPad’s touch screen, but ergonomists know how a real trackpad is preferable to constantly raising one’s hand to the screen: Just watch happy Magic Trackpad users with their Macs. And Apple’s 2-in-1 competitor, the Microsoft Surface Pro, offers a trackpad on its keyboard cover. Apple’s iPad stylus, the Pencil, is an improvement on Microsoft’s in one regard: It doesn’t need an AAAA battery—it can be recharged directly from the iPad or with a gender-changing adapter to a standard lightning/USB cable. But the tiny adapter is soon lost, and the Pencil rolls away far too easily. Microsoft’s stylus contains a magnet, and conveniently sticks to the side of the Surface tablet. These are obvious and surprising misses for a company that’s known for its attention to convenience and aesthetics—misses that are easily remedied. In the long run, and somewhat counterintuitively, Apple is in an enviable position because of its prosperous Mac business. The Mac gained $5.2 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, compared to $4.8 billion for the iPad. The iPad is certainly less profitable than the Mac, but if a lower price/profit iPad takes Mac business away, so be it: Apple will cannibalize itself rather than let a 2-in-1 interloper do it. In the long run Apple is in an enviable position because of its prosperous Mac business.   But which iPad are we speaking of? Let’s not overlook the fact that the iPad line is now forked. The iPad Pro undoubtedly appeals to a more demanding base of users than the smaller iPads. iOS is “growing windows,” a more visible file system and, in a soon-to-be-available version, will provide easier access to documents on a Mac desktop, or a documents folder. We’ve yet to see if these improvements help Mac users actually create more on their iPads, or if they merely make life more pleasant for those fortunate enough to commute between the two devices. In the longer run, progressively beefing up the simpler/cleaner iOS is a better bet than adding more layers of bug fixes and features on top of the noble and worthy OS X, now macOS. The original iPad and iPad Mini, on the other hand, pretty much fully satisfy the “non-pro” users who don’t need to do much more than message family and friends, navigate social websites, share pictures, watch videos, and so on. In his Jan. 27th, 2010 presentation, Steve Jobs presciently said the iPad “had to find its place between the iPhone and the Mac.” It seems to have found two places: The evolving iPad Pro is leaning ever closer to a laptop; the original iPad—and more so the iPad Mini—tend towards the larger iPhones. It’ll be interesting to see if and how Apple entices happy iPad Mini users to upgrade. We’ll know soon enough; the fall upgrade season is coming. This post originally appeared at Monday Note.

Baker reports for Reuters. “Samsung is mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and sells its handsets exclusively to hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to Olympic venues – but Apple is tempting some of them outside with its own unofficial Games merchandise.” “It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands,” Baker reports. “Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media.” “The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word “Olympics”, which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colors, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week,” Baker reports. “‘While they don’t appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing,’ said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the U.S. Olympic Committee.” Ready for rio ! pic.twitter.com/p8PKJ3o5Fs — IamTrayvonBromell (@TrayvonBromell) July 21, 2016 We now know that time it is.

They’re more for the viewers watching who see the logos at venues, and ads on TV and media, who might then buy them in their home countries.

SCOUT Share & Embed Ben McAdoo discusses 'big moment' during camp Sara Eljouzi 08/08/2016 The Giants head honcho was very pleased with his team's practice on Friday and thinks that his team has turned the corner during camp. With so many new additions to the New York Giants organization, building chemistry will be the key to a successful season. So how are the Giants’ rookies adjusting with the team? Ben McAdoo has high hopes for first-round pick Eli Apple, who could be a viable starter this season. As a young player from a Big Ten school, the rising CB is ready to transition to the NFL. Apple is right in the mix, getting those first-team reps and maintaing a competitive edge in one-on-one drills.  “What was encouraging about Eli was that he got a holding penalty early and he bounced back and didn’t get one the rest of the (practice),": said the Giants head coach. "There was tight man to man coverage and he was physical out there and he forced guys to the sideline and boundary and it left the quarterback no room to throw the ball, so that was exciting to see.  Apple has a lot of great mentors, with all of the leadership from the vets on the team and ObJ has also helped guide him, being in the same position just 2 years ago. McAdoo has been emphasizing this kind of unity and believes that they are building a solid foundation throughout training camp.  “We have been talking a lot about toughness and physicality and doing it together and family is important and we are all one family here,” McAdoo said.  Perhaps the biggest area of concern is the way the defense is working together as a unit. In minicamp, the coaches said that it was hard to assess the group because of the lack of contact. Now that the pads are on, fans are wondering if the defense can live up to the hype. McAdoo has said that the depth chart is still not finalized and that it will become more clear during preseason games. However, he does see that as a unit, everything is coming together smoothly with the Giants’ season opener just a month away. “I hear communication. There was some good communication happening on the defensive side of the ball today.”  “Today was a big day for us; we talked about that after practice," noted McAdoo. "This was a big moment for us in training camp. It was a heavy hitting physical practice and we had a lot of explosive movements in tight quarters. I think we had 42 plays in the red and the green zone today. Some team, some 9 on 7 with the big guys and some 7 on 7, but a lot of contact and a lot of physicality and we got through it. We checked the box and it wasn’t as good as it could be, but we did check the box and it will be the starting point for a good foundation."           Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout RG3 back on the field Week 12: Gamble On These Super Sleepers What We Learned: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final Unheralded Heroes: Week 11 Edition Williams Looking Forward to Iron Bowl The Giants Beat Top Stories Beyond the Boxscore: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final While most fans had their eyes on the boxscore following the game, the Giants Beat digs a little deeper to reveal the variables and factors that dictated the outcome in Week 11. by Alex Evans The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:31 PM Unheralded Heroes: Week 11 Edition The Giants Beat covers the players whose contributions were overlooked during Sunday's win. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatYesterday at 4:12 PM What We Learned: Giants 22 Bears 16 Final The Giants Beat recaps the major takeaways from the Giants narrow win over the Bears. by Scott Thompson The Giants BeatMonday at 1:18 PM FOX Sports Radio: The Giants BeatThe Giants Beat publisher hosted a two-hour FOX Sports Radio show in New Jersey talking about the Giants and the rest of the NFL. by Staff The Giants BeatMonday at 12:44 PM Game Balls and Goats: Week 11 Edition The NY Giants have won their fifth straight game with a 22-16 victory over the Chicago Bears at MetLife Stadium. by Sara Eljouzi The Giants BeatSunday at 2:45 PM Fantasy Slant: Week 11 Recap The New York Giants improved to 7-3 on the season, winning a 22-16 squeaker in windy conditions at MetLife stadium.

Is Apple working on a Galaxy Edge-style iPhone? by Joe Roberts 09 August 2016 0 shares Read Comments Although anticipation is high for the release of the iPhone 7, we already know Apple is making big plans for future phones, with rumours of a design overhaul for the iPhone 8 in the works. But the company was today granted permission for a new patent which hints at a particularly interesting new design feature, which might reveal more about Apple's iPhone 8, or perhaps post-iPhone 8, plans. The patent (via Patently Apple) is for a curved glass display with virtual buttons which looks remarkably similar to the screens on Samsung's Edge phones. It follows a patent application from Apple, granted in July, for an OLED display with 'bent edge', and another previously granted application for a 360-degree wraparound display. Both these developments fuelled rumours that the iPhone 8 could come with a curved screen. But this is the first we've heard of Apple working on a Galaxy Edge-style display. The patent itself lists features on Apple's version of the technology that are more than slightly reminiscent of the Galaxy S7 Edge and Galaxy Note 7's curved edge offerings. The application lists "virtual buttons, virtual switches, or informational displays that are supplemental to front side displays" among the elements involved. Related: Best smartphone The application also explains: "Electronic devices may be provided that contain flexible displays that are bent to form displays on multiple surfaces of the devices. Bent flexible displays may be bent to form front side displays and edge displays. "...Virtual buttons may include transparent button members, lenses, haptic feedback components, audio feedback components, or other components for providing feedback to a user when virtual buttons are activated." Luckily, Apple began submitting patent applications for the technology long before Samsung's first curved-edge phone hit the market, with the first application being submitted in 2013. That should mean any potential lawsuits between the two tech giants are avoided. Related: 8 Apple patents that will shape the next iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch Interestingly, the newly granted patent also details how there could be an artificial break between the edges of the display and the main screen, which would differentiate the design from Samsung's now instantly recognisable curved screens. Whatever Apple's up to, the series of patent applications for display tech, which is seemingly being refined by the company with each month that passes, certainly suggests we'll be seeing some sort of display changes on future iPhones – though, it should be noted that Apple has yet to confirm any of this, and is unlikely to do so until it comes time to officially unveil the iPhone 8. It should also be said that patent applications, whether granted or not, are no guarantee that a technology will make it to market. As such, it could be that we never see Apple's take on curved-edge screens – though we're really hoping we do. WATCH: What's the no.1 smartphone in the world? Do you think we'll see a curved edge iPhone 8? Let us know in the comments.

While many have claimed that Apple is doomed and that the sudden change or move to giant tablet and smartphones may be a sign of struggle, things did not seem to be that way when Fast Company interviewed CEO Tim Cook and SVPs Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi. The long commentary aside, the interview does shed plenty of light on the Cupertino giant’s recent moves. For example, Apple’s move to open up a public beta program stemmed from the whole Maps debacle, one that can easily termed as the worst service offered on a device out of the box (don’t even get started with India). Eddy Cue confessed that building a Maps app had been tougher than anyone in Apple had expected. It was Apple’s failure in not being able to accomplish the same, that led Apple to launch the public beta so that more bugs would be identified prior to a public release. The article also shed light on how Jobs would have never wanted a beta version of the company’s software in the hands of the consumer. Additionally Cue also commented on those who criticize Apple for the company’s lack of innovation ever since Steve Jobs passed away, “The world thinks we delivered [a breakthrough] every year while Steve was here,” says Cue. “Those products were developed over a long period of time.” This is a fact, as many patent filings will tell you that most Apple ideas were though about and patented a really long time ago. For example, the patent filing for a wrap around display was filed back in 2011, which was around the time the 3GS was up for sale. During his interview, Tim Cook seemed least bothered about what critics had to say. As for the ‘Apple is doomed’ stories that are floating around the internet, Cook simply commented, “The way that I look at that is, I really know the truth.” He reiterated his stance on what the company believes about itself: “We have never said that we’re perfect. We’ve said that we seek that. But we sometimes fall short. The most important thing is, Do you have the courage to admit that you’re wrong? And do you change? The most important thing to me as a CEO is that we keep the courage.” As for the reason why Apple is putting its hands and legs into other areas like health, home and even a car, well, there’s an answer for that as well. “Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can, whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car.” Indeed, as many of you may have already noticed, the interview does come at a time, almost a month before the release of the company’s next iPhone. So this could be something that Apple may have wanted its audience and fans to believe in before the launch. Still then, it does paint a picture of a company that stands tall despite tonnes of criticism and despite being the only one to make a hefty $50.6 billion in sales, which is also termed as ‘disappointing’ quarter.

Putting Apple Product Development into Perspective→ Linked By John Voorhees Rick Tetzeli, co-author of Becoming Steve Jobs, interviewed Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, and Craig Federighi for an article about Apple’s approach to product development that was published by Fast Company yesterday. Tetzeli does an excellent job exploring critics’ ‘Apple is doomed’ refrain, putting it into historical context, and exploring what Apple’s long-term approach to product development might mean for the company’s future. Apple often seems to be criticized for simultaneously doing too much and too little. The ‘Apple is doing too much’ criticism typically points to recent product misses as evidence that Apple has lost its focus under Tim Cook’s leadership and needs to return to its core products. But as Tetzeli points out, product failures at Apple are not a new phenomenon: Indeed, the iPod, iPhone, and iPad—and the financial success they engendered—obscured the fact that Jobs oversaw almost as many flops as hits during Apple’s resurgence: the circular, nearly unusable mouse that came with the first iMac in 1997; 2001’s beautiful PowerMac G4 "Cube," which was discontinued after one year; Rokr, a music phone Apple released with Motorola in 2005; the iTunes social recommendation network Ping, and many more. The complaint that ’Apple is doing too little’ seems to come from fear that Apple is missing out on technologies announced by companies like, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. But as Tim Cook explains: "What tends to happen with Apple, not just today but in the 18 years I’ve been here,… is that invariably some people compare what we’re doing now to a vision or a product that somebody says they will create in the future." Apple’s approach is different. It doesn’t announce technologies; it announces products. As Tim Cook puts it: "People like things they can do now, not just think about…. I’ve been thinking about The Jetsons since I was a kid. But occasionally you want The Jetsons to come to reality. That’s what Apple is so great at: Productizing things and bringing them to you, so you can be a part of it." Tetzeli concludes by looking at what the future may hold for Apple. Acknowledging that the iPhone may have been a once-in-a-lifetime product, Tetzeli makes the case that there are other large markets for Apple to conquer with this closing remark from Tim Cook about the health care industry: "When you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of Big Pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. Not thinking about what helps the patient. So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small." Tim Cook’s perspective on health care is classic Apple. The company developed the Mac by building computers for people, not corporate IT departments. It’s not hard to see how Apple’s approach to PCs could play out similarly in the health care industry if it builds products that are patient-focused.

Samsung is mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and sells its handsets exclusively to hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to Olympic venues -- but Apple is tempting some of them outside with its own unofficial Games merchandise. It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands. Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media. The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word "Olympics," which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colors, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week. "While they don't appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing," said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the U.S. Olympic Committee. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment on the bands, which are selling for 296 reais ($92.80) each - and only from the U.S. tech giant's store in Barra de Tijuca. Another top Olympics sponsor, Swatch Group's Omega, which makes an Olympic watch and is Games timekeeper, showed no concern. Omega president Raynald Aeschlimann said that unlike his firm, Apple could not talk about its Olympics history. Apple is also not permitted to display its limited-edition bands alongside the Olympics logo, or any other obvious Games symbol, but that has not stopped some Apple fans from doing so. U.S. sprinter Trayvon Bromell has tweeted a photo of himself wearing the USA-themed band of red, white and blue on the same arm as his Olympic rings tattoo. Defending decathlon champion Ashton Eaton has also shared a photo of himself on Twitter wearing the band. Top Olympic sponsors can pay about $100 million over four years to the International Olympic Committee for exclusive marketing rights to the Games, and they keep a close watch for any guerilla marketing during the event by their rivals. So far, Apple is in the clear. "As long as they do not use the Olympic logo, the Rio 2016 logo or our look, there is no infringement," said Sylmara Multini, director of licensing and retail for the Rio 2016 organizing committee. Athletes can also fall foul of Olympic rules if they market a non-official sponsor's products during the Games -- but not if they do it well before the event. Bromell shared his photo of the Apple band and his Olympic tattoo on July 21, six days before the blackout period began. Apple is not promoting the new bands directly -- many buyers say they are reading about them on blogs -- but at least one customer says he regards the band as Olympics merchandising. Nelson Imana, a visiting sports fan from Chicago, bought two bands on the way to watch Olympic volleyball. He said they reminded him of the kind of exclusive merchandise sold at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. "If you see somebody with Masters gear, they'll ask you about it because you can only buy it there," Imana said. "So if they see this band, they'll say OK, you've probably been to Rio and the Olympics." (By Liana B.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Cisco’s software that optimizes iOS devices and apps for enterprise due next month By Christian Zibreg, Aug 9, 2016 Tweet Leave a Comment The New York Times article headlined “Once Taunted by Steve Jobs, Companies Are Now Big Customers of Apple” contains an interesting side-note which claims that network giant Cisco is currently testing an upcoming software “that gives priority to mobile devices or apps” ahead of its unveiling next month. The forthcoming software solution is clearly born out of a partnership that Apple and Cisco struck last year to optimize iOS devices and apps for enterprise users. Announced in August 2015, the deal creates “a fast lane” for corporate users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrating the iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and providing “unique collaboration” on the iPhone and iPad. “To address the ever-increasing demands on corporate infrastructure, Cisco networks and iOS devices will be optimized so that they work together more efficiently and reliably with the goal of providing users with even greater performance,” wrote Apple and IBM at the time. The upcoming Cisco software could include iOS-optimized versions of Cisco’s collaboration tools such as Cisco Spark, Cisco Telepresence and Cisco WebEx. Given the new Cisco software is due alongside iOS 10 next month, it’s actually possible that the article refers to iOS 10 itself. It’s entirely possible that iOS 10 may include optimizations to make the iPhone “an even better business collaboration tool in Cisco voice and video environments, with the goal of providing employees with a seamless experience between iPhone and their desk phone,“ as stated in the original press release announcing the partnership a year ago. In addition to the Cisco partnership, Apple teamed up with IBM two years ago on a major enterprise mobility partnership and about three months ago announced a deal with German business software maker SAP to build apps that connect to the SAP back-end software used by many large enterprises for inventory, sales, human resources and other corporate tasks. According to the latest Forrester research, nearly half of all iPads are now being bought by corporations and governments. Nearly every Fortune 500 and Global 500 company today trusts iOS for its mobile strategy and 95 percent of Fortune 500 corporations use Cisco Collaboration and Cisco networks to conduct their business.

While many have claimed that Apple is doomed and that the sudden change or move to giant tablet and smartphones may be a sign of struggle, things did not seem to be that way when Fast Company interviewed CEO Tim Cook and SVPs Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi. The long commentary aside, the interview does shed plenty of light on the Cupertino giant’s recent moves. For example, Apple’s move to open up a public beta program stemmed from the whole Maps debacle, one that can easily termed as the worst service offered on a device out of the box (don’t even get started with India). Eddy Cue confessed that building a Maps app had been tougher than anyone in Apple had expected. It was Apple’s failure in not being able to accomplish the same, that led Apple to launch the public beta so that more bugs would be identified prior to a public release. The article also shed light on how Jobs would have never wanted a beta version of the company’s software in the hands of the consumer. Additionally Cue also commented on those who criticize Apple for the company’s lack of innovation ever since Steve Jobs passed away, “The world thinks we delivered [a breakthrough] every year while Steve was here,” says Cue. “Those products were developed over a long period of time.” This is a fact, as many patent filings will tell you that most Apple ideas were though about and patented a really long time ago. For example, the patent filing for a wrap around display was filed back in 2011, which was around the time the 3GS was up for sale. During his interview, Tim Cook seemed least bothered about what critics had to say. As for the ‘Apple is doomed’ stories that are floating around the internet, Cook simply commented, “The way that I look at that is, I really know the truth.” He reiterated his stance on what the company believes about itself: “We have never said that we’re perfect. We’ve said that we seek that. But we sometimes fall short. The most important thing is, Do you have the courage to admit that you’re wrong? And do you change? The most important thing to me as a CEO is that we keep the courage.” As for the reason why Apple is putting its hands and legs into other areas like health, home and even a car, well, there’s an answer for that as well. “Our strategy is to help you in every part of your life that we can, whether you’re sitting in the living room, on your desktop, on your phone, or in your car.” Indeed, as many of you may have already noticed, the interview does come at a time, almost a month before the release of the company’s next iPhone. So this could be something that Apple may have wanted its audience and fans to believe in before the launch. Still then, it does paint a picture of a company that stands tall despite tonnes of criticism and despite being the only one to make a hefty $50.6 billion in sales, which is also termed as ‘disappointing’ quarter.

On Monday (Aug. 8), the Canadian National Vending Alliance (CNVA) announced it has inked a partnership with PayRange, the mobile payment solution company, to allow customers to make mobile payments at vending machines around the country. That should be welcome news to Canadians who traditionally had to use cash to get something out of a vending machine. By teaming up with PayRange, the Canadian National Vending Alliance said it can bring cashless payments to vending machines without having to spend the money or deal with the complexity of installing card readers and network connections on the vending machines. The machines will only require a BluKey dongle, which installs in seconds, it said. Then, by using the PayRange app, which is available for both iOS and Android, users can make purchases. The app can be funded via credit cards, debit cards and Apple Pay. “The CNVA prides itself on addressing the needs of consumers, and with more people becoming increasingly cashless, we realized we needed a mobile payment solution to bring to all our machines,” said Steve Tremblay, president of the Canadian National Vending Alliance, in a press release. “With the PayRange platform, we’re able to provide consumers with greater choice, not only in how to pay but also in what they can purchase from the machines as they are no longer constrained by the change in their pockets.” Apple Pay’s entrance into Canada had long been rumored but officially kicked off on Nov. 17, 2015. It remains to be seen how widespread adoption will be. In the U.S., Apple Pay is having a rough time, with adoption rates not as high as Apple and watchers had hoped. As PYMNTS Karen Webster wrote in late June: “The number of people who’ve tried the service once has tripled since launch. But that has less to do with massive waves of enthusiasm for the service and more to do with it simply being made more broadly available and people having had more time to try, so it makes sense that more people are giving it a whirl. But adoption has also plateaued over the last two quarters, which is a bit concerning.” Related Items:Apple Pay, canada, Mobile Payments, Vending Machines, What's Hot Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Recommended for you Uber Of X: Rent-A-Ref, Sports Officials For Any Game Or Tournament PYMNTS Daily Data Dive: India’s Rupee Update Klarna, Swedish FinTech Startup, Buys Bankrupt German Startup Cookies Get our hottest stories delivered to your inbox.

It's the reason Apple now offers public iOS beta When Apple Maps replaced Google as the iPhone’s default mapping service in 2012, it was nothing short of a disaster. It struggled to locate even the most basic addresses. It sent drivers down roads that didn’t exist. It didn’t support public transit, a huge drawback for urbanites. It was such a mess that Apple CEO Tim Cook offered a rare public apology, while an Apple manager who oversaw Maps was fired. Four years later, Apple Maps is greatly improved — enjoyable to use, even! This week, a new profile of Cook and other Apple executives in Fast Company offers fresh insight into how the Maps fiasco changed the company’s approach to software. As it turns out, the Maps debacle led Apple to offer public betas for new iPhone software, which it hadn’t done before. The theory: People who download pre-release software will find and report bugs that smaller teams inside Apple might miss. But the company did more than just throw numbers at the problem. Cook also forced his execs to re-examine, and change, the way they worked with development teams. Famous for being secretive, Apple opened up a bit. “We made significant changes to all of our development processes because of it,” says Cue, who now oversees Maps. “To all of us living in Cupertino, the maps for here were pretty darn good. Right? So [the problem] wasn’t obvious to us. We were never able to take it out to a large number of users to get that feedback. Now we do.” Apple now does public beta testing of its most significant software projects, something that Jobs never liked to do. In 2014, the company asked users to test run its Yosemite upgrade to OS X. Last year, it introduced beta testing of iOS, which is the company’s most important operating system. “The reason you as a customer are going to be able to test iOS,” Cue says, “is because of Maps.” Also of interest to Apple watchers: Cook is very intrigued by Apple’s potential to shake up the healthcare industries. We’ve already seen a bit of that with the Apple Watch, HealthKit, ResearchKit and so on, but it sounds like there’s much more in the pipeline that hasn’t been discussed publicly yet: As we’re saying our goodbyes, Cook and I stumble into discussing health care, and he perks up again. “We’ve gotten into the health arena and we started looking at wellness, that took us to pulling a string to thinking about research, pulling that string a little further took us to some patient-care stuff, and that pulled a string that’s taking us into some other stuff,” he says. “When you look at most of the solutions, whether it’s devices, or things coming up out of Big Pharma, first and foremost, they are done to get the reimbursement [from an insurance provider]. Not thinking about what helps the patient. So if you don’t care about reimbursement, which we have the privilege of doing, that may even make the smartphone market look small.” Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Music News Photos Video Lists Reviews Share < br />this article: Latest Frank Ocean Conspiracy Theory Involves Travi$ Scott & “Technical Difficulties” Carl Williott @cwilliott | August 9, 2016 - 9:59 am Share < br />this article: As we all know by now, Frank Ocean’s new album Boys Don’t Cry was expected to drop on Apple Music last Friday (August 5) — the New York Times said so! — but it never materialized. Fans have since noticed that the original due date slip Ocean posted indicates it could be released on November 13, but there’s a new theory circulating…and it has to do with Travi$ Scott’s new album. More: Did 'Boys Don't Cry' zine images leak? Scott’s Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight was also announced for an exclusive Apple Music release on August 5, which also never happened. But in an Instagram post last night Scott explained due to “technical difficulties” the release was pushed back a week, to August 12. NME points out that Ocean fans on Reddit looking for an answer, any answer, wonder if those same technical difficulties also derailed Frank’s Apple-exclusive release. And if you buy that logic, then it means his album will be out this Friday as well. AUGUST 5TH WE WAS SUPPOSE TO SET THIS OFF. BUT DO TO "TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES" WE HAD TO MOVE IT TO THE 12th. THAT BEING SAID KIDS WE EAT FRIDAY. JOIN ME AND CHASE B FOR A FREE EXPERIENCE SOMWHERE IN LA FOR THE START OF BIRD SZN. TUNE IN ON THE 12th. AND U SHALL BE GUIDED 🕊🕊🕊🕊 A photo posted by flame (@travisscott) on Aug 8, 2016 at 6:00pm PDT Seems flimsy. It seems more likely that Scott’s “technical difficulties” were a cover by someone in his camp who decided it would be wiser to hold off on the release until the (expected) Frank Ocean release day chaos subsided. Now that Boys Don’t Cry appears to be set for November, Scott is free to drop his LP this Friday without going up against one of the most anticipated albums of the decade. That’s my hunch, anyway. Let us know yours in the comments.

Although the report sheds little light on the matter, a machine-translated version of the story suggests that the device, described as a “killer new” gadget, will be a first-generation product so we can rule out a second-generation Apple Watch. It’s also unclear if the rumored product will be worn on one’s body and whether it will operate standalone or require an iPhone, like the Apple Watch. Economic Daily News suggests the gadget will accurately collect “users’ personal daily life including heart rate, pulse, blood sugar changes and other information.” It’s been reportedly in the works for two years now by Apple’s health teams led by director Jay Blahnik. The device should tightly integrate the hardware and software aspects to it, as we’ve come to expect from Apple, and is said to “set off a new whirlwind” within the technology industry. The report adds that the mystery product should utilize 3D Touch technology for interactions. It’s also mentioned in the report that Apple may have come up with a “revolutionary idea” for the forthcoming product that, if a machine-translated version is to be trusted, may have something to do with its power supply. Assuming the report is accurate, I’m going to go out on a limb in speculating that the gizmo could come in the form of an Apple Watch band with additional built-in sensors that would extend health-tracking capabilities of the device, including measuring blood sugar levels, respiratory rates, blood pressure and more. Apple, of course, is deeply invested in health technologies with a number of product and initiatives, starting with the Apple Watch and extending to the HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit frameworks for developers, plus iOS’s stock Health app. Source: Economic Daily News (Google Translate) via Mac Otakara (Google Translate) Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend Jawbone denies exiting wearables business, production of UP devices continues Jawbone stops making UP fitness trackers, planning a clinical-grade health device Samsung pulls back the curtain on two new wearables: Gear S3 Classic and Frontier Say hello to three new pebbles: Pebble 2, Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core Related Topics Apple, Health, News, Rumors, wearable computing, Wearables nyangejr +1 Anonymous I’m excited to see what they have come up with.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Apple could slash prices of next year’s 4.7″ and 5.5″ iPhones with legacy LCD technology iPhone 8 to hit mass production late in the third quarter of 2017 KGI: iPhone 8 will have all glass casing to support wireless charging Nomad’s new Lightning cables cross durability with function How to add an image to your email signature on Mac   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClearClockView, PullOver, & more… PullOver lets you pin an app to your screen for easier multitasking Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Even IBM is promoting Apple gear.” “Companies are turning to Apple’s products for their tight-knit hardware and software, advanced security features and intuitive interfaces,” reads the report. Since their strategic partnership in July of 2014, Apple and IBM have been pushing iPads into enterprise, with IBM taking care of the sales, software development and support side of things while Apple provides technical assistance, hardware and expertise in iOS app development and large-scale deployment. IBM has developer more than 100 business-oriented iOS apps that it has sold to over 2,000 enterprises, raking in more than half a billion dollars in revenue last year. In fact, an industry analyst at Forrester went as far as to claim that Apple is now “stronger in the enterprise market with its devices than it is with consumers.” Forrester’s Frank Gillett: Tim Cook has taken a pragmatic approach without changing Apple’s culture. Apple’s philosophy is, “We want to stick to our knitting, what we’re really good at—devices and software experiences for individuals—and work with others to translate Apple’s strengths into the workplace.” The following quote is worth mentioning, too: Apple totally recognizes that their products are being used in a workplace context and not just at home. But they are rabidly focused on making the world better for individual users. They have a strong fear if they begin to think too much about their enterprise customers, they will compromise the consumer experience. In hindsight, releasing the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was the right move because sales of high-end iPads to business customers in particular have been strong since then. Unfortunately, we will never know the extent of iPad sales to enterprise because Apple does not divulge corporate sales. Apple also partnered up with network king Cisco and just three months ago announced another partnership with SAP, a big German maker of business software, to make it easier to build apps that connect to the SAP back-end software that many large enterprises use for inventory, sales, human resources and other corporate tasks.

Related Topics Apple, Enterprise, Forrester Research, iPad, News, NYT PhoneTechJay It’s true because just about everyone who wants one has one and there aren’t enough changes to keep upgrading everyyear especially since the old on is still great. gary I wish more people had this sentiment towards their old devices instead of just thinking “my old device is horrible now, I HAVE to get the newest one because mine is so out of date.” When in reality, the only time you should really be having to upgrade is when either A) you can get the new one for free a la the iPhone with carrier upgrades, etc. or B) your device stops being supported by the latest updates i.e. the iPhone 5 and earlier or whichever iPad doesn’t support iOS 9+. iBanks A) there won’t be free premium devices anymore. B) if that’s the case, Apple can simply stop support each year after an new device comes out. Of course they won’t but anything is possible. I personally never thought my old devices were horrible but I do upgrade each of my devices once an new release comes out except my Mac Mini and MB Pro. Flip your old devices every year and essentially you may come out free with an new device. Sony Exactly. I’m still using my iPad 2 lol it works still good Christopher Lim You don’t know what you are talking about. Sony I know what i’m talking about Christopher Lim Come on… Let’s have a look at the things you miss out on… • Siri • Handoff features in Continuity • Split View, Slide Over, and Picture-in-Picture multitasking. • The new Spotlight screen, predictive Siri, and third-party Spotlight search. • Public transit directions for Maps. • Apple Health • TouchID • Support for OpenGL ES 3.0, the Metal graphics API, 64-bit ARMv8 apps • Apple Pay. • Translucency effects. • Airdrop • Burst photos • HDR photos • Panorama Shots • Slow-mo video. • Retina display • Lightweight • Smart Connector • …you get the point… And possibly even more come iOS 10. Not to mention the sad performance compared to a modern iPad Pro (7 times faster in geekbench, possibly even more so ill). It survived the guillotine, but it’s not working “good”. It’s barely clinging on, perhaps you could say it works? Sony I don’t miss anything of the things you listed, because my iphone 6 and mb pro retina have all these functions and i use my ipad 2 maybe once a week for basic tasks like surfing youtube/safari and playing games. So there’s no reason for me to upgrade my ipad as it still works. Christopher Lim Not the smart connector, not 4K video recording and not the true tone display or Apple Pencil support.

 Apple could release a new gadget to monitor your health in 2017 Kif Leswing Aug. 9, 2016, 9:14 AM 6,019 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP A new rumor about an Apple health gadget is spreading out of Taiwan, and it could be a new product that is separate from the Apple Watch. Apple is talking to suppliers about a new product that is packed with sensors and can collect data like heart rate, pulse, blood sugar, and other biometric statistics, the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reports (via Apple Insider). Apple is reportedly in talks with a slew of manufacturing partners, including TSMC, Foxconn, TPK, Zhen Ding Technology, and others. The device would launch at the same time as the 2017 iPhone, according to the report. Rumor has it that Apple has been working on a sensor that can measure blood sugar since before the Apple Watch launched. But Alphabet's Verily has reportedly had trouble building its own "noninvasive" glucometer integrated into a contact lens, and biotech professionals have told me the technology isn't ready for prime time. Apple will need its sensors to be noninvasive, meaning they won't require users to draw blood or break the skin. Apple clearly has long-term plans in health. The company has hired doctors and nurses and also runs around-the-clock biometric labs. A device separate from the Apple Watch would be surprising, though Apple CEO Tim Cook has talked about a separate health product that could require approval from the Food and Drug Administration. He has also talked about adding more sensors to the Apple Watch, most notably at a conference earlier this year. "I love the Watch," Cook said. "One day, this is my prediction, we will look back and we will wonder: How can I ever have gone without the Watch? Because the holy grail of the watch is being able to monitor more and more of what's going on in the body." "We've gotten into the health arena," he said in another interview. "We started looking at wellness, and that took us to pulling a string to think about research; then we pulled a string a little further, and it took us to some patient care stuff; and we pulled a string that's taking us into some other stuff."

 How the battle for TV's future could take over your whole house Nathan McAlone Aug. 9, 2016, 9:40 AM 5,239 facebook linkedin twitter email print Comcast's Matt Strauss Comcast/Business Insider/Hollis Johnson Comcast doesn't believe that the future of TV is apps. That's according to executive VP Matt Strauss, who heads up video services. The reason Strauss is skeptical, beyond presumably not wanting to give up power to the likes of Apple, is that he sees an "app" as a metaphor for a channel. It's an advanced channel that lets you do things like watch on demand, but it's still a channel when you get down to it. And channels aren't what people want. They want a fundamentally different experience, he says. They want something like X1, the system Comcast is betting will secure a new generation of cable lovers and put all the "cable is dead" chatter to bed. What is X1? If you haven't used X1, think of it like an advanced cable box — one that smartly surfaces the shows you want and responds to your voice commands via its remote. But X1 isn't the actual cable box; it's technically a cloud-based system that can work not only from that fancy new box, but also — with more limited functionality — on your phone and tablet. X1 is a cross between an advanced TV guide and a virtual assistant, and Comcast thinks it will compete with the likes of Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo and Apple's Siri-powered Apple TV. Why are these three things competitors? They all use "digital assistant" software to make using hardware like a TV or a speaker easier. But more importantly, all of them have the ambition of being the center of your "smart home." Comcast Your future house Comcast's general thesis is that some platform will power the homes of the future. You'll talk to it, and it will pull up the video you want to watch or the music you want to listen to, or even start your coffee. The question is who will win that battle. Strauss thinks the TV is the natural starting place for the "hub" — though he might be a tad biased. In Comcast's world, the TV is the center of your home. The X1 is having its big introduction party during the Olympics, with a bunch of new features meant to transform how you watch and wring as much value as possible from the games. These features mostly revolve around different ways to personalize the games: following different sports, countries, or athletes; surfacing stats you want; or dropping you right in the action. But what's interesting about these features isn't that they're for the Olympics, but that they begin to reimagine the way you surf cable. The big picture Strauss wants X1 to be the "aggregator of aggregators," to tie together your cable package and other services like Netflix (which will come to the platform "later this year"). X1 will pluck what you want from it or let you go into individual apps. No more tyranny of apps — or channels, for that matter. Strauss is dreaming big with X1. I asked him whether there was a ceiling of how much TV you could watch. "Maybe you never turn off your TV," he said. He sees a future X1 understanding what you need at that moment, whether it's a primetime drama, background music, an update of what's trending on Twitter, cooking instructions, and so on. Comcast Two-part plan X1 shows how Comcast thinks about the future of cable TV and how it means to conquer it. The first portion of Comcast's X1 plan is to integrate on-demand and live TV into a platform that does away with the old channel system. On-demand viewing on the X1 is already 40% higher than on its previous system, Strauss says. Apple is reportedly working on something similar as well and wants to build a kind of advanced TV guide that pulls together content services like Netflix, HBO, and ESPN. But the second part of Comcast's plan is to use voice — and cable — as a foundation to manage your entire home. That goal pits it against not just Apple, but likely Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft. You can bet they will all be vying for that spot. Comcast seems to believe that whatever robot controls your house in the future will likely control your TV — and that direct relationship with the customer is valuable since without it, the cable company begins to feel like the unnecessary middleman between the people who actually make the shows and the people who watch them. No one wants to become a dumb pipe. So for Comcast, winning the future of TV could mean winning the entire house in the process.

Apple Watch 2 may have inbuilt GPS support According to an analyst note sent out to investors, Apple may introduce two variants of the Apple Watch this year. The first is estimated to be an incremental update with minor change to the components, while the second is set to feature a barometer, GPS support and a new processor made on the 16nm manufacturing process. Oppo F1S launched Responding to society's collective obsession with selfies, Oppo has updated the selfie-focused F1 with the new F1s. Equipped with a 16MP front-facing camera, (the primary camera is lower resolution, at 13MP) the F1s also packs in beautification features in the software to enhance the entire selfie experience. The 5.5-inch phone packs 3GB RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, and a fingerprint sensor that can register up to five fingerprints and perform unique actions when triggered within specific apps. The phone also has a three slot tray that can hold two nano-SIM cards and a memory card. The F1s runs Android 5.1 with Oppo's ColorOS on top, all powered by an octa-core processor that draws from a with a 3,075mAh battery. The Oppo F1s is priced at Rs. 17,990. OnePlus 3 won't be getting a Mini variant The rumours on the interwebs about OnePlus working on a mini version of the recently launched OnePlus 3 flagship have been shot down by OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei himself. The reports began with a GFXBench listing which belonged to a device with similar internals as the 3, but with a smaller screen size. This prompted Pei, who has always been active in engaging with the company's followers online, to take to Twitter and post a link to the article about the rumour, debunking it with a simple 'no'. Orkut creator launches new social network Orkut Buyukkokten, who created the eponymous Orkut social network while working at Google 12 years ago, has resurfaced with a new social platform called hello. In the creator's own words, hello is “built on loves, not likes”; possibly to create a clear distinction from Facebook right from the outset. The social network is app-only for the moment and allows individuals to create 'personas' based on their interests and connect with others who share similar interests. It is available on iOS and Android in eight countries, including the US, Canada and Brazil, with India, Germany and Mexico set to be included in the fold sometime this month. Now is a good time to get Batman: Arkham Knight PC gamers who've been holding off from purchasing the latest in the Arkham trilogy have reason for cheer. Arkham Knight, which was almost unplayable on PC for months after release, seems to have been rid of all its glitches, and reviews on Steam are now reflecting this. Latest reports are praising the now-functional game for its story and gameplay, with one of the highlights being the ability to control the Batmobile.

(AAPL), Opko Health Inc. (OPK) and Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (RAX) OPK is charging, AAPL keeps climbing and RAX is struggling Aug 9, 2016, 8:29 am EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Crude oil prices rose robustly on Monday, lifting energy stocks, but a dip in the healthcare sector led to a dim trading day overall. The stock market slightly sagged, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each falling 0.1%. As we head into Tuesday’s trading, a few stocks will be front and center in the headlines. Among today’s stocks to watch are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Opko Health Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) and Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (NYSE:RAX). Here’s why: Apple Inc. (AAPL) AAPL shares look to continue their slow crawl higher on Tuesday after the company responded to Russian allegations about price-fixing of iPhones. Specifically, Apple says it didn’t do it. The Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service — an antitrust group — says Apple and 16 iPhone resellers in Russia fixed prices on iPhone 6s and iPhone 6Ses starting last year. Moreover, it wanted to fine AAPL up to 15% of iPhone revenues there. 7 Stocks to Buy for the Federal Reserve Rate Hike In response, an Apple spokesperson said, “Resellers set their own prices for Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world.” AAPL, which is trading around $109, continues to march toward its 2016 highs set in April around the $112 mark. Shares cleared their major moving averages weeks ago, though they’re starting to look toppy, at least as far as its Relative Strength Index (around 75) is concerned. Apple stock was up fractionally in Tuesday’s premarket action. Opko Health Inc. (OPK) OPK stock was up strongly on Tuesday morning amid a Street-beating second quarter report. Opko managed to flip from a year-ago loss to $15.5 million in net income for Q2, which translated into adjusted earnings of 2 cents per share. The Street was looking for a breakeven quarter. Meanwhile, revenues of $357.1 million screamed higher from last year’s $42.4 million and was plenty good enough to top expectations. OPK likely will have an exciting rest of the year, as the company expects to close its acquisition of Transition Therapeutics in Q3, and it will launch Rayaldee — a kidney disease treatment — in Q4. Opko shares were up about 5% before Tuesday’s bell. Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (RAX) RAX will have trouble lifting off today thanks to some mixed results including Street-beating earnings, but disappointing Q3 guidance. The cloud computing provider reported earnings growth of 26%, with adjusted profits coming out to 38 cents per share, which topped estimates of 22 cents. Meanwhile, revenues of $523.6 million were up 7% year-over-year and beat estimates for $521 million. Bristol-Myers Squibb: The BMY Stock Selloff Is Overdone However, RAX stock is lagging thanks to underwhelming third-quarter guidance. Sales are expected to come in at $510 million to $515 million, lower than the $530 million that Thomson Reuters-polled analysts predict. Its annual revenue estimate is now $2.06 billion to $2.08 billion, compared to a previous estimate of $2.08 billion to $2.16 billion. RAX shares were off fractionally this morning. As of this writing, Karl Utermohlen did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Netflix original series got one of the best ‘80s looking posters to date, and it was all done using an iPad Pro and an Apple Pencil.  ( Netflix | IMDb ) Advertisement Stranger Things is one positive summer surprise from Netflix, and its surging success is tied to the capabilities of the iPad Pro. This is because the series' iconic poster pays glorious tribute to classic movie posters from the '80s and was designed by Kyle Lambert, who used an Apple Pencil in tandem with the iPad Pro to create the poster for the sci-fi series. The Netflix original production is set in 1983 Indiana and revolves around multiple plot points such as mysterious government experiments, telekinesis, mirror worlds and the now forgotten tensions of the Cold War. A coming-of-age friendship is also an important element in the series, and all the ingredients come to honor sci-fi horror legends such as Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King. This mélange of elements made the poster design a tall order for Lambert, but he rose up to the challenge. And being a generous artist as he is, he explained in great detail what steps he took to see his creative process come to life. First off, the studio provided him with only a few rough cuts from a few episodes, a number of photographs and a vague concept. The task was to craft one single image to deliver the diverse content and still manage to keep it in unity. Lambert reminisces that after completing the sketch, he applied some tonal blocking in Procreate. This was followed by exporting the artwork to Photoshop, where he ramped up the poster's resolution. This back and forth was necessary so he could paint small elements at the highest resolution, in case Netflix decided to enlarge the poster at a later date. Those familiar with Lambert's attention to detail were not surprised to see the amount of effort he put into Stranger Things' poster. A few years ago, the artist delivered an outstanding iPad art video where he showcased his skills in illustrating a photorealistic Morgan Freeman portrait using an iPad Air tablet. Seeing how adept he was at tapping into the iPad Air's potential, it is little wonder that the iPad Pro gave Lambert all the tools to come up with a great poster for Stranger Things. He notes that as soon as the poster started shaping up, he exported a flat version of the file to the iPad, fiddled with Procreate once more to put some more detail to previously neglected areas, and obtain "a more fluid sketch style." "I did several layer adjustments like this between the two devices and applications to give the poster a finished look," Lambert notes. Professionals were already aware of the iPad Pro's tremendous potential to create awe-inducing art and Lambert's story backs this up completely. Also, it reminds the less talented of us that there is a lot of work and a detailed process behind every eye-catching poster or illustration. We expect to see more visual experts using the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil, which Lambert says makes digital sketching feel incredibly natural.

Samsung is mobile phone sponsor of the Rio Games and sells its handsets exclusively to hundreds of thousands of visitors flocking to Olympic venues - but Apple is tempting some of them outside with its own unofficial Games merchandise. It is using an Apple Store about six miles (10 km) from the main Olympic park as the sole outlet for special-edition Apple watch bands. Some buyers, including top athletes, have been proudly advertising their new bands on social media. The watch bands do not feature the iconic Olympic rings logo or the word "Olympics", which are for the exclusive use of sponsors like Samsung. Instead, they come in a choice of 14 national team colours, including the United States and Canada. A Brazil-themed nylon band was close to selling out this week. "While they don't appear to be breaking any rules, they appear to be getting really close to the edge of ambush or guerilla marketing," said Jeff Benz, who arbitrates disputes for international dispute-resolution firm JAMS and is a former general counsel at the US Olympic Committee. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment on the bands, which are selling for 296 reais ($92.80) each - and only from the U.S. tech giant's store in Barra de Tijuca. Another top Olympics sponsor, Swatch Group's Omega, which makes an Olympic watch and is Games timekeeper, showed no concern. Omega president Raynald Aeschlimann said that unlike his firm, Apple could not talk about its Olympics history. Apple is also not permitted to display its limited-edition bands alongside the Olympics logo, or any other obvious Games symbol, but that has not stopped some Apple fans from doing so. READ ALSO: 7 hot gadgets debuting at Rio Olympics 2016 US sprinter Trayvon Bromell has tweeted a photo of himself wearing the USA-themed band of red, white and blue on the same arm as his Olympic rings tattoo. Defending decathlon champion Ashton Eaton has also shared a photo of himself on Twitter wearing the band. Top Olympic sponsors can pay about $100 million over four years to the International Olympic Committee for exclusive marketing rights to the Games, and they keep a close watch for any guerilla marketing during the event by their rivals. So far, Apple is in the clear. "As long as they do not use the Olympic logo, the Rio 2016 logo or our look, there is no infringement," said Sylmara Multini, director of licensing and retail for the Rio 2016 organizing committee. Athletes can also fall foul of Olympic rules if they market a non-official sponsor's products during the Games -- but not if they do it well before the event. Bromell shared his photo of the Apple band and his Olympic tattoo on July 21, six days before the blackout period began. Apple is not promoting the new bands directly -- many buyers say they are reading about them on blogs -- but at least one customer says he regards the band as Olympics merchandising. Nelson Imana, a visiting sports fan from Chicago, bought two bands on the way to watch Olympic volleyball. He said they reminded him of the kind of exclusive merchandise sold at the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia. "If you see somebody with Masters gear, they'll ask you about it because you can only buy it there," Imana said. "So if they see this band, they'll say OK, you've probably been to Rio and the Olympics."

Related: Apple debuts international versions of the iPad Pro’s Smart Keyboard For example, according to the report, British Airways has built as many as 40 iPad apps for its workforce to use, and switching to tablets has totally eliminated the need for paper records and paper flight plans for the company. One app allows employees to use an iPad to rebook passengers quickly and easily when a flight has been canceled. Of course, the shift does make some sense. Apple has been making a much larger push into business over the last few years than it did when the iPad was first launched in 2010. For example, the company buddied up with IBM in 2014 to launch a number of business-targeted iOS apps. It even paired with Microsoft to show off Office for iOS when the iPad Pro was first launched. Not only that, but Apple’s products do have an edge over Android and Microsoft slates — Apple products are often seen as more secure — whether they actually are or not — and Microsoft still doesn’t have a real mobile-focused operating system. The news certainly does represent somewhat of a shift, especially for Apple. Microsoft has traditionally enjoyed much more success in the business sector, and while Apple obviously isn’t finding more success than Microsoft in business just yet, it is interesting that such a large chunk of Apple’s income comes from business.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Coping with a cashless economy By Paul Heywood Shares It’s said that in the next 20 years, the UK will be a cashless society and across the pond, almost two-thirds of Americans believe the USA will also be cashless within their lifetime. With this trend happening across the globe, perhaps the age-old saying 'cash is king' could soon be long forgotten. Cashless is now king The figures speak for themselves. In the first quarter of this year alone, a total of 88.1 million contactless cards were issued in the UK – a 35 per cent increase on last year – and during 2015, around £633 million was spent using contactless technology. It is unsurprising, then, that Payments UK found that debit cards are now being used for over half of transactions, with notes and coins making up just 45.1 per cent of payments. This widespread adoption of digital payments resides not only with the fact the technology meets consumer demand for convenience with its ‘tap and go’ nature, but there are also a number of ways we are able use it. For example, the introduction of Apple Pay and Android Pay in the UK has resulted in more and more consumers reaching for their phones to pay for goods and services instead of using old-fashioned cash. In fact, the use of Apple Pay amongst iPhone owners grew nearly fourfold in a year, growing from 12 per cent last year to 47 per cent today and in the US, Apple Pay now claims 3 of every 4 contactless payments. With these quick and efficient payments methods becoming more and more popular, cash is quickly being regulated to the side lines -so much so that it is estimated by 2021, debit cards and contactless payments will overtake cash usage to be the UK’s most frequently used payment method. Dealing with downtime However, as consumers increasingly leave their wallets behind, there are some key considerations merchants and financial institutions need to address. A dependency on cashless payments goes hand in hand with an increased pressure to ensure transactions made through websites, mobile apps and connected devices all run as efficiently as possible, without any glitches. And this can prove tricky when you consider that all digital transactions and updates are reliant on resilience and availability of the public Internet. For example, what happens in a period of downtime, especially if retailers stop taking cash as a form of payment? In short, both parties suffer. For the merchant it’s a loss of revenue, and potentially customer loyalty. For the consumer, it’s the inconvenience and frustration of not being able to purchase the services they want. For example, imagine you are filling up with petrol and connectivity to make a payment fails and there’s no other alternative method to pay – what happens then? While outages are an obvious issue, latency is also something that needs to be closely monitored. Expectations from consumers start and end with quickness and reliability – delays because of Internet performance issues only raise doubts about quality and can damage brand trust with every transaction. The cashless society is inherently dependent on rapid and reliable connectivity and any risk of digital transactions suffering downtime or delays needs to be completely eliminated. In the UK last year, around £114 billion was spent online and in this new age of digital dependency, businesses must consider the consequences that result from Internet traffic spikes and outages, with loss in revenue being a big one. For example, Yahoo found that a server delay of one second leads to a 2.8% drop in revenue, whilst Amazon revealed sales decreased by 1% for every 100 milliseconds of latency. This shows how revenues are directly dependent upon speed, performance and efficiency for organisations selling online. Managing performance With that in mind, merchants and financial institutions need to ensure their payments technology ecosystem is protected to mitigate against the risk of delays and downtime to be best prepared to support electronic payments and services through the digital supply chain. Any business wanting to protect revenues and provide an exceptional digital experience in the cashless society must ensure a well-executed Internet Performance Management strategy is in place to support the company’s ability to monitor, control and optimise online infrastructure. This applies to a range of industries from banks offering their customers apps to mobile payment providers such as Apple Pay and also retailers who find themselves no longer exchanging cash for goods. That said, the Internet is a complex and unpredictable collection of networks and its changeable nature makes it difficult to manage, especially in peak times. But the Internet is not uncontrollable with the right tools in place. With proper Internet performance management solutions in place, payments providers and merchants , can meet customer expectations by delivering fast, scalable, secure and reliable assets via any digital channel, regardless of time or circumstance. By having visibility and control of the entire digital supply chain payments providers can ensure that all transactions are completed. Businesses that don’t make Internet performance their priority forfeit delivering the best customer experience and consequently could not only suffer a loss in revenue but also damage the brand’s reputation. Companies in the payments supply chain have an opportunity to leverage the Internet and make it their competitive advantage. This can only be achieved by having visibility of the end-to-end transaction process and the ability to control paths to optimise performance. The key to succeeding in a world where cash is no longer king is to be prepared for any issues that may arise in the payments process, and be confident in the company’s abilities to react and remedy any problems, so that customer experience is not affected. Because, in the cashless society, it is the customer that is king.

Concerned about the message such a name could send, the group wrote to the local Huon Valley council in Tasmania, urging councilors to change the name to Apple and Cherry Bay. "Obviously Tasmania is known as the Apple Isle and the Huon Valley produces a lot of apples and cherries, and we think it's a much better, kinder, compassionate and healthy name for this particular area," PETA Australia campaign coordinator Claire Fryer said. © Flickr/ Apple and Pear Australia Ltd The Apple Shed Museum, Huon Valley, Tasmania Petition to change Eggs and Bacon Bay to Halal Snack Pack Bae — Pat (A New Dad) (@patbcaruana) August 9, 2016 ​"Considering the high levels of cholesterol and saturated fat in both eggs and bacon, the area might as well be called Heart Attack Bay.

The plans have been met with bemusement and ridicule among locals, with Huon Valley deputy mayor Ian Paul describing the suggestions as "ludicrous." "I think the world has gone mad, I just can't barely believe it," he told the Guardian. If that bay gets renamed to anything, it should be Bacon and Eggs Bay, co's that's the correct way round to say it. #EggsAndBaconBay — Tyrell Mills (@tyrellmmm) August 9, 2016 ​"Does any normal-thinking person really think that?" he said.

However nomenclature expert Wayne Smith said those assumptions were false. If they change the name of Eggs and Bacon Bay, I'm moving to New Vealand. — Ben Pobjie (@benpobjie) August 9, 2016 ​"No, that's absolutely not true," he told the ABC. "It was named a long time after she was around." According to Smith, Eggs and Bacon Bay's name derives from the red and yellow wildflowers of the same name found along its shores.

"Following" : "Follow"}} August 09, 2016 8:49am   Comments Share: Related AAPL Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot Apple Getting Flexible The Repatriates (Seeking Alpha) The consensus expectations for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) don't appear to be accounting for an elongated replacement cycle in 2017, Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report. He reiterated a Perform rating on the company, while stating that the 2017 iPhone shipment estimate was the lowest on the Street. FY17 Expectations Oppenheimer’s estimate for Apple’s FY17 iPhone shipments is 10 percent below the consensus, which doesn't seem low enough to incorporate an elongated replacement cycle, Uerkwitz mentioned. Related Link: Why The iPhone 7 Release Benefits T Mobile & Sprint The FY17 iPhone shipment estimate reflects a 6.4 percent year-over-year decline to 197 million units, due to “a weak replacement cycle, competitive threats, and tough iPhone SE comps.” This compares with the consensus estimate of 221 million units, representing 5 percent y/y growth. “We believe consensus estimates are at risk for the coming March and June quarters,” Uerkwitz wrote. FY18 Expectations The analyst expressed his optimism regarding the FY18 iPhone cycle, citing “potentially substantial changes with new aesthetics and features that enable a better mobile VR experience.” The FY18 iPhone shipment estimate is at 245 million units, which is 3 percent higher than the consensus of 239 million units. “Longer term, we expect wider swings in Apple's iPhone outlook and we believe challenges abound for Apple as the smartphone shipment driver shifts from market growth to changes in market share,” Uerkwitz commented.

Bozoma Saint John on Apple Music→ Linked By John Voorhees Yesterday, Mark Sullivan of Fast Company interviewed Apple Music’s Head of Global Consumer Marketing, Bozoma Saint John, about Apple Music. On the upcoming changes to Apple Music in iOS 10, Saint John said that the goal was to make the experience simpler and easier whether you are a casual listener or an expert. She also expressed her thoughts on the importance of human-curated music: Yeah, it's important, it really is important. Human curation allows you to have the emotion and feel music, because it is a very emotional thing. It makes you feel happy, it helps you when you are feeling sad, gets you pumped up, calms you down. You want me to keep going? Because I could preach. I think it is a very emotional thing and you should treat it as such. We as humans have that and we can express it. There have been an interesting series of features about Apple Music since WWDC. First, BuzzFeed had a behind-the-scenes look at the people who create playlists for Apple Music and other services. Then, Eddy Cue discussed Apple Music’s integration with Apple’s products, curation, and radio in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. The message from Apple is clear. Apple Music is distinguished from other streaming services by human curation. I like the emphasis on the human touch, but remain skeptical about whether Apple’s editorial team can create new playlists regularly enough to keep them feeling fresh, which has not always been the case in the past.

(Reuters/Dado Ruvic) Share Written by Anne Quito Obsession Design August 09, 2016 Design luminaries including Calvin Klein, Dieter Rams, and Norman Foster are schooling the US Supreme Court in the laws of design. They’re rallying behind Apple, in the first design patents case to be heard by the court in over a century. In 2011, Apple sued Samsung for all its profits from sales of its Galaxy smartphone, arguing that the South Korean electronics company had willfully copied Apple’s patented rounded-corner front face, bezel, the look of its icon grid, and packaging of its devices. It won and was awarded nearly $1 billion in damages, but last year, Samsung appealed to lower the amount to $548 million. Now, it’s appealing again, arguing—among other things—that the reduced penalty is still excessive because design only played a small part in the Galaxy’s sales success. Designers are not having it. In a thundering defense of design’s vital importance to tech, on Aug. 4, 111 distinguished design experts filed an amicus curiae letter that’s essentially a crash course in design theory. It’s signed by many design luminaries, several of whom have had their own work counterfeited and copied for years: industrial designer Dieter Rams, Louis Vuitton artistic director Nicolas Ghesquiere, fashion designers Calvin Klein, Paul Smith, Bentley’s design chief Stefan Hans Sielaff, architect Norman Foster and typography idol Paula Scher. Many signatories have designed products for the world’s leading companies including AT&T, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Xerox and, yes, even Samsung. (Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji) The illustrated 36-page brief was spearheaded by Industrial Designers Society of America member Charles Mauro and contains distilled lessons for anyone interested in understanding design. Drawing on cognitive science, design history, marketing theory, and consumer technology, it explains two fundamental rules of contemporary design: Design is the most important element of a consumer product, and good design is vital to new technologies. 1. The design is the product Textbook case. (Brief of Amici Curiae 111 Distinguished Industrial Design Professionals and Educators in Support of Respondent) [A] product’s visual design becomes the product itself in the minds of consumers. Modern cognitive and marketing science verifies this fact. Two examples prove the point. First, the distinctive CocaCola bottle, which was designed and patented in 1915, helped the soft drink become the most widely distributed product on earth. A 1949 study showed that more than 99% of Americans could identify a bottle of Coke by shape alone, and customers routinely report that Coke tastes better when consumed from the patented bottle. The same is true for American automobiles. Henry Ford’s original Model T was notoriously unattractive. After General Motors created an Art & Colours department in the 1920s, GM permanently surpassed Ford in annual sales. Embracing industrial design eventually lead to huge U.S. economic growth, as car manufacturers discovered that without changing the underlying technology, engineering or functionality, they could create many different makes and models simply by changing the automobile’s shape, style and appearance. Today, design outranks all other considerations and is the driving force behind new car purchases. 2. Design is an essential bridge between technology and consumer Design is particularly important for consumer products with complex technology. Cognitive science proves that a product’s visual design has powerful effects on the human mind and decision making processes, and eventually comes to signify to the consumer the underlying function, origin, and overall user experience of that product. Sight is overwhelmingly our strongest sense. In addition, the human brain recalls memories and emotions attached to visual stimuli for far longer than text or words. Because the brain does not separate the physical appearance of an object from its functions, a consumer’s subsequent exposure, experience, or knowledge of a product are cognitively mapped onto the product’s visual design such that the look of the product comes to represent the underlying features, functions, and total user experience. The authors therefore conclude that Apple’s design patents protect not only certain details of the visual design, but the entire product itself: When an infringer steals the design of a successful product, it captures the consumer’s understanding of what the product does and what the product means in addition to the emotional connections associated with the company’s brand. Until the heated legal battles started, Apple was actually a customer of Samsung. It had outsourced the production of displays and microchips for the iPad to several companies in Asia, including Samsung. The Supreme Court case Samsung v. Apple is scheduled for October.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have broken out of a bearish technical pattern, and the stock now has a clear path to surge to all-time highs. Apple has been struggling since last summer after it reached all-time highs at $130. Since then, the stock has made a series of lower highs, which, obviously, are defined as a bear market.

Published in Mobiles "Arrogant" Apple falls foul of Tsar Putin by Nick Farrell on09 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email Price fixing allegations Fruity cargo cult Apple's arrogant attitude to its business partners might have earned it a price fixing court case in Tsar Putin's Russia. The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia said that it has opened investigations into the allegations after a claim from a citizen that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models at 16 major retailers. Resellers had quoted identical prices and maitinaed them for a certain period of time, the anti-monopoly body said. A similar practice has been followed for other iPhone models as well. MTS has been mentioned as one of the resellers in the anti-monopoly service's statement. Another firm Euroset has denied having coordinated prices with other resellers. "The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones," the agency said in a statement issued to Reuters.   9to5Mac claims that Apple might have hacked off its partners with its autocratic control over its Russian partners. In 2012 MTS accused Apple of running a "dictatorship" over iPhone sales. "They're more in a dictatorship mode where they say, 'This is what you have to do or you don't get the iPhone'. Being arrogant with your partners in big markets doesn't pay off," said MTS vice president of marketing Vasyl Latsanych. But associating Apple with antitrust is not a Russian thing. In fact Apple has form for this sort of thing in the US. In 2013 the US District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan found compelling evidence against Apple for violating federal antitrust laws by conspiring with publishers to eliminate retail price and raise e-book prices. Apple traditionally denies it has done anything wrong sometimes even after the highest court in the land tells them that they have been very very naughty indeed.. 9to5Mac claims that Apple might have hacked off its partners with its autocratic control over its Russian partners.

Toggle navigation Business Insider Singapore Tech Finance Entertainment Politics Strategy The Life Search for: Search Tech One of Apple’s biggest weaknesses is becoming a strength Kif Leswing Tech Aug. 8, 2016, 10:14 PM Andy Hertzfeld Apple, famous as the computing company that likes to “think different,” is going corporate.  In fact, nearly half of all iPads are bought by corporations and governments, according to a Forrester estimate included in a feature about Apple’s enterprise strength.  Since teaming up with IBM  in 2014 to sell iPhones and iPads to big Fortune 500 companies, Apple’s products have become the “preferred mobile computing devices for corporations,” reports the Times. Companies like British Airways deploy as many as 40 custom iPad apps for flight attendants, pilots, and airline workers. These apps allow the airline to, say, rebook a passenger or check a passenger manifest. British Airways has already bought 17,000 iPads for its workers and is looking to buy more.  Many enterprise apps are developed by IBM, which has created 100 enterprise apps for over 2000 companies, and now generates more than half a billion dollars from Apple-related services. IBM has made apps for insurance companies, retailers, and other specific industries. One of the reasons why businesses have decided to embrace iPhones and iPads is that Apple’s security is superior to Android’s, thanks to the way Apple controls both the hardware and software.  It’s quite a turnaround for Apple, which is seeking new sources of revenue as sales have dropped on an annual basis for the past two quarters. Apple’s always sold computers to businesses, but while CEO Steve Jobs was in charge from 1998 to 2011, the company was significantly more focused on consumers. Aside from the famous photo of Jobs flipping off the IBM logo, there’s one fun anecdote that hammers the change home. Back in 2008, Jobs called chief information officers, the people who buy computers for big businesses, “orifices,” according to a story told by VMWare CEO Patrick Gelsinger: “I went with (former Intel CEO Paul) Otellini to meet with Jobs and his lieutenants. We go into this meeting and say Steve, let’s work together to make your Macs better for enterprise customers. Jobs looks at us and says ‘why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?’ At Intel we’re aghast; two-thirds of our business is that orifice called the CIO. He went on to say ‘I’m going to build devices that are irresistible for consumers, and CIOs will just have to deal with it.”   NOW WATCH: How different camera lenses affect how you appear in photos Please enable Javascript to watch this video Share ​ ​ Tagged In AndroidAppleAppsenterpriseiPadSteve JobsTech Discuss Get Business Insider Emails Subscribe Business Insider Singapore Contact Editor Got A Story Tip?

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 24, 2016 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world Patrick Commins 9 Aug 2016, 3:48 p.m. An analysis of the most 'crowded trades' highlights just how wary investors are of Australia's major banks - and Apple. CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world The most under-owned ASX stocks. The most over-owned ASX stocks. Professional fund managers are underweight the major banks. Photo: Warren Hackshall Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the most under-owned stock on the ASX and the sixth most underweighted stock in the world. That data comes from UBS, which looked at the "most crowded trades" on the world's major bourses, or, in other words, which stocks fund managers, in aggregate, were most over- or underexposed to relative to the weighting of that name within its benchmark index. By this measure, Apple is the most underweighted stock in the world right now. "We sum up all the holdings in dollar value across all the active managers and calculate the weights of stocks in this active trading portfolio," the broker explained in a note to clients. "We then compare this weight with the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight." Our first chart shows that professional stock pickers are wary of the big banks in general, as well as BHP, supermarket owners Woolworths and Wesfarmers, Aurizon, AGL and AMP. Eight of those 10 names are in the ASX's top 20 stocks by market capitalisation, reflecting the fact that many professional stock pickers are looking to invest more money outside the blue-chip names, including a general uneasiness with the challenges facing the major lenders, despite the generous dividends on offer. The global top 10 in order from most to least underweight are: Apple, Exxon, AT&T, GE, Toyota, CBA, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and IBM. Analysis by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch suggested a contrarian approach to these so-called "crowded trades" has proved profitable in recent years. "The top 10 most overbought stocks have trailed the S&P for each of the past three years, while the top 10 'most neglected' stocks outperformed the S&P on average by 11.6 per cent," they wrote last month. At the other end of the scale is gold miner Newcrest, which earns the mantle of the most overbought stock on the ASX. Gold has outperformed just about every asset class this year, with the US dollar price of an ounce jumping 25 per cent in 2016 amid dwindling odds of an imminent US Fed rate hike and fresh monetary easing from most of the world's biggest central banks. Most overbought ASX stocks The most overbought stocks on the ASX look a pretty defensive, dividend-focused list, with Telstra the second most overweighted name, alongside a clutch of listed property trusts: Scentre Group, Westfield, Dexus and Vicinity Centres. Sydney Airport is in there, but not fellow infrastructure darling Transurban. Also are three global, industrial names – perhaps as investors bet on either a weaker Aussie dollar and/or improving global growth. These include Amcor, Brambles and James Hardie. Globally, the most overbought stocks are (in order): Amazon, United Health, Medtronic, Microsoft, Amgen, Alphabet, Visa, Texas Instruments, and Comcast.

Apple Investigated over iPhone 6s Price Fixing in Russia GO Watchdog: Firm, local resellers violated price fixing laws Aug 9, 2016 11:31 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Apple is once again having problems in Russia, this time following claims of price fixing as part of a scheme that also involved 16 major local resellers. The Russia Federal Anti-Monopoly Service says an investigation has already started in order to determine whether Apple and a number of resellers tried to set the same price for the iPhone 6s and maintained it at the same level for a longer period of time. “The Anti-Monopoly Service sees signs of price fixing violations in the Russian Federation at Apple iPhone resellers, which resulted in the same prices for these smartphones,” the organization is quoted as saying in a Reuters report. It appears that the entire case was started after a local customer complained that Apple and resellers were selling the iPhone 6s and the 6s Plus at an identical price since the launch in October 2015, and all of them maintained it for several months. Because of the price fixing, the iPhone didn’t get any cheaper for a long period of time, according to investigators. Most of the retailers involved in the case have already refused to comment on the claims, but Euroset, which is one of the largest stores in Russia and one of the companies that were believed to participate in the price fixing, denied the accusations and said it didn’t collaborate with other stores or with Apple to use an identical price for the new iPhone models. Apple, the dictator This isn’t the first time when Apple is involved in a scandal in Russia, as local carrier MTS accused the company back in 2012 of turning to “dictatorship” to sell the iPhone 4s in the country without any discount. “They’re more in a dictatorship mode where they say, ‘This is what you have to do or you don’t get the iPhone.’ Being arrogant with your partners in big markets doesn’t pay off,” an MTS rep was quoted as saying back then. This time, however, Apple hasn’t angered local companies, but the competition watchdog, so it remains to be seen if any fines will be issued. For the moment, the company has remained tight-lipped, just like it did in 2012, but Apple is undoubtedly willing to work together with Russian authorities to end this case without any financial penalty. #Apple#Russia#price fixing#iPhone 6s subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news How the New iPhone 7 Dual-Camera System Could Work Apple Watch 2 to Launch in September with GPS, Bigger Battery Leaked Video Shows iPhone 7 Family, Including Pro Model Apple Outs iOS 9.3.4 for iPhone, iPad & iPod to Fix an Important Security Issue iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March Hackers Could Infect Headphones to Spy on You HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks    The investigation could end up with a fine for Apple New Mac Apps TOWeb: A straightforward application that enables you to quickly and effortlessly create your own webpage by customizing one of the built-in website templates Wondershare Video Converter Ultimate: A straightforward multimedia converter, editor and downloader that helps you grab clips from the web, encode and burn them with just a few clicks of a mouse button War Thunder: An engaging and enthralling online game where you must destroy the enemy tanks, aircraft and human forces in order to win and gain a new rank.

Apple reacted a day after Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said it had opened a case into the allegations after a consumer had pointed out that identical prices had been set for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus models, which appeared in Russia in October 2015, at 16 major resellers. Apple, in emailed comments, said it did not oblige Russian resellers to fix prices for its products. "Resellers set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world," the company's press office said. FAS said it was looking into the idea that Apple had somehow obliged Russian resellers to treat its recommended product prices as mandatory. It said an investigation had shown that retailers had set identical prices and kept them at that level for a certain time period, including for other models. FAS has the power to fine firms it finds guilty of price-fixing.

Don't Hold Your Breath Apple VR? Don't Hold Your Breath By Tim Bajarin August 8, 2016 10 Comments At this point, I don't believe this is a market in which Apple has a high interest. In late February, I argued that Apple needs to get into VR sooner than later. But here we are, some five months later, and the best we have is Tim Cook saying AR and VR is interesting during an earnings call. While I understand that Apple is not one to jump on a trend right away, I decided to take a closer look at why Apple might be avoiding VR for now. As most Apple watchers know, Cupertino tends to watch a new technology enter the market and study closely what type of interest and impact it has. Then, if it sees the technology has real demand, Apple introduces its own version, which can be tied to its large ecosystem of apps and services. Apple did not invent the PC. But it improved upon the concept with the Mac, which introduced the mouse, graphical user interfaces, and smaller floppy drives. Apple also did not invent MP3 players, but the iPod quickly eclipsed all competitors. I believe that as Apple is eyeing VR, it's viewing it as it did the early MP3 player market. While some early VR headsets are picking up steam with gamers and early adopters, I don't believe this is a market in which Apple has a high interest. For one thing, these devices are not high volume. And at the low end, with the Samsung Gear VR, they are low quality. So, the big question is, when will Apple enter the VR space? As I look at what is in the market today, I really don't believe that Apple will introduce a tethered solution or low-end headset powered by an iPhone. Rather, I think Apple should enter this market with a powerful, standalone device. //Related Articles The Wacky World of VR in the 80s and 90s Knowing Apple, I suspect it would also opt for very high-quality optics and make the overall VR experience a fully hands-free one as much as possible by applying AI via Siri for many levels of input and navigation. Then it would create a special VR-optimized version of iOS and deliver a dedicated SDK for developers. My best guess is that Apple still needs more powerful mobile processors and GPUs to pull this off. What is interesting is that in talking with key semiconductor players, they too don't believe a tethered headset will ever gain mass market adoption. I suspect Apple will need at least another one or two years to advance its A series processor before it can go in an Apple-acceptable VR headset. So, I don't expect Apple to enter the VR space anytime soon. However, if history is our guide, even if Apple is "late" to the VR game, it could end up delivering one of the best solutions and drive unit sales in the millions per month. Of all the players out there, Apple is probably in the best position to bring VR to a mass market. Back to top Previous : This Mapping Tool Is Helping Disabled City Dwellers Get Arou...

The newest announcement (via Geekwire) in the space comes from Apple as it acquires artificial intelligence startup Turi for $200 million. This ensures Apple is at par when competing with Google, Facebook and Amazon. Apple, which is known to buy smaller companies and not disclose much, reportedly put out its standard statement, “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” said Apple in a statement. Turi has several developer tools that help build AI solutions. However, it isn’t clear whether it’s the tools or talent that Apple targets with this acquisition. The Turi team will be working from Seattle. This acquisition doesn’t come as a surprise as Tim Cook had discussed a shift to newer techs like artificial intelligence and augmented reality during the company’s earnings call. However, it should be noticed that it isn’t the first-ever AI-based acquisition as Apple has previously bought Perceptio and natural language-processing company, VocalIQ. In a letter to employees, Sundar Pichai had said earlier this year that Google also wants to have seamless integration across all of its services, so that users can easily move from one to the other. More services will be powered by neural networks and machine learning. AI implementation in Google Services means that the experience for the users will keep getting better with use.
