From the late, rather underwhelming MacBook Pro update last year to the seeming abandonment of the Mac Pro series, the Cupertino-based tech giant has been accused by critics of being far too invested in its mobile devices such as the iPad and the iPhone. For years, Apple has largely been silent about its stance on its desktop range. That is, of course, until now. Seemingly breaking from tradition, Apple recently held a closed-room discussion with a handful of tech journalists to discuss the state and the future of its Pro range. According to Matthew Panzarino of TechCrunch, the meeting was held by three of Apple’s top executives, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi, and Vice President of Hardware Engineering John Ternus. During the gathering, the executives discussed the elephant in the room that has been noticed by Apple fans for years — the state and future of the Mac and Apple’s Pro lineup. While the meeting in itself was rather unique, even more remarkable was the fact that the executives admitted that the Mac and the Pro series are currently in challenging straits. Its Mac Pro, for one, had effectively run aground since its release back in 2013, and as a result, Apple is now in the process of completely rethinking the entire machine from the ground up. Over the course of the discussions, here are the most relevant updates that the Apple executives have stated, and they are quite exciting. First off is the Mac Pro, the Cupertino-based tech giant’s most robust computer. The current iteration of the device itself is a marvel of design. However, Apple had admitted that its own design had become its most notable flaw, as the device left much to be desired when it came to longevity and the device’s flexibility for future upgrades. According to Schiller, the next Mac Pro that Apple would release will be a completely different machine, largely modular in design and complete with a Pro display. Dear @Apple Just make this. Sincerely, Everyone#macpro pic.twitter.com/sOtaC2gF5H — Nukefactory.com (@nukefactory) April 4, 2017 “As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a Pro display as well. Now you won’t see any of those products this year; we’re in the process of that. We think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that’ll take longer than this year to do.” The Apple executives also touched on the future of the iMac, yet another device that has largely been neglected by Apple. The iMac is one of the tech giant’s best-selling machines, yet it is, just like the Mac Pro, in dire need of an update. During the closed-room discussion, Apple’s executives stated that an upgrade for the iconic all-in-one is on the way. This, of course, could pertain to the release of the long-rumored iMac Pro, which is speculated to be marketed as a direct competitor to the Microsoft Surface Studio. One thing that the Apple executives were firm about was the premise of a Pro-level device with a touchscreen. According to Schiller, the answer to this question is a simple “No.” In a lot of ways, this is not surprising at all, especially since Apple has made it a point to completely avoid touchscreen desktops and laptops over the years. The 2016 MacBook Pro had a Touch Bar, but it is located above the keyboard of the device, and it plays a completely different function than a traditional, full touchscreen panel. While news of the Pro line’s impending upgrade has been received warmly by fans of the Cupertino-based tech giant, the firm’s executives did state that the updates to the Mac Pro, as well as the bulk of the upgrades that are set to be rolled out in its professional-grade devices, are scheduled to be rolled out next year at the earliest. Thus, while the future of the Mac and the Pro lineup is inevitable, users of the machines would have to wait a little bit longer to receive the next iterations of the devices. Apple reveals plans for a new, module Mac Pro: https://t.co/0ioY8RosBM #MacPro pic.twitter.com/OVlLJTavXg — Larry Jordan (@LarryJordanFCP) April 4, 2017 Perhaps the most interesting tidbit of information from the meeting with Apple executives, however, appears to be a confirmation that the MacBook Pro series would eventually be boosted regarding its graphical capabilities, according to a BGR report. During the closed-room discussion, Federighi was asked about Apple’s stance on external GPUs. The executive’s response was, for lack of a better term, very encouraging. “I think they have a place,” he said. The 2016 MacBook Pro was widely criticized for its lack of processing power and the inability for its internals to be upgraded. With the current iteration of Apple’s professional-grade laptop, even basic upgrades such as RAM boosts are next to impossible, and this has not been received very well by users and critics of the device alike. Considering Federighi’s response to Apple’s stance on external GPUs, however, it appears that the Cupertino-based tech giant is, at the very least, willing to explore the idea of docking the MacBook Pro with an external graphical processing unit. With Apple finally breaking its silence regarding the future of its Pro series devices, the Cupertino-based tech giant has issued a strong statement to those who are in doubt about the firm’s dedication and commitment to the development of professional-grade devices. Though Apple has miscalculated in the past, there must be no uncertainty that the tech company would, in more ways than one, be back in the Pro market as a force to be reckoned with.

WeChat has transformed from a social media to a payment platform (among other things) and had success in China. Could Australia be next? Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) decision to deny some of Australia’s major banks the ability to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay, might have opened a whole new door for digital wallets in Australia. The banks wanted to bargain with Apple for access to the Near-Field Communication controller in iPhones, enabling them to offer their own integrated digital wallets to iPhone customers. This would have been in competition with Apple’s digital wallet, but without using Apple Pay. A digital wallet is essentially an app on a mobile phone that can provide some of the same functions as a physical purse or wallet. This includes making payments in-store and storing information such as loyalty program points. In the example of Apple Pay, it used a digital wallet to allow customers to use their phones like “tap-and-go” bank cards. Mobile payments can also be made via wearable devices, such as the Apple Watch and various fitness devices. Part of the ACCC’s rationale in deciding on the banks/Apple case was that, “digital wallets and mobile payments are in their infancy and subject to rapid change”. So the ACCC is uncertain as to how competition will develop in this space. The Australian market for digital wallets Recent research from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) confirmed the use of mobile payments accounted for only around 1% of the number of point-of-sale transactions over the week of the survey, which was conducted in November 2016. By contrast, the same research revealed that the share of the number of payments made using credit and debit cards had increased to 52%, driven by the use of these payments cards for lower value transactions. This has been facilitated by the rapid adoption of contactless payments by both consumers and merchants and according to the RBA’s research, in 2016 around one-third of all point-of-sale transactions were conducted using contactless cards. According to the Australian Payments Clearing Association by 2016, 77% of Australians owned a smartphone and yet mobile payments at the point-of-sale remain relatively rare. The very success of contactless payment cards in Australia means that consumers do not see what extra advantage there is in mobile payments. Tap-and-go is increasingly available for even relatively low value transactions at the point-of-sale. Financial institutions have been speedy to issue such cards to their customers and this is matched by merchant’s adoption of the terminals to facilitate these payments. For mobile payments to become significantly more attractive than contactless card payments, it would require the wallets to have additional functionality to appeal to consumers. Examples of this include: the ability to use mobile payment devices on mass transit journeys, to hold loyalty program points, to verify identity and enabling person-to-person transactions. This breakthrough in functionality for digital wallets could come from another direction, other than the current mobile payments options of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Indeed, China provides an alternative example of how digital wallets can be developed, that will in retrospect make the ACCC’s decision on Apple Pay, rather passe. Tap-and-go payments are popular in Australia so digital wallets will have to offer more than contactless payments. David Crosling Digital wallet companies expanding from China According to Chinese government statistics, about 750 million Chinese had moved online by 2016, with 95% of them accessing the internet via their smartphones. China’s digital payments market was by then nearly 50 times greater than that in the United States. This is partly explained by the lack of other viable alternatives in China for non-cash payments. Credit card penetration is low compared to other developed markets, debit cards are not contactless and hence require authentication at the point-of-sale. China appears to have jumped directly from cash to mobile payments and hence missed the step into payment cards, particularly credit cards, to which the Chinese consumers appear to have a cultural aversion. The use of digital wallets in China is being driven by the success of the so-called financial technology firms in China, particularly Alibaba and Tencent. These companies have a vast and protected domestic market at their disposal and an almost complete absence of data regulations. These companies have been able to move on from offering just instant messaging platforms, to being payment providers via Alipay and WeChatPay, respectively. These apps on a smartphone allows consumers to scan a QR code from a merchants point-of-sale terminal or smartphone, to complete a transaction. Person-to-person transfers can also be done through these apps. Chinese company Tencent’s WeChat was originally a social media platform, but it has now expanded to include payments services, music streaming, taxi booking, photo sharing and a news service, to name only a few functions. Its over 800 million worldwide active users now have fewer and fewer reasons to leave its integrated full platform of services. WeChatPay is also increasingly accepted by bricks and mortar merchants in China. And now WeChat is planning to expand its services into the UK and Europe and is also looking to enter markets in the United States and Southeast Asia. Part of the company’s planned expansion is driven by the ever-increasing flow of Chinese overseas tourists. This flow was 120 million in 2015 and forecast to be 220 million by 2025. Australia is already a popular destination for Chinese tourists, many of whom will be users of WeChatPay. Who is to say that Facebook and/or Amazon will not follow Tencent’s path into digital wallets? While Apple Pay may have won the battle against some of Australia’s banks, it may lose the war against the providers of digital wallets, such as Tencent and Alibaba.

For now, the company has upgraded the specs of the current model with more powerful Intel Xeon chips and updated GPUs. Apple's announcement that it is "completely rethinking" what the Mac Pro is, means a lot to loyal users, as it shows that the company has not yet abandoned the product line.  WATCH RELATED VIDEO Apple - Here's What You May Not KnowNow Playing Fascinating Facts About Steve JobsNow Playing Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The WorldNow Playing Apple recently revealed that a major overhaul will come next year to its flagship desktop Mac model, the Mac Pro. The announcement means a lot to loyal users, who have been waiting for years for an upgrade to the computer.  ( Apple ) Advertisement Apple Promises New Design For The Mac Pro Apple promised that a new design is coming for the Mac Pro, but the refreshed desktop model will not be sold this year. The first major overhaul to the line in three years will instead be released next year. The Mac Pro is a powerful desktop model that has a loyal user base, composed mostly of professionals in need of massive amounts of computing power in their fields of work. Included in this group of Mac Pro users are video editors, graphic designers, and animators, among others. The upgraded Mac Pro will be sold for $2,999 with a six-core Intel Xeon processor, 16 GB of RAM, and dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs. For $3,999, the specifications will be bumped up to an eight-core processor with dual D700 GPUs. The powered up Mac Pro, along with the promised redesign of the desktop model, comes as good news for the computer's loyal users, as Apple has mostly focused on developments for mobile devices such as its iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple's Mac Pro Announcement Is Good News For Loyal Users While Mac computers started Apple's journey to become one of the world's most valuable brands, they have largely taken a backseat to the iPhone since the mobile device was launched 10 years ago. Product refreshes for Mac computers, including the Mac Pro, have been few and far between compared to the annual developments for the iPhone. The Mac Pro, which was released in 2013, was a powerful computer that came with a weird shape and an eye-popping price tag. However, it was embraced by professionals who need massive amounts of computing power, and the Mac Pro was able to get the job done. More than three years has since passed from the launch of the Mac Pro without any considerable upgrades for the desktop model. In the meantime, desktop PCs have become very attractive options for even the most loyal Mac Pro users. As such, Apple's promise to release a redesigned Mac Pro represents a commitment that it has previously not shown to the desktop computer and the entire Mac line. The iPhone will still likely be the focus of Apple, but at the very least, loyal users now know that the company at least still remembers the Mac Pro. Apple's announcement, however, does not mean that it will be releasing annual updates to the Mac Pro and Mac computers similar to what it does for the iPhone. Once the redesigned Mac Pro launches in 2018, users will likely ask if the next update would take more than three years again. TAG Apple, Mac Pro, Mac © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

It is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. The Australian competition regulator and national consumer law champion started an investigation following reports relating to "error 53", an inaccuracy which disabled some consumers’ iPads or iPhones after downloading an iOS update. Many consumers who encountered "error 53" had previously had their Apple device repaired by a third party, usually replacing a cracked screen. What ACCC found was that Apple allegedly appeared to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers’ defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault. It stated that under the Australian Consumer Law, users are protected by a number of “consumer guarantees” in relation to the quality, suitability for purpose and other characteristics of goods and services. In addition, the ACCC alleged that Apple represented to consumers faulty products that were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, “unauthorised repairers”. But, it mentioned that having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by anyone besides Apple cannot, by itself, remove the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with consumer guarantees. ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer,” he said. “As consumer goods become increasingly complex, businesses also need to remember that consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto those goods. Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” This proceeding follows a court enforceable undertaking which the ACCC accepted from Apple in December 2013, following an investigation into Apple’s consumer guarantees policies and practices, and representations about consumers’ rights. Apple was also recently involved in a case with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation, National Australia Bank, and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank in Australia, that collectively petitioned to the ACCC to reject Apple Pay. Following the request, the ACCC denied their authorisation to collectively bargain with Apple and boycott Apple Pay.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken the electronics giant to the Federal Court, alleging that it breached consumer law by telling customers - who had encountered the "error 53" malfunction - that it didn't have to remedy a fault if the device had been earlier repaired by a third party.

When are you eligible for a repair, replacement or a refund? The Australian Consumer Law gives you more rights than you might know. In 2015 and 2016, Apple customers around the world were left with useless iPhones after they had installed the latest operating system. In most cases, they had previously had their phones repaired - usually the replacement of a cracked screen - by an unauthorised shop. Apple was accused of extending its monopoly over the iPhone ecosystem, forcing customers to use its higher-priced repair service. Related Content The iPhone error message you never want to see Watchdog probes iPhone-killing malfunction The ACCC said Apple was in the wrong because Australian consumers, by law, were entitled to a free repair if a product was not of acceptable quality or fit for purpose. "Consumer guarantees are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party, that is the essential issue here, and for Apple to suggest otherwise is, we allege, misleading and deceptive conduct," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said. Advertisement "It not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." The error largely affected iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "Error 53" disabled phones that had been repaired by unauthorised shops. Photo: Ben Margot Amid the outrage last year over "error 53", Apple issued an apology and a software update that reversed what had, until then, been described as an irreversible condition. It had initially insisted the error was a result of a security feature that was designed to prevent fraudulent use of the fingerprint sensors in newer model iPhones. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The iPhone 6s home button showing its Touch ID hardware.  In the US, a class action was launched, but this was thrown out because the plaintiffs "lack[ed] standing to pursue injunctive relief" and could not provide sufficient evidence that they had suffered permanent data loss. "Apple has commenced an outreach program to re-contact every consumer who contacted Apple concerning 'error 53'. Whether everybody who had a problem made contact with Apple is another matter, but I accept they have [provided a remedy]," Mr Sims said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link ACCC chairman Rod Sims. ACCC has taken Apple to the Federal Court. Photo: Bradley Kanaris "But it doesn't excuse the underlying behaviour and our concerns go beyond 'error 53'." The ACCC accepted a court enforceable undertaking from Apple in 2013, after similar behaviour where it told consumers it wasn't required to provide a repair, refund or replacement, when this was not the case. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link "The iPhone could not be restored": Apple's "error 53" alert.  "The ACCC was concerned that Apple was applying its own warranties and refund policies effectively to the exclusion of the consumer guarantees contained in the Australian Consumer Law," Mr Sims said at the time. The ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs. Apple did not respond to Fairfax Media's request for comment. Under the Australian Consumer Law: when consumers buy products, they come with a number of guarantees, including a guarantee that they will be of acceptable quality and a guarantee that they will be reasonably fit for any disclosed or represented purpose. the consumer guarantees are in addition to any manufacturer's warranty; the consumer guarantees  are not limited to the period of the manufacturer's warranty. In many cases, they will apply for longer than the manufacturer's warranty; if the product is not of acceptable quality or fit for purpose, consumers are entitled to remedies, which may include a refund, replacement or repair, at no cost to the consumer.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Apple in Australian court for 'refusing to service' third party devices April 6, 2017 - 08:55 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Apple was Thursday, April 6 taken to court by Australia's consumer watchdog for violating laws by allegedly refusing to look at or repair some iPads and iPhones previously serviced by a third party, AFP reports. The tech giant "made false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law," the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) charged. The proceedings, against Apple Pty Limited and its US-based parent Apple Inc, were brought on behalf of 275 consumers. Under Australian law, each breach can attract a fine of up to Aus$1.1 million (US$830 million), although it is up to the court to determine the size of the penalty. The case followed an ACCC investigation into reports users who had an error that disabled their iPads or iPhones after updating their operating systems were "routinely refused" by Apple to have their devices looked at or serviced. These customers previously had their devices serviced by a third-party, "even where that repair was unrelated to the fault", the government body said. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third-party repairer not only impacts those consumers. "(It) can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." Apple in Australia had no immediate response. It is not the first time Apple has fallen foul of the ACCC. In 2013, it worked with the watchdog over a court-enforceable undertaking after alleged "misleading representations" to customers that it did not need to refund, replace or repair some products even though required to under Australian law.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 6, 2017 11:23 am Apple is said to delay the launch of its upcoming iPhone 8, dubbed as iPhone Edition to October-November time frame instead of the September. Apple is said to delay the launch of its upcoming iPhone 8, dubbed as iPhone Edition to October-November time frame instead of the September. The report comes from DigiTimes via Economic Daily News which claims “technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices”. The new report is in contrast with the one published in Barren’s Tech radar earlier. The site quoted BlueFin Research Partners’s John Donovan and Steve Mullane who said there’s ‘some indication’ Apple will ramp up the production of iPhone 8 and start the supply chain by June. Further, it stated that this doesn’t necessarily mean there will be a change in the launch date of iPhone 8. Samsung is said to be the sole supplier for Apple’s new iPhone OLED display panels. According to a report in Japan’s Nikkei paper, Apple has placed an order for 70 million OLED panels with Samsung Electronics. All of these panels will be used in Apple’s new phones. Read: Apple iPhone 8 unlikely to cost above $1000: Report Of course, the DigiTimes report should be taken with a pinch of salt as the site isn’t particularly known for accurate Apple-related leaks. Plus there are no other indications pointing to delay in the launch of iPhone 8. The upcoming iPhone is expected to feature a radical new design change given the year 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of iPhones for Apple. According to analyst Steven Milunovich from UBS, iPhone 8 will cost between $700 and $900, contrary to earlier speculations that it will be priced above $1000. The 64GB iPhone 8 could cost at $850-$900, while the 256GB model might cost $950 or $1000. Apple is expected to launch two more smartphones – the 4.7-inch or 5-inch iPhone 7s and 5.5-inch iPhone 7s Plus – along side the 5.8-inch iPhone 8. Multiple reports suggest only iPhone 8 will have OLED display, which means its base price will be slightly over the iPhone 7s. Also Read: Apple iPhones will be manufactured in Bengaluru: Here are the details Apple is likely to get rid of the home button on the front, and could introduce wireless charging on the new iPhones. The iPhone 8 series will feature a glass and steel design as seen on earlier iPhone models.

While it came with the best features, it didn’t bode well for users who are looking forward to the 7th-generation of the device. Since Apple released the latest model in 2016, it’s doubtful the successor will be ever made this year. It could take a few years again before the company updates the iPod line, but there are already predictions of what it could offer should it hit the shelves soon. When the tech giant made the most recent Apple iPod Touch, they used the technology of previous iPhones. For instance, the 6th-gen model had the performance specs of an iPhone 5 and came with the Apple A8 chip found in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Its design may not be similar to the smartphone line, but the latest iPod model was on par with the iPhone 6 which is quite impressive for an iPod. That said, many are expecting for Apple to keep this tradition for the iPod Touch 7. Touch ID Among the most requested features for the successor is the Touch ID, which enables users to unlock the device using their fingerprints. We can recall that the technology has become a standard for the iPhone since its inclusion in the iPhone 5S. It’s about time the tech giant incorporates the feature to its iPod line which could very well debut on the rumored iPod Touch 2017. Apple Pay Should this materialize, Apple Pay can be employed in the media player. This is definitely a nifty feature for users to have on the iPod touch, which already offers the Wallet facility to store credit card information. At this point, the mobile payment method is only compatible with iPhones, select iPads, and the Apple Watch. The company has not revealed any plans of bringing the service to the upcoming 7th-gen iPod Touch. However, as more people are starting to opt using contactless payment options, its integration on the rumored device isn’t far-fetched. Apple iPod Touch 2017: Apple Pay is only compatible with iPhones, select iPads, and the Apple Watch at this point. Dual Camera Setup & More People are also expecting improvements on the camera of the next iPod Touch. Given the popularity of dual cameras nowadays, many believe Apple should include it on the 7th-gen to keep up with the times. There are also talks of a bigger screen, wireless charging, and GPS support for the next model. But again, these are merely predictions. The release of the 7th-gen iPod Touch remains indefinite to date. Some tech outlets do not expect any update this year, considering the iPod line’s declining sales in recent years which can be attributed to customers’ aggressive shift to smartphones. So, as usual, we’ll have to sit back and wait for any announcement. We’ll be sure to update you, though, once they do. What features do you want to see on the rumored iPod Touch 2017? Do you think we’ll get the upgrade this year? Sound off in the comments below!

According to earlier reports, Apple is set to unveil the said phone along with the updates for the current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. However, it would seem that this will not be the case after all. A new report suggests that Apple might delay the iPhone 8 release to anywhere between October and November this year. According to Digitimes, Apple is currently having some technical difficulties with the 3D sensor that will go with the iPhone 8. This sensor is said to be used for the 3D facial recognition feature of the phone. Furthermore, it will also help in applications requiring augmented reality or AR as well as virtual reality or VR. In the said report, it would seem that Apple is having a hard time merging the OLED display glass and the 3D sensor. The issue lies in the lamination process that is used to merge the two together. Because of this, Apple might decide to delay the release of the iPhone 8. iPhone 8 concept (via macrumors.com) Right now, there are no means of verifying the validity of these claims. Readers are urged to take this bit of news with a grain of salt. The iPhone 8 is said to be a revolutionary phone. Apple fans somehow know what to expect on how the phone would look like because of countless leaked third-party renderings. In addition to this, Samsung just released the Galaxy S8 which uses a similar curved OLED display. The iPhone 8 is said to be priced beyond $1,000 on its release. This is due to the various rumours about the improvements that Apple has put into the phone. Apart from the curved OLED display and 3D facial recognition, the phone will also be waterproof and capable of wireless charging.

Last year alone, Apple shipped around 12 million Apple Watches. This enabled the company to capture roughly half of the global market for smartwatches. While the Apple Watch Series 2 is still relatively new, there are rumors now that the Apple Watch Series 3 is coming very soon. According to Digitimes, Apple has acquired a new supplier for the Apple Watch. This new supplier, Compal, will be in charge of manufacturing current models of the Apple Watch as well as the Series 3 version. Furthermore, Compal will start shipping finished products sometime in the second half of 2017. This bit of news led many to believe that Apple could be unveiling a new Apple Watch sometime in September. There is a high chance that the said release will coincide with the launch of this year’s iPhone upgrades. Unfortunately, both Compal and Apple declined to comment on the report. Apple Watch Edition (via apple.com) At the moment, very little is known about the Apple Watch Series 3. So far, a number of reports point to a newer display technology. The new smartwatch is said to use the new micro-LED display instead of the current OLED panel. This new display technology is much brighter and thinner than the current display used on the Series 2. This will enable Apple to reduce the overall thickness of the upcoming watch a bit further if it chooses this new display technology. Another rumored spec for the Apple Watch Series 3 is the inclusion of an LTE module. This new hardware will make it possible for the Apple Watch to not rely on a mobile device in terms of data and network connectivity. Unfortunately, these are but rumors based on the market and supply chain movements. There are no ways of knowing whether Apple would indeed go for these improvements. However, on the Series, 2, it was speculated that it will include a GPS chip on release, and it did. Therefore, going with this way of thinking, it is also possible that Apple will finally include an LTE module on the Apple Watch Series 3.

There are even new ARM processors that are somewhat comparable to the previous generation desktop processors. This jump in performance led many to speculate that Apple could be making a jump as well to ARM for its line of laptops like the MacBook Pro. While it could be quite possible, Apple made it clear that it does not have any intentions of changing systems for the MacBook Pro or any other Mac device. According to Axios, Apple has no intentions of using an ARM chip to a Mac or a MacBook Pro as a main system. However, the company is not closing its doors on the possibility for more ARM chips used for peripheral devices. At the moment, the latest MacBook Pro is already equipped with an ARM chip. This chip controls the Touch Bar and Touch ID features of the 1026 MacBook Pro. While the prospect of using an ARM chip to MacBook Pro is quite enticing, it will remain to be with the mobile devices that Apple sells in the market. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) Even if Apple chooses to switch to the ARM platform, it is not entirely new to the company. In fact, back in 2006, Apple made a huge decision to ditch the PowerPC line of processors in favor of the Intel line of chips. Another aspect of it not being a surprise at all is the fact that Intel has been lagging behind in terms of performance for a few years now. Its old strategy of small incremental upgrades for each product released has led to the boost in market for other products like the AMD Ryzen processor. Perhaps the most obvious change that could possibly come is the switch to AMD processors instead of ARM chips. Right now, Intel is caught between a rock and a hard place as AMD unleashed its newest line of cheap and high-performance processors. Maybe in the near future, consumers could be seeing a Mac product that uses an AMD processor. In hindsight, Apple has already made the switch to AMD graphics on the new MacBook Pros and Mac Pros. It is only a matter of time before it makes the same switch to AMD processors. For more updates on the MacBook Pro, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The tech giant "made false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law," the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) charged. The proceedings, against Apple Pty Limited and its US-based parent Apple Inc, were brought on behalf of 275 consumers. Under Australian law, each breach can attract a fine of up to Aus$1.1 million (US$830 million), although it is up to the court to determine the size of the penalty. The case followed an ACCC investigation into reports users who had an error that disabled their iPads or iPhones after updating their operating systems were "routinely refused" by Apple to have their devices looked at or serviced. These customers previously had their devices serviced by a third-party, "even where that repair was unrelated to the fault", the government body said. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third-party repairer not only impacts those consumers. "(It) can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." Apple in Australia had no immediate response. Sims said companies must remember that consumer rights extended to software or software updates on goods they sell. "Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law," he said, adding that the ACCC was seeking remedies including financial penalties. It is not the first time Apple has fallen foul of the ACCC. In 2013, it worked with the watchdog over a court-enforceable undertaking after alleged "misleading representations" to customers that it did not need to refund, replace or repair some products even though required to under Australian law. 6 Apr 2017 Previous Back to summary Next Newsletter AFP Subscribe to our newsletter AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

Technology & Business Gizmodo Kotaku Lifehacker Business Insider Lifestyle & Shopping POPSUGAR ShopStyle Who What Wear Byrdie MyDomaine Kin Community | The ACCC Is Taking Apple To Federal Court Over 'Error 53' Campbell Simpson Apr 6, 2017, 2:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  accc apple Australian Stories Share Australia's consumer and competition watchdog is taking Apple to court again. This time, it's over the Error 53 "security feature" that bricked iPhones with third-party screen repairs. The ACCC says its investigation shows Apple appears to have refused to look at defective devices repaired by a third party. As we reported back in February last year, the ACCC says that under Australian Consumer Law, customers are entitled to warranty support free of charge if their goods don't comply with consumer guarantees - even if repairs have been made to a different and unaffected or unconnected component of the device by a third party. "The ACCC alleges Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, 'unauthorised repairers'. However, having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees." In its media statement, the ACCC says it's seeking a host of reliefs against Apple — "pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs" — for this alleged overreach. The last time Apple and the ACCC were this clearly at loggerheads was in December 2013, again over consumer guarantees. Error 53: The Timeline Why Is Apple Killing Customers' iPhones? Over the weekend, you may have read reports about Apple "bricking" multiple iOS devices that had undergone third-party repairs. According to the Guardian, customers who elect to fix their damaged iPhones through unauthorised repair providers have been receiving an "Error 53" message which renders the device useless. Apple has since issued an official statement to address the mounting furore. Apparently, it's a deliberate "security feature". Should we be grabbing our pitchforks? Read more Apple To Reimburse Customers Over 'Error 53' Controversy Apple has come under fire for "bricking" iOS devices that have been fixed by third-party repair shops. After the repairs are done, iOS device users reported that they received an "Error 53" message which would lock up their iPhones or iPads. Apple has insisted that this is a "security feature" but the company has now done an about-face on this issue. Read more ACCC Is Gunning After Apple For Error 53 'Security Feature' Last week, Apple came under fire for "bricking" iPhones that had undergone unauthorised, third-party repairs instead of going through the official iPhone Repair store.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MOBILE Apple bringing more chip design in-house to lower costs and speed development Reuters April 5, 2017 8:44 PM Tags: Apple, Arm, Imagination Technologies, Intel, TSMC Image Credit: Martin Abegglen (Reuters) – Apple’s decision to stop licensing graphics chips from Imagination Technologies is the clearest example yet of the iPhone maker’s determination to take greater control of the core technologies in its products – both to guard its hefty margins and to position it for future innovations, especially in so-called augmented reality. The strategy, analysts say, has already reduced Apple’s dependence on critical outside suppliers like ARM, now owned by SoftBank. Apple once relied heavily on ARM to design the main processor for the iPhone, but it now licenses only the basic ARM architecture and designs most of the chip itself. More recently, when Apple bought the headphone company Beats Electronics, part of a $3 billion deal in 2014, it ripped out the existing, off-the-shelf communications chips and replaced them with its own custom-designed W1 Bluetooth chip. “Apple clearly got rid of all the conventional suppliers and replaced about five chips with one,” said Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside electronics devices. “Today we do much more in-house development of fundamental technologies than we used to,”Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said at a February conference. “Think of the work we do on processors or sensors. We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality.” Most vendors of consumer electronics products rely on outside suppliers for chip design and development, primarily because it is extremely expensive. That has created huge opportunities for companies like ARM, Qualcomm and Nvidia, which have developed core technologies for processing, communications and graphics that are used by scores of vendors. Now, though, Apple is so big that it can economically create its own designs, or license small pieces of others’ work and build on it. As with ARM and Qualcomm, the actual manufacturing of the chips is still contracted out to a semiconductor foundry, such as those run by Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Move fast, save money Bringing more of the design work in-house cuts complexity, people familiar with the processes say. Instead of managing one or more design teams and then a fabricator, Apple has only to manage the fabricator. It may also help the company move faster – and save money – as it focuses on new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality. Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated that Apple plans to integrate augmented reality into its products, which makes 3-D sensors and graphics chips like Imagination’s especially important. Even before formally cutting off Imagination, Apple had given hints that it was preparing to design its own graphics processors. Specifically, it introduced a piece of its own code called Metal for app developers. App developers use Metal to make their apps talk to the graphics chip on the iPhone. By putting a piece of Apple-designed code between app developers and the phone’s chip, Applehas made it possible to swap out the chip without interrupting how the developers work. That could also make it easier to bridge the gap for developers between the graphics chips on Apple’s phones and its desktop computers, which currently require some separate coding. “By promoting Metal instead of relying on other existing standards, Apple is not only able to control what graphics chip functionality is exposed at its own pace, but also blur the line for developers between coding for desktop and mobile GPUs,” said Pius Uzamere, the founder of a virtual reality startup called Ether. Taking control of the iPhone’s chips can also help Apple keep costs down, which is especially important as it gears up for a feature-laden new iPhone this fall. Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co said in a research note that he thinks the curved screens expected on the new phone could add as much as $50 in cost, for example. Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities, estimates that the average price of an iPhone increased only 1 percent to $695 last quarter, while costs increased 8 percent to $420, resulting in an iPhone gross margin of 39.6 percent. That is down from the 44 percent average gross margin for iPhones in 2015, according to Seyrafi’s estimates. Apple spends only $75 million a year on licensing fees for Imagination’s chips. But licensing fees to chip designers, taken together, are a significant cost for the iPhone. Apple recently sued Qualcomm for $1 billion over licensing terms for its communications chips – which Apple would have trouble designing in-house because of patent issues.

It’s been over three years since the machines were given even a specification bump, and that’s left many wondering if Apple had any plans to continue making them. Today, Apple announced that a new Mac Pro is coming someday that should please its most faithful fans. For now, however, those fans will have to settle for a small increase in specifications, as Daring Fireball reports. More: New Mac desktops are coming and they’re ‘great,’ says Apple CEO Tim Cook Apple’s Phil Shiller outlined Apple’s general plan regarding the Mac Pro’s complete overhaul: “With regards to the Mac Pro, we are in the process of what we call ‘completely rethinking the Mac Pro.’ We’re working on it. We have a team working hard on it right now, and we want to architect it so that we can keep it fresh with regular improvements, and we’re committed to making it our highest-end, high-throughput desktop system, designed for our demanding pro customers. As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a pro display as well. Now you won’t see any of those products this year; we’re in the process of that. We think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that’ll take longer than this year to do.” As Daring Fireball notes, describing a future product isn’t Apple’s preference. Usually, the company works in silence and then introduces new products with great fanfare. And so coming right out and describing what it’s working on is unusual. In any case, that new modular Mac Pro won’t be arriving in 2017, and Apple was cagey about whether it would arrive in 2018. In the meantime, Mac Pro users waiting for a modern, innovative machine will have to settle in the meantime for the same Mac Pro with slightly upgraded components. apple announces new mac pro interiorMore apple announces new mac pro interiorMore Those upgrades are relatively small. The $3,000 quad-core Mac Pro with dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs has morphed into a six-core Mac Pro with dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs. The $4,000 model now has an eight-core processor and dual AMD FirePro D800 GPUs, replacing the model that is now slotted in at the low-end. Both models have 16GB of RAM and neither has USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3, and neither are yet reflected in the Apple Store configurations. Read More According to Apple, Mac revenues are split roughly into roughly 80 percent notebooks and 20 percent desktops. So, while desktops aren’t the most significant portion of Mac revenues for the company, they’re not insignificant either. Roughly 30 percent of Apple users use professional software at least weekly — a significant portion of its user base, but not overwhelming. Nevertheless, this should be good news for anyone who has been waiting and hoping for a Mac Pro refresh. For now, you’ll have to settle for a slightly faster version of the existing model, but Apple hasn’t forgotten that you also want it to innovate in this market as well. You’ll just have to wait a bit longer to see what it comes up with.

Technology & Business Gizmodo Kotaku Lifehacker Business Insider Lifestyle & Shopping POPSUGAR ShopStyle Who What Wear Byrdie MyDomaine Kin Community | The ACCC Is Taking Apple To Court Alex Walker Apr 6, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  accc apple Australian Stories error 53 Share Image: Gizmodo Have you ever experienced the joy of getting "error 53" on your precious iOS device and taken it to Apple, only for them to refuse to look at it? Good news: an ACCC investigation allegedly uncovered the same thing, and they're taking Apple to court. In a media release earlier this morning, the ACCC announced that they discovered Apple had "routinely refused to look at or service consumers' defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault". The investigation was kicked off by the infamous "error 53", an error some users saw after downloading an update for iOS on their iPad or iPhone. "The ACCC alleges Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, 'unauthorised repairers'," the consumer watchdog argued. "However, having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees." Rod Sims, chairman of the ACCC, noted that Australian consumer guarantees cannot be voided "simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party" and that they remain independent of any warranty from a manufacturer. "As consumer goods become increasingly complex, businesses also need to remember that consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto those goods," Sims said in the release. For more information about the dreaded error 53, and what you can do about it, here's some info from our friends at Gizmodo: Apple's iPhone 'Error 53' Is A Security Feature, Not A Bug Earlier today the Guardian reported on mounting "fury" over a mysterious "Error 53" appearing on iPhones repaired by unauthorised repair providers.

The lawsuit targets Apple’s stringent repair and warranty process, specifically mentioning the infamous Error 53 bug that plagued numerous users last year… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case In the lawsuit, the ACCC explains that Apple rendered a multitude of consumer devices completely useless via software update last February. As we reported at the time, the Error 53 fiasco was centered around devices that had Touch ID module or screen repairs by an unauthorized third-party, thus causing the device to fail Apple’s security checks. The ACCC goes on to say that customers are entitled to specific “customer guarantees” when they purchase a good. This relates to things like the quality, suitability for purpose, and other characteristics of the good. These guarantees exist in addition to the standard warranty that may come with a product and require that companies provide remedies at no cost for situations where a product does not comply with the aforementioned guarantees. The argument made by the ACCC is that having a repair done by a third-party does not mean that Apple has the right to later refuse a fix of its own. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer.” In its case against Apple, the ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs. At the time, Apple explained that Error 53 appeared when a customer had a Home button replaced by a third-party. Apple would run security checks and because the Touch ID module was different, the device would fail the check. Here is how the company defended the error: “We take customer security very seriously and Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers. iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device’s other components. If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled.” The issue was the subject of a class action in the United States, though it was eventually thrown out due to a lack of merit. The full statement from the ACCC can be read here. Apple has yet to respond. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

The tech giant "made false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law," the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) charged. The proceedings, against Apple Pty Limited and its US-based parent Apple Inc, were brought on behalf of 275 consumers. Under Australian law, each breach can attract a fine of up to Aus$1.1 million (US$830 million), although it is up to the court to determine the size of the penalty. The case followed an ACCC investigation into reports users who had an error that disabled their iPads or iPhones after updating their operating systems were "routinely refused" by Apple to have their devices looked at or serviced. These customers previously had their devices serviced by a third-party, "even where that repair was unrelated to the fault", the government body said. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third-party repairer not only impacts those consumers. "(It) can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." Apple in Australia had no immediate response. Sims said companies must remember that consumer rights extended to software or software updates on goods they sell. "Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law," he said, adding that the ACCC was seeking remedies including financial penalties. It is not the first time Apple has fallen foul of the ACCC. In 2013, it worked with the watchdog over a court-enforceable undertaking after alleged "misleading representations" to customers that it did not need to refund, replace or repair some products even though required to under Australian law.

Rich Duprey, Steve Symington, and Timothy Green (TMFCop) Apr 5, 2017 at 9:05PM Although there have been periods in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) history where you would have suffered some gut-wrenching declines in its share price, the overall history of owning Apple stock has been one of ever higher gains. Today the technology giant stands at record highs, and its shares have total annual returns above 35% over the last 15 years -- including periods where there have been those sickening plunges. So, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to share why they believe Apple stock remains a buy today. Image source: Apple. Look beyond the iPhone Rich Duprey: Although Apple generates almost two-thirds of its revenue today from the iPhone, it's far from a one-trick pony. First, the iPhone has only been around for less than a decade (we're coming up on its 10-year anniversary this June), showing the tidal shift the smartphone created, and not just for Apple, but for the industry itself. And it's not really showing any signs of aging, either. Later this year, Apple will be unveiling the latest iteration of this cultural icon, the iPhone 8, and some analysts think the results could be huge as we may be on the cusp of a upgrade supercycle. Because the most recent versions of the smartphone have been improved incrementally, there are millions of users with iPhones that are several generations out, therefore the newest model could be swept along by a tsunami of upgrades, particularly since the latest Samsung Galaxy failed to really wow the market. Apple, of course, also has its Macs, iPads, Beats, and the usual assortment of tech gadgets we've grown to know over the years, but the real sleeper is its services business, which has been enjoying phenomenal growth. It started from a small base, but it has been piling on double-digit growth rates and has become Apple's second-largest segment behind iPhones, generating more than $24 billion in sales last year (about what all of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) made last year). Services has the potential to become a key driver of growth for Apple in the future because it has multiple streams of revenues itself. The segment includes revenue from Apple's digital content, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing, and more. Revenue from this division was up another 18% in the first quarter, led by record customer activity in the App Store. With so many ways to grow in the future, Apple's stock should be considered a buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images. Outrageous profitability Tim Green: Regardless of what you think about Apple's long-term prospects, it's indisputable that the company is drowning in cash. Despite reporting a revenue decline in 2016, its first since 2001, Apple produced a staggering $52.3 billion of free cash flow. That's down significantly from 2015, but it hardly matters when the numbers are that big. Years of robust cash generation have led to a swelling of Apple's balance sheet. The company has taken on an enormous amount of debt, about $87.5 billion, to fund share buybacks -- necessary because much of its cash is held overseas. But net of that debt, Apple's balance sheet contains cash and investments totaling $159 billion. With a market capitalization of about $750 billion, the market values Apple at a little over 14 times free cash flow, or a little over 11 times free cash flow if the net cash is backed out. That's a tantalizing valuation if you believe that Apple can at least maintain its current level of profitability. The iPhone has showed tremendous staying power despite an onslaught of lower-priced competition, and it's certainly not crazy to believe that the status quo will persist. While moonshots like self-driving cars and augmented reality headsets get a lot of attention, Apple's immense profits and fortress balance sheet are reasons enough to buy the stock. Image source: Getty Images. Ambitious capital returns Steve Symington: It's no mystery that Apple is on a roll, setting company records last quarter for both revenue (up 3.3% year over year, to $78.4 billion) and earnings per diluted share (up 2.4%, to $3.36). But the incredible scale of its capital returns efforts is simply mind-boggling. Apple returned nearly $15 billion to shareholders last quarter alone, for example, including $3.1 billion in dividend payments, $5 billion to repurchase 44.3 million Apple shares on the open market, the completion of an accelerated share repurchase program to retire another 4.4 million shares, and the launch of a new $6 billion accelerated share repurchase authorization that resulted in the initial delivery and retirement of another 44.8 million shares. All told, Apple has exhausted $201 billion of its current $250 billion capital return program, which itself was most recently expanded by $50 billion following the company's first-quarter 2016 earnings report last May. For perspective, Apple promised investors at the time it would complete that program by the end of March 2018. But given the rate at which Apple has already put so much cash back in the hands of shareholders, and with more than $246 billion in cash and marketable securities on Apple's balance sheet at the end of 2016, I won't be the least bit surprised if it once again increases the size of its capital return program in the coming months.

The ACCC alleges Apple illegally denied warranty repairs because of third party work on devices. (Credit: ABC licensed)  The competition and consumer law watchdog is taking action against Apple over allegations it misled consumers about their warranty rights under the Australian Consumer Law. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against Apple after an investigation into "error 53", which saw iPads or iPhones disabled after users downloaded an Apple IOS update. The ACCC alleges Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by an unauthorised third party repairer, even in cases where the repair was unrelated to the fault. Mr Sims said the central allegation was that consumers who had gone to third parties for repairs, for example to fix a cracked screen, were routinely refused any service to their Apple device, even if the fault had nothing to do with the cracked screen. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options - including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." The ACCC is alleging breaches of the law relating to 275 customers, with each breach carrying a maximum penalty of $1.1 million. However, even if the ACCC wins its case in full, it is extremely unlikely that Apple would be fined anywhere near the maximum penalty for each breach. Under the Australian Consumer Law, consumers are entitled to have their goods fixed or replaced at no cost to them in situations where the goods or services are not of an acceptable quality - that is where they have faults, visible damage or do not do what you would normally expect them to. Mr Sims said those consumer guarantees extend to software or software updates loaded onto a product, which means any problems caused by software updates may entitle consumers to a free substitute under the Australian Consumer Law. Apple's behaviour 'very unusual' According to Mr Sims, Apple's behaviour is "very unusual" and not the sort of behaviour that should be going on in a modern economy. "I find [Apple's behaviour] puzzling. We often find with companies generally that they like to have goods repaired by themselves, rather than by third party repairers," he told the ABC. "I think the allegations we're making here, and which are now before the court, are extremely serious ... and I think the allegations if proven, reflect extremely bad behaviour." He said part of the benefit of putting matters like these before the court was to remind both consumers and companies of their rights and responsibilities under the consumer guarantees. The ABC has contacted Apple for its response.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 April 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Next Apple Watch could have standalone mobile connectivity The advantage of a smartwatch with a 4G SIM card is that it is totally autonomous and does not need to have a smartphone nearby. — AFP Relaxnews Two years after the official launch of the Apple Watch, the brand's third generation smartwatch could have a SIM card slot, according to reports by various tech news websites. This could revolutionise its use. The advantage of a smartwatch with a 4G SIM card is that it is totally autonomous and does not need to have a smartphone nearby. The SIM card obviously makes it possible to communicate (phoning and sending SMS/MMS) as well as connecting to the Internet via 3G or 4G. The next Apple Watch could well incorporate the new eSIM technology, meaning a SIM card built into the watch. If Apple makes this move, it will be following a general trend. The latest version of Android Wear, which is the operating system used in most of the devices that rival Apple Watch, now handles autonomous apps which can be installed directly on the watch and no longer need a smartphone to operate. This has prompted a string of manufacturers to offer smartwatches with a SIM card and 4G connectivity. Some of the more high-end examples of this include the LG Watch Sport, LG Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2. The Samsung Gear S3 is another example, using Samsung's own Tizen operating system. The increasingly availability of smartwatches with 4G is one of the reasons why Apple cannot launch a new generation of the Apple Watch which is not standalone. It would therefore be possible to communicate, listen to music, and share on social media without the need for an iPhone nearby. —  AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Traffic offenders, watch out – you could lose your licence under Kejara system Co-ordinate donations to prevent surplus and abuse Forest City project: Penalty for China buyers who seek to cancel purchase Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie 8 types of runners you meet at a marathon Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Customs team to look into chicken wing scavenging incident ‘I still shiver at thought of frostbite’ Amma spreads uplifting power of embrace advertisement Latest News UK increases pressure on Google to remove terrorist content UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Most Viewed in Tech Pepsi pulls Kendall Jenner ad after social media backlash Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Europe regulator says airlines’ tech ban may compromise safety Google’s AI hasn’t passed its biggest test yet: hunting hate Office workers most likely using lunch hour to plan their vacation: Kayak Samsung's foldable smartphone could land this year UK and Swedish watchdogs warn of international cyberattack New travel trends report shows how fliers search and book flights Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

It is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. The Australian competition regulator and national consumer law champion started an investigation following reports relating to "error 53", an inaccuracy which disabled some consumers’ iPads or iPhones after downloading an iOS update. Many consumers who encountered ‘error 53’ had previously had their Apple device repaired by a third party, usually replacing a cracked screen. What ACCC found was that Apple allegedly appeared to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers’ defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault. It stated that under the Australian Consumer Law, users are protected by a number of “consumer guarantees” in relation to the quality, suitability for purpose and other characteristics of goods and services. In addition, the ACCC alleged that Apple represented to consumers faulty products that were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, “unauthorised repairers”. But, it mentioned that having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by anyone besides Apple cannot, by itself, remove the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with consumer guarantees.

Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” This proceeding follows a court enforceable undertaking which the ACCC accepted from Apple in December 2013, following an investigation into Apple’s consumer guarantees policies and practices, and representations about consumers’ rights.

According to Nikkei Asian Review, Apple has ordered the flexible OLED panels from Samsung, ready for the device's launch in September. The 70 million figure revealed by Nikkei's source is in line with estimates by David Hsieh, senior director at research company IHS Markit. "Apple has ordered 70 million units of OLED panels from Samsung this year, while Samsung is preparing to churn out as many as 95 million for Apple in 2017, in case demand exceeds expectations," he said in a previous report. Samsung will be the sole provider of displays because Apple thinks it has the most advanced technology. As this will be the first time a curved display will be integrated into an iPhone, Apple wants to make sure it uses the best available technology. Samsung would not comment on whether it would be supplying Apple with the screens for the iPhone 8, commenting it does not reveal information about any of its customers' orders.

The US technology giant “bricked” — or disabled with a software update — hundreds of smartphones and tablet devices, and then refused to unlock them on the grounds that customers had had the devices serviced by non-Apple repairers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a court filing. “Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. The regulator said that between September 2014 and February 2016, Apple customers who downloaded software updates then connected their devices to their computers received a message saying the device “could not be restored and the device had stopped functioning”. Customers then asked Apple to fix their devices, only to be told by the company that “no Apple entity... was required to, or would, provide a remedy” for free, the documents added. Apple engaged in “misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations to consumers” about its software updates and customers’ rights to have their products repaired by the company, the commission said. As well as fines, the ACCC said it was seeking injunctions, declarations, compliance programme orders, corrective notices, and costs. The lawsuit was filed late yesterday, a week after the consumer watchdog granted Apple a win by denying Australia’s banks the right to introduce a mobile payment system to rival its Apple Wallet. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone ‘bricking’ ‘Mass Effect: Andromeda’ prepares to patch up Mastodon, the new alternative to Twitter Facebook to use photo-matching to block repeat ‘revenge porn’ Twitter creates ‘lite’ version for data-starved users Find the stations with the cheapest petrol with MyPetrol app Apple ‘spaceship’ headquarters readies for boarding China’s TCL brings back physical keyboard in new BlackBerry Google adds new languages, voice dictation to its iPhone keyboard Lazada launches ‘Lovezada’ dating app (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Related Articles Chinese court rules in favour of Apple in local design patent disputes Late-night snacks that are actually good for you China’s secretive billionaire reveals how he toppled Apple Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for more global trade with China New Bar president hopes to keep cordial ties with AG, says lawsuit just business Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

That’s because, somewhere in my carrer, I was exposed to the military concept of getting inside the enemy’s decision cycle. This was further refined by the legendary USAF Colonel John Boyd as the OODA loop. Observe, orient, decide and act. From Wikipedia: An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent can thereby ‘get inside’ the opponent’s decision cycle and gain the advantage. The OODA (or Boyd) Loop. A corollary of this OODA loop is that rapidly changing technology, a massive influx of too much non-curated information, consumer response, social media and actions by the competition can also get inside a corporation’s decision cycle. The result is often dramatic. First, the outcome of the decisions made by an organization often can’t be assessed until it’s too late. Next, by the time the mistake is recognized, even if very early, the pace of change and events have pushed the decision makers into a new set of possibly bad decisions to either remedy or move forward. The Damping Period The problem with early decision making is that both the pros and cons appear to have equal weight at first. If there are proponents of each side of the argument, each can make a convincing case—at first. Later, after a suitable damping period, the objective facts sort out. A problem arises when the damping period is longer than time for the next critical decision. A damped oscillator and damping period as an analog. Uncertainty at start; objective truth at the end. It’s time for an example. Apple launched the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar at the end of October, 2016. It wasn’t generally available until early November. So Apple didn’t have a full quarter’s worth of sales data going into 2017. But the tremors induced both by the Microsoft Surface Studio and Apple’s pro users were instantaneous and influential. Apple invested a lot in the Touch Bar as a technical alternative to touching the display of a Mac. Also, the company made a big investment in the beauty of a thin MBP. However, what pro users yearned for was more RAM (32 GB), more CPU/GPU speed, and a longer battery life. That’s what competitors were providing. Initial sales were enough to offset a decline in overall Mac sales for Q1, but we don’t know if that was simply pent up demand or affection for the Touch Bar. I’d guess Apple won’t know for sure for another quarter. It’s likely that Apple is now beginning to finally assess the sales success, consumer utilization and developer support for the Touch Bar. But now it’s time (perhaps past time) for Apple to envision the next generation MBP and decide if they met the expectations of their pro users. Perhaps the company will learn from its Mac Pro experience. The Apple CEO is now a starship captain. Case Study: The Mac Pro Debacle The inattention to the Mac Pro gave Apple plenty of time to diagnose the situation and make a decision going forward. But the cost was a serious corporate initiative by both HP and Microsoft to move in on Apple’s tech and creative pro customers. Apple’s recent response was heartening, but it will come very late. Some customers will wait things out, but many will defect from the fold. Meanwhile, Apple’s prestige has taken a serious hit. One of the black arts in technical leadership is to have great, even ruthless, instincts about how a decision will take its course without having to wait too long into the damping period for the final validation. One euphemism for that is the well-worn notion of “skating to where the puck will be, not where it is.” Steve Jobs was good at that. How do we determine when a company is managing its decision cycle well? One way is to see products evolving rapidly and being released on a regular basis. It’s a sign of decision authority being delegated by top management. Rapid OODA loops, decision authority and frequent product cycles are something Apple hasn’t been able to do lately, outside the iPhone, and 2017 will tell us if Apple has corrected the problem. Summary Large companies are like aircraft carriers. They’re powerful, but hard to turn on a dime. For a corporation to respond effectively to an ever increasing pace of change, changes that can infect and destroy decision cycles, the delegation of authority is important. The improper delegation of responsibility without the attendant and required authority is a genuine challenge as companies grow to enormous size. We’ve seen how Apple’s decision cycles are getting longer and longer, not shorter in the non-iPhone product areas. Those longer decision cycles aren’t going to work for much longer in the tech world where every opening and every mistake by Apple creates an opportunity for other companies who want a piece of Apple’s action. The evolution of Apple’s iPad and the entire Mac lineup in 2017/8 will tell us a lot about how Apple is solving its OODA loop problems.

(Google it). Basically, the concept was to just make a well thought out decision and take action. Then based on whether you hit the target (which you likely didn’t), refine your decision/action (or product, if you will) and then you will be able to aim precisely. It seems like Apple does this with many of its products. April 5, 2017 at 7:25 EDT PM Lee Dronick April 5, 2017 “Spot on”, Mike. I was in the Navy and sometimes you wanted to get a round off as soon as possible and then accuratly adjust the gun. April 5, 2017 at 8:55 EDT PM John Martellaro April 5, 2017 Mike, Lee: Reminds me of a quote from the famous SciFi author Robert Heinlein. It goes something like this, as I recall: “Get your first shot off fast. This disorients the opponent just long enough to make your second shot perfect.” Heinlein was a Navy guy, BTW. April 5, 2017 at 9:12 EDT PM vpndev April 5, 2017 I well remember that Microsoft scheduled its Surface Pro rollout the day before Apple’s announcement, of the new MacBook Pros. But it had been widely suggested that the long-ignored iMac might also get an update then. I wonder if that was just wishful thinking, or did Apple pull the iMac from the event because it would have been seen as a poor effort in comparison? And that would have seriously overshadowed the MBPs. I guess no-one asked that the other day. And also that it wouldn’t have received an answer even if they had. April 5, 2017 at 10:58 EDT PM JonGl April 6, 2017 The problem right now, is that Apple keeps _telling_ us what they are doing or rather, going to do, but what I need is for Apple to _show_ me what they are doing. Give us product, and with that, I have a question, why are we discussing this in 2017, and why wasn’t Apple doing this in 2015 or earlier, even? I’ve been running a 2010 MBP since 2010, and never upgraded because there wasn’t a compelling-enough replacement for me–the upgrades seemed to be too minor to warrant the $1500 cost. And, what did Apple give me in the end? a touch bar and an extra $200 tacked on the price. Honestly, I’d rather the touch screen. It’s not like touching the screen is going to _replace_ the track pad, but it is a wonderful supplement, especially if you allow the screen to lie flat (180° flat). It is like Apple is trying so hard to be what they think it is supposed to be, or what they think it was, without actually _being_ Apple. Jobs was, simply put, able to turn about on a dime, and was compelling enough to force Apple to do that. Nobody at Apple has this ability, and that is what is sorely missing. Apple has become too ponderous. I think they will put out good product in the end, but it may end up being too little and too late. They need to return to showing us, and not telling us what they are doing. Seriously, with all that cash, and all that talent, I find it hard to believe that they couldn’t turn something out in months, rather than years.

It is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against Apple. The Australian competition regulator and national consumer law champion started an investigation following reports relating to "error 53", an inaccuracy which disabled some consumers’ iPads or iPhones after downloading an iOS update. Many consumers who encountered ‘error 53’ had previously had their Apple device repaired by a third party, usually replacing a cracked screen. What ACCC found was that Apple allegedly appeared to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers’ defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault. It stated that under the Australian Consumer Law, users are protected by a number of “consumer guarantees” in relation to the quality, suitability for purpose and other characteristics of goods and services. In addition, the ACCC alleged that Apple represented to consumers faulty products that were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, “unauthorised repairers”. But, it mentioned that having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by anyone besides Apple cannot, by itself, remove the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with consumer guarantees. ACCC chairperson Rod Sims Read more TPG coughs up $22.5M in mobile spectrum push ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, said consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer,” he said. “As consumer goods become increasingly complex, businesses also need to remember that consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto those goods. Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” This proceeding follows a court enforceable undertaking which the ACCC accepted from Apple in December 2013, following an investigation into Apple’s consumer guarantees policies and practices, and representations about consumers’ rights.

By Asha McLean | April 6, 2017 -- 01:43 GMT (18:43 PDT) | Topic: Legal The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has initiated proceedings in the Federal Court against Apple and its US-based parent company, Apple Inc, alleging that the tech giant made false, misleading, or deceptive representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law. In a statement, the ACCC said it commenced an investigation into Apple following reports relating to "error 53", which was an error that disabled some consumers' iPads or iPhones after downloading an update on their devices. Latest Australian news Qantas launching beta on-board Wi-Fi NBN lower-grade services 'not acceptable': Queensland government Digital Transformation Agency appoints former NAB exec as new CEO Privacy Foundation calls for human intervention in Centrelink debt collection Australian banking cartel loses fight against Apple According to the ACCC, many consumers who experienced error 53 had previously had their Apple device repaired by a third party, for instances such as a cracked screen. The ACCC said its investigation revealed that Apple appeared to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers' defective devices if they had the device repaired by a third party, even when that repair was unrelated to the fault. Under the Australian Consumer Law, there are a number of "consumer guarantees" regarding the quality, suitability for purpose, and other characteristics of goods and services, the ACCC explained, and consumers are entitled to certain remedies at no cost where goods and services do not comply with the consumer guarantees. As a result, the consumer watchdog alleges that Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third-party unauthorised repairers. This practice, according to the ACCC, cannot by itself remove a consumer's right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees. "Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said on Thursday. "Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third-party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options, including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer." Sims used the opportunity to inform other players in the consumer tech space that under Australian law, consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto goods and devices. "Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law," he explained. The ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs against the Californian giant. In December 2013, the ACCC accepted a court-enforceable undertaking from Apple following an investigation into the iPhone maker's consumer guarantees policies and practices, and representations about consumers' rights under the Australian Consumer Law. The ACCC conducted its investigation after becoming concerned that Apple was misleading customers on what consumer guarantee rights they had. These included telling customers that Apple is not required to provide refunds and/or replace or repair products, when these guarantees are covered under the Australian Consumer Law. According to the ACCC, Apple staff may also have told customers that they were not entitled to refunds 14 days after purchase, or that they are only covered by a 12-month limited manufacturer's warranty. However, under the Australian Consumer Law, customers are always permitted a refund if there is a major problem with the product, and products sold are always automatically protected with a consumer guarantee. "The ACCC was concerned that Apple was applying its own warranties and refund policies effectively to the exclusion of the consumer guarantees contained in the Australian Consumer Law," Sims said at the time. The watchdog informed Apple at the same time that a retailer cannot refuse to help a customer, even in the case of faulty non-Apple products.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC's) lawsuit is over whether consumers here are allowed to have third-party screen replacements that come without the hefty price of an original. In its announcement, the ACCC alleges “Apple appears to have routinely refused to look at or service consumers’ defective devices if a consumer had previously had the device repaired by a third party repairer, even where that repair was unrelated to the fault.” That, the regulator says, is in breach of Australia's consumer law regarding warranties. Its lawsuit claims Apple told consumers that third-party repairs voided their warranties. “[H]aving a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees,” the ACCC says. Commissioner Rod Sims makes this interesting statement in the commission's press release: “consumer rights”, he says, “extend to any software or software updates” in complex consumer goods. “Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” Perhaps the ACCC has noticed how much of the exceeding awfulness of the Internet of Things is down to manufacturers slacking their software security and patching responsibilities. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments More from The Register We wanna give IoT folk kilobit data rates, beam NB-IoT telcos MBBF2016 Um.

The redesigned computer is said to be modular, so that upgrades could be easily carried out by owners regularly. The Cupertino tech giant also disclosed it is working on professional displays.  On Tuesday, John Gruber shared via Daring Fireball what he’s learned from the private meeting he had with Apple and a group of journalists. According to him, Cook’s company divulged there is now a “completely rethought” Mac Pro in the works, and this one will come with a modular design. A good reference to how modular technology works is the LG G5, which came with switchable parts. Another is the scrapped Project Ara smartphone that was originally intended to provide consumers with a handset that have easy-to-upgrade hardware components. Apple is also taking the same approach with the next-generation Mac Pro, for it desires to roll out upgraded components on a regular basis. Aside from the redesigned Mac Pro, Gruber has also learned from Apple that the company is working on displays that would go with the new desktop machine. No other details about the displays were given. Instead, marketing chief Phil Schiller revealed that both the next-generation Mac Pro and the Apple-branded displays “will not ship this year” since they still need more time to work on the two. For this year, Apple is planning to just focus on updating the configurations of its current Mac Pros’ CPUs and GPUs.  READ: Apple severing ties with Imagination Technologies?  True to its word, Apple Insider learned Apple issued a minor speed bump for the existing Mac Pros on Tuesday. Now the base $2,999 model has a six-core Xeon CPU and dual AMD G500 GPU configuration. As for the $3,999 model, it now has eight cores and dual D800 graphics cards. “The CPUs, we’re moving them down the line. The GPUs, down the line, to get more performance per dollar for customers who DO need to continue to buy them on the interim until we get to a newly architected system,” Schiller said.  Lastly, another good news to Apple fans that arrived this week is the confirmation that new iMacs are scheduled for launch later this year. The company said that it has “great” new iMacs in the pipeline. The new iMacs will be designed with professional customers in mind. “That is a pretty incredible evolution that we’ve seen over the last decade … We can take iMac as a high performance, pro system, and we think that form factor can address even more of the pro market,” Apple’s Senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said.  AppleMore Tim Cook’s company has just announced that it will be releasing an all-new Mac Pro next year.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues The good news and bad news of Apple’s Mac Pro announcement Jason Snell 6 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News This week’s announcement by Apple that the current Mac Pro will be replaced by a new model–but not this year–was one of the most curious ones it’s made in recent memory. It was a defense of the Mac, a promise of things to come, an attempt to reassure professional Mac users, and an admission of failure, all at once. Here’s what it was: A restatement of Apple’s support for the Mac. Three years ago, Phil Schiller sat across a table from me at Apple’s Infinite Loop campus and responded to my question about the future of the Mac by saying, “The Mac keeps going forever.” And in stories posted today based on a prior interview, Schiller said much the same thing. “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple… we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac,” he said. For those who doubt the esteem the Mac holds at Apple, it’s worth nothing that Apple has been unwavering in its insistence that the Mac is an ongoing concern, not a product with a rapidly approaching expiration date. A remarkable admission of failure. The lack of updates on the Mac Pro made it obvious that this product was a flop, but it’s still to Apple’s credit that it came out and took its lumps. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the execs went into some detail about how the company made a bet on a unique design approach in the hopes that pro users would come to relay on the two GPUs that the system provided. It was a mistake, perhaps predicated on a troubling lack of understanding about what Apple’s professional customers really desired in a Mac Pro. Apple executives wouldn’t specify exactly when they realized that the existing Mac Pro needed to be killed, but it must have been somewhat recently, or this entire process could have happened sooner. (And perhaps a new Mac Pro would arrive sooner than 2018.) Acceptance that the current Mac Pro isn’t going to sell. Apple very rarely announces any product (or even the existence of a product) months in advance. When it does so, it’s generally in a new category. This is because the moment a company announces that it’s replacing a product with a newer model, sales tend to fall off a cliff. (It’s called the Osborne effect.) But in the case of the Mac Pro, it’s already been so long since the machine was updated, it can’t be selling. A signal sent to professional Mac users. The Mac Pro has been sitting, unadjusted, on Apple’s price lists for years now. The company’s silence on the issue has been deafening. In the past year, speculation about the future of the model has risen to a fever pitch, with cranky pro users beginning to brag about building custom Intel-based PCs as “hackintoshes” running Sierra just to show how far behind the curve Apple is. It seems like Apple has twice tried to cool the ire of the market via Tim Cook statements–one embedded in an internal memo, another expressed in public–about the company’s commitment to pro users. But the statements never took. Cook’s statements were so vague that they could be read as negative by those who wanted to believe the worst. Tuesday’s statement, on the other hand, couldn’t be more clear. A promise of a new Apple-branded monitor. Despite reports that an unnamed Apple executive had declared that Apple was “out of the display business” last year, on Tuesday Schiller confirmed that in addition to the new Mac Pro, Apple would release a display to go along with it. It’s possible that cosmetic and technical issues around the LG display Apple promoted with the new MacBook Pros may have prompted this move. Perhaps there was enough negative feedback around the LG display for someone at Apple to convince the powers that be that it was in Apple’s best interest to control this product category rather than leaving it to a partner? And here’s what it wasn’t: An update to the current Mac Pro. Reports from the writers who attended Apple’s private roundtable session used words like “bump” to support the changes Apple made on the current Mac Pro model today. But as Marco Arment pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t an update at all. Here’s what Schiller said: “In the meantime, we’re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a new design, we’re just going to update the configs. We’re doing that this week.” The two available Mac Pro configurations aren’t new, they’re just newly priced. So if you must buy a Mac Pro right now, at least it’s a better deal than it was. Not a good deal, mind you, but a better one. A solution for people who need a better professional Mac this year. As excited as we can be that the soap-opera story of the fate of the Mac Pro has been resolved, the fact is, its replacement won’t arrive until 2018 at the earliest, and we know nothing about it. If you’re a professional Mac user with a long-in-the-tooth Mac Pro or iMac and you need more power today, or next month, or this fall, Apple won’t have a new Mac Pro to sell you. Perhaps a new iMac will appeal to you–Apple suggested on Tuesday that iMac upgrades that may appeal to professional users are on the horizon–but if not, it’s going to be a long wait. A commitment to update the new Mac Pro in a timely fashion. Schiller suggested that the new Mac Pro will be more capable of receiving hardware updates, but on what schedule? It seems that Apple’s most high-end users want the company to track hardware updates as closely as possible with new chip releases from Intel. When this new Mac Pro debuts in 2018, will the company take that approach? Or will it do as it has done on most of its other computers lately, and lag behind Intel’s processor releases by months? In the end, Tuesday’s announcement allows Apple to stop the bleeding of a self-inflicted wound. It should probably have come to this conclusion a lot sooner, but whether it was an inability for those who green-lit the Mac Pro to see that they had made a mistake or a simple lack of focus on this particular market segment, the product languished far too long and became an embarrassment. At least now the deed is done. The “trash can” Mac is bound for the garbage dump itself. In the long run, it’s good news for Apple’s professional users. But in the short run, it doesn’t change Apple’s lack of competitiveness compared to other Intel PCs. At least now high-end pros can know that if they’re waiting for a solution from Apple in the next few months, they’re probably out of luck.

Plus tax. According to 9to5Mac, Apple is emailing iTunes customers who recently purchased Workflow to let them know that the app is now free and that refunds are imminent. It’s unclear exactly what the purchase window is for refunds, although 9to5Mac reported one Twitter user had bought his version “some weeks ago.” When Apple confirmed the acquisition to TechCrunch in late March, a company spokesperson said Workflow would remain in the App Store as a free app, but didn’t say whether Workflow’s technology would be built into iOS. That would make sense, given that Apple is pitching the iPad Pro as a laptop replacement and Workflow’s behind-the-scenes automation is tailor-made for getting work done on in iOS.

* Optimism on iPhone 8 has attracted foreign funds
    * Imagination Technology crash  may be warning for Apple
suppliers
    * Taiwan investors will anxiously follow Trump-Xi meetings

    By Faith Hung and Nichola Saminather
    TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - Taiwan's stock market
has risen almost 20 percent over the past 15 months but gains
have slowed recently as investors drawn by anticipation of the
iPhone 8 pay more heed to risks previously dismissed.
    With about one-third of its stocks - including heavyweights
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) <2330.TW> <TSM.N>
and Hon Hai Precision Industry <2317.TW> - dependent on Apple
Inc. <AAPL.O>, Taiwan is vulnerable to sharp declines if the
U.S. company turns away from the island for its major suppliers,
or if the iPhone 8 doesn't meet expectations.
    A fate similar to Imagination Technologies' <IMG.L> 70
percent plunge on Monday after Apple's decision to drop the UK
company as a major supplier cannot be ruled out. [nL5N1HB0YX]
[nL2N1HB1UA]
    Export-dependent Taiwan could also see its fortunes reversed
should U.S. President Donald Trump impose a border tax on
imports, or if he labels the island a currency manipulator.
    A bad turn in Taiwan's mercurial relations with China, its
largest trading partner, could also make investors flee.
    "So far the market has ignored the protectionist threat and
has focused on good aspects of Trump economic policy," said
Frank Benzimra, head of Asian equity strategy at Societe
Generale in Hong Kong, who has moderated his bullish stance on
Taiwan this year due to concerns about U.S. policies and rising
valuations.

    TRUMP-XI MEETING
    As many Taiwan companies have production facilities in
China, investors will closely watch the first meeting between
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Thursday.
    Trump has said he expects the meeting to be difficult given
his belief China has taken advantage of U.S. trade policies.
    "Trump's protectionism could force Taiwan's supply chain to
move to the U.S or raise their capital expenditures, without
actually expanding their market very much," said Tom Wu, chief
investment officer of global investments for Yuanta Funds in
Taipei. "That would put pressure on their earnings."
    Taiwan had Asia's strongest foreign fund inflows in January
and February but was overtaken by India and South Korea in
March, according to Thomson Reuters data.
    The inflows helped lift the Taiwan dollar about 6.7 percent
this year, making it the region's best performer after the
Korean won.
    The currency's strength poses a potential problem for the
island's exporters, but Taiwan's central bank has been reluctant
to intervene, not least because of the threat of being labeled a
currency manipulator by the U.S. in a report on trading
partners' currency practices due this month. [nL4N1G84GA]
    Foreign interest in some technology stocks "has driven part
of that currency appreciation," said Oliver Lee, investment
director in Hong Kong at Old Mutual Global Investors, who is
underweight tech stocks including TSMC. "But then, there is that
underlying threat of Trump labeling them a currency
manipulator."
    Despite the risks, some fund managers remain optimistic,
continuing to accumulate shares of TSMC and other Apple
suppliers.
     "The story of the year is the iPhone 8 supply chain," said
Jeff Chang, chairman of Cathay Securities Investment Trust,
Taiwan's largest fund house. "Our funds will continue to add
these shares."

Version 2.0, the first major update for the app, has already rolled out for those who are on the “other side”. Users will now be able to experience a more streamlined user interface which kind of looks like the original Apple app (well, at least the one from last fall). Still, this is a huge improvement for those Android users who prefer to use this particular music streaming service for some reason. The update brings a clearer and more streamlined look for the app so it’s easier for users to go to whatever section they need to use. The app now has four main sections – Library, For You, Browse, and Radio. With Library, you will be able to see which of your Downloaded Music you can play even when offline. If you’re looking for music that you will probably like but you’re too busy to search for it, you will get recommendations based on the music you love and listen to in the For You section. But if you feel like browsing through their catalog, then of course you go to the Browse part and look for new releases or playlists that will match your mood. Radio will of course give you access to Beats 1 shows or just go to a genre station that you like and listen to their curated songs. When you feel like singing while listening to a song, the update also pulls up the lyrics as the song plays. While it’s not yet the same as its iOS counterpart (and it will probably never be), the major update has improved the app a lot. Update your Apple Music for Android (well, if you have it) and see for yourself.

The ACCC say that Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, “unauthorised repairers”. However, the ACCC insists, “having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees.” “Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer’s warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party,“ ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said. “Denying a consumer their consumer guarantee rights simply because they had chosen a third party repairer not only impacts those consumers but can dissuade other customers from making informed choices about their repair options including where they may be offered at lower cost than the manufacturer.” “As consumer goods become increasingly complex, businesses also need to remember that consumer rights extend to any software or software updates loaded onto those goods. Faults with software or software updates may entitle consumers to a free remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.” The ACCC is seeking pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs. Apple has yet to issue a comment.

Technology & Business Gizmodo Kotaku Lifehacker Business Insider Lifestyle & Shopping POPSUGAR ShopStyle Who What Wear Byrdie MyDomaine Kin Community | The ACCC Is Taking Apple To Federal Court Over 'Error 53' Campbell Simpson Apr 6, 2017, 10:35am ⋅ Filed to:  accc apple Australian Stories Share Image: Apple Australia's consumer and competition watchdog is taking Apple to court again. This time, it's over the Error 53 message that bricked iPhones with third-party screen repairs. The ACCC says its investigation shows Apple appears to have refused to look at defective devices repaired by a third party. The ACCC says that under Australian Consumer Law, customers are entitled to warranty support free of charge if their goods don't comply with consumer guarantees — even if repairs have been made to a different and unaffected or unconnected component of the device by a third party. "The ACCC alleges Apple represented to consumers with faulty products that they were not entitled to a free remedy if their Apple device had previously been repaired by third party, 'unauthorised repairers'. However, having a component of the Apple device serviced, repaired, or replaced by someone other than Apple cannot, by itself, extinguish the consumer’s right to a remedy for non-compliance with the consumer guarantees." In its media statement, the ACCC says it's seeking a host of reliefs against Apple — "pecuniary penalties, injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs" — for this alleged overreach. The last time Apple and the ACCC were this clearly at loggerheads was in December 2013, again over consumer guarantees. Error 53: The Timeline Apple's iPhone 'Error 53' Is A Security Feature, Not A Bug Earlier today the Guardian reported on mounting "fury" over a mysterious "Error 53" appearing on iPhones repaired by unauthorised repair providers. The report includes a quote from an unnamed "specialist" journalist (whatever the hell that is) who claimed that Error 53 will "will kill your iPhone". Read more Apple's Error 53: Dodgy Repairs Will Brick Your iPhone Following reports of bricked iPhones, Apple has confirmed that "error 53" is real — but it's not what is causing the bricking. Read more Apple Is Already Being Sued Over The 'Error 53' Issue Find any problem with an Apple device, and sure as carrion crows will rip the still-beating heart from a carcass, class action lawyers will assemble. So it goes with Error 53, the latest (non) issue to befall Cupertino. Read more ACCC Investigates Apple's Error 53 For Potential Consumer Law Breach The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) has launched an investigation into whether Apple's Error 53 is in breach of consumer laws. When the error code hit, effectively bricking iPhones, users initially thought it must be a bug. It was quickly revealed that the error is actually a security measure for the Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology. The error is activated when the phone is worked on by a third-party repairer using non-standard techniques or components. Read more Apple Suddenly Decides That Error 53 Is No Longer A 'Security Feature' After weeks of insisting Error 53 brickings were the result of bad repair jobs, Apple is now saying that it was a big goof and that the brickings were never supposed to happen. Come on Apple. Read more Apple Has Apologised, Released A Fix For 'Error 53' Apple has apologised to iPhone owners whose devices were disabled after succumbing to the Error 53 malfunction. The company has also issued a software update that will reverse what until now has been described as an irreversible condition, one which blocked users from retrieving any data from their phones. Apple will reimburse anybody who was asked to pay for a whole new phone. Read more WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments × Comment Voting Up Votes Down Votes × Only logged in users may vote for comments!

The new MacBook Pro is a little inconvenient in that it replaced most ports with USB-C, relegating owners to a life of adapters if they want to make their existing peripherals compatible with the new laptop. And although they probably don't want to hear about another adapter they may have to soon buy, this one is an exception. Why? Because it makes their old MagSafe breakaway charging cables useful again. A patent published a few days ago has revealed Apple mulled the idea of a MagSafe to USB-C adapter. The patent was actually filed last year, the same day Griffin began selling a similar, MagSafe-like breakaway USB-C adapter for $40. Of course, because this is a patent, it means Apple may never actually release the adapter, but there has been a lot of criticism over its USB-C-only laptops, so you never know. MacBook Pro (2016): A touch of brilliance or totally brainless? Apple Stores in the near future could soon stock Apple's latest invention. Yes, it's another adapter, but it appears to be a tiny, little thing that will be easy to carry around. Plus, it'll let you make use of your old MagSafe cables, while still providing a breakaway solution. Keep in mind USB-C cables for the new MacBook Pro don't breakaway, meaning your laptop will fall to the ground should you trip over the cable, but with this adapter, you can use old charging cables, plus trip over them, and spare your laptop from floor crashes.

In fact earlier this year a report from Apple insider Mark Gurman at Bloomberg hinted that ARM-based MacBook Pros could be launched this year, although it seems that this chipset won’t be replacing Intel’s chipset, but rather exist alongside it. Whether or not that is true remains to be seen, but according to reports, Apple has no plans for pure ARM-based MacBooks. However the report goes to add that Apple did not rule out the possibility that ARM processors could be used as companion processors, which is more or less in line with what the report from Bloomberg had suggested, although Apple stopped short of confirming whether or not that is true. Apple also reiterated that there are no plans for touchscreen Mac computers. Following the launch of hybrid devices like the Surface Pro, many had wondered if Apple could follow suit. However the company has previously explained why this would never happen, with some Apple execs even calling the idea “absurd”, so definitely do not get your hopes up for a touchscreen Mac anytime soon. In the meantime Apple has also announced their plans to “rethink” the Mac Pro, but that we probably shouldn’t expect to see anything anytime soon. Filed in Apple >Computers.

But first, Destiny 2 gets dated. Final Destiny update paves way for Destiny 2, coming this fall Age of Triumph, the final update for Destiny (PS4, Windows, Xbox One), released last week. Along with new challenges, Triumph heralds the return of some of the raids from the game's early days. First released in 2014, Destiny still manages to get me playing on a regular basis. But I am looking forward to Destiny 2, which Bungie has confirmed is coming on September 8, 2017. Here's the reveal trailer for the new game. Video of Destiny 2 – “Rally the Troops” Worldwide Reveal Trailer   Apple's Canadian App Store creates a place for iOS indie games Games are the most popular category on Apple's App Store, where you can get software to run on your iOS devices including iPhone, iPad, and iPod. Recognizing this, the company has created a dedicated page promoting games from independent developers, including many from Canada. With more than a billion mobile devices running the iOS operating system, the App Store is an appealing place for indie developers to distribute their games. Featured on the page are standout titles that include Leo's Fortune, Monument Valley, Ridiculous Fishing, Desert Golfing, and Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP. More ways to play and enjoy Minecraft Last week. a new minigame was released in Minecraft: Console Edition. Glide is a free update that lets players equip elytra (wings) that can soar through the air. Game modes include Score Attack and Time Attack, and you can play solo or multiplayer. This is the third free minigame for the console version of Minecraft. Battle and Tumble were released last year. In addition to Glide, a Power Rangers character skin pack was released for all versions of Minecraft last week. The Mini Game Masters skin pack arrived on the console edition of the game. Old Time Hockey a fun retro sports sim From Vancouver studio V7 Entertainment, Old Time Hockey is a riotous sim in the spirit of early hockey video games. The simple controls for passing and shooting echo those from old-time games, and the pixelated art style and jagged animations are suitably dated. It's all in service of a nostalgia for the 1970s that is baked into the very core of Old Time Hockey, right down to the Slapstick-inspired narrative that anchors the game's story mode. Old Time Hockey is available for PS4, Windows, and Xbox One.

Well... The trash can. Apple has promised a new "modular" Mac Pro for sometime after 2017. In the light of this news, I thought it would be interesting to look back a model, to the "cheese grater" Mac Pros Apple sold from 2006 until 2013. The cheesegrater is a truly iconic Mac. I love it. On a related note, here's some interesting tidbits and nuggets I've picked up regarding the new Mac Pro from people and sources who know their stuff. The Mac Pro was in limbo inside Apple. The decision to go ahead and develop a modular Mac Pro replacement seems to have been made only in recent months, with development starting only a few weeks ago, which makes it clear why Apple said it won't ship this year. I have no idea how long it takes to develop a new computer like a Mac Pro, but I think we can expect the new Mac Pro late 2018 at the earliest, but most likely it won't be until early 2019 before it ships. What made Apple do a 180? Well, after the announcement of the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, orders for refurbished "old" MacBook Pros supposedly went through the roof, and after the initial batch of reviews came out, they shot up even higher. This response to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar took Apple completely by surprise. Combined with the problems surrounding the LG UltraFine 5K display and the constant negativity from professional Apple users, the company decided to double down on professional users. As Apple announced, we'll be getting a new Mac Pro and an iMac Pro as a result. In addition, Apple is said to be exploring additional Retina MacBook Pro models without the Touch Bar, and other pro-oriented features, such as hooking an iPad Pro up to a Mac to use it as a Cintiq-like device. All in all, there is definitely excitement in the air regarding professional Mac use, and to be honest - that's been a while. Personally, I'm still very cautious, because in the end, all we got yesterday was a more official version of Tim Cook's endless "we've got great stuff in the pipeline, trust us!" meme that's been going on for a few years now. Until we get it - and that may still be 2 years away - the new Mac Pro is vapourware.

Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Customers around the world can also easily donate directly to (RED) through iTunes. In the US, iTunes Movies is offering a free download of The Lazarus Effect, the documentary about the mission of (RED). The Killers’ holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, is exclusively available on iTunes featuring all 10 of their holiday singles, as well as a new track “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” with 100 percent of the proceeds in the US going to the Global Fund. Over the past 10 years, 70 million lives have been impacted by (RED)-supported Global Fund grants. At the start of Apple’s partnership with (RED), 1,200 babies were born with HIV every day, and today, UNAIDS predicts that number could be near zero by the year 2020, with the end of AIDS by 2030. With the life-saving medication costing as little as 30 cents a day, every person can make a difference. Through these efforts we’ll get that much closer to helping (RED) create an AIDS-free generation.

Their renewable energy projects will produce over 12 MW of solar power — more than the energy they need for Apple manufacturing — and support Japan’s nationwide efforts to limit its carbon emissions. “These innovative new clean energy investments demonstrate our commitment to doing business responsibly and economically,” said Kyoichi Yamanaka, Managing Director of Ibiden’s Environment Group. “Our products help Apple devices run smarter, and now we’re powering our operations with smarter energy too. We’re pleased to partner with Apple and lead the way in helping Japan meet its clean energy goals.” Apple and its suppliers will be generating over 2.5 billion kilowatt hours per year of clean energy for the manufacturing of Apple products by the end of 2018 — equal to taking over 400,000 cars off the road for a year. Apple has taken significant steps to protect the environment by transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy. Today, the company is powering 100 percent of its operations in 23 countries, and more than 93 percent of its worldwide operations, with renewable energy.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 5, 2017 at 7:30PM DigiTimes, citing a report from Economic Daily News, says evidence is mounting that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming premium OLED iPhone 8 might not launch in September. Instead, thanks to "technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels," as well as "the adoption of a 3D sensing system," could cause the new phones to arrive in either October or November. DigiTimes further goes on to note, once again citing the Economic Daily News report, that "market sources" are keeping an eye out for "the pull-in for passive components from the iPhone's supply chain to see whether production of the new devices is on track." Image source: Apple. What if the new iPhone is delayed? Given that the upcoming OLED iPhone is seemingly shaping up to be a technical tour de force, it's probably not too far-fetched to believe that the new device could be delayed. After all, the new technology Apple is bringing to this device is clearly difficult to build, and considering the demand that Apple is reportedly expecting for this new model, Apple probably isn't going to want to launch this new device until it can prepare a lot of them for initial shipment. The bad news -- if the launch of the new device is delayed -- is that Apple clearly won't begin recognizing revenue for its newest phones as early as it has in previous years. That could make year-over-year comparisons a bit messy. Remember, Apple tends to ship some next-generation iPhone models at the end of the fourth quarter of a given fiscal year, with most of the initial sales rush happening in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. If the launch of the iPhone 8 is pushed out into, say, October, then the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year might come in a little lighter than many expect, but then the first quarter of the following fiscal year could be more robust than what one would typically expect. Things could get quite messy, though, if Apple doesn't launch the new OLED iPhone until sometime in November. Not only would initial revenue that would have been recognized at the tail end of the current fiscal year be pushed out, but a substantial amount of revenue that would have been recognized in the first quarter of the following fiscal year, typically Apple's peak quarter, would be pushed out, too. That could really mess with Apple's seasonal revenue trends. Moreover, if Apple is late to getting its new OLED iPhone out, then that could lead potential buyers of the new phone to opt for alternative devices with, perhaps, similar feature sets. What Apple needs to do If Apple won't be able to ship the new OLED iPhone in serious quantities until October or November, it should still announce it and take pre-orders for it when the other iPhone models -- presumably called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- go up for sale. Taking pre-orders probably wouldn't change the dynamics of any revenue push out, but it could serve to stem any potential order losses to competing devices resulting from the push-out, and it would help prevent potential customers from just buying one of the cheaper iPhone models, negatively affecting Apple's product mix. Delays aren't ideal, but in this case they wouldn't be the end of the world. Building state-of-the-art devices in mass quantities isn't easy, but as long as the company has a killer product on its hands and as long as it lets customers pre-order it ahead of mass availability, everything should work out all right.   Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Sponsor Book → RSS → The Cheese Grater Mac Pro  April 5, 2017April 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink As we learned this week, the 2013 trash can Mac Pro is going to … well … the trash can. Apple has promised a new “modular” Mac Pro for sometime after 2017. In the light of this news, I thought it would be interesting to look back a model, to the “cheese grater” Mac Pros Apple sold from 2006 until 2013. It was a flexible, expandable, powerful desktop computer.  Imagine that.  (Full resolution version can be downloaded here.) Early Days The Mac Pro was introduced at the tail-end of the Mac’s transition to Intel chips back in 2006. It was designed to replace the Power Mac G5, which had been serving pros for several years. The Mac Pro used the same external case,1 complete with the cheese grater look on the front and back, but the inside was all new, as Phil Schiller spoke about at WWDC 2006: The new desktop used Intel’s “Woodcrest” Xeon chips, in speeds up to 3.0 GHz, a number that eluded Apple and IBM in the PowerPC days. Schiller praised the Xeons for being far more efficient than the G5. The Mac Pro offered twice the performance of the Power Mac G5 while running much cooler, and without the need of the kilowatt power supply in the quad-core G5. This efficiency allowed Apple to drastically redesign the interior of the Mac Pro: The G5 required a system of nine computer-controlled fans, and later models came complete with liquid cooling modules. The Xeons ran cooler, so Apple had more room for goodies. The Mac Pro came with 4 hard drive carriers. A user just had to screw a hard drive to the carrier and slide it into place for the system to see it. For those who wanted it, a second optical drive could be installed as well. Like the G5, it came with 8 RAM slots and was upgraded to a total of four PCI Express slots as well. When the Mac Pro first went on sale, Apple offered a single SKU for $2,499: 2 x 2.66 GHz Dual-core Xeon 1 GB RAM 250 GB Hard Drive NVIDIA GeFrorce 7300GT GPU 16X SuperDrive The Mac Pro could be configured in countless ways on Apple’s online store, of course, with faster (or slower) Xeons, more RAM and storage, a better card, AirPort and Bluetooth cards and a second SuperDrive. The 8-Core Mac Pro All of the original Mac Pros were quad-core machines, but in April 2007, Apple launched a new high-end model at $3,997. This Mac Pro used Intel’s “Clovertown” Xeons and ran at 3.0 Ghz. The Good Years The Mac Pro saw updates in January 2008, then again in March 2009 and July 2010. With each revision, the tower became more powerful, moving from “Harpertown” chips in 2008 to “Bloomfield” and “Gainestown” in 2009. By the time 2010 rolled around, Apple was offering three SKUs in its Good/Better/Best arrangement. These machines used “Bloomfield,” “Gulftown” and “Westmere” Xeons, respectively. The Early 2008 Mac Pro was the first to officially support 32 GB RAM, even though users were having luck with that much memory with older machines. The Early 2009 Mac Pro brought with it Intel’s Nehalem architecture. While the clock speeds don’t show it, these towers were noticeably faster, especially for multi-threaded applications. They also supported higher RAM ceilings than earlier models, as the quad-core machines could address a whopping 128 GB of memory. The Mid 2010 model is the oldest Mac Pro supported by macOS Sierra. Apple introduced a $4,999 12-core model for the first time in this generation, as well as a build-to-order option for a SSD. Mac Pro Server The Mid 2010 Mac Pro had a sibling: the Mac Pro Server. Announced in November 2010 as a semi-replacement for the outgoing Xserve, this tower came with a license for Mac OS X Server, a 2.8GHz quad-core processor, 8GB of RAM and two 1 TB hard drives. Apple would also ship a version of the Mid 2012 Mac Pro with the Server designation. The Decline 2011 marked the first time that Apple “missed” its schedule for Mac Pro updates, and users noticed. Here’s Marco Arment in 2011, responding to a report that Apple was questioning the need for a Mac Pro: The Mac Pro was a tough sell to anyone but the most demanding users even in 2008. Today, even fewer buyers can justify it and it’s a worse deal relative to the rest of the Mac line. The Xeon E5 isn’t going to help either problem. I bet we’ll see a minor Mac Pro update to use the E5 CPUs whenever they’re available (probably within the next few months). But it wouldn’t surprise me if that’s the last Mac Pro. It had a great run, but the tower is over. Around this time, the iMac was making great strides, as I wrote in May of the same year: The Mac Pro used to be the obvious choice for anyone who needed power or expandability. It really was a no brainer. If you need brawn, Apple’s only tower was the only choice. Clearly, the first factor has become less of a differentiator as iMacs have become increasingly powerful. There are very few things that an iMac can’t do smoothly at this point. While some still need all 12 cores that the muscular Mac Pro offers, the Sandy Bridge chipset in Apple’s all-in-one is enough horsepower for just about everyone. People that just barely needed a Mac Pro for the power would be fine getting an iMac now. The new desktop can even support two displays out, something that only the Mac Pro could boast until this week. 2011 came to an end with no new Mac Pro, and by the spring of 2012, people were freaking out. This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper… In June 2012, Apple updated the cheese grater Mac Pro one last time. Updated may be too strong of a word, as James Galbraith wrote for Macworld: The new Mac Pros released at WWDC 2012 represent a speed bump, plain and simple. The new Mac Pros use the same, highly-upgradable case design, the same graphics cards, and even the same version of USB as the last iteration. And while the Macworld Lab’s test results show the new Mac Pros to be considerably faster than those systems the new Mac Pros replace, it is hard to swallow new “pro” systems that lack Apple’s fastest connection, Thunderbolt, released on MacBook Pros 16 months ago, and USB 3.0 support that arrived on the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. The machine was met with such dismay that Tim Cook wrote this in a customer email the same day they were released: Although we didn’t have a chance to talk about a new Mac Pro at today’s event, don’t worry as we’re working on something really great for later next year. We also updated the current model today. That “really great” machine is the one the company just apologized for and then said it was replacing. Time really is a flat circle. I sometimes wonder what a Mac Pro would have looked like if the G5 didn’t need so much air flowing through it. I guess we’ll find out. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post RSS Sponsorship: With CardioBot, you can easily understand the data captured by the Apple Watch so you can improve your lifestyle and discover notable patterns.   512 Pixels is a blog written by Stephen Hackett about things that light up and make noise.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone.

Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music.

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career).

The WebGPU standard Apple proposed is much more object-oriented than WebGPU and allows developers to create and store objects that represent state. Additionally, it allows for objects that can process a broader set of commands. This reduces the work needed to perform during a drawing operation. Now, Apple has shared a WebGPU prototype and demos to show developers what the new standard is capable of… Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case Apple announced the prototype and demos on its WebKit blog, explaining that the new feature comes as part of the Safari Technology Preview version. Apple notes several times throughout the announcement, however, that this is a demo and nothing more. In fact, in many cases, Apple says the demo code is behind the proposal: We also have written some simple demos to give you an idea of how the API works. Note that our implementation and documented proposal are not quite aligned, so the code in these demos will change over time. We’ve tried to indicate the places in the code where the prototype is behind the proposal. And, to reiterate, this is a proposal – the final API will almost certainly be quite different. If you want to try out the new WebGPU demos, you can do so by heading to Apple’s WebKit blog. Here, you’ll see four examples. One depicting a “Hello World Triangle,” another showing a “2d-drawing like Shadertoy,” a third showing a “Simple Spinning Cube,” and finally a fourth showing “Animating Cubes.” In order to try the demos, you must be using Apple’s Safari Technology Preview and enable WebGPU in the Developer Menu: Make sure you are on a system with WebGPU enabled. In Safari, first make sure the Developer Menu is visible (Preferences → Advanced), then Develop → Experimental Features → Enable WebGPU. More information and gritty details on Apple’s WebGPU proposal can be found on the company’s WebKit blog. If you’re a web developer, what do you think of Apple’s the first demonstrations of Apple’s proposed WebGPU standard? Let us know in the comments.

Earnings: Can the Tech Giant Live Up to a Higher Stock Price? With Apple's stock soaring lately, the pressure will be on when the company reports second-quarter results. Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Apr 5, 2017 at 5:40PM Mark your calendar. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has just set the date for its second-quarter results. On May 2, investors will get a timely glimpse into the company's recent performance. With Apple stock hitting new highs ahead of the earnings release, can the tech company live up to higher expectations from investors? Here are some key areas to watch when Apple reports its Q2 earnings early next month. Jet black iPhone 7 Plus. Image source: Apple. Will iPhone sales continue upward? After three quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, the segment's revenue finally turned upward in the company's most recent quarter. iPhone unit sales and iPhone revenue were up 5% year over year in Apple's first quarter of fiscal 2017. Going into Apple's second quarter, investors will be looking for a similar trend in iPhone sales. Based on Apple's guidance for second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, management is likely expecting year-over-year growth in iPhone sales to persist during the quarter. This guidance implies overall revenue of about 3.4%, using the midpoint of Apple's guidance range, compared to Apple's $50.6 billion in revenue in the year-ago quarter. Considering that the iPhone accounted for 64% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, Apple's iPhone sales are a major determinant of the direction of the company's overall revenue, and thus a key determinant in management's guidance. It's time for a dividend increase Apple is expected to give investors an update on its capital return program alongside its second-quarter earnings release, as management has done in previous years. With the program consisting of both Apple's dividend and its share repurchase authorization, investors should look for management to update investors on both. As for Apple's dividend, investors should look for a dividend increase in the range of 8% to 15% -- in line with the company's dividend increases in the past four years. Perhaps even more important than Apple's dividend increase will be management's plans for share repurchases. Historically, Apple has opted to give more weight to share repurchases than dividends. Indeed, since the company initiated its dividend in 2012, Apple has spent $144 billion buying back its own shares and $51 billion paying dividends. However, with Apple stock rising about 25% in the past 12 months, it's possible that management will choose to give more emphasis to dividends than it has in the past. Looking ahead Another key area investors won't want to miss is Apple's guidance for its third quarter of fiscal 2017. With Apple only recently returning to revenue growth, the company's ability to grow its business is still in the spotlight. AAPL Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Apple's third quarter will be particularly interesting because, while Apple's iPhone 7 is still fairly new, the smartphone's overall form factor is several years old, dating back to the company's iPhone 6 launch in 2014. Will an aging iPhone design continue to drive growth for Apple? Further, investors will be looking to see if Apple's rapidly growing services segment can grow to represent an even larger portion of sales and, in turn, help Apple's overall revenue. Based on how successful the iPhone 7 has been so far, and on the company's success with growing its services revenue, investors should expect Apple to guide for yet another quarter of year-over-year growth. Apple reports its second-quarter results after market close on May 2 and will host a live quarterly conference call to discuss results with analysts at 5:00 p.m. PST.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Trump Administration is set to meet Top Foreign Business Leaders including Samsung about Investments and More | Main | Uniloc Sues Apple on Three Counts of Patent Infringement Covering iOS 7's Frequent Locations Feature & more » April 05, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals an Echo-Like Device while explaining how Siri will coordinate iDevices to perform a Specific Task   Last week the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple relating to a new Siri function whereby it could intelligently coordinate and pass on a user's request to the appropriate iDevice in the home or office to perform. Today such a request would result in either duplicative or conflicting operations by each of a user's iDevices within the same environment. Apple has created a device prioritization system so that iDevices receiving an instruction for Siri would work in concert with each other to perform a specific task instead of annoyingly duplicating the same action on multiple iDevices.   One of the small bonuses of this patent filing is that an Apple engineer added a Google Home or Amazon Echo-like device that works with Siri in the home as highlighted in the partial patent figure in our cover graphic and again below.   While Apple acknowledges the mysterious device #608 along with others like an iPhone, TV and Apple Watch, they never break out device #608 to describe it in any way. The closest they get is briefly mentioning a "Speaker Dock" later in the filing – though they never specifically link it back to device #608 to confirm it.   Yet clearly we're able to see that it's a speaker-like device that could understand instructions for Siri, so it's not a boom box. It's been rumored for some time now that Apple is working on a device similar to that of Google-Home or Amazon's Echo. Apple's patent figure that surfaced last week confirms, as far as the patent is concerned, a viable concept that's on the table.   Siri to Coordinate Multiple iDevices to perform a Task   In respect to intelligent identification of devices in a multi-device system, Apple provides us with a full example of how it's intended to work.   In some examples, natural language inputs are resolved into one or more tasks by a single device of the electronic devices #602 to #608 identified below as an Apple Watch, an iPhone, a TV (or TV with Apple TV box) and a speaker device like Google Home.   Apple notes that once the spoken audio input has been sampled, one of the electronic devices may be identified as a first device used to determine the task based on the sampled audio input.   The first device used to determine the task may, for instance, be identified based a set of prioritization rules.   By way of example, the first device may be the device whose sampled audio input has the greatest quality of speech, sound pressure level, and/or volume.   In the example shown above, the user is sending a request directly to Siri on his Apple Watch. So in this scenario, the Apple Watch is shown to be the official "first device" within this new prioritized system, as it is closest to the user's audio instruction and thereby the device that is delivering the greatest quality of speech and so forth as set out above.   Basic Task Overview   Apple notes that tasks may be determined locally or remotely. A device, such as Apple Watch may locally determine the task using the sampled audio input or may transmit data representing the sampled audio input to one or more servers. The task may be determined by the one or more servers based on the transmitted data and provided to the device. Optionally, one or more devices may provide an output after the task has been determined.   Once the task has been determined, one of the electronic devices (#602-#608) may be identified as a second device used to perform the task. In some examples, the second device may be identified based on task requirements.   A task may require it be performed by a device having a particular capability (e.g., functionality). In Apple's scenario above, the task may be directed to provide the user with an 'R-Rated Movie' that requires a device with the best display capability.   Accordingly, Apple Watch may determine which of the user's devices (iDevices, Macs or TV) within a multi-device environment at home would satisfy the display capability requirement.   Because multiple devices may satisfy a task requirement, the second device may additionally or alternatively be identified in accordance with a plurality of prioritization rules.   In some examples, the second device may be a device "best suited" to perform the task. For tasks directed to video playback, for instance, the second device may be an electronic device having the largest display. That could translate to a future Mac Pro mega 8K display or a television.   Uniquely Apple never mentions a set-top-box or the like as they've done in past patent filings in describing Apple TV. In this patent they only list a television. No use getting stuck on that point, but it's noteworthy to remember should they deliver a smart TV sometime down the road.   Apple further notes that for tasks directed to mapping functions, the second device may be a mobile device. In some examples, the second device may be identified based on prior use. For example, the device typically used to perform a task may be identified to perform subsequent iterations of the task or similar tasks. In some embodiments, the second device may be identified based on signal strength between the first device and each of the other devices.   In some examples, the second device may delay performance of the task. A task may, for instance, include one or more criteria that must be satisfied prior to the task being performed.   A task may require a user cease driving (e.g., as determined by GPS) prior to the task being performed (also covered in this patent), and/or may require a particular form of connectivity (e.g., Bluetooth) prior to the task being performed, for example.   Authentication   As another example, a task may require that a user be authenticated prior to the task being performed. With reference to Apple's patent FIG. 7A noted above, a user may provide an audio input #702 requesting playback of an R-rated movie and the request may be resolved into a task, for instance, by the Apple #602, for playback of an R-rated movie on the user's TV #606.   Because of the nature of the movie's rating, the task may first require that the user be authenticated. Authentication may be implemented using biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint authentication) and/or credential authentication (e.g., username and password) – audio biometrics revealed in yesterday's report titled "Apple Patent Reveals a New Security Feature Coming to Siri."   With reference to Apple's patent FIG. 7B noted above, we're able to see that the user's iPhone #604 may provide input requests #712 such as "Please enter your Tough ID" message on the display.   As illustrated in FIG. 7C, the user may provide a biometric input and the user's iPhone may authenticate the user. In some examples, the iPhone may provide outputs #722 (Ok, playing R-Rated Movie on the TV – in written form) or #724 (in a verbal response) respectively acknowledging completion of authentication and that the R-rated movie is being played on the user's TV.   Miscellaneous Patent Points of Interest   "In some examples, the audio input can represent and/or contain a user request. For example, the audio input may include the request "Play the latest episode of Game of Thrones," thereby requesting playback of the most recent episode of the television show Game of Thrones." It's unclear if this translates to choosing TV episodes only available for a fee on iTunes or episodes available on cable TV.   Lastly, Apple notes that "It should also be recognized that in some examples, text input can be received at instead of audio input. For example, text input representing a user request can be received from the user via a suitable user interface on one or more of the plurality of electronic devices. Examples of suitable user interfaces for receiving text input can include a virtual keyboard, a handwriting recognition interface, a gesture recognition interface, and the like."   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Apple has been busy advancing Siri of late with a patent about audio biometrics and a visual system for Siri. Additional Siri specific advancements could be revealed later this week.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office. Readers are cautioned that the full text of any patent application should be read in its entirety for full and accurate details.

The new application describes an automated bumper system for an iPhone case that acts a a cushion when it is dropped and also doubles as a flotation device. The technology is built around sensors, such as the accelerometer, which are able to detect when a device is in 'free fall'. Apple has been awarded a patent that could save your iPhone when it slips out of your hands. The new application describes an automated bumper system for an iPhone case which doubles as a flotation device  FLOATIES FOR YOUR IPHONE  A new Apple design aims to prevent Phones from sinking to the bottom of bodies of water. The design incorporates an automated bumper system, which acts as 'water wings' on the four corners. The bumper system can detect falls as they're happening by sensing motion patterns, and deploys shock absorbers to protect the phone. Buoyant materials in the bumper cushions will be used to keep the iPhone afloat.  The flotation will work even if the shock absorbers aren't deployed.  The patent was filed in May 2014 and was awarded on April 4, 2017, reported Silicon Beat. Apple labeled the application, ‘Electronic Device Housing’, as the casing device absorbs shock from falls while also protecting the phone from water.  Onboard sensors track the movement of the phone, noting changes in velocity and acceleration, along with other movements that indicate a drop. If the system, which is placed at the four corners of the iPhone, recognizes the motion as a fall, spring loaded shock absorbers shoot out from the housing, acting as 'water wings.' Specialized support rods deploy buoyant bumper cushions, made of foam, plastic, rubber, or other materials.  The cushions can be replaced if damaged or deteriorated, and will function as a float even if the shock absorber system has not been deployed.

Share this article Share 29 shares With the right combination of the bumper support structure with buoyancy and orientation, the system could even make an iPhone float above the surface of water. The iPhone flotation device could also prevent water accidents related to dropped iPhones. Replacing the phone entirely can be more expensive than fishing it out and repairing it. If the system, which is placed at the four corners of the iPhone, recognizes the motion as a fall, spring loaded shock absorbers shoot out from the housing, acting as 'water wings' Although Apple did not outright note the toilet as a place people drop their smartphones, a recent survey revealed that 39 percent of users take their handset with them to the bathroom, and according to Google, 19 percent top the phone in the toilet.  Though a system like this would have practical use, it may be too costly to implement into the current design anytime soon. The iPhone floatie isn't the only design to attempt to work around Apple devices' aversion to water.   Specialized support rods deploy buoyant bumper cushions, made of foam, plastic, rubber, or other materials.

Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart.

If you wanted to spend up to 400 Euros for an Apple iPad so far, it had to be one of the Mini models. However, the current generation iPad Mini 4 costs at least 480 Euros – because you can only get the 128 GB model right now. Apple now launches a new tablet for price-conscious users. The name: iPad. The price: starting at 400 Euros . This will get you a 9.7-inch tablet with Wi-Fi, 32 GB storage and somewhat dated components. The A9 SoC, which debuted in the iPhone 6S, is already 1.5 years old. Apple also uses the same camera modules for quite a while now. Potential buyers also have to make two more compromises: Apple does not equip its latest tablet with a fully laminated panel, so you can expect reflections. The 2017 iPad is not compatible with the Apple Pencil, either.

ATO boss Mark Konza did not confirm the companies involved in the reported 'debt dumping'.  Seven major technology companies including Google, Apple and Microsoft have been slammed with a $3 billion tax bill Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer (pictured) said the government would fight the companies in Federal Court after some reportedly said they would not pay up An insider told the Daily Telegraph the companies sent the tax bills include Google, Microsoft, Apple, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.   Mr Konza said more than 1,000 investigators looked into 71 multinationals that are coming into Australia and said he was determined to fight the tax avoidance. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The billionaire who bought the 'world's most expensive... The ONE thing the world's most successful people credit with... Share this article Share He said one multinational has already flown representatives to Australia to discuss the tax bill. 'Mums and dads pay tax, they can't avoid it and do it because they know their tax goes towards paying for hospitals, school, roads, defence,' Ms O'Dwyer said. 'The Australian government will make sure that everyone pays the tax they owe, whether they're big multinationals or other individuals'.  On Wednesday, Rio Tinto confirmed it had been ordered to pay $447 million in tax after the Australian Commissioner of Taxation issued amended assessments from 2010 to 2013. 'This payment would be in addition to the $25.5 billion of taxes and royalties Rio Tinto paid in Australia during the same four-year period,' a statement from the miner read. The companies believed to be dodging tax in Australia are Google, Microsoft, Apple, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Both Apple and Microsoft said they comply with the tax law in Australia But the multinational said it would fight the ATO's assessment. 'The issue in dispute is the pricing of certain transactions between Rio Tinto entities based in Australia and the Group’s commercial centre in Singapore,' the statement said. 'Rio Tinto considers that its pricing is in accordance with the internationally recognised OECD guidelines and Australian domestic law.  'Rio Tinto will challenge the amended tax assessments, but will pay 50 per cent of the total amount to the ATO this month.' BHP Billiton said it was still in discussions with the ATO but will 'defend its position in court if necessary' and Google did not comment, according to the Daily Telegraph. Both Apple and Microsoft said they comply with the tax law in Australia.  'The Australian government will make sure that everyone pays the tax they owe, whether they're big multinationals or other individuals,' Ms O'Dwyer (pictured) said Read more: www.dailytelegra...

The heat is subtle and a moderate but it is not overwhelming and delivers a chili pepper taste. This makes it appealing to a large group of people that enjoy Sriracha flavoring, but not the extreme heat. Sriracha is a type of chili sauce originating from Thailand and include ingredients such as vinegar, sugar, salt and garlic. Rockin’ Honey apple is a new flavor on the market that is unique to BeefJerky.Rocks! After months of perfecting the flavor and texture the company says that it is ready for public consumption. It pairs up the beef flavor with smoke, honey and all natural apple flavoring. The honey apple beef jerky is sweet and tender and delivers no heat at all. “We’re excited about the new flavors that we’ve added to our product list” say Jim Sokol, CEO and owner of Saginaw Snacks, LLC. “With so much competition in the beef jerky market, we believe that our unique flavor offerings such as Rockin’ Honey Apple and Sriracha set us apart for all the rest.” The new beef jerky products are available on their website BeefJerky.Rocks, and are also available in various stores around New England.

A new article in the Wall Street Journal highlights some of the challenges Apple has faced in gaining more ubiquitous mindshare for its two-year-old mobile payment service, such a consumer wariness over security concerns and reliability and adoption by U.S. retailers. The report notes that Apple has also not done much to market the payment platform, nor made much of an effort to train its own employees, although Apple SVP Eddy Cue said that Apple Pay has been adopted faster than other mobile payment systems, and still believes that it will eventually replace cash, debit, and credit cards, but suggests that Apple is playing the long game with the service, Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years [or] five years? Ultimately, no.” Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster revealed that even “to conservative expectations” the adoption of Apple Pay has been disappointing thus far, revealing that only 13 percent of the estimated 680 million iPhone users have used Apple Pay, and estimating that Apple Pay handled around $36 billion in transactions last year, well short of his original $207 billion prediction. Technology research firm Creative Strategies suggests that 40 percent of U.S. consumers remain concerned about security risks associated with adding a credit card or debit card to their iPhone, and 60 percent aren’t familiar with the concept of contactless payments — a system that, while long ubiquitous in other countries such as Canada, remains relatively uncommon among U.S. retailers; a report from payment-industry trade publication the Nilson Report notes that only a third of U.S. stores accept Apple Pay as a form of payment, although it notes that the rate of acceptance has more than doubled since 2015. Nilson Report publisher David Robertson believes that Apple Pay is on the cusp of broad acceptance, and a report by payment advisor First Annapolis Consulting reveals that U.S. consumers are still twice as likely to have used Apple Pay as any rival service. A former employee on the Apple Pay project suggested to the Wall Street Journal that Apple had overestimated the impact of Apple Pay when it first launched, expecting customers to embrace it with the same enthusiasm as the 2003 iTunes launch, however when retailers were slow to come on board, Apple executives were more reluctant to promote the service and invest in retail terminals. However, the Wall Street Journal notes that several big-name stores such as Wal-Mart still do not accept Apple Pay, and adds that even in stores where Apple Pay is accepted, cashiers remain unfamiliar with the service. Apple’s Jennifer Bailey, VP of Apple Pay, stated that the company does have a team that works with merchants to help educate cashiers and also add instructions to retailers’ training materials, and noted that more than half of the largest 100 merchants in the U.S. have adopted Apple Pay since its launch — a significant achievement considering that contactless payments were virtually nonexistent among U.S. retailers prior to the launch of Apple Pay.   Comments Scania becomes first company to add CarPlay to semi trucks » Related Stories Subscribe to iLounge Weekly Recent News Apple execs remain optimistic about Apple Pay, despite slow uptake Scania becomes first company to add CarPlay to semi trucks Apple patent hints at improvement to let Siri recognize specific voices Apple Music for Android update adds lyrics support, brings design into line with iOS 10 Music Reports: iPhone 8 won’t cost more than $1,000, but launch may be delayed to October or November High-level Apple designer Christopher Stringer leaves the company Apple adds 22 new U.S. banks, credit unions Apple refunding recent purchases of Workflow app Apple releases minor iOS 10.3.1 security update Apple bidding on Toshiba’s flash memory division, cuts ties with Imagination Technologies Recent Reviews Blue Ella Headphones Apple iPad (Fifth-Generation) AudioQuest NightOwl Carbon Headphones ExoLens PRO with Optics by ZEISS Wide-Angle Lens Kit Blue Sadie Headphones Circle with Disney Parental Control and Internet Filtering System Pioneer Rayz Plus Lightning Connector Earphones BEEM United BeMe D200 Lightning Connector Earphones Jam Audio JAM Xterior Max Rugged Wireless Bluetooth Speaker HiFiMAN Edition S Headphones Recent Articles Top Five: The Best Products for Building a Smart Home with HomeKit Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of watchOS 3 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of tvOS 10 Instant Expert: Secrets & Features of iOS 10 Inside the betas: iOS 10 Photos gets Advanced Computer Vision Inside the betas: iOS 10 Music app delivers ‘clarity and simplicity’ Inside the betas: iOS 10 Maps gets a major redesign Inside the betas: iOS 10 shakes up the user experience Inside the betas: watchOS 3 promises a real speed boost Inside the betas: A sneak peek at what’s new in tvOS 10 Win Subscribe Buy ADVERTISE | CONTACT US Search Sign up for the iLounge Weekly Newsletter iLounge is an independent resource for all things iPod, iPhone, iPad, and beyond. iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes, Apple TV, Mac, and the Apple logo are trademarks of Apple Inc. iLounge is © 2001 - 2017 iLounge, Inc.

Here are two things that are both. The first is my favorite  podcast of all time, a podcast focused on what’s going on under the hoods of your Apple devices. The second is a macOS Service that fixes funky text issues and much more. My Favorite Free and Useful Podcast of All Time! The podcast of which I speak (if you haven’t guessed), is our very own Mac Geek Gab with Dave Hamilton, John F. Braun, and (sometimes) Pilot Pete. I like it so much, in fact, I show my support by paying for a premium subscription every month for the past few years. My favorite free and useful podcast of all time is Mac Geek Gab with Dave Hamilton and John F. Braun. I never miss an episode—it’s like listening to NPR’s Car Talk with Click and Clack, but about Apple devices (mostly) instead of cars. I have a rather short attention span, and while many other podcasts have come and gone from my playlists over the past decade, this is one I look forward to each and every week. From productivity tips and hints for macOS and iOS to “cool stuff found,” Dave and John promise will all learn at least four new things every week and I always do. If you’re interested in what’s happening under the hood of your Apple device, you’re sure to enjoy Mac Geek Gab. By the way, the reason Mac Geek Gab is on my mind this week is that in Episode # 650 they discussed macOS Services and a free service I’d been using for so long I had forgotten it’s not part of the operating system. Free and Useful macOS Services, at your Service! Services are commands that appear in the Services menu of most apps and in most shortcut menus (Control or right-click), often allowing you to perform an action of the selected text or object. To enable or disable the services included with macOS, launch System Preferences; click the Keyboard icon; click the Shortcuts tab at the top; and then click Services in the list on the left. Scroll through the list on the right and enable checkboxes for services you want in your Services menu. The Services System Preferences pane has lots of free and useful goodies preinstalled. Tip: You can create a keyboard shortcut for a service by clicking it and then clicking the Add Shortcut button. Tip-o’-the-hat:  Want to know more about Services? Read Jeff Butts excellent tutorial on customizing your Services menu.  Now, in addition the dozens of useful services built into macOS, there is at least one third-party service I’d be lost without—WordService from DEVONtechnologies, which is free in the Mac App Store. As its name implies, it’s a service that works with words. So, for most of its commands you need to select some text before you choose a command in the Services menu, such as: smart quotes lowercase all caps initial caps (words) initial caps (sentences) remove multiple spaces remove hyperlinks Other WordService commands insert variables and don’t require a text selection, such as: insert time insert long date insert long date & time insert short date insert short date & time There’s no reason not to install WordService and have these (and other) useful commands for mangling words available in your Services menus at all times. …and that’s all he wrote.

One of the big complaints with Apple's new line of MacBook Pros has been the loss of the MagSafe connector. The breakaway connector has saved many laptops from destruction caused by tripping over one's power cord. A patent application published last week and filed a little over a year ago reveals that Apple has already designed a MagSafe to USB-C adapter that could be used for its notebooks. Connector adapters that may have a MagSafe connector receptacle and a Universal Serial Bus Type-C connector insert. This may allow MagSafe chargers to be used to charge devices having Universal Serial Bus Type-C connector receptacles. This also may provide the breakaway characteristic of a MagSafe connector system for a device that does not include a MagSafe connector receptacle. Other adapters may have other types of magnetic connector receptacles and connector inserts. Despite the patent, it's unclear if Apple has any plans to release such an adapter. It would have made the most sense to make it available alongside the new MacBook Pro. You can find the full patent details at the link below... Read More Follow iClarified Comments (7) Add Comment D4xM4Nx - 15 minutes ago Only because I'm extremely careful with my MacBook Pro, I haven't had issues with accidental drops due to applying tension on the power cord...

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Mobile Technology Samsung Galaxy S8+ vs. iPhone 7 Plus Will Shanklin April 5, 2017 New Atlas compares the features and specs of the Samsung Galaxy S8+ (left) and Apple iPhone 7 Plus View gallery - 32 images With Samsung routinely releasing its main flagships about 7-8 months before Apple's equivalent iPhones, we get some uneven comparisons where the newer phones' specs are at least a half-generation ahead. So until Apple launches its 10th-anniversary iPhone later this year, we're left to compare the specs and features of the Galaxy S8+ to last year's iPhone 7 Plus. Size Sick of Ads? More than 700 New Atlas Plus subscribers read our newsletter and website without ads. Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information The Galaxy S8+ is just 1-percent taller, but 6-percent narrower, than the iPhone 7 Plus. The S8+ is also 11-percent thicker, though it didn't feel overly beefy in our launch event hands-on. Weight The Galaxy S8+ is 8-percent lighter. Build Neither company has changed course here, as Samsung sticks with a glass back and aluminum frame, while Apple is no stranger to aluminum unibody designs. Water resistance Both have solid water resistance, though Samsung's IP rating is higher. Colors You have five color options to choose from with each phone. Display size The screen of the Galaxy S8+ is 17-percent bigger. And keep in mind it's only a smidge taller – while measuring narrower – than the iPhone, accentuating how much more screen-bang for your phone-buck the Galaxy gives you. Display resolution Apple never bothered with the pixel density arms race that permeated Android flagships a few years ago. Despite lower (but still high) DPIs, iPhones often still have some of the best displays, as Apple hones finer points like color balance, contrast and brightness. With that said, Samsung's nearly-edgeless display looked stunning in our hands-on. Display type It's AMOLED vs. IPS, on the display panels front. Curved display The S8+ has a display that curves off on both sides. Pressure-sensitive display Samsung has yet to copy Apple's 3D Touch, which lets you press deeper on the screen for various shortcuts, but the S8's home button does have some pressure sensitivity built in. (For what exact purpose we aren't sure, as pressing deeper didn't launch any shortcuts during our demo.) Fingerprint sensor Samsung moved the fingerprint sensor to the back this year, to make way for that almost-all-screen front. Iris scanning It might be slightly tedious to use, as you have to hold your phone at just the right angle to capture your eyes, but the Galaxy S8+ has an iris scanner that works a little faster than the one briefly seen in the Note 7. Facial recognition It sounds like it's too easily spoofed to provide much meaningful security, but Samsung also offers a quicker option to unlock your phone with facial recognition. Processor The Galaxy S8 and S8+ felt extremely fast in our hands-on, but event demo models, which lack carrier bloatware and other apps, may not be the best indication of retail-unit performance. Note that US shoppers will see the Snapdragon 835 in the S8+, but many global markets will see an octa-core Samsung Exynos processor in its place. RAM The Galaxy S8+ has an extra GB of RAM, but that doesn't always translate directly into better performance. Storage Samsung gives you one generous storage tier, while Apple starts lower but reaches higher. Just keep this next category in mind. microSD It's easier for Samsung to skip 128 GB or higher internal-storage tiers because you can pop in a microSD card for things like storing extra photos or music. Camera megapixels We can't have much to say about the Galaxy S8+'s camera until we handle a review unit, but it doesn't sound like the rear one is much (if at all) changed from the Galaxy S7's. Camera aperture (rear) Samsung's aperture, which can help determine the quality of low-lit shots, is unchanged since last year's Galaxy S7 – and still a tad wider than Apple's. OIS Both include Optical Image Stabilization. Dual cameras (rear) Samsung didn't add a dual camera, however, leaving Apple with the advantage of its Portrait Mode. It lets you blur backgrounds like you could do on a DSLR or mirrorless camera with wide-aperture lens. Battery The S8+'s battery capacity is 21-percent higher, but many other factors go into actual battery life. Another item to revisit in our review. Fast charging Apple has still yet to offer any kind of quick-charging solution. Wireless charging Samsung is sticking with wireless charging and – if you splurge for a special Samsung-made charging pad – fast wireless charging (which is still slower than fast wired charging, but is faster than standard wireless charging). VR Apple hasn't put a horse in the VR race yet, while the Galaxy S8+ still works with the mobile VR platform with the most well-stocked content library (even if we don't think the platform itself isn't advancing quickly enough), the Gear VR. Headphone jack Unlike Apple, Samsung kept the headphone jack on its newest flagships. PC dock An optional US$150 purchase, Samsung's DeX is a dock that you can connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse to: Slide the Galaxy S8 or S8+ in, and it will give you a desktop version of Android to use as a smartphone-powered PC. Whether this will serve as an acceptable alternative to a Windows or macOS PC is a question we're going to remain skeptical on until we're convinced otherwise. Mobile payments The Galaxy S8+ uses Samsung Pay, which works at both NFC terminals and many (if not most) standard credit card readers. Apple Pay only works with dedicated NFC stations, which are becoming more common. Software The Galaxy S8+ runs Android Nougat (with a layer of Samsung TouchWiz on top), while the iPhone runs iOS 10. Voice assistant Somewhat confusingly, the Galaxy S8+ includes two voice-controlled AI options: Samsung's new Bixby (which has its own dedicated hardware launch key on the S8 phones) and Google Assistant. The latter is a known –and very solid – quantity, while Bixby's voice control was disabled during our event demo, leaving us with little to say in terms of evaluation. The iPhone, of course, has Siri. Release The Galaxy S8 phones launch on April 21. Starting price (full retail) The Galaxy S8 phones are ultra-premium flagships, a fact that their striking designs will announce to anyone within eyeshot. But its price tag also shows further evidence that flagship costs are starting to get out of hand. As always, we'll evaluate the S8+ on a price-based curve when we review it. Until then, you can check out our hands-on impressions of the Galaxy S8, along with our review of the iPhone 7 Plus.

Credit: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comMore Credit: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com At a small roundtable discussion in Cupertino this month, Apple execs Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi and John Ternus spoke with a group of journalists about the roadmap for various Apple products. While the meeting wasn't put together to unveil a specific product, Apple let slip that it's working on a re-imagined version of its Mac Pro desktop in order to answer the demands of its most hardcore power users. "We're in the process of completely rethinking the Mac Pro," Schiller told Mashable. Apple noted that while the current Mac Pro introduced a compact, quiet and thermal-friendly design, it also turned off certain customers who needed more customization and power. The company noticed that many Pro users migrated to iMac all-in-ones, which helped Apple get a sense of what those users wanted out of a desktop. Naturally, Apple's execs didn't say a ton about the new Mac Pro, simply telling Mashable that the PC will "speak to a wider set of users and be configurable" and that it will likely be out around 2018. MORE: The Best All-in-One PCs Speaking of the iMac, fans of Apple's all-in-ones can look forward to more powerful configurations of the desktop later this year. "We're going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind," Schiller told Buzzfeed. If you don't feel like waiting until next year for the reimagined Mac Pro, you'll be able to buy beefed-up versions of the current cylindrical model. According to Mashable, the starting $2,999 model will now feature a six-core Xeon processor (up from four) and dual Fire Pro D500 graphics cards, up from the D300s in older models. Stepping up to the $3,999 configuration will get you an 8-core CPU and dual D700 graphics cards.

FEMAIL finds out which knicker styles will flatter your figure From high leg to thong, the roll call of knicker styles is as confusing as it is long According to plastic surgeon Marc Pacifico shape is determined by: the position of your pelvis and hip bones, fat distribution and your gluteal muscles FEMAIL find out which styles will flatter your shape best By Daily Mail Reporter Published: 17:00 EDT, 5 April 2017 | Updated: 20:13 EDT, 5 April 2017 e-mail 37 shares 198 View comments Bikini, high leg, shorts, midi, thong - the roll call of knicker styles is as confusing as it is long, making finding the right pair a seemingly impossible task. To track down a pair of pants that not only fit comfortably but actually enhance the look of our derriere, we need to work with what nature bestowed upon us.  ‘Shape is determined by four factors: the position of your pelvis and hip bones, fat distribution and your gluteal muscles,’ says Marc Pacifico, a plastic surgeon at the Purity Bridge Clinic in Tunbridge Wells.  APPLE  HIGH LEGS BEST  Our experts say: It’s the lemon-on-a-matchstick look: thin legs with fat around the tummy. So the bottom can appear shapeless. A lot of apple shapes want to define their waists. They have fuller busts and bottoms but need their tummies pinching in. A high-leg brief provides the perfect balance, defining the waist while lengthening the leg. A lot of apple shapes want to define their waists. They have fuller busts and bottoms but need their tummies pinching in. A high-leg brief provides the perfect balance, defining the waist while lengthening the leg  FULL BRIEF This is another great style for the apple-shaped woman. They pull in every lump and bump and also help to define the waist — anything cut above the navel is ideal. These also give a smooth outline beneath clothes. BRAZILIAN  Here’s a perfect example of how the wrong pants can change your shape. This model has a beautiful figure, but here her bottom has no definition and the pants are doing nothing for her thicker waist. Here’s a perfect example of how the wrong pants can change your shape. This model has a beautiful figure, but here her bottom has no definition and the pants are doing nothing for her thicker waist THONG  Not a good style at all — these knickers sit just under the tummy, which isn’t an area to accentuate in the apple shape. From the back, her hips look wider and her bottom looks flatter, creating no defining shape. ‘Pear shapes have slender waists and heavy buttocks and thighs. ‘Apples have rounder bottoms, with a lot of volume in the outer corners. Petite women may have little definition between their waist, hips and bottom and hourglass shapes have a narrow waist, and then curve outwards and back in again.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Whole chicken cookies, Crockpot cold water, and chocolate...

Share this article Share 37 shares But the right knickers can transform the lumpiest of rumps, insists Michelle Lawrence, brand manager of lingerie firm Ultimo: ‘You need to look at the body and choose lingerie to balance it, creating the ideal bottom.’ From Brazilian briefs, which are cut slightly higher at the back, to the high-leg bikini, we find out which styles will flatter your shape best, and Marc and Michelle give their expert view... MATURE  CHOOSE SHORTS  Our experts say: From the age of 30 we lose muscle. Due to this and skin laxity, the bottom may become flat and saggy. Falling levels of female hormones during the menopause also allow fat to gather around the waist. So a lot of over-50s want something that’ll give a lift while being comfortable. Shorts push up the bottom, giving fullness and shape, while the low waistline balances the hips and shoulders.

This underwear really ruins her lovely shape PETITE  TRY THE BIKINI Our experts say: Petite figures are often straight, androgynous and less feminine, with a smaller pelvis. Many petite women have shorter legs and a less defined waist. So when it comes to knickers you’re looking for something with minimal material — a lower waistband and higher cut at the legs — and a simple style, like the bikini. Here, the body looks perfectly in proportion.  Many petite women have shorter legs and a less defined waist.

Considering how slim this model is, it’s really surprising how wearing the wrong pair of pants can make her look a little bit podgy.  Her legs look longer, but the volume of material covers too much flesh — a petite bottom needs a lower rise. Considering how slim this model is, it’s really surprising how wearing the wrong pair of pants can make her look a little bit podgy SHORTS  Although the higher cut once again gives the legs length, her bottom ends up looking flat and squashed in at the sides. The shorts also look a little tight on the lower bottom, cutting into the buttocks and creating a rather unflattering bulge. HOURGLASS  GO BRAZILIAN Our experts say: This body type is likely to have that ideal hip-to-waist ratio and a full, heart-shaped bottom with hip and pelvic bones aligned. Ladies with this figure can carry off almost any style of clothing as there’s inherent balance in the curve at the waist and hips. The Brazilian style pants accentuate our model’s excellent figure, sitting beautifully on the hips. The high-cut legs give a great shape to the bottom and make her legs look longer.

Although they look nice, she doesn’t need the coverage and they do nothing for her shape PEAR  DON A THONG Our experts say: This is a classic English shape — a narrow waist with fat at the hips and a wider bottom. The pelvis and hip bones are also wide. As the position of the gluteal muscles partly determines fat distribution, there may also be saddlebags (fat on the sides of the upper leg). Women usually aim to distract from heaviness at the thighs. The thong looks great and her legs appear longer because of the high cut. The pelvis and hip bones are also wide.

Featuresby Robert Triggs10 hours ago 9 606 15 Picking up the latest and great smartphone is rarely an inexpensive purchase, however, customers in some countries can often pay much more for their handsets than other. Regional launch prices can vary for a number of reasons, mostly due to local tax rates, import duties, and occasionally plain old profiteering on the part of the manufacturer. To help track down the cheapest and most expensive countries for smartphone purchases, we have compiled data about various smartphone release prices around the world. This has been combined with historic currency prices at the time of launch to compare global prices in USD. While it’s not feasaible to track prices in every country, we’ve included as much data as possible about the usual suspects, including last years flagship releases to popular mid-rangers like the Moto G series. Flagship handsets Believe it or not, it’s actually a little tricky to find smartphone launches that see a completely global release. Neither of last year’s LG V20 or HTC 10 range made it out around the whole world, and we’re all familiar with the strict regional availability of Chinese brands like Xiaomi. Fortunately we can turn to the hugely popular iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge to give us a look at how prices fair on a like of like basis. Galaxy S7 Edge and iPhone 7 Plus prices Unlocked prices for your 32GB Samsung and Apple flagships are actually the cheapest in the US and Canada, followed not too far behind by Japan and Middle Eastern markets. Europe, China, and Asian markets add a small premium to these models, probably mostly due to additional taxes. There seems to be higher import premiums still if you’re buying these phones in India, Mexico, Russia, or Scandinavian countries. Perhaps surprisingly, the US offers flagships from Samsung and Apple at cheaper prices than the rest of the world. Unfortunately, Latin American, South African, and New Zealand customers pay considerably more than those in other regions. In the US prices tend to start at just under $800, but this shoots up to $1000 USD and more in these countries, a more than 25 percent up-mark compared with the cheapest launches. For interest’s sake, the average global launch price of the 32GB Samsung Galaxy S7 edge was $870 and $973 for the Apple iPhone 7 Plus with the equivalent memory size. So pat yourself on the back if you grabbed yours for less. Typical flagship prices per region Once we start throwing more smartphones into the mix we begin to see a sharp divergence towards cheaper flagships in Asia. While the US and Europe are able to get their hands on the expensive and rather excellent Google Pixel and Pixel XL, China, India, and other parts of Asia are able to purchase much lower cost flagships from Xiaomi, Oppo, LeEco, and other local manufacturers. Only recently has Huawei begun offering its flagships in more regions, and this is helping to lower prices slightly in the West, as are the OnePlus 3 and 3T. However, the lack of official availability in some countries, such as Australia or Norway, is keeping average flagship prices higher in these places. There’s a growing gap between the most affordable flagships in certain continents, not just in Asia but in Europe and Oceania too. Speaking of growing gaps, what this chart doesn’t show is the huge gulf between average flagship prices and lowest cost purchases. For example, the average cost of a flagship in India is now quite close to that in the US or Canada. However, your iPhone’s, Galaxy, or Xperia handsets cost anywhere from $100 to $300 more than in the US, but the country’s customers also have access to the very cheap Le Max 2 and Xiaomi Mi range, which cost as little as $260 in China. That’s $140 cheaper than the US’ cheapest flagship at launch, the ZTE Axon 7. See also: Android smartphones with the best battery life 3 weeks ago It’s also perhaps a little surprising to find that Asian countries that design many of the most well known smartphone brands, such as South Korea’s Samsung or Japan’s Sony, see prices typically around that of customers in Europe. There doesn’t appear to a notable discounts for being the country of origin for a particular phone in Japan, Taiwan, or South Korea, unlike there is in China. Speaking of Europe, Scandinavia remains the most expensive part of Europe for smartphones, while the UK is slightly cheaper than the mainland, for the most part. The US and Canada retain a price advantage over other Western countries, although the latter typically pays an additional $50-$100 for the same devices. Scandinavia is the most expensive place to buy phones in Europe, but South America is by far the most expensive region around the globe. Again we see the Southern Hemisphere paying significantly over the odds. Latin / South America has yet to benefit from the arrival of low cost Chinese manufacturers and pays significantly over the odds for flagships from Samsung, Apple, LG, HTC, and others. This can range anywhere from $150 to $500 more than US prices. And that’s if manufacturers even release their handsets in these countries, as LG and HTC often sell cut-down flagship models in countries like Brazil, but still end up charging premium prices. Australia and New Zealand also pay over the odds, although not to the same extent as South America. Import distance is likely a contributing factor, as is a lack of choice and competition. For example, you can’t buy the top of the line Google Pixel or the low cost OnePlus 3T in these countries, at least not through official channels. Mid-range bargains Flagships are one thing, but what about the cost of mid-range phones? This is a little tricker to track without having to look at hundreds of handsets, because prices and specs vary a lot more in this category. Instead, I’ve collected data on handsets that cost around the $250 mark in the US so see how much they can be bought for around the rest of the world. We’re looking at handsets like the Moto G4 Plus, LG X Power, Honor 6X, etc, in terms of price and performance. Unfortunately launch price information for these handsets is trickier to track down in many regions. Interestingly there seems to be a lot less global price variation in this segment of the market, with handsets sitting consistently in the $250 to $300 price bracket across North America, Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and Southern Asia. Japan and New Zealand see a roughly $100 markup over US prices, with mid-range phones costing around $350, but this isn’t such a big price hike compared with our flagship graphic. Again, South America is considerably more expensive than the rest of the world, with prices typically $120 more expensive than the US in Brazil and I found that prices often doubled in Argentina. Unfortunately this situation isn’t just limited to smartphones. Most electronics see a considerable mark up in these territories, owing to steeper taxes and high import duties, along with expensive and difficult distribution channels. Some handset manufacturers, including Huawei, Nokia, and ZTE have established distribution and manufacturing facilities in Brazil in order to sidestep some of these import taxes and costs, and we may see other manufacturers follow suit in the future. See also: Best cheap Android phones 2 weeks ago Just as with flagship smartphones, we see notably cheaper mid-tier handsets in China, India, and parts of Southern Asia. For example, the Honor 6X costs $250 in the US, but this falls to just $190 in China and India. The Redmi Note 4 is even cheaper at just $145 in China. The fact that handsets are manufactured locally in these regions certainly helps keep distribution costs low, as does the higher level of competition for affordable handsets than in the rest of the world. Wrap Up These findings certainly won’t surprise those who have been following smartphone announcements over the past couple of years. The falling price of handsets in China and India are well documented, as is Western consumer fondness for the more familiar, and expensive, smartphone brands. Of course, not all flagship smartphones are equal and your top of the line Galaxy S7 Edge, Xperia XZ Premium, and LG G6 the like are typically more expensive outside of the US. In addition, this data probably tells us quite a bit about consumer preferences too. Lower cost flagship territories seem quite willing to forgo the little extras in exchange for a core experience that offers higher performance at a less expensive price point. We will have to see if consumers make similar choices as Chinese manufacturers roll-out more products in the West.

According to a patent application unearthed this week, the company is teaching Siri to respond only to the voice of her master. The approach, detailed by Patently Apple (via 9to5Mac), would involve teaching the personal assistant to recognise the device owner’s voice during set-up. It would also enable users to customise a wake word to replace Hey Siri, adding an additional level of security. Related: Siri iOS 11 features tipped According to the patent, if Siri can’t identify users via their voice and the wake phrase, they’ll then be asked for the TouchID or passcode in order to verify. Currently Siri will respond to just about anyone whether the device is locked or unlocked. So, if you leave you phone unattended, it’s still possible for unauthorised parties to access some of the functionality by pressing the home button or using the “Hey Siri” command, if enabled. The patent was initially filed around this time last year, so it’s possible that Apple might be prepared to integrate this within iOS 11 and the next versions of tvOS, watchOS and macOS. Indeed, voice biometrics are certainly an untapped area for personal assistants like Siri, Alexa and Cortana. A voice signature isn’t as unique or secure as a fingerprint or an iris scanner, so the implementation will doubtless be tricky. Can Apple be first to the punch?

I didn’t play any sports growing up and I don’t closely follow any today. I only started being physically active one year ago thanks in large part to my Apple Watch, and even then running has not been something I’ve enjoyed. Until recently that is… I’ve been running with Apple Watch Nike+ ($379-$399) and tracking my workouts with the Nike+ Run Club app. My super short review is that I think any Apple Watch Series 2 is an excellent running watch while the NRC app has some kinks to work out. More on my experience below. Sony A6500 I say any Apple Watch Series 2 is an excellent running watch because any Apple Watch Series 2 can accurately track outdoor runs without carrying an iPhone thanks to the built-in GPS. This includes every Apple Watch Nike+ and Series 2 versions of Apple Watch Edition and Apple Watch Hermès. You can even use the Nike+ Run Club app on other Apple Watch Series 2 models that aren’t Nike+ versions, and Apple features outdoor run tracking in its built-in Workouts app on all Apple Watches. If you prefer other third-party apps like Strava or Runkeeper, these work with any Apple Watch Series 2 versions as well. The only difference with Apple Watch Nike+ compared to other Series 2 models is two Nike watch faces that are exclusive to the Nike models. These recently got new Nike color options through Apple’s watchOS 3.2 software update. Before last month, Apple Watch Nike+ was the only way to buy the special Nike Sport bands too, but Apple and Nike started selling standalone versions recently (which do not unlock Nike watch faces on other Apple Watches). Their bands have perforations that makes them more breathable and flexible than Apple’s standard Sport bands, although band overlap for me minimizes the effect other than how it looks. Most of my experience with Nike+ Run Club and running occurred using a space black stainless steel Apple Watch Series 2 with regular Sport band (and occasionally even the heavier Link Bracelet), although I switched to using an Apple Watch Nike+ in March solely for the Nike watch faces for style and lighter aluminum casing. Nike+ Run Club works with both Apple’s Health app and Activity app on iPhone. You can see your workout history and details about each run in the Activity app, although route maps are only visible in the NRC app. If you log a run from Apple Watch with Apple’s Workouts app, the route map appears in Apple’s Activity app (but third-party apps do not have this capability yet). NRC does a better job than Apple’s Workouts and Activity apps at showing lifetime achievements and even how many miles you’ve run with specific shoes so you know when it’s time to replace them (every 200-500 miles is recommended). Features like coaching for running goals like getting started, 5Ks, half marathons, and marathons are valuable, and the NRC app does a good job of encouraging you to run regularly with planning features that include weather conditions. I primarily track my history in the NRC app, although I have experienced a reoccurring bug when running with Apple Watch Nike+ without iPhone where runs appear in the Activity app but do not sync to the NRC app. I ran daily in March and this occurred two days back to back. At Nike Support’s suggestion, I un-paired Apple Watch Nike+ from my iPhone and re-paired it. Run syncing with NRC on the iPhone worked again on the next run. Then it happened again on Monday. A quick mile run using NRC on Apple Watch appeared in the Activity app on iPhone afterwards but never synced to the NRC iPhone app. Re-pairing takes a long time so I tried tracking a sample 0.1 mile run a few hours later and syncing worked again as expected. So that’s one reoccurring bug. Another happens during a run with Apple Watch Nike+ using the Nike+ Run Club app on Apple Watch, and it’s happened in about one out of every seven runs. You start tracking a run with the NRC app on Apple Watch without iPhone, then during the run it appears the NRC app has stopped tracking your run. The user interface stops showing your progress in the workout and instead shows you the buttons to start a new run. This bug is tricky because your run is still actually being tracked (so don’t stop!) even though the NRC app looks like it has stopped, crashed, and started over. If you have auto-pause enabled for runs, the NRC app on Apple Watch will actually show you the stop and resume buttons when you stop moving which lets you save the workout. Without these two specific bugs, Apple Watch Nike+ is an easy recommendation especially for casual runners looking to get more serious about the activity, but these issues can be frustrating and confusing when they occur. Both have occurred for other Apple Watch Nike+ users I’ve heard from and without using beta versions of software. To be clear, both bugs are with the Nike+ Run Club app which is separate from Apple Watch’s software. The problem is Apple Watch Nike+ is marketed to rely on the NRC app being as quality as Apple’s own apps (even if development may be separate). Nike’s software team can easily slip a bug or two through the App Store in an update that changes the overall Apple Watch Nike+ experience. The version of Nike’s app (version 5.0) that works with Apple Watch was released back in August and initially met with a fair amount of criticism. Nike has since released 12 updates to Nike+ Run Club, however, and other issues not mentioned above have been resolved. Still, Apple Watch Nike+ has been on the market for six months and there’s clearly still room for improvement with the NRC app. NRC issues aside, I recommend any Apple Watch Series 2 model as a GPS watch for runners. I tracked over 80 miles of running in March with Apple Watch Nike+ using Nike+ Run Club. I started running in September when Apple promoted the Nike+ Run Club app with a few runs under a half mile before I had to stop and walk. I’ve steadily increased by distance to up to 6.4 miles at a time in some cases and 186 miles in total since starting. I actually marked the one year anniversary of starting my fitness and healthy living journey with a somewhat competitive 5K race in Miami at the beginning of this month where I beat my personal record which was my primary goal. But any version of Apple Watch Series 2 can be used as a dedicated GPS watch for running. Personally, I enjoy the NRC app (and style of the Nike+ watch) and hope the bugs get sorted soon. If the NRC bugs are too frustrating or you just prefer other apps, Apple’s Workouts app has excellent outdoor run tracking and apps like Strava and Runkeeper offer similar features. My favorite part about Apple Watch Series 2 as a running watch is being able to just go out and run with AirPods or any Bluetooth headphones and play music wirelessly directly from my run tracker. It’s easy to make excuses not to go for a run when you’re starting out, and Apple Watch Series 2 ensures that dealing with a cumbersome iPhone armband case and earphone cables isn’t one of those excuses.

Dan Goodin - Apr 5, 2017 7:46 pm UTC Enlarge IntelFreePress reader comments 71 Share this story A broad array of Android phones is vulnerable to attacks that use booby-trapped Wi-Fi signals to achieve full device takeover, a researcher has demonstrated. The vulnerability resides in a widely used Wi-Fi chipset manufactured by Broadcom and used in both iOS and Android devices. Apple patched the vulnerability with Monday's release of iOS 10.3.1. "An attacker within range may be able to execute arbitrary code on the Wi-Fi chip," Apple's accompanying advisory warned. In a highly detailed blog post published Tuesday, the Google Project Zero researcher who discovered the flaw said it allowed the execution of malicious code on a fully updated 6P "by Wi-Fi proximity alone, requiring no user interaction." Google is in the process of releasing an update in its April security bulletin. The fix is available only to a select number of device models, and even then it can take two weeks or more to be available as an over-the-air update to those who are eligible. Company representatives didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment for this post. The proof-of-concept exploit developed by Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini uses Wi-Fi frames that contain irregular values. The values, in turn, cause the firmware running on Broadcom's wireless system-on-chip to overflow its stack. By using the frames to target timers responsible for carrying out regularly occurring events such as performing scans for adjacent networks, Beniamini managed to overwrite specific regions of device memory with arbitrary shellcode. Beniamini's code does nothing more than write a benign value to a specific memory address. Attackers could obviously exploit the same series of flaws to surreptitiously execute malicious code on vulnerable devices within range of a rogue access point. Basic mitigations missing Besides the specific stack overflow bugs exploited by the proof-of-concept attack, Beniamini said a lack of security protections built into many software and hardware platforms made the Broadcom chipset a prime target. "We’ve seen that while the firmware implementation on the Wi-Fi SoC is incredibly complex, it still lags behind in terms of security," he wrote. "Specifically, it lacks all basic exploit mitigations—including stack cookies, safe unlinking and access permission protection (by means of [a memory protection unit.])" The Broadcom chipset contains an MPU, but the researcher found that it's implemented in a way that effectively makes all memory readable, writeable, and executable. "This saves us some hassle," he wrote. "We can conveniently execute our code directly from the heap." He said that Broadcom has informed him that newer versions of the chipset implement the MPU more effectively and also add unspecified additional security mechanisms. Given the severity of the vulnerability, people with affected devices should install a patch as soon as it's available. For those with vulnerable iPhones, that's easy enough. As is all too often the case for Android users, there's no easy way to get a fix immediately, if at all. That's because Google continues to stagger the release of its monthly patch bundle for the minority of devices that are eligible to receive it. At the moment, it's not clear if there are effective workarounds available for vulnerable devices. Turning off Wi-Fi is one possibility, but as revealed in recent research into an unrelated Wi-Fi-related weakness involving Android phones, devices often relay Wi-Fi frames even when Wi-Fi is turned off. This post will be updated if word of a better workaround emerges. Promoted Comments DCRoss Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Elrabin wrote: The attacker needs to know your MAC address, you need to be on a vulnerable phone and the attacker has to be on the same network as you. Simple mitigation? Don't connect to random WiFi hotspots Which is the same advice i've given to everyone for years due to MitM attack vectors. It may not be that simple. I haven't read the full exploit details yet, but any wifi device broadcasts its MAC all the time. It's not exactly a well kept secret. Having to be on the same network could make it difficult to make a targeted attack on a specific device, but the availability of open hotspots, coffee-shop wifi, corporate guest networks and vendor or carrier provided networks would still leave you with a ton of targets. I'm not entirely convinced that being on the same network is a requirement for this issue, though. That may be just the easiest way to send TDLS packets to a target. Since the issue lies in firmware handling of the protocol, it may still be possible to trigger bad behaviour through unsolicited packets. Being careful of what networks you connect to is still good advice, but it may not be enough to stop everything. 619 posts | registered 11/2/2011 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple will be launching an iMac Pro while we all wait for the Mac Pro redesign Apple will be launching an iMac Pro while we all wait for the Mac Pro redesign Matthew Wilson 11 hours ago Apple, Featured Tech News Yesterday, Apple did something very uncharacteristic for the company- it admitted it screwed up and openly talked about upcoming design changes. This was all in regards to the Mac Pro, which received a major redesign back in 2013. While it was a powerful machine with a bold redesign, it didn’t leave any room for upgrades and the system wasn’t modular at all. As a result, the Mac Pro has been taken back to the drawing board. However, it looks like Apple is also planning on showing the iMac some love this year too. Over the last couple of years, it has seemed like maybe Apple is abandoning the professional market. The MacBook Pro 2016 wasn’t the best upgrade and the Mac Pro is dated at this point. However, Apple is looking to restore faith over the next two years, we’ll be getting a new Mac Pro in 2018 but this year, Apple is hoping to win us over with a ‘Pro’ model iMac all-in-one. Speaking once again with Buzzfeed, Apple’s Phil Schiller explained that Apple has “big plans for the iMac”, which will include “configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind”. Specifics weren’t exactly revealed at the time but we can expect touch screens to not enter the equation, with Schiller saying that “Touch doesn’t even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about”. Instead, it seems Apple has the right idea this time, with Schiller saying Pro users are mainly interested in “performance, storage and expandability”. With that in mind, perhaps we will see the Pro iMac come with better options for upgradeability, larger storage options and higher power chips. Maybe we will even see Apple make the jump from Intel CPUs to Ryzen, as AMD and Apple have been working together more often over the last few years. KitGuru Says: Seeing Apple address the concerns of its pro customers is encouraging. I’m a MacBook Pro user myself, though I would have gone with a desktop system if there were better options available for my needs in particular. Hopefully Apple will start to restore some faith in its Mac Pro and iMac lines over the next 12 months.    Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple imac pro news Previous Ryzen 5 1600 performance showcased in early review Next AMD’s RX 500-Series starts its slow leak to fame Check Also AMD’s RX 500-Series starts its slow leak to fame Right now, the Internet is rife with rumours and screen grabs of AMD’s latest reincarnation … Polls Which CPU air cooler next?

However, Siri can also be a meddlesome pain, which one of my colleagues can attest to having sent an iPhone back to Apple after it got stuck on the app – and was still asking to help from the box as the courier arrived. Accidentally pressing the home button for just a moment too long and the artificial intelligence helper bursts into life with its trademark "Sorry, I didn't get that?" – which may well be one of the most frustrating of first world problems. It can also be extremely useful, it can identify a song without having to download Shazam, can answer many questions, and is partial to the occasional bout of moderate banter Who would have thought technology could be so meddlesome? (Getty Images) Siri is still learning though, although the voice assistant was introduced back in 2010, it certainly isn't perfect. Users have constantly found ways to exploit and have fun with it and The Daily Record have discovered another one. They wrote that iPhone users have been taking to Twitter to discuss a new phenomenon. Repeatedly muttering '"108" to yourself and wondering if this is some millennial euphemism or something? Well not, not quite, it's potentially much more hazardous than that. Why this is a bad idea Saying "108" will in fact put you through to the emergency services in the UK. This is because 108 is the equivalent of 999 in India. So what Siri does is recognise it as an emergency call, and puts you through to the services in your area. Another would-be prankster went one further and urged people to not only say "108", but to then close their eyes for five seconds. This would of course mean you don't cotton on to the fact you've called the UK's emergency services until it's too late. Other numbers includes in similar pranks are: 112,110, 000 and the US number 911. Obviously, do not try this, as wasting the emergency services time can have serious repercussions.

Image Credit: Flickr/Rob Marquardt Computers, like many other technologies, were originally made for the 1 percent. More than 50 years ago, people would be as likely to touch a computer as to perform brain surgery. It wasn’t until Apple created the Apple II, specifically marketed to the masses, that computers began to penetrate the American market. And it wasn’t until many years afterward that computers (including tablets and smartphones) became truly present in the global market. The trajectory of computer usage and popularity is directly related to the evolution of the computer’s user interface (UI). Before 1980, humans and machines interacted through command-line interfaces, then it became graphical, and then we moved into touch with the smartphones. Next, I predict we will accomplish greater global market penetration through conversational interfaces. The reason is simple: A touchscreen can still be daunting to some, but everyone knows how to have a conversation. Interfaces move from command-line to conversational In 1980, 44 percent of the world was illiterate. In 1984, only 8.2 percent of U.S. households had a computer. These two statistics are not unrelated: At first, computers required high levels of expertise to operate, which meant that only those who were both highly educated and fairly wealthy could get even a marginal amount of use out of them. Operating a computer meant learning an entire language — there was (and still is — think: coding) a usage barrier for the majority of the population. Starting in the ‘80s, UIs became graphical. People had to learn how to use a mouse and a keyboard, but they could see the input and output on the computer screen. At its most sophisticated — the laptops we use today — this system’s learning curve is dramatically lower than the UI of 20 years ago. That said, for older people and people in developing countries, learning how to use a mouse and keyboard is still a fairly massive usage barrier. Enter the touchscreen. This user interface has actually helped with the age barrier that graphical interfaces came up against. Tablets are extremely popular with seniors — much more so than with younger generations. And it’s not difficult to figure out why. With the combined advantages of size (larger than a smartphone) and the touchscreen interface, seniors run into fewer barriers to learning the rules of the machine. It’s an important factor for the elderly, as one’s ability to learn new systems declines with age. And now for the finish line: conversational interfaces. Think of any sci-fi movie made in the past 40 years. From Blade Runner to 2001: A Space Odyssey to Her to iRobot to Star Wars — they all include conversational interfaces. It is the holy grail of UI. While a large percentage of the world’s population may still be illiterate (26 percent of adults), most of those adults can speak. This is the final hurdle in UI: making computers where the only input needed is your voice. Chatbots lead to true conversational interfaces Despite the many, many behemoths working on conversational interfaces (such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and others), those that exist are not even close to sophisticated enough to achieve true market penetration. Instead, we’ve mostly seen the predecessors of true conversational interfaces: chatbots. More than 34,000 bots have been built since Facebook Messenger opened its platform to bot developers back in April, and it’s likely that this number will double by the middle of 2017. From immigration assistant bots to weather bots to personal shopping assistant bots, businesses have leaped at the opportunity to embrace this new medium. As I’ve written about previously, chatbots offer both myriad opportunities and myriad pitfalls. They are essentially acting as a trial run for truly conversational interfaces, as many of the issues that we’ve seen with them (being too spammy, misunderstanding requests, not being tailored to user preferences, etc.) would crop up for conversational interfaces. These issues are already being replicated through systems like Alexa and Siri. Alexa, for instance, has encountered such mishaps as the infamous video in which a child requested a song and was instead given a string of raunchy and inappropriate curse words. Then there’s the time a news story about a kid ordering a doll house and four pounds of cookies through the system set off a random Alexa dollhouse shopping spree in homes around the nation. For conversational user experiences to work, a lot of natural language processing still needs to improve. Chat will rejuvenate access-based industries That said, chat — at least as a precursor to speech — is still conversational. That makes the usage barrier lower than other systems. Most people know how to text, even if they don’t know how to navigate the UI for various apps. For access-based industries, such as customer service and food delivery, chat will revolutionize the user experience. The UI barriers that once existed (think of a technologically illiterate person attempting to use the GrubHub app) disappear when all you have to do is write back and forth with a bot. Chat also offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously improve the customer experience while also cutting costs through automation. This doesn’t even necessarily mean chatbots; it means pre-populated messages, automatically directing the customer to the best person for their needs and rapidly addressing problems. Chat also reduces the likelihood of a customer just leaving a product because of a bad experience — the platform is less intimidating, and the customer is more likely to ask for help. Conversational commerce encourages the user to engage with the brand, which is precisely what access-based industries want. For a while it’ll be chatbots, but eventually, as natural language processing becomes more sophisticated, we will see voice-operated conversation become the primary method of human-machine interaction. This is not to say that people will no longer message or text. For many reasons, one of them being privacy (iMessaging while at work, Slacking or texting while at a crowded restaurant), text will not die; it will just become a more personal method of communication. Just as phone conversations have been relegated to the realm of the highly personal, messaging via touch will be reduced to private conversations. As I type this, I foresee a time where my WPM will no longer be a selling point — dictation will become the norm, and conversation will be the primary user interface.

Ahead of its release, Apple put the iOS 10.3 update into beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The iOS 10.3 beta helped Apple gain valuable feedback about potential bugs and problems. Of course, that didn’t prevent iOS 10.3 problems from emerging in the final release. The bug list included unspecified issues that ultimately forced Apple to halt the iOS 10.3 updates for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Apple’s replaced iOS 10.3 with an iOS 10.3.1 update, a tiny maintenance update. iOS 10.3.1 didn’t go through a beta, probably because the update is just a few MB in size. And while iOS 10.3.1 might be tiny, it too is causing issues for some iPhone, iPad and iPod touch users. With that in mind we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners need to know about iOS 10.3.1 problems as we push away from the update’s release. This roundup takes a look at the current state of iOS 10.3.1 problems, shows you potential fixes for the most common iOS 10.3.1 issues, and provides some resources that could come in handy if you start to see trouble with your version of iOS 10.3.1. It also takes a look at what’s next from Apple in terms of bug fixes. iOS 10.3.1 Problems It’s early but we’re already hearing about some of the iOS 10.3.1 problems iPhone and iPad users are encountering after installing Apple’s brand new update. The early list includes the usual suspects. iPhone and iPad users are encountering installation errors, weird battery drain, Wi-Fi issues, busted Bluetooth, Touch ID, Siri, and some issues with third-party applications including Facebook. Apple’s discussion forums, Reddit, and social media sites like Twitter are starting to fill up with various complaints about the iOS 10.3.1 update and we expect the list to grow as more people find and install the new software. @Apple @AppleSupport IOS 10.3GM and 10.3.1 both seem to have high battery drain can you address please. Iphone 7+ thanks. — Myklo (@3JustMike3) April 4, 2017 @My_AppleGadgets experiencing battery drain with ios 10.3.1 — Kurt Gilchrist® (@Kurtgilchrist) April 4, 2017 It’s virtually impossible to predict what kind of performance you’ll see on your phone or tablet and this is precisely why we always recommend doing a some prep work before installing an iOS release, even before a small release like iOS 10.3.1. We’ve put together a step-by-step process that will take you through the pre-iOS 10.3.1 installation process we used on our iPhones and iPads. At the bare minimum you’ll want to make a backup of your device. This way you won’t lose any important files. Where to Find Feedback As we push away from the iOS 10.3.1 release date it’s important to keep tabs on the update’s performance. Part of this is monitoring your version of the update for issues. Part of it is digging into feedback from other iOS 10.3.1 users. Digging into some of this iOS 10.3.1 feedback will alert you to potential iOS 10.3.1 problems and it’ll help you find potential benefits of the iOS 10.3.1 update. To start you off, we’ve put together some reasons to and not to install the iOS 10.3.1 update on your device right now. If you’re on the fence about making the move to iOS 10.3.1, start there. We’ve also starting putting together our own impressions of the iOS 10.3.1 update. We’ve started with the iPhone 7, iPhone 6, and iPhone 5 and we plan to publish our thoughts on the iPhone 6s and iPad iOS 10.3 updates in the near future. As always, we also recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter/Facebook, and the MacRumors forums for additional feedback about your new iOS update. How to Fix iOS 10.3.1 Problems If you do run into an iOS 10.3.1 problem on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, there’s no need to panic. Chances are, you’ll be able to fix your issue from the confines of your home or office. Before you take your iPhone or iPad down to an Apple Store or carrier store you’ll want to try and fix your issue(s) manually. We’ve put together a list of the most common iOS 10 problems and fixes and it’s a great place to start if you’re in trouble. We also recently released a list of tips that could help you improve performance. Some of these will take seconds to complete, others are a little more involved. If you’re unable to find a fix for your issue there, you should go to Apple’s discussion forums for help. There are tons of helpful users there. If Apple’s forums don’t help, you can get in contact with Apple Support via Twitter or the company’s website. If that doesn’t work, schedule an appointment to see a Genius at a local Apple Store. You Can Downgrade to iOS 10.2.1 or iOS 10.3 You also have another option at your disposal. If you think it might improve performance, you can try dropping back down to an older version of iOS 10. At the moment, you’ve got two options: iOS 10.3 or iOS 10.2.1. The downgrade process is pretty straightforward but you’ll want to put away at least 20-30 minutes to get it done. The iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3 downgrades will only be open for a limited time. At some point, Apple will close up them up permanently. Once Apple stops signing on iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 10.3, you’ll be stuck on iOS 10.3 with any problems you might have. For more on the iOS 10.3.1 downgrade process, take a look at our detailed walkthrough. What’s Next A new version of iOS 10.3 is confirmed. The iOS 10.3.2 update is official and it’s currently in beta for developers and those in the free Beta Software Program. The update arrived alongside new beta software updates for tvOS, watchOS, and macOS. The iOS 10.3.2 update appears to be a maintenance release which means it will likely have critical bug fixes and security patches on board. Unfortunately, we don’t know when iOS 10.3.2 will be released to the general public. Apple typically releases several beta updates before pushing the final product. If you’re dealing with an iOS 10.3 problem, make sure you keep a close eye on iOS 10.3.2 and the iOS 10.3.2 beta. 4 Reasons Not to Install iOS 10.3.1 & 6 Reasons You Should Install iOS 10.3.1 If You Want Better Security   1 / 10 If you value your security, you'll want to seriously consider downloading the iOS 10.3.1 update on your iPhone or iPad.  iOS 10.3.1 brings a single security patch for a potential Wi-Fi exploit. But if you failed to install iOS 10.3, your iOS 10.3.1 update will bring its monster list of patches as well.  The iOS 10.3 update delivered over 60 known patches for potential exploits. That's substantial, even for a milestone upgrade. The previous version of iOS 10, iOS 10.2.1, brought 14 known patches. Among them is a patch for a Safari ransomware bug that scammers used to extort iOS users who viewed pornography on their device.  These patches enhance the security on your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch making them ideal for those of you who store sensitive files/data on your device. Most people do. If you skipped the iOS 10.2.1 update and/or the iOS 10.2 update, know that iOS 10.3.1 brings their security patches with it as well. Again, the iOS 10.2.1 update had 14 important patches on board. You can see them all right here.  If you failed to install Apple's iOS 9.3.5 update, iOS 10.3.1 will also bring the three crucial security patches it delivered last year. These patch up serious security problems that could potentially expose your calls, contacts, texts, and emails. If security is important to you, iOS 10.3.1 is probably worth a download right now.   1 / 10 3 Responses 03/30/2017 DopplerDon Barker Reply I installed (or did I) iOS 10.3 and now my phone (6S) will not get past the updating iCloud settings screen despite hard reboots x3. 04/03/2017 jenny Reply My phone keeps searching,fixed it just within 4days its searching again 04/05/2017 Yacine Reply Hello i have mutch problems touch id very slow and the 4g data problems you turn on very slow not fast that all i can say please Apple fix this i have a iPhone 6s 128gb Apple give updates but nothing working good i hope fix this message app little bit slow thanks!!!!

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / General Tech / Qualcomm wants the FTC’s anti-competition lawsuit dismissed Qualcomm wants the FTC’s anti-competition lawsuit dismissed Matthew Wilson 12 hours ago General Tech Recently, Qualcomm has been finding itself in quite a bit of trouble with regulators in various countries. The chip maker was recently fined a huge sum of money over anti-competitive practices in South Korea and now, the FTC is also on the case in the US, with Apple being one of the key companies helping with the commission’s case. Qualcomm has already fired back at this US lawsuit from the FTC but this week, the company also began seeking dismissal of the suit entirely. Qualcomm filed the motion on Monday at the US District Court in San Jose, California. In its claim, Qualcomm states that the FTC’s complaint fails to outline any ways in which Qualcomm has violated antitrust laws or caused competitors harm. The FTC obviously disagrees, as does Apple, which has been tied into an exclusive contract with Qualcomm for years. The FTC’s complaint against Qualcomm initially claimed that the chip maker had been preventing Apple from working with competing companies for five years straight:  “Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm’s competitors from 2011 to 2016. Qualcomm recognized that any competitor that won Apple’s business would become stronger, and used exclusivity to prevent Apple from working with and improving the effectiveness of Qualcomm’s competitors.” Apple has also filed its own lawsuit against Qualcomm, seeking $1 billion after claiming that Qualcomm overcharged for licensing its patents. However, so far there has been little news on that front since the initial complaint filing. The FTC has also yet to speak out following Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss. KitGuru Says: Qualcomm is having a lot of legal battles on its plate at the moment. We will continue to follow this story for updates.    Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Apple FTC lawsuit news qualcomm Previous The HTC Viveport subscription launches today, offers 5 free games per month Next Ryzen 5 1600 performance showcased in early review Check Also Amazon to spend $70 million refunding parents charged for in-app purchases Over the last few years, there have been plenty of horror stories going round of … Polls Which CPU air cooler next?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News The Apple of Consumers’ Eyes — More Conversations Take Place About I-Anything Than All Other Consumer Electronic Products /EINPresswire.com/ — NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – April 05, 2017) – When it comes to conversations about consumer electronic brands, Apple products dominate, according to new data released by Engagement Labs. The analysis finds that out of the top ten most socially discussed consumer electronic products/brands in the U.S., Apple products hold four of the top ten spots, scoring particularly high with respect to online scores including volume, sentiment and brand sharing. At the same time, Samsung leads the category with respect to offline conversations, which is a leading driver of sales. This is despite the fact that brand sentiment took a hit in 2016 related to the problems and the eventual recall of its Galaxy Note 7. The rankings were developed based on Engagement Labs’ proprietary TotalSocial data, which continuously measures the most important drivers of brand performance with respect to social media and word of mouth conversations. According to Engagement Labs’ report, the consumer electronic category as a whole is one of the only categories that perform better online than offline, with many of these brands considered „Social Sirens.” While it is normal for a brand or two per category to be considered a Social Siren, there are many more consumer electronic brands that hold this title. „Consumer electronic companies represent some of the largest, most well-respected brands around the globe,” said Ed Keller, CEO of Engagement Labs. „When we looked at this category as a whole, we found that these companies perform much better online than offline, leaving room for improvement to spark more ‚water cooler’ conversations. If you look at the category leader, Apple, for example, all of their products perform significantly better online compared to offline.” Videogame consoles PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox, round out the top ten. PlayStation comes out ahead at number six because of its strong offline sentiment performance, whereas Xbox makes the list because of the volume of conversations that take place about the brand online. In fact, there are more conversations bout Xbox online than any other consumer electronic brand overall. This includes Apple. Nintendo is a brand whose online volume is stronger than offline, but demonstrates the reverse trend for sentiment, creating an imbalance and that could be improved to support its marketing and sales efforts.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Business Insider: ‘Apple is getting crushed by Microsoft in the PC race, and it may not be close for a while’ The Microsoft Surface Pro 4.Melia Robinson/Business Insider Apple’s senior vice president of marketing, Phil Schiller, told TechCrunch in a report published Tuesday that the Mac’s user base was nearing 100 million users. To compare, 400 million computers were running Windows 10 as of September, according to ZDNet, and that figure is likely to be higher today. And Schiller’s figure encompasses all Mac computers, some of which could be running older versions of Apple’s macOS (or OS X, as Apple named its older operating systems) while Microsoft’s figure is specific to Windows 10. Many more computers are most likely running older versions of Windows, like Window 7, 8, Vista, and even XP. Schiller also said 80% of Apple’s Mac shipments were laptops, like the MacBook, the MacBook Air, and the MacBook Pro, while 20% are desktops, including the iMac and the Mac Pro. He also mentioned that Apple’s MacBook Pro sales had grown 20% year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter. Schiller told TechCrunch that Apple’s Mac computer business was clearly doing well, nearing a $25 billion run rate. That number brings Apple’s Mac business on its own closer to a Fortune 100 status. Apple’s latest 2016 MacBook Pro.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Still, Microsoft’s Windows business is growing, too, especially in the high-end market. More consumers are enticed by Microsoft’s high-end Surface lineup of hybrid laptop-tablet devices, which lines up with the growing market for such products. Apple doesn’t offer a laptop-tablet hybrid that runs a full desktop operating system. Microsoft now also sells a high-end desktop computer, the Surface Studio, which our own Matt Weinberger said was leagues better than any Mac he had tried. And other high-end applications that demand premium $900-plus computers, like virtual reality, are also steering users to Windows from Mac, albeit slowly. Add the tepid reception of Apple’s latest lineup of 2016 MacBook Pro laptops to the mix, and it’s clear that Apple still has its work cut out for it to match Microsoft’s Windows. Apple told reporters on Tuesday that it would be releasing new models to its professional desktop lineup, including new iMacs and Mac Pros, in 2017 and 2018. Yet, considering that most of Apple’s computer sales are in laptops, the impact of the refreshed Apple desktops may not dramatically increase the Mac’s user base.

Called Amazon Cash, the feature allows cash-carrying consumers to add funds to their Amazon.com balance by presenting a bar code to a cashier at a network of partner retailers. Users tell the clerk how much cash to add, between $15 and $500 at once, and the funds arrive instantly in an Amazon.com stored-value account. Systems like this are not new, and earlier models relied on consumers setting up a cash load online and then presenting a printed receipt, as was the case when Walmart introduced a similar service in 2012. Amazon's twist is keeping the experience decidedly digital, allowing consumers to store a reusable Amazon Cash bar code in Apple's wallet app or on the home screen of Android devices. Bloomberg News Amazon Cash debuted Monday in the U.S., and the initial retailers include CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Family Fare Supermarkets and VG's Grocery. Besides bearing similarities to Walmart's Pay with Cash service, Amazon Cash also resembles PayPal's MyCash card, which charges a nominal fee upfront for digital in-store prepaid loads to PayPal's account, and is a major part of PayPal's efforts to build a market among underbanked consumers. The key differences for Amazon: There are no consumer fees, and there is no physical card. "It's a bit of a defeat for PayPal, which is increasingly catering to the needs of the unbanked and would had loved to do a deal with Amazon to enable the unbanked to purchase there," said Rick Oglesby, president of AZ Payments Group. Amazon Cash also shares traits with PayNearMe, which works with a similar network of retailers but markets its service more for bill payment than e-commerce. Amazon's service could also be an alternative to prepaid card companies such as Netspend and Green Dot, whose products can give unbanked consumers access to e-commerce. "Amazon's service is open to anyone who has a mobile phone," said Richard Crone, a payments consultant. The system adds authentication through the phone credentials, the Amazon login and the consumer showing his or her phone at the retailer, he noted. "It pushes the entire prepaid market to up its game." Amazon can also pair the program with its strategy to build a brick and mortar footprint by tying some elements of traditional retail with its e-commerce brand. Amazon is building Go, an experimental store that doesn't require a checkout, instead using in-store sensors to charge a user's Amazon account for in-store shopping. Amazon is also opening a chain of bookstores, and is expanding its distribution and fulfillment network in the U.S. Amazon did not reveal terms of its deals with retailers, and did not return a request for comment by deadline. The launch of Amazon Cash comes at an unwelcome time for the traditional brick-and-mortar industry, as Amazon becomes larger than most big-box chains combined, and many big-box chains face traffic slumps and closures. "Consumers can access to Amazon for whatever you want to buy. And if Amazon takes this to its move to open stores, they can squeeze out even more," Crone said. "It would be like Trader Joe's for Amazon." John Adams John Adams is Executive Editor of PaymentsSource.

The situation is a little brighter for merchants; a third of U.S. stores accept Apple's mobile wallet today, more than two years after its launch in October 2014, the article states. Consumers remain wary of Apple Pay, with 40% concerned about security risks when linking a credit or debit card to the service, and more than 60% of U.S. consumers are unfamiliar with contactless payments enabled by Near Field Communication-based payments technology, according to data from Creative Strategies, the WSJ said in its April 5 report.

"We mishandled Apple," Omega Advisors' Leon Cooperman told CNBC on Wednesday. Cooperman, who has a position in Microsoft, told CNBC's "Halftime Report" that his firm sold stock in Apple "early" because they were concerned about competition. "We were wrong," he admitted. That being said, the hedge fund manager said he has seen some of his other bets in the tech sector pay off, Alphabet being one example. "[Alphabet] is sitting on a fortress balance sheet," Cooperman said. But nevertheless he thinks it should follow the lead of one of its big tech rivals. "We think [Alphabet] should take a [page] out of Apple's book ... and more aggressively deploy cash, which turned out to be a good decision" for Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team. Nevertheless, Larry Page's internet search company is generating substantial free cash flow and "makes sense" for many investors today, Cooperman said. When it comes to social media, the chief executive of Omega Advisors likes Facebook more than anything else — again because of its "fortress balance sheet." "[Facebook] has a dominant position in what they do," Cooperman told CNBC. "There's no secret sauce." Success comes as a result of a combination of a high trading multiple, growth in the equity and how secure the company's industry position is, Cooperman added. "We're looking for value and we find value in many places. ... That's what investing is all about." As of Wednesday afternoon, Apple has gained more than 30 percent over the past 12 months, Alphabet is up close to 13 percent, and Facebook has climbed a little more than 27 percent.

Today some rumors slightly lift the veil how much the device employing them would cost - the 64GB version might start at $850, and the 256 GB model could go for $1000. Designer's concept of iPhone 8 Current rumors say the next iPhone will have a 5.8 screen and Apple will get rid of the home screen button for Function Area,' probably similar to the Touch Bar on MacBooks. Such feature can happen only with OLED displays produced by Samsung Display, but at cost. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes the base model might be priced higher than predecessors. If the 256 GB version indeed sells for $1000 in the US, it will be the first Apple phone with a four-digit price tag there. Milunovich since he predicted pretty accurately prices of the iPhone 7 the same time last year. The only flagship with OLED display and comparable standing right now is the Galaxy S8+ with 6GB RAM and 128 GB storage. It can be found only in China and will cost $1030 when launched.

Currently, Quanta Computer supplies all Apple Watch orders. It will continue to assemble the new Apple Watch but Compal Electronics will be given some production orders for the second generation smartwatch. The upcoming next-generation Apple Watch, which is scheduled to be released in the second half, will continue to be manufactured by the Taiwan-based ODM; however, production of the existing second-generation Apple Watch will be partially given to Compal. Compal has already moved equipment for production to plants in Chongqing in preparation for Apple's orders. Compal is the second largest notebook ODM worldwide and has been aggressively expanding into non-notebook businesses over the past few years. Compal shipped five million wearable and IoT devices in 2016, and the volume is expected to increase to over 10 million units in 2017 with the Apple Watch being a major growth driver, the sources noted.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search This iPhone 8 video shows what Galaxy S8 does right and LG G6 does wrong Chris Burns - Apr 5, 2017 4 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It’s difficult to say exactly why it is Samsung and Apple dominate the smartphone market – but this video takes a crack at it. What we’re looking at is a spinning iPhone 8 concept – a device that’s most likely going to come out next year, but commands search terms in Google this year because “iPhone 7s” is too many characters to be bothered typing. What we see here is style – design finesse – a sense of assuredness in the phone’s overall excellence. That’s what Apple and Samsung have, or appear to have, that most other phone companies lack. As SlashGear’s LG G6 Review suggests, LG’s newest smartphone is entirely rational. The LG G6 has a fantastic display – its camera is great, and there’s really nothing objectively wrong with any one of the phone’s features. But LG does not invest in dominant advertising – they do not put pressure on the public to buy their phones. SEE TOO: Galaxy S8 hands-on with Galaxy S8 Plus LG seems instead to be content releasing their phones as they have Feature Phones for the past decade. Putting the phone in stores on shelves where they can be seen and promoted by employees at mobile carriers. LG has all the ingredients necessary to be a top-tier smartphone brand – everything except the very public confidence in their smartphone brand that Apple and Samsung share. In the video you’re about to see, even this 3rd-party 3D-rendering show of design gets Apple’s design language at least half-right. It’s the iPhone – you know it’s the iPhone. Even though Apple did not design this device, you understand that because of the way it’s presented, it’ll be great. And well supported – because Apple is a brand that cannot afford to fail in this department. Apple has a legacy of dominance of this market that they need to uphold. This is a big reason why the iPhone doesn’t make drastic changes year-to-year – everything in and on the device needs to work within the perfect image that Apple’s cultivated. Small changes to a device that’s trusted by millions made a big difference. Samsung is taking a similar approach – they’ve got their Galaxy brand. Samsung’s use of the Galaxy brand offers a bit more leeway in part because of the wide variety of devices they’ve applied it to. Samsung presents itself as a company that can infuse the greatness of the Galaxy brand into whatever product they want. Along with the wide spread of Galaxy-brand devices, Samsung is able to change in a big way year-to-year on their smartphone hardware. Just a few years ago the Samsung Galaxy smartphone was a super-light, super-thin smartphone with a removable battery, plastic edge, and plastic removable backside. Now the Galaxy smartphone has a glass back, metal edge, and a display which curves down its left and right side. Samsung maintains their year-to-year flow with the Galaxy smartphone brand, similar to Apple. They do not promise, however, that every feature will be super familiar and immediately usable to all legacy Galaxy smartphone users. They’ve instilled in their line of smartphones a slightly more open-ended sense of wonder than Apple. In the end it may just be that no other brands are willing to place all their bets on one product. Because they didn’t make their start in the smartphone industry with a single hero brand, their method of multi-tiered releases is all they can hope to accomplish. Until these other brands can make the public believe that they’re entirely confident in their own hero device brand, they’ll remain in second place in every market. While this is happening, devices like the LG G6 and the Moto G5 Plus will continue to thrill or otherwise satisfy the few consumers that’ve done their research well enough to cut through the aura of none-other-ness projected across the planet by Apple and Samsung. And a company like OnePlus with a device like the OnePlus 3T will continue to sneak up from behind and inch their way into the limelight.

Today’s update comes with a few overall browser changes, and a lengthy list of Web Inspector updates. As with all of the Safari Technology Preview releases, today’s update focuses on changes that directly impact developers and the work they do. For example, release 27 introduces “Reload Page from Origin” which allows developers to reload pages without using any of the cached data.

Developers already on the latest release can download the update from the Mac App Store.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Why Are So Few People Using Apple Pay? April 5, 2017 12:29 pm EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler apple apple pay concerns contactless payment mobile payments not ditching the wallet yet security risks still using credit cards Shortly after Apple Pay launched a study found that people try the payment service once, but don’t continue using it. Two years later, Apple still hasn’t convinced a large majority of iPhone users to pay with their device instead of what’s in their wallet. The Wall Street Journal reports that while many Apple device owners have picked up Apple Pay, others have steered clear of the digital wallet, citing security concerns and a lack of accepting retailers. Apple Pay lets iPhone users store virtual versions of credit and debit cards on their phone. At participating retailers, the customer just holds their iPhone up to a device connected to the register, then confirms the purchase with a fingerprint or PIN. The service can also be used as the default payment option for purchases made online or in certain apps. While the system might sound fairly simple, a recent report from Creative Strategies found that many consumers don’t feel that way. In fact, more than 60% of consumers surveyed aren’t familiar with contactless payments. Others said they were concerned about the service itself, with 40% worried about the security risks of adding a payment card to their phone. Shortly after the service launched, a colleague at Consumer Reports tested out the feature’s scanning ability, and found he was able to upload his wife’s card without taking additional steps to authorize the card. Another issue many consumers say has kept them from using the service regularly is confusion over who accepts the payments. When Apple Pay first launched it was only available at certain retailers, with some explicitly banning the payment option. Since then, however, Vice President of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey tells the WSJ more than half of the 100 biggest merchants in the U.S. accept Apple Pay. But that doesn’t mean using the service at places like Best Buy, McDonald’s, or Starbucks is easy. One user tells the WSJ he recently had to show a McDonald’s employee how Apple Pay worked. Competition from rival payment services — such as Android Pay, Samsung Pay, and others — has also hindered Apple Pay’s reach, some analysts say. Despite consumers’ apparent reluctance to use the service, Nilson Report believes the payment option is on close to gaining broad acceptance. To that end, the WSJ reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said the number of people using the service has tripled over the past year. While the company doesn’t disclose the number of Apple Pay transactions it facilitates, the WSJ reports the service brought in $30 million in revenue last year. All this is to say that Apple isn’t giving up on its dreams of replacing cash, credit cards, and traditional wallets. “Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years [or] five years?” Eddy Cue, Apple senior vice president in charge of internet software and services, tells the WSJ. “Ultimately, no.” April 5, 2017 By Ashlee Kieler@akieler apple apple pay concerns contactless payment mobile payments not ditching the wallet yet security risks still using credit cards Tell a friend: Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window) Click to email (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Related virtual wallets Tap Or Scan Here To Pay: Know Your Mobile Payment Apps apple pay Study: People Try Apple Pay Once, Don’t Go Back Easier to split the check?

That's no easy task - read on to find out if it stands a chance By Oliver McKean 5 Apr 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Huawei Honor has announced its new flagship mobile phone, the 8 Pro. With ambitions of taking on the big boys in the smartphone market, it comes armed with one rather significant target – to be the best camera smartphone of 2017. You can pre-order the 8 Pro now, it costs £475 Sim-free, and you’ll be able to get your hands on it by around 20 April. At this price, it stands among models such as the Sony Xperia XZ, Samsung Galaxy S7 and Apple iPhone 6s, but is it a better choice? We run through the 8 Pro’s key specs and features below. We’ll be sending it to our test lab for a thorough investigation too, and will bring you our full verdict soon. All mobile phone reviews – buy the best handset for your budget Camera Perhaps the biggest news for the new 8 Pro is that Honor wants it to be considered the best camera smartphone of 2017. On the back of the phone you’ll find a 12Mp camera, right next to another 12Mp camera – and both use Sony sensors. This dual camera design aims to help bring out detail better and capture more vibrant colours, but what Honor has done here is give the second camera a very important job. It has a monochrome sensor, which allows it to use more of the light that hits the lens and, in theory, this will lead to a range of benefits including better results in low light, faster focusing and some fancy depth of field effects. Whether or not it lives up to its billing is yet to be seen – we’ll be running a full gamut of in-depth tests in our lab to find out. Selfie fans have not been forgotten, and will be glad to hear there’s an 8Mp front-facing camera. In our tests, we found that some front phone cameras take grainy and washed-out snaps, which may not be particularly flattering. We’re hoping Honor can do a better job here to back up its claims. Design The 8 Pro has an expansive 5.7-inch screen. Large displays are pretty common on the latest smartphones – but they may prove just too big for some. If you’ve never owned a large-screen phone before, it’s worth trying them out in the shop before buying. You should expect everything to look crystal clear and vibrant on the screen thanks to a Quad-HD display, and its aluminium rear and frame give the 8 Pro an expensive look. At the moment you can only buy the phone in navy blue, but we’re expecting the release of midnight black and platinum gold versions. Battery The 8 Pro has a huge 4,000mAh battery. As a point of comparison, the recently-announced Samsung Galaxy S8 has a 3000mAh battery, while the iPhone 7 has a 1,960mAh offering. But a larger battery doesn’t automatically mean better battery life. It’s an indicator, but battery life is dependent on a lot of other factors – such as processor efficiency. Honor claims that you can expect 30 hours of continuous 3G voice calls, or 10 hours of YouTube streaming, with the 8 Pro. We put all smartphones through the same battery-life tests in our lab to find out if the claims are matched to reality, so it’s worth waiting for our review to find out whether the 8 Pro is really a battery champion. Speed With its tagline of ‘born for speed’, the V8 Pro comes laden with expectations for fast and responsive use. Huawei owns HiSilicon, which makes processors. The Honor 8 Pro has the latest of its processors, the Kirin 960. We expect to see absolutely no lag when going about everyday tasks with the 8 Pro, and it should be able to cope with the latest graphics and games seamlessly. Extra features The Honor 8 Pro offers a generous 64GB of on-board storage. Of course, some of this will be taken up by the operating system and pre-installed apps – but there should still be plenty of space for photos, music and apps. If you get carried away with the fancy camera and find yourself wanting more it will take a micro-SD card. It’s a dual-Sim phone, which essentially means you can have two different numbers on the same device. You might find this useful if you want to use one phone number for work purposes, and another for talking to family and friends. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the back of the phone, for speedy unlocking. Huawei mobile phone reviews Huawei makes a range of smartphones, from more budget-friendly models to high-end options. For instance, you can spend around £145 on the Huawei Honor 5C or about £530 on the Huawei Mate 9. The Honor 5C has a small 16GB of storage (including the space taken up by the operating system and pre-installed apps), and doesn’t really have any special features other than a dual-Sim card slot. The Mate 9, on the other hand, has a huge 5.9-inch Full-HD touchscreen, a metal body, a fingerprint scanner, and 64GB of advertised storage. All smartphones are put through the same assault of tests, no matter their price. And we regularly find cheaper options outstripping their pricier rivals.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Soaring for a purpose: Young Eagles program teaches aviation to first-time flyers with free rides Sunday Apr 2, 2017 at 1:31 PM Apr 2, 2017 at 1:31 PM Monica Solano Staff Writer @DP_MonicaInes APPLE VALLEY — For a handful of young first time flyers, the opportunity to fly in a light-sport aircraft Saturday morning was a high-flying experience they won't soon forget. “It was really fun getting to fly and the pilot was really nice and taught us about flying,” said Brielle Santos, 9, of Victorville. “It was a little scary when he did a rollercoaster trick where he pulled the plane to go straight up and then down, but it was still a lot of fun.” As part of a nationwide event hosted by the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Young Eagles program, children were given the opportunity to see the High Desert from high above, and learn about the world of aviation. The Young Eagles of Apple Valley, Chapter 768 happily offered the free plane rides to their enthusiastic guests. “Sadly, aviation is kind of a dying sport and this is a great way to get those interested in not only the possibility of pursuing a career in aviation, but also understanding the importance of it as well,” said Young Eagles’ Coordinator Jeneace McBurney. “It’s been really encouraging to see so many kids out here interested in flying today and seeing their faces light up.” Founded in 1992, the Young Eagles program has dedicated nearly 25 years to giving youth ages 8 to 17 their first free ride in an airplane with the sole mission to introduce and inspire kids in the world of aviation. Since then, the program has flown more than 2 million children with the help of EAA’s network of volunteer pilots and crewman. “We’re a family of three who all happen to be pilots, and the funny thing about that is my son was introduced to aviation around the age of 10 and took his first flight similar to what we’re doing today,” said Flight Instructor and Pilot Gary McBurney. “What’s so great about aviation is that there’s a whole range of career options, like mechanism and design, for kids interested in entering into this field of study.” Gary McBurney, who was been flying for 12 years, was one of five pilots who volunteered his time and plane, taking more than 30 children up into the sky while also allowing them to get behind the controls for a brief period during the plane ride. Sisters Bella and Sofia Fernandes, of Apple Valley, both flew for first time together and although they said “it was scary at first” they happily exclaimed they would both “do it again.” “It was awesome, even though there were times the plane felt a little bumpy and I got scared,” Bella Fernandes said. “We also got to fly the plane and at one point I took off my headphones for a second to see how loud it was up there and it was.” After each plane had landed and everyone was back safely on the ground, each child received a certificate commemorating their first flight from the Young Eagles staff. The pilots may have received something better at the end, as each child hugged their instructor and thanked them for the times of their lives.    Monica Solano can be reached at MSolano@VVDailyPress.com or at 760-951-6231.

Apple designed the Safari Technology Preview to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari. Safari Technology Preview release 27 includes fixes and improvements for JavaScript, Web API, Rendering, CSS, Web Inspector, Media, Accessibility, WebCrypto, and more. Browser changes include a new "Reload Page From Origin" option, which reloads a page without using cached resources, and the removal of the Disable Caches option from the Develop menu. Equivalent functionality is available using the Web Inspector's Network tab. The Safari Technology Preview update is available through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store to anyone who has downloaded the browser. Full release notes for the update are available on the Safari Technology Preview website. Apple's aim with Safari Technology Preview is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. Safari Technology Preview can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.

The best iPads you can buy Malarie Gokey, Insider Picks Apr. 5, 2017, 11:00 AM 4,416 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. TL;DR You can't go wrong with any of Apple's iPads, but the new 9.7-inch iPad is the best deal for most people with its sharp screen, fast processor, and low $330 price tag. Apple Apple is the uncontested king of tablets. The word iPad is synonymous with the word tablet. Chances are if you own a tablet at all, you have an iPad. Apple's tablet lineup is more varied than ever before, and a brand-new iPad just joined the crew. At $330, the new 9.7-inch iPad is one of the cheapest iPads Apple has ever sold, but it's very high end. The rest of the iPads are equally stylish and powerful (if not more so). We've tested nearly every iPad that has been released over the past three years, and these are the absolute best iPads you can buy. Whether you want a giant screen for drawing, something small and portable, a cheaper option, or a quasi-laptop, we've got you covered. You can also check out the best iPad cases for every type of person and read why we love the Apple Pencil. The new 9.7-inch iPad may be our top pick, but for various reasons laid out in the slides below, you should also consider the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the iPad Mini 4. View As: One Page Slides The best iPad overall Apple Why you'll love it: The new 9.7-inch iPad is an absolute steal at $330 with a gorgeous sharp screen and high-end metal design. Apple's iPads have always been the best tablets you can buy, but the high price tags made it tough to find an iPad on a budget. All that has changed with the new 9.7-inch iPad. It costs a mere $330, and it offers nearly all of the same high-end specs and features as the top-of-the-line iPad Pros. Early reviews are out, and big-name tech publications like Digital Trends, The Verge, and CNET are giving it top marks. If you own an aging iPad or iPad Mini, the new 9.7-inch iPad is an excellent upgrade. Obviously, if you have an iPad Air 2 or an iPad Pro, you don't need to get the new one. The new iPad is for anyone who has always wanted an iPad, but couldn't afford the $500+ price tag. It's an absolute steal at $329.99. The 9.7-inch screen is sharp and clear with its 2,048 x 1,536-pixel resolution, the A9 processor is still very capable, the battery life should be great, and you can even buy things on it with Apple Pay, thanks to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.  You simply can't beat those specs at that price point. Comparable Android tablets cost hundreds of dollars more, and the iPad still has a better app library and accessory support.  The aluminum build looks and feels premium, and the 9.7-inch screen size makes it a very portable device that's easy to stow away in your bag. It's quite light, too, so you can happily binge-watch Netflix in bed on your new iPad. Pros: Incredible price for an iPad, powerful A9 processor, slick aluminum design, Touch ID for security and Apple Pay, gorgeous screen, and iOS 10 Cons: No Apple Pencil support and it's not the latest A10 processor Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (32GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) from BestBuy for $329.99 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (128GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) from BestBuy for $429.99 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (32GB storage, Wi-Fi + Verizon) from BestBuy for $459.99 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (32GB storage, Wi-Fi + AT&T) from BestBuy for $459.99 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (32GB storage, Wi-Fi + Sprint) from BestBuy for $459.99 The best iPad Pro Apple Why you'll love it: The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a step above the regular iPad in performance, it's perfectly portable, and works with the Apple Pencil. If you're feeling flush, you really want an iPad that can double as a laptop in times of trouble, or you just want to draw with the Apple Pencil; the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the tablet for you.  It's a step above the new 9.7-inch iPad in terms of processing power, thanks to the A9X processor, which has been proven to deliver laptop-like performance. The screen also has special tech in it that adapts to your lighting conditions and offers support for the Apple Pencil. Anyone who wants to make digital drawings, but doesn't like the giant 12.9-inch iPad Pro should go with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Those of you who watch a lot of Netflix on your iPad will love the four speakers on the iPad Pro — they pump out a whole lot of sound for a tablet. The bright, high-resolution screen helps you get truly immersed in what's happening on your screen. Of course, the iPad Pro line isn't just about having fun, it's also about getting things done. We recommend the Logitech Create keyboard case for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro over Apple's own offering. It's sturdy, the keys are responsive, and it doubles as a protective case when you're traveling. You could easily use the iPad Pro and this keyboard as a laptop stand-in, but remember the limitations of the medium. It's still a tablet, so it runs iOS, a mobile operating system that isn't adapted for laptop-like workflows.  Because it's so portable, light, and user-friendly, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is the best iPad Pro you can buy. However, if you like to draw or you don't think you want to carry your tablet around with you, read on to hear why you ought to consider the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Pros: Gorgeous adaptive screen, zippy processor can handle laptop-like tasks, Apple Pencil support, Touch ID for security and Apple Pay, sturdy aluminum design, and portable size Cons: Pricey Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad Pro (32GB storage, Wi-Fi, Space Gray) on Amazon for $535.00 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (128GB storage, Wi-Fi, Space Gray) on Amazon for $639.00 Buy the 9.7-inch Apple iPad (256GB storage, Wi-Fi, Space Gray) on Amazon for $734.97 Buy the Apple Pencil on Amazon for $93.99 Buy the Logitech Create Keyboard Case for the 9.7-inch Apple iPad Pro on Amazon for $129.99 The best iPad for drawing Apple Why you'll love it: The 12.9-inch iPad Pro gives you a giant drawing slate, Apple Pencil support, laptop-like performance, and a big screen for Netflix. Apple's first iPad Pro was an absolute behemoth with its 12.9-inch screen. The giant tablet may not be as portable as most tablets, but it offers a lot more screen real estate for getting work done, watching Netflix, and drawing with the Apple Pencil. I used the iPad Pro for two years as my main tablet, and I absolutely loved it. As someone who enjoys creating digital art and drawing, the big screen was just perfect for sketching. The Apple Pencil was literally made for the iPad Pro's screen, so there's no lag and every stroke feels natural. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro is also great for Netflix, thanks to its giant high-resolution screen and four speakers. Another huge advantage of having more screen is that it makes it easier to work on the larger iPad Pro. The A9X processor is speedy enough to do many laptop-like tasks, and once you get a keyboard case like this great one from Logitech, you can work on your tablet. Just keep in mind that it's still a tablet, so it runs iOS, a mobile operating system that isn't adapted for laptop-like workflows.  Sometimes bigger is better, but it depends on what you want your tablet to do. If you tend to keep your tablet at home and portability isn't important to you, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro may be just right for you. It's a bit unwieldy as a reading tablet unless you have it propped up on a table, but if you're drawing or watching movies, its size is ideal.  Pros: Giant screen is great for drawing and Netflix, laptop-like performance, Apple Pencil support, and Touch ID for security and Apple Pay Cons: Pricey and too big to carry around with you Buy the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro (32GB storage, Wi-Fi, Space Gray) on Amazon for $760.00 Buy the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro (128GB storage, Wi-Fi, Space Gray) on Amazon for $860.00 Buy the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro (256GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) from BestBuy for $999.99 Buy the Apple Pencil on Amazon for $93.99 Buy the Logitech Create Keyboard Case for the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro on Amazon for $138.63 The best small iPad Apple Why you'll love it: Apple's iPad Mini 4 is the most portable tablet you can get with a small screen and strong performance. Apple hasn't updated its small iPad in two years, but the iPad Mini 4 is still quite respectable. If you want a small tablet to take with you everywhere, the iPad Mini 4 is a great option — even though it's getting older. While the larger iPads are best for watching video, drawing, and getting things done; the iPad Mini excels at other tasks. It's great for reading, it's small enough to bring with you every day, and it's helpful for casting video to your TV with Chromecast. Those were the three things I used my iPad Mini 4 to do for the past two years.  I've always like the bite-sized 7.9-inch screen on the iPad Mini. It's just big enough to make watching video on it okay, but small enough that it feels like a book in your hand when you're reading. The A8 processor is one-to-two generations behind the A9 and A9X processors you'll find on the other iPads we've recommended in this guide, but it's still fast and responsive. The next iPad Mini could have an A10 chip, but those are just rumors. For now, this is your best choice for a small iPad. However, for $30 more, you can get the slightly bigger 9.7-inch iPad, which has a slightly more up-to-date A9 processor onboard. It's a hard choice if size is your primary concern, but we imagine you'd be happy with either one, and the new 9.7-inch model will last you longer. Pros: Small and portable design, low price, sharp screen, Touch ID for security and Apple Pay, and a classic aluminum build Cons: It's aging with an A8 processor and the new 9.7-inch iPad is a better deal Buy the Apple iPad Mini 4 (16GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) on Amazon for $366.80 Buy the Apple iPad Mini 4 (32GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) from BestBuy for $299.99 Buy the Apple iPad Mini 4 (128GB storage, Wi-Fi, gold) from BestBuy for $399.99 Buy the Apple iPad Mini 4 (16GB storage, Wi-Fi+LTE, silver) on Amazon for $344.98 Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

By Corazon Victorino On 04/05/17 AT 12:43 PM Close More details about Apple’s recent private meeting with a group of journalists have surfaced online. This time, there is confirmation on whether or not the Cupertino giant intends to release MacBooks and iMacs with touchscreen technology in the future.  Although the private discussion with reporters centered mostly on Apple’s plans for its Mac Pro computer, the company’s officials also spilled some details about the MacBook laptops and the iMac all-in-one desktop computers. For consumers who were hoping to see the day that Tim Cook’s company unveils touchscreen Mac machines, looks like this is never going to happen for them. Apparently, Apple is not looking to developing touchscreen Mac devices at all.  During the private gathering, marketing chief Phil Schiller was asked if the company is open to releasing Mac devices with touchscreen displays. Schiller responded with a “no” before proceeding to say, “That's a whole other long discussion we can get into, but suffice it to say, it's not a big need of the Mac Pro customers that we’re trying to address,” as quoted by TechCrunch.  READ: Apple iMac with Touch Bar in the works?  MacRumors pointed out that Schiller has already dismissed the idea of creating touchscreen iMacs and Macbooks late last year. “Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd,” Apple’s marketing chief said at the time. Even design chief Jony Ive said in the past that touchscreen technology isn’t “particularly useful or appropriate application of Multi-Touch” for Mac devices.  Another thing that was recently revealed by Apple has to do with the processors for future Macs. Axios’ Rebecca Zisser stated in a report that the tech giant does not have plans to produce machines powered solely by ARM processors typically found in iPhones and iPads. Interestingly, Apple executives shared that they are open to using ARM chips as companion processors for future Macs.  IBTimes previously reported that Apple has confirmed its plan of releasing a redesigned Mac Pro in the near future. The new Mac Pro is said to embrace a modular design, so the company could readily roll out upgraded components on a regular basis. In addition, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi has shared that new iMac desktops are scheduled for release later this year. The new iMacs are said to be designed mainly for professional users.  Apple has recently revealed details about its plans for its Mac devices.

The most glaring criticism was aimed at tepid adjustments Apple made to the Mac Pro line this week -- the first time any change has happened in years. Earlier this week, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reshuffled its Mac Pro lineup, bringing down the price of Mac Pro configurations combining them with faster chips. But there's nothing new about what Apple did. "The two available Mac Pro configurations aren’t new, they’re just newly priced," MacWorld pointed out.  Apple has yet to respond to a request for comment from Fox News.  The entry-level $2,999 Mac Pro model now has 6 Intel Xeon processor cores –versus 4 cores on the previous configuration – with dual AMD FirePro D500 graphics chips. And the $3,999 Mac Pro gets an 8-core Intel Xeon processor with dual AMD FirePro D700 graphics silicon. These pricing tweaks come after a long dry spell. “Apple has left the Mac Pro largely unchanged since 2013, creating problems for professionals who want to use a Mac for performance-intensive tasks such as 3D rendering or high-resolution video editing,” Apple enthusiast site Apple Insider said on Tuesday. Media dings Apple for neglect of product line as company promises big changes Frustration was palpable on Tuesday, with stories such as “Apple admits the Mac Pro was a mess,” from The Verge, which referred to the current Mac Pro design as “trash can-shaped.” "The lack of updates on the Mac Pro made it obvious that this product was a flop," said MacWorld, referring to the current Mac Pro state of affairs.  Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller reportedly said that the Mac Pro had heat (aka “thermal”) issues that “restricted” a user’s ability to upgrade and that Apple is “sorry to disappoint customers.” Most stories on Tuesday focused on a meeting Apple executives had with select news outlets on Monday. During the meeting, Apple said it is “completely rethinking” the Mac Pro model. And, as a result, the company acknowledged "that its flashy 2013 Mac Pro redesign was a mistake” -- as The Verge put it.   “I honestly think Apple may have finally gotten the message,” Gordon Ung, Executive Editor at PC World, told Fox News in an email. “I like to read Mac Forums…and for years, it was nothing but flying the flag and falling on the sword. These days though, even hardcore Mac addicts are saying Apple has forsaken us.” Apple apology But Apple's statement about the rethink of the Mac Pro may only frustrate users because the overhaul won’t happen this year, according to Schiller. So, to assuage any perceived user frustration, Apple, in so many words, is apologizing. “The mea culpa is clear,” said 9to5Mac. “The very fact that Apple felt compelled to hold [Monday's] meeting in the first place is evidence of just how much it thinks it screwed-up here,” added 9to5Mac. “The company that has always taken the view that ‘people don’t know what they want until you show it to them’ has clearly had to face the fact that, in the pro market at least, that’s not the case.” “Apple’s disclosures today are very encouraging but let’s see some actual products first,” PC World’s Ung said.

Photo: Martin Hajek Apple could delay the launch of its next-generation iPhone until October or November, according to a new report. It is claimed the company has run into “technical issues” associated with its new curved OLED displays, which means we may not get the spectacular refresh we were expecting this September. In case you haven’t been keeping up, this year marks the tenth anniversary of iPhone. Apple is expected to deliver a long-overdue redesign to celebrate, which means we can finally bid goodbye to the aluminum unibody we’ve been used to since 2014. The new model, believed to be called iPhone 8, is expected to ship with curved glass and the iPhone’s first OLED display. But that curved screen could cause a delay that means will have to wait until as late as November to get our hands on the device. “There are signs indicating that Apple may delay the launch of its next-generation iPhone to October or even November, instead of September as usual,” reports Digitimes, citing claims from Chinese newspaper Economic Daily News. “Technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system may cause the delay of the new iPhone devices, said the paper.” Apple has been announcing its latest iPhone every September since it introduced iPhone 5 in 2012. Rumors surrounding a delayed release surface every year, but this isn’t the first time we’ve heard iPhone 8 could be held back due to supply issues. We’re also yet to see any leaks associated with the device from component manufacturers, which means that either these reports are correct, or Apple has significantly bolstered security to ensure the secrecy of a much-anticipated upgrade. Other iPhone 8 variants could be available earlier, however. It is thought only one version of the device — which could offer a larger 5.8-inch display — will offer OLED screens and curved glass, while the 4.7- and 5.5-inch models will retain LCD panels and more traditional designs.

By Emily Bary April 5, 2017 11:02 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Several of the upcoming iPhone’s expected features may just be gimmicks, says one analyst. Illustration: Getty Images There’s lots of pressure on the iPhone 8 -- Apple shares are up 25% this year largely because of the upcoming device. But one relatively bullish analyst still suggests that investors, and consumers, may want to temper expectations a bit. More from Barron’s Next An Apple Analyst Goes Searching for the Next Big Thing Here’s How Apple Shares Could Hit $200 Apple: It’s No Longer About the iPhone Some of the flashy new features thought to be included in the next iPhone may not be that useful, argues Maxim analyst Nehal Chokshi. For instance, the new phone might support wireless charging, but Samsung has had this for two years now. Wireless charging “has been largely a gimmick for Samsung and has not turned into an essential feature,” he wrote. Meanwhile, the augmented-reality features on the iPhone 8 could also be gimmicky -- and not as strong as the AR capabilities found elsewhere. Chokshi says the technology to support AR on the new phone “will not be powerful enough to create a best-in-class augmented reality experience,” Chokshi wrote. Arguably the most exciting new element, the edge-to-edge screen, could be a selling point for those who want more screen space and a sleek look. But Samsung beat Apple to the punch on such a screen, which was “one of the big differentiating factors” thought to be in the next iPhone. Between this and the “gimmicks,” Chokshi is “concerned that an elevated switch rate from Android to iPhone that investors may be envisioning for the iPhone 8 cycle may not transpire.” He’s generally still optimistic about Apple stock, which he rates at Buy with a $163 price target. Shares are flat in Wednesday trading at $145. Big Picture: Some of the fancy new features expected in the next iPhone will add to production costs but may not be that useful.

Once configured, a customized combination of a specific phrase and a user’s voice—which Apple’s patent refers to as a “lexical trigger”—would be required to get Siri to respond. Current voice-activated digital assistants respond to specific speech, but not to specific speakers, creating circumstances where a user’s request can be picked up and acted upon by other devices in earshot. In addition to limiting that type of confusion, the change could allow users to place restrictions on everything from who can use Siri’s search on an unattended iPhone to who is allowed to rent movies from an Apple TV.

It basically hints at a new security feature that may or may not come to Siri in the future. In a nutshell, Apple’s proposed solution would let Siri recognize the voice of the device owner. The invention has the potential to prevent unauthorized Siri interactions on the Lock screen and across CarPlay and HomeKit devices. According to the patent abstract, the command to call up Siri could be customized to your voice. Moreover, the personal assistant could be set up to recognize a custom phrase other than today’s stock phrase “Hey Siri”. It’s this combination of a special phrase and the characteristics of the user’s own voice that may form a two-factor voice biometrics solution of sorts. Before Siri could ignore unauthorized users, she would need to be trained to know the user’s voice. Moreover, the user may be required to create a custom hotword to replace the standard “Hey Siri” phrase. If the right custom phrase was used and a user’s voice matched stored patterns, Siri would respond normally. Otherwise, the user could be asked to authenticate themselves with Touch ID and/or passcode before being allowed to use Siri. “Unless your iDevice recognizes you on multiple security levels, Siri will remain unresponsive to commands or requests,” noted PatentlyApple. The patent drawing noted below illustrates a process for recognizing a speaker to invoke Siri. As a security feature potentially augmenting passwords we type in and Touch ID (plus, facial recognition and iris scanning in the future), this could be extended to a whole host of future devices, including HomeKit hardware for the connected home and CarPlay. For instance, Siri would refuse to unlock the front door or turn off the lights in the living room unless greeted with the right lexical trigger. Or, she would remain silent unless  you were recognized as the owner of the car. In another example, a vocal password that also carries an audio footprint of the user could prevent others from logging in to your Mac. The patent application was filed for back in the second quarter of 2016. It’s unclear if Siri on iOS 11 will include these features. At any rate, we’ll find out sooner than later as Apple is scheduled to hold its Worldwide Developers Conference in June. According to a sketchy rumor, Siri on iOS 11 will learn from user behaviors, integrate with iMessage and sync data and settings between devices via iCloud.

Apple Pay launched last Wednesday, and according to Lee, 415,000 cards had already been registered to the service by Thursday. 　While only the numbers for the first two days' of operation are available, banks are estimating that as of this Wednesday, the service had 600,000 registered cards. Legislator Chiang Yung-chang (江永昌) asked Lee during an Executive Yuan hearing Wednesday why Apple Pay managed to outperform the Taiwanese service T Wallet + in such a short amount of time. Apple Pay vs. T Wallet + The number of cards registered to Taiwan Mobile Payment's T Wallet + app, a local mobile payment service that launched seven months ago, pales in comparison at only 33,000. Both mobile payment services use a coding technology that excludes the usage and storage of one's actual card number on the phone. The services differ in the number of partnering banks and types of cards that can be registered, Lee said. Though Apple Pay appears to have more users, T Wallet + actually has double the number of partnering banks in comparison with Apple Pay — the former having 14 and the latter seven. Furthermore, Lee said, T Wallet + can register both credit and debit cards, while currently Apple Pay can register only credit cards in Taiwan, due to the differences in debit card chips between Taiwanese and foreign debit cards. Apple Pay Concerns Some legislators have voiced concerns that Apple has forbidden its partnering banks in Taiwan to disclose information regarding Apple Pay's usage, including registered card numbers and transaction values. Lee, however, dismissed these allegations and said that "as far as I know, there is no such thing." The commission's chairman further stated that any company doing business in Taiwan has to comply with Taiwan's laws. While some sources say that Apple will not disclose the values of transactions that take place on Apple Pay for security reasons, Lee emphasized on Wednesday that his commission would regularly provide updates on transaction values.

Apple has just released the official version of iOS 10.3 for everyone, the last major software update for iPhones, iPads and iPods before the big iOS 11 roll out in June. Popular Searches TravelCenters of America LLC TA ▲ 6.05 +0.05 +0.83% KFC Ltd 3420 ▼ 2,289.00 -93.00 -3.90% ComfortDelGro Corp Ltd CDGLY ▼ 36.70 -5.99 -14.03% Bed Bath & Beyond Inc BBBY ▼ 37.80 -1.18 -3.03% Don't expect obvious changes in this version of iOS, but there are a few subtle tweaks that may be worth the upgrade. 1. Apple ID Profile There's a new profile section at the top of the settings menu with all your account information.  Click on your profile to access your iCloud, iTunes, App Store and Family Sharing information in one place and scroll down to see a list of all the Apple devices linked to these accounts. You'll still need to log in to the Find my iPhone app on your phone or web browser to access them all, but it will save you from having to dig through the settings to access each account. 2. iCloud storage breakdown If you pay for extra storage on Apple's iCloud, this next one will be especially useful. You can now see exactly how you're using your iCloud storage by clicking on the iCloud option in this new profile section. Tap the graph at the top of this section to figure out exactly what the storage hogs are. This gives you a device and program-specific breakdown detailing how many gigs of storage are being used by each.  If you haven't activated the two-factor authentication on your account (which you should), you'll notice a new "suggestion" section right below your profile in the main settings page. Apple may use this space to give you other suggestions to improve your device's performance, but for now this is the only suggestion that appeared on my phone. 3. Weather in Maps If you're a fan of Apple's proprietary Maps app, you will now have a glimpse of the weather wherever you go. The latest update adds a tiny weather bug to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen showing the current weather conditions in that area. For a seven-day breakdown of the weather just 3D Touch the weather bug or continue holding to open the weather app in a new screen.  4. Find my AirPods If you've splurged on a pair of AirPods, this feature will save you time and money. If not, just read ahead.  Sign in to your Find my iPhone app and you should now see the AirPods as one of the devices associated with your account. Click to see the last known location of the 'Pods when they were paired with your phone or ping them to make them ring. Just make sure you're not wearing them if you want to keep your hearing intact. Apple has not disclosed the official release date for iOS 10.3, which means these features are still subject to change. And the final version of the update may still end up including the "theater mode" or any other features Apple wants to debut before WWDC in June. 5. App compatibility status Chances are, you may be holding on to a few apps that have stopped receiving updates, which could be making your phone sluggish and buggy.  iOS 10.3 makes it easy to identify the culprits right from the Settings menu. Click on the About option on your General settings and wait for the information to load. If you have any non compatible apps lying around, you should see an arrow appear next to the number next to Applications. Another click should then take you to the App Compatibilitypage listing the offenders. 6. A better way to store your files One of the most important changes in iOS 10.3 is one you can't really see or try. Apple is taking the first step in switching all of its devices to a more advanced file system known as the Apple File System (APFS).  Apple's new File System replaces the existing Hierarchical File System (HFS+) and has stronger encryption, storage optimization among other improvements. What does this mean for you? What you'll notice right away is a longer installation time and a small bump in storage space. But over time this will mean improved performance over time, efficient storage and a more stable platform.

While Siri is often very good at understanding what iPhone users say, it cannot tell the difference between voices. At the very least, this can lead to friends hijacking each other's phones, but at its worst this could let a thief access private contact details, calendar events and more.

Amazon is also said to be working on a way for its own assistant, Alexa, to tell voices apart The patent also suggests the system would let users designate their own trigger call word or phrase to launch Siri. Instead of "Hey Siri," they could set up the assistant to respond to something else. This could further enhance security as the more obscure the phrase, the less likely a thief would know how to activate Siri. As Patently Apple explains: "Today a user will say 'Hey Siri' and Siri will respond. In the future, the command to call up Siri may be customised to your voice. For instance, a user sets up Siri to recognize the phrase 'Hey there, Boss'. The customised phrase and the voice must match what's in Siri's database before the digital assistant will respond. The customised phrase is technically referred to in Apple's patent filings as a Lexical Trigger." Although iOS can be configured to not let Siri work when the phone is locked, many users do not switch this feature off, leaving their phones and private data vulnerable. The website goes on to suggest such a system would help the version of Siri built into the Apple TV set-top box differentiate between members of a household. That way, the Apple TV could serve up content relevant not only to what the spoken command is, but to who says it. But, as with all stories about patents, it is worth remembering that companies like Apple investigate and develop many forms of technology (and even entire products) that never see the light of day. But with , we have hope that Apple's plans for Siri could one day become a reality. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

But Apple isn’t most phone companies. There’s always been an appetite for its colour variants, from the day the iPhone 4 came out in white and subsequent iPhones added gold, rose gold, black and jet black to the range. A few days ago, and with a lack of fanfare rare for Apple, it revealed its first ever iPhone designed to support the fight against AIDS. The iPhone 7 (PRODUCT)RED is now in the shops and comes in a head-turningly bright shade of red. The back is fiery crimson and looks beautiful. It’s amplified by the antenna band which is a slightly lighter shade but really catches the light. And the Apple logo is stainless steel rather than red, so it jumps out – other iPhone 7 handsets have the logo colour-matched to the back of the phone. Turn it over and the steel theme is continued on the home button – Apple could have made the Touch ID ring red but chose a silver finish instead. PRODUCT (RED) iPhone + show all PRODUCT (RED) iPhone 1/4 2/4 3/4 4/4 All looks great. By the way, that red really looks strong in reality in a way that photographs, even those taken by Apple, just don’t do it justice. Try and see it for yourself, that’s my advice, and move it around in the light to see how it seems to change colour as the light falling on it alters. Where the new look has proved controversial is on the front of the phone which is the same white you’ll find on the rose gold, gold and silver iPhone variants. Personally, I like it. I find the white surround lifts the brightness of the phone and makes it more appealing than if Apple had plumped for a red front glass. Read more Apple releases new, red iPhone 7 alongside update iPad Pro But not everybody feels that way, with some wishing the company had made the surround black. It’s worth noting that no iPhone apart from the various black colours (space grey, black and jet black) have been dressed with a black front, so it’s perhaps no surprise that Apple has gone for white here. Internally, this iPhone 7 is identical to all other iPhone 7 models, it’s just the shade of the anodised aluminium rear that is different. Buying the (PRODUCT)RED option is a way of supporting the Global Fund which contributes to HIV/AIDS programs. So far Apple has given $130 million to this fund, out of a total of $465 million the fund has raised. As such, Apple is easily the biggest single contributor to the fund, towards money that’s used to try and create an AIDS-free generation. The price is the same as other colour iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models, too, though as with the jet black iPhone 7, it’s only available in the 128GB and 255GB capacity editions. If you want one of those capacities, and if red is your colour, then choosing one of these phones is a cost-free way of contributing to an extremely worthy cause.

According to a report by industry news site Digitimes, Apple is working with suppliers to release the “upcoming next-generation Apple Watch” in the second half of 2017. The report details how the wearable will continue to be manufactured by Taiwan’s ODM, but doesn’t list any specs or changes. Digitimes has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple leaks, so it’s worth taking this report with due caution. That said, we’ve already heard a number of Apple Watch 3 rumours this year, and this isn’t the first time a 2017 release has been mooted. Back in January, China’s Economic Daily News reported that Apple was targeting the third quarter of 2017 for an Apple Watch 3 release. The article explained that Apple was keen to boost the device’s battery life, a problem that has plagued the Apple Watch since it first launched in 2015. Then in February, Digitimes reported that Apple may be changing the supplier of touch panels for the Apple Watch 3, with the firm reportedly set to utilise a new “glass-film touch solution”. Taiwan’s General Interfact Solution and Hong Kong’s Biel Crystal Manufactory were both said to be in the running for a supply deal. And just last month, analyst Christopher Roland reported that Apple was plotting standalone mobile connectivity and a more advanced processor to boot. Roland’s predictions were based on discussions with suppliers in Asia. Of course, Apple hasn’t confirmed any such details about a new Apple Watch Series 3, so these leaks with a pinch of salt.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Apple to Design In-House GPUs for iPhones and iPads Azeem Ullah 2 days ago Apple is famous for having a “walled garden” like ecosystem. From in-house designs for the iPhones and iPads to the iTunes App Store being the only source of downloading apps for iOS. The company is trying its hand at another venture, adding one more important component to its walled garden, GPUs. For a long while Apple relied on Imagination Technologies for designing its GPUs. This will be the first time that the company will be designing its own graphics solution for portable devices. Switched to Intel in 2006 The move could take place as soon as next year. The Cupertino-based company already makes the A-series CPUs it uses in its portables. Macs are an exception to that case, obviously, having switched over to Intel’s processors back in 2006. The phones have, since the beginning used Imagination’s PowerVR series for fulfilling graphics requirements, starting from the iPhone 2G. With all said and done, the shift will be completed in under two years. Apple had previously considered acquiring Imagination Tech, and does own 8% of it. Ultimately it decided to take a different route altogether and get production done in-house. Bad News for Imagination Technologies This is bad news for Imagination Tech. Half of their revenue comes from their licensing deals from Apple. The company’s shares have plummeted by more than two-thirds since Apple’s announcement. Whatever the case, we might hear more of this story as time progresses. That’s because Imagination reckons it’ll be hard for Apple to design a new graphics chip from scratch without infringing upon its intellectual property, not surprising since its designs have been used for more than 10 years now. It could just as easily conclude amicably, with “potential alternative commercial agreements” still being discussed. Only time will tell how Apple’s new venture goes.

TECHNOLOGY Meet the $21 Million Company That Thinks a New iPhone Is a Total Waste of Money The guys behind iFixit want to show you how to fix everything from your iPhone to your toaster--for free. By doing so, they've built a huge business. Even though Apple totally hates them. By David Whitford David Whitford was a senior writer at Inc. in the mid-1990s, and recently returned as an editor-at-large, based in Boston. Between tours at Inc., he was an award-winning feature writer for Fortune and Fortune Small Business. He has written three books about sports, business, and politics, the first of which, A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption, and Football at SMU, was republished last fall by University of Nebraska Press. @davidwhitford Editor-at-large@davidwhitford WRITE A COMMENT IFixit's founders, Kyle Wiens (left) and Luke Soules, have built a thriving company around a pretty radical idea. CREDIT: Alex V. Murawski Advertisement "Here--stand on that," says Kyle Wiens, positioning himself opposite his visitor and reaching for the switch. Then comes the electric hum, followed by the soft jolt and the ground receding. It's a car lift, mechanic's grade, salvaged from a dealership, reinstalled on a concrete pad in Wiens's backyard in Atascadero, California.  Wiens--who's wearing jeans, a checkered shirt, steel-rimmed glasses, and the kind of haircut you might give yourself with a pair of dull scissors--has about two sloping acres on a rise overlooking U.S. Highway 101, midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The high hills beyond are green from this winter's drenching rains. There's a stucco main house, a prefab outbuilding, a chicken coop, a patio with a monster grill, and a work shed that houses motorcycles, dirt bikes, kayaks, wetsuits, a generator, a compressor, a welding torch, hammers, wrenches, and drills, as well as several small piles of disassembled equipment: his many works in progress. The lift is just outside the shed. Wiens uses it for jobs most people would delegate to a professional, like swapping out the transmission on a truck. And for cheap thrills: "It's so cool!" IFixit co-founders Kyle Wiens (left) and Luke Soules in a loft atop a rock-climbing wall. Note the strategically placed iFixit logos on their laptops. CREDIT: Shaughn and John It's also there because fixing stuff is his life's work. Wiens, 33, is co-founder and CEO of iFixit, a company whose mission, he says, is to "teach everybody how to fix everything." On iFixit's website is a vast library of step-by-step instruction sets covering, well, let's see: how to adjust your brakes, patch a leaky fuel tank on a motorcycle, situate the bumper sensor on a Roomba vacuum cleaner, unjam a paper shredder, reattach a sole on a shoe, start a fire without a match, fill a scratch in an eyeglass lens, install a new bread-lift shelf in a pop-up toaster, replace a heating coil in an electric kettle, and--iFixit's specialty--perform all manner of delicate repairs on busted Apple laptops and cell phones. More than 25,000 manuals in all, covering more than 7,000 objects and devices. Last year, according to Wiens, 94 million people all over the world learned how to restore something to tiptop working condition with iFixit's help, which frankly was a little disappointing. Wiens's goal was 100 million. Some of the knowledge stored on iFixit's website is produced internally. Most comes, wiki-style, from the world at large. Either way, the information is always free. You don't have to register. There's no advertising. IFixit makes about 90 percent of its revenue from selling parts and tools to people who wouldn't know what to do with them if iFixit weren't also giving away so much valuable information. The rest comes from licensing the software iFixit developed to write its online manuals, and from training independent repair technicians, some 15,000 so far, who rely on iFixit to run their own businesses. "We impact the economy in a far bigger way than we capture ourselves," Wiens allows. He's OK with that. That's how you get to everybody and everything. But it's a real business. A 14-year-old, 125-employee, five-time Inc. 5000 honoree growing 30 percent year over year, iFixit topped $21 million in sales in 2016 and delivers steady profits. "We give away a whole lot for free," says co-founder Luke Soules, who's 32. "We like that, and it still works, even if only a fraction of those people give us money." Consider how we as consumers relate to our electronic gadgets and gizmos. We can't live without them, but we have no more idea about what goes on beneath their shiny exteriors than the apes did about the monolith in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When they break, we feel helpless; we want a new one right away. But there are consequences to consuming like that--environmental consequences, as our discarded toxic technology makes its way into landfills and dumps; resource consequences, as finite supplies of crucial elements like iridium are rapidly consumed and discarded; eco­nomic consequences, as we recklessly empty our pockets to keep pace with the latest and greatest; and human conse­quences, as we grow increasingly frustrated by the magical objects on which we depend. IFixit and its noble mission may not seem like much of a threat to anyone, least of all the most profitable company on the planet, but Apple has been watching iFixit carefully. Apple doesn't like iFixit, because iFixit writes its own in-house versions of Apple's top-secret repair manuals and shares them with all comers. It sells reverse-engineered Apple-equivalent parts and bundles them with custom-designed picks, tweezers, spudgers (tiny plastic chisels), and screwdrivers in affordable, everything-you-need kits. Working with iFixit, you can replace a cracked screen or a fried battery for a lot less than if you were to take your problem to an Apple store, which might not be an option for you anyway, depending on where you live. Plus, iFixit won't try to sell you a new phone. (Apple ignored repeated requests to comment for this story.) IPhones equipped with new iFixit replacement screens, awaiting testing. CREDIT: Shaughn and John Then again, iFixit doesn't like Apple either. At iFixit headquarters in San Luis Obispo, California, the recycling goes in cans labeled with iFixit's logo--it resembles a Phillips screw head--while the cans with the Apple logo are for trash. In eight state legislatures across the country, the two companies are fighting over so-called right-to-repair laws (see "You Gotta Fight for Your Right to Repair," below) that, if passed, will loosen Apple's strict, cradle-to-grave control over everything it sells and eat into its stupendous repair revenue. Apple doesn't report just how huge that repair revenue is, but trade journal Warranty Week estimates that one proxy for that--sales of Apple's extended-warranty repair program, AppleCare--delivered the company a staggering $5.9 billion worldwide in 2016. "It's the world's largest extended-warranty program," says Warranty Week editor Eric Arnum. "Bigger than GM's. Bigger than Volkswagen's. Bigger than Best Buy's or Walmart's." IFixit wouldn't be here if it weren't for Apple and everything about it--its innovation, its ubiquity, and its arrogance. IFixit is basically a parasite if you think about it that way. Or maybe a pilotfish, swimming with the shark and subsisting on its leftovers. Yet that doesn't begin to capture the fullness of this company's radical mission, or the ambition of its founders, both of which Wiens has spent much time reflecting on. "I'm really concerned about the transition in society to a world where we don't understand what's in our things," he says. "Where we are afraid of engineering, afraid of fact, afraid of tinkering. When you take something like a phone or voice recorder and you take it apart and you understand it enough to be able to fix it, a switch flips in your brain. You go from being just a consumer to being someone who is actually a participant." This may not be as cool as having your own backyard car lift. But still, it's pretty cool. Wiens and Soules both grew up in Oregon, but they didn't meet until they got to California Polytechnic State University, where the motto is "Learn by doing." That was 2003, and they've been together ever since--as friends, roommates, 50-50 business partners, and river kayaking buddies. (When Wiens announced he was getting married, his other friends told him he would have to divorce Soules first.) Wiens talks more than Soules and sleeps less; he's the public face of iFixit, its chief explainer and grand strategist. Soules oversees operations and manages iFixit's China supply chain; he's also a pilot and a clarinetist. At Cal Poly, they bonded over their shared geekiness. "I remember him going home for Christmas break," says Soules. "He had a big, old-fashioned desktop computer. He brought it with him on the train." Wiens's other computer was an Apple iBook G3, the curvy, candy-colored laptop known as the "toilet seat Mac." He dropped it one day, and it broke. Wiens was unfazed. As kids, he and his brother were always taking apart and reassembling old radios and kitchen appliances that their grandfather bought for them at Goodwill. He "spent his life making and maintaining things," Wiens wrote of his grandfather in a eulogistic essay published on The Atlantic's website in 2013; he schooled Wiens in the war against "entropy: the second law of thermodynamics that guarantees everything will eventually wear out"; and he sent him off to college with a toolkit and a soldering iron. IFixit staffer Alec Thille, at his desk at company headquarters. CREDIT: Shaughn and John Wiens needed a G3 repair manual. He searched in vain online. Apple doesn't share such knowledge with its customers. That ticked him off. It was his computer, after all. Bought and paid for. Why shouldn't he have access to its inner workings? "This shall not stand," Wiens remembers thinking, and so was born the idea for a business. Wiens and Soules worked it out over the next several years. Initially, they thought they'd write their own repair manuals and sell them, but--first lesson--information is a tough sell. (No one would pay for eHow's articles or videos, either.) Parts and tools, on the other hand, aren't, so Wiens and Soules became online resellers, clearing out the screwdriver shelves at Sears, ordering hard-to-get parts from catalogs, and filling orders, Michael Dell-like, from their dorm. They called their fledgling company PowerBook Fixit, until Wiens got scared that Apple might hunt them down for trademark infringement. Next, they tried PBFixit, which didn't stick either. "People thought it stood for peanut butter," says Soules. Still, people came. "We didn't make money our first month," says Wiens. "We made money our second month. And we've made money ever since." They roomed together, sleeping in bunk beds so they'd have more space for inventory. Sophomore year, they moved off campus to a two-bedroom apartment, and eventually to a three-bedroom house with a three-car garage that served as a parts warehouse. Taking care of business while keeping up with classes presented certain challenges. "I'd be on the phone with a customer, trying to walk them through installing their hard drive, and I'm looking at the clock thinking, 'I have a midterm across town in 20 minutes,' " says Wiens. "You can't tell the customer that." Eventually, they hired help. One day, an employee arrived for work at the house having forgotten his key, so he picked the lock. The boss was impressed. "To this day, we still teach lock-picking to new employees," Wiens says. (At times, iFixit has sold branded lock-pick sets despite certain complications; it's illegal to ship them via U.S. mail.) "In the beginning, we were very carefully iterating on the customer experience around parts," says Wiens. "Then customers would say, 'Well, that's fine, but how do we install it?' So we wrote them a manual. And they would say, 'Well, that's fine, but we don't have tools,' and so we sold them the tools. And they would say, 'Well, the tools are too expensive,' so then we started building kits and just bundled the tools into the price of the parts. It turns out that we were doing something that nobody else in the parts business was." The year they graduated, 2007, was the same year the iPhone made its debut, presaging a dramatic shift in their revenue stream from fixing computers to fixing handheld devices. What had begun as a part-time gig was by now a profitable, fast-growing business. It didn't provide them with just spending money while they were in college--it paid for college. It also covered the down payment on the $690,000 house in Atascadero that would serve them over the years, sometimes overlappingly, as their shared home, an employee bunkhouse, and iFixit's headquarters. "This could very well be a career for us," Soules remembers thinking senior year; the thought had never occurred to him before. So much for worrying about finding a job. IFixit staffers pitching in to process the company's latest delivery of its tools inventory from its suppliers. This time around, iFixit received more than 2,000 boxes. CREDIT: Shaughn and John The front door at iFixit headquarters on the edge of downtown San Luis Obispo is locked. A sign says "by appointment only." There is a bell, however, to which a smiling, bearded 20-something responds. He leads the way through an empty waiting room into a steel-girded, skylighted barn, filled with other bearded 20-somethings and a few of their female counterparts. This building used to be the car dealership where Wiens got his lift. He left the other lift out back for his employees' benefit, though it's not clear how many drive, much less own cars. On their first day, all iFixit workers receive--in addition to a desk, in parts, which they're expected to assemble themselves--$400 toward the purchase of a bike. The parking lot is mostly empty. Renovating the place took more than a year. The biggest challenge, Wiens says, was figuring out how to insert an upper level into the existing framework and make everything watertight without bringing down the roof. ("It's much harder to repurpose and reuse an existing building than to build a new one from scratch," he concedes, irony apparently unintended.) There's a grand staircase bisecting the central atrium, made with recycled acacia and walnut. Twin monitors on the landing track global activity on the website. The paneling at the top of the stairs is made with two-by-four oak-flavor planks, discarded by the region's wineries. It smells good in here. Not like wood or wine, but familiar and clean. Like a freshly opened box of electronics. Soules is visiting the company's suppliers in China this week, but Wiens is at his second-floor "desk." It's a treadmill set to walking pace, facing a high-top table holding a stack of outdated software manuals, repurposed as a platform for his laptop. Wiens doesn't advertise it, but he's a devout Christian. Jen Wiens, iFixit's company chef, wasn't sure what to make of her future husband the first time they met, in Bible class--an insistent chatterbox, a voracious reader (later she would learn that he listens to audio books at double speed), a man given to big ideas and noble pronouncements. "I worked at a law firm downtown," she says. "I was always pretty tired from a 14-hour day. He would sit next to me and just keep talking. He was always really excited. Eventually, I decided maybe I should pay attention." Kay-Kay Clapp, iFixit's director of outreach, hard at work at (well, under) her desk at company headquarters. CREDIT: Shaughn and John One of the first times they hung out together, Kyle told Jen that he wanted to change the world. He was still in college, still working out the details of his big vision for "fighting the growth of disposable culture," as he would write years later in iFixit's employee handbook (a 50-page manifesto illustrated with drawings lifted from a 1903 edition of the Boy Scout handbook), "promoting sustainable design, defending ownership rights, and shedding light on the devastating effects of electronic waste." Kyle wasn't quite there yet, though it was clear to Jen even then that when Kyle talked about changing the world, he meant something more than disrupting some tiny corner of the tech industry and making a lot of money for himself. "I knew where he was going," she says. Where he was going, of course, was this business that would eventually infuriate Apple. But it would also thrill a few enlightened corporate allies--notably Patagonia, which partners with iFixit to help fulfill the lifetime guarantee it offers on all branded gear. "We're really impressed with their ethos," says Nellie Cohen, Patagonia's "worn wear" program manager. In some ways, iFixit is a conventional success story. It's made money, certainly, though not as much as it could have if that had been the main goal all along. One reason its founders stopped applying for inclusion on the Inc. 5000 several years ago, according to Wiens, is they weren't interested in hearing from any more potential investors. "I think we're both scared of the responsibility to grow and make money at all costs that that would bring," says Soules. And already iFixit has had far more impact, in its own industry and beyond, than companies many times its size--remember, it reached 94 million do-it-yourselfers last year, and has trained thousands of technicians scattered across the U.S. "I can't think of anything else as exciting as this or as needed," Wiens says. In a world marked by a huge economic divide, he is convinced--as well as convincing--that iFixit can help make owning technology more affordable while creating opportunities for independent repair shops. Add to that the environmental benefit of throwing less stuff away, and maybe the human benefit of making us all just a little bit happier. One of Wiens's favorite books is Matthew Crawford's Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work. Crawford, a research fellow at the University of Virginia, has an undergraduate degree in physics and a PhD in political philosophy. His book ties all that together with lessons learned in his other career, as a motorcycle mechanic. "We evolved to be tool users," Crawford says. "What people are looking for is that basic experience of individual agency, to see the effect of your own actions and take care of your own shit." That Wiens and Soules have created a booming business that can help with that? Very cool. You gotta fight for your right to repair Eight states are mulling legislation that would thrill iFixit--and anger Apple. The first car I owned was a 1970-something Ford Maverick. When you opened up the hood, it was easy to do whatever you had to do--new plugs, new belts, oil change. Cars today are packed to the gills with circuitry and software. But that doesn't mean they're unfixable by anyone other than the manufacturer, despite what car companies would have us believe. A set of screwdriver heads, waiting to be mounted on an iFixit-branded handle. On their first day at iFixit, new employees are given a desk. There's one catch: They have to assemble it themselves. CREDIT: Shaughn and John Such was the impetus behind Massachusetts's Right to Repair ballot initiative of 2012, which voters approved by 86 percent to 14 percent. It gave car owners and independent repair shops access to the same diagnostic tools, repair manuals, and firmware that licensed dealers have. Now lawmakers in eight states are pursuing legislation that would extend the concept to cover computers, smartphones, and tractors. "Repair is impossible without access and information," says Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of the lobbying firm Repair Association. One such bill was introduced in January by Lydia Brasch, a state senator for a rural district in northeastern Nebraska. She's tired of driving 80 miles to Omaha--to the only Apple store in Nebraska--to get her computer fixed. Her husband, Lee, is a fifth-generation corn and soybean farmer who's had similar issues with his $300,000 John Deere combine. (John Deere, says Gordon-Byrne, is "the Apple of farming.") Apple, which did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story, is not happy with what's happening in Nebraska--and Kansas, Minnesota, New York, Tennessee, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Wyoming. Recently, the company sent a delegation to the state capitol in Lincoln to have a word with Brasch. Apple's lobbyists were "respectful," she reports. They offered to back off if she exempted smartphones. Then they tried to scare her, warning if the bill passed, Nebraska would be "a mecca for hackers and bad actors." But Brasch isn't buying it. "How many billions do you need?" she wonders. "There should be a little piece of the apple for the rest of us to share." If I can do it, you can do it I put one of iFixit's kits to the test, on my busted up old iPhone. My work-issued iPhone 5C worked fine until one day it didn't. The screen fizzed out. No cracks in the glass, just a dense net of wavy vertical lines, rendering the display unreadable. Apple says that its phones should last three years. Mine made it two and a half. By then, the warranty had expired, which might have bothered me if I were paying, but I wasn't. Work sent me a replacement and the 5C went into a drawer, where according to a study sponsored by SellCell.com, a reseller, some $13 billion worth of old cell phones reside. Then I heard about iFixit and I wondered: Could a doof like me really fix my old phone? I was encouraged to learn that the 5C earns a reparability score of six from iFixit, on a scale of one to 10, which isn't bad. (My new Galaxy S6 Edge only gets a three.) And that my specific job, a front panel replacement, involved 32 steps, would require 30 minutes to an hour to complete, and had a difficulty rating of "moderate"--not "easy," but not "very difficult" either. I ordered the full kit, parts, and tools, for $54.95, plus shipping. The first thing I did when my package arrived was watch the six-minute tear-down video on iFixit's website. Then I dove into the illustrated instructions. Step 12, removing the four infinitesimally small Phillips screws that secure the front panel assembly cable bracket to the logic board, caused me the most anxiety. The screws look identical, but they're not. "Accidentally using the 3.25 mm screw or the 1.7 mm screw in the bottom right hole will result in significant damage to the logic board causing the phone to no longer boot properly," I read. I wasn't certain at the time that I hadn't made that mistake. (I recommend clearing off your workspace before you begin; a magnetic mat would have been helpful too.) Still, I persevered. After reinserting the last two "Pentalobe" security screws (Apple nomenclature) that seal the case, I pushed the power button, held my breath, and beheld with pride a glowing screen. My old 5C, good as new. I showed my wife. Then I tossed it back in the drawer. FROM THE APRIL 2017 ISSUE OF INC. MAGAZINE Advertisement

The reason for the later launch may be tied to production problems with the smartphone’s curved OLED display. Report says iPhone 8 shipping in October or November thanks to OLED production issues Sources speaking with China’s Economic Daily News said Apple is having issues with the OLED panel lamination process. They also said the iPhone 8’s 3D sensors may be causing delays. The iPhone 8 is expected to include an OLED display, glass front and back, 3D sensing front-facing camera, and wireless charging support. It may also ditch the familiar Home button for a dedicated touch-based function area on the phone’s screen that includes embedded fingerprint scanning. Seeing the iPhone 8 in October or November would be late compared to Apple’s typical launch cycle, but that doesn’t necessarily mean everyone has to wait for their new phone this fall. Apple could release the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus in September and follow up a few weeks later with the iPhone 8. That means we could still see Apple’s usual September iPhone refresh event with the 7s series models shipping right away and a teaser for the iPhone 8 with the promise that it’s coming soon. New phone parts are usually leaking by now, but so far we aren’t seeing anything purporting to be for the iPhone 8. That’s a sign that either Apple has found a way to completely stop leaks, which isn’t likely, or the iPhone 8 isn’t far enough into production for photos to show up online. If it’s the latter, then an October/November launch window seems more plausible. Considering we’ve already seen reports saying iPhone 8 production is ramping up in September, it’s looking a lot like this model is coming closer to the end of the year.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares.

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career).

If you own a device running Siri, all it takes to get her attention is to utter the phrase "Hey, Siri." But what if there are multiple Siri-enabled devices in the room, and you only want one of them to respond? Or what if you don't own all of those devices? Apple may have a fix for that, and with it introduce a whole new layer of security to iDevices. Patently Apple discovered a patent filed by Apple describing a system where Siri is capable of learning to recognize specific voices. In so doing, Siri could associate a voice and spoken phrase with a specific device such as an iPhone or iPad. Rather than just a helpful assistant, Siri would become a voice biometric and gatekeeper to your gadgets. Related How to Kid-Proof Your iPhone or iPad How to Kid-Proof Your iPhone or iPad If this system ended up being released, we'd likely stop hearing the "Hey, Siri" phrase. Instead, a custom phrase (Apple calls this a "Lexical Trigger") would be chosen to act as your voice password. Siri would have a training process to learn an owner's voice, and the device would remain locked for anyone else attempting to gain access. You may even be able to double up on security, for example, requiring TouchID and a voice command. Siri is always getting smarter, but using it as a voice biometric makes a lot of sense because it's already an established form of interaction for iDevices by millions of people. It can also be expanded to new products with ease. The Apple Watch, MacBooks, Apple TV, and maybe even an Apple Car one day could take advantage of this extra security. Patently Apple points out that the patent application was filed in the second quarter of 2016, so this certainly isn't a new project for Apple. Maybe we'll see it ship with the iPhone 8? But before finalizing the system, I urge Apple to also look into Lip Passwords, which would be a simple addition that adds even more security.

Apple has always had the edge in the past thanks to the thin plastic Samsung used on its phones for the first few years after entering the market, and then the gap narrowed in 2015 when the company finally switched to glass and metal. Now, in 2017, Samsung has stolen the crown with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, which feature a design that puts Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design to shame. Thankfully, Apple has no plans to use the same design a fourth time when comes to the iPhone 8, and now a new video imagines a next-generation flagship iPhone that manages to outshine Samsung’s new smartphones. Don't Miss: How to get free network TV and home phone service for the rest of your life Expectations for the upcoming new iPhone 8 — or iPhone Edition, or iPhone Pro, or whatever Apple ends up calling it — couldn’t be higher. Apple’s tenth-anniversary iPhone is expected to feature a bold new design with an OLED display that takes up most of the front of the phone. The home button will reportedly be removed and replaced with a virtual home button like the one on the Galaxy S8 (but so much better, obviously) and the bezels around the screen are expected to be much narrower than before. Now, a new iPhone 8 concept created for the ConceptsiPhone YouTube account by a graphic designer called “incriptor” images what Apple’s upcoming new redesigned iPhone might look like. The result, though not grounded in reality, is stunning. Some aspects of this iPhone 8 render are probably reasonably close to reality. The general look of the phone is likely close to what Apple is going for, and Apple executive Jony Ive has said on record that his dream is an iPhone that looks like one continuous piece of glass. Where this concept takes a sharp turn away from reality, however, is in its use of displays on the edges and back of the phone. The idea of a small, invisible screen on the back of an iPhone that displays notifications is actually pretty awesome. It’s also not even a remote possibility on the iPhone 8. But hey, it never hurts to dream, so check out the video below.

The reason for this is the decision by Apple to move away from using the company's intellectual property in its products. While this will not happen instantly, it will take place over the next 15 months-to-two years' time. Reliance on one company While the loss of any customer is a significant problem for any business, the loss of Apple as a customer will hit Imagination extremely hard. It contributed over £60m in revenue in the most recent financial year. This works out as roughly half of the company's total revenue. While the loss of half of total sales is clearly bad news, the deal with Apple was associated with minimal direct costs to Imagination. In other words, the vast majority of revenue from Apple was profit. This reliance on one company for half of sales and the majority of profit is not uncommon in business. However, it is somewhat unusual for a major listed company to be so reliant on one entity for the bulk of its sales and profitability. Clearly, it is always easy to criticise in hindsight, but it now seems obvious that Imagination needed to have a more diversified business model. It was running a major risk of losing a key customer, which has now taken place. Investor takeaway Of course, diversification is not only crucial for companies, it is also of great importance for investors. While a portfolio of just a handful of stocks could record stunning capital gains and lead to high potential rewards, risks are also high. Even the most stable of companies with the best track records can endure challenging periods which lead to profit warnings. Therefore, the lesson from Imagination's share price decline is to spread the risk among a number of different stocks. Furthermore, buying shares in a variety of industries and geographies can also be worthwhile. This can help to reduce the overall risk of a portfolio. In addition, buying a range of different types of companies, such as growth, income and value stocks can protect against changes in investor sentiment over a period of time. Looking ahead While Imagination Technologies may be able to launch a legal defence of its patents or else agree a revised payment structure with Apple, the fact is that the company appears to be overly exposed to one business. As such, it does not seem to be an attractive buy given the opportunities which are available elsewhere at the present time. Certainly, the company's shares could mount a comeback, or they could fall further if a profit turns into a loss over the medium term. For Foolish investors, it proves why diversification is a required, rather than a desired, part of successful investing for the long term. Five shares worth buying? Finding shares with attractive risk/reward ratios is never easy.

Supply-Chain Stock This Fool goes over a couple of things you might want to know about this rumored new Apple supplier. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 5, 2017 at 9:45AM This fall, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch three new iPhones, one of which will be a premium variant with an organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, display. In addition to the OLED display -- which promises to deliver better image quality than the liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, that Apple currently uses -- the premium iPhone is expected to pack 3D sensing technology, which DigiTimes says will "enable augmented reality and virtual reality," citing "industry sources." An expected key beneficiary of the inclusion of this 3D sensing technology, according to DigiTimes, is a company called Lumentum (NASDAQ:LITE). Image source: Lumentum. Lumentum isn't a stock that has previously come up with respect to Apple supply-chain rumors and tear-downs. However, if the reports are correct that it will be providing a key technology in Apple's next flagship device, then anybody interested in Apple supplier stocks should know a thing or two about the company. Let's go over three basic facts about Lumentum that investors ought to know. What does Lumentum do? In Lumentum's most recent form 10-K filing, the company says it's a "leading provider of optical and photonic products addressing a range of end-market applications," including data communications and telecommunications networking and commercial lasers "for manufacturing, inspection, and life-sciences applications." Telecom-related revenue made up 61.5% of the company's sales in its most recent fiscal year, with data communications coming in at 18.1%, consumer and industrial hitting just 4.7%, and lasers making up 15.7%. At first glance, it doesn't seem as though this is the kind of company that would be involved in supplying components for Apple's iPhone. However, this sentence makes it clearer (the bolded portion is mine): In addition, we are using our core optical and photonic technology and our volume manufacturing capability to extend into emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide, including 3D sensing for consumer electronics and diode light sources for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. Lumentum later goes on to explain that "consumer solutions containing [its] 3D sensing lasers employ [its] laser technology in mobile, computing, industrial, and automotive applications," noting that its 3D sensing systems "simplify the way people interact with technology and were first used in applications for gaming platforms." Sounds good, but what exactly do these 3D sensing products do? Lumentum explained further in its 10-K filing, saying that this technology allows for "the use of natural body gestures, like the wave of a hand, to control a product or application." Lumentum's revenue and profitability Over the past several years, Lumentum's revenue has been growing, but at a relatively slow pace. The company's revenue was $727.9 million in the year ended June 30, 2012, and was $903 million in the year ended July 2, 2016. That works out to a compound annual growth rate of just 5.54%. Lumentum's operating income trend is also spotty. In the year ended June 30, 2012, it generated negative operating income of $4.5 million. In the following year, it managed to turn an operating profit of $3.9 million, and then in the year after that it raked in $8.7 million in operating profit before seeing an operating loss of $23.4 million in the year after that. The good news is that in its most recent fiscal year, it posted an operating profit of $11.5 million. An operating margin of less than 1.3% isn't stellar, but in fairness, it's better than loss. Lumentum's top customers In its form 10-K filing, Lumentum gave a list of customers that made up more than 10% of its consolidated revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Huawei and Ciena each made up 17.1% of the company's fiscal 2016 sales, while Cisco Systems contributed 13% of Lumentum's total revenue that year. Perhaps if Apple truly is planning to use Lumentum components in the upcoming premium iPhone, which Apple appears to be very bullish on, Apple may soon rise to become one of Lumentum's top customers, if not its top one.  Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned.

 Here's everything from Apple's latest round of updates you'll actually use Lucy Yang, INSIDER Apr. 5, 2017, 11:34 AM 11,157 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stephen Lam/GettyImages The INSIDER summary: Apple recently released new software updates for all of its devices. Some of the new features are more useful than others. You can now track your AirPods, use Night Shift on your Mac, put your Apple Watch in Theater Mode, and fast scroll on Apple TV. Last week, Apple updated all four of its operating systems — iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS — for its devices. Notably, the patch came with a new file system that should help your iPhone and iPad run faster and more smoothly. After having some time to play with the new updates, we've realized there are some cool new tools. In addition to all the storage space you might gain after updating, here are the most exciting features that you'll actually use: Track your tiny AirPods with iPhone's Find My AirPods Apple When the AirPods first came out, the public's response was lukewarm at best — the gadget even became a short-lived meme. One of the biggest gripes: How will I keep track of these tiny new ear buds? With iOS 10.3, you can finally track your tiny AirPods using the Find My AirPods feature in the Find My iPhone app. Now, if your AirPods are out of their case and connected to your iPhone, you'll see their location on the Find My iPhone map. If they're in their case or not connected to your iPhone, you'll see their last known location. Even cooler, if your AirPods are out of their case and somewhere nearby, you can trigger a chirping alarm from the AirPods by tapping "Actions" and then "Play Sound" in the app. Get hourly weather updates — without ever opening the Weather app iDB iOS 10.3 also comes with an exciting new 3D Touch shortcut in the Maps app which you can use to get hourly weather forecasts for the location you're viewing. That's right— you no longer have to open the Weather app and manually enter a location. With summer right around the corner, this time-saving hack will let you take spontaneous beach trips without worrying about getting stuck in a storm. Get a better night's sleep with Mac's new Night Shift feature Apple Night Shift has finally made its way from the iPhone to your iMac and Macbook. The feature, which turns your display from cool- to warm-toned (or from blue to yellow hued), helps reduce eye strain when you're using your computer at night. To set this up, go to "System Preferences" on your iMac or Macbook, click "Displays" and choose the "Night Shift" tab. You can then schedule the Night Shift to turn on automatically from sunset to sunrise, or set your own custom time frame. You can also adjust the warmth of your screen under "Color Temperature." Enjoy movies uninterrupted with Apple Watch's Theater Mode Apple You no longer have to worry about your Apple Watch lighting up in the middle of a movie. It's a small but useful update that'll save you a lot of embarrassment and keep your smartwatch screen dark, even if you get a notification or move your arm in a way that usually lights up the screen. Find your show faster with Apple TV's quick scrolling iDB/YouTube If you're like me, you can't eat until you find just the right show to watch. Luckily, Apple TV's update includes fast scrolling, so you won't have to browse slowly through long lists of shows and movies anymore as your food gets cold. The new update also lets you rent something on one Apple device (say your iPhone) and watch it on your Apple TV. EXCLUSIVE FREE REPORT: 25 Big Tech Predictions by BI Intelligence.

Today, DigiTimes said Apple had asked its suppliers to begin shipping parts for the device in the second half of 2017. The tentatively named Apple Watch Series 3 should be assembled by Compal Electronics, with Quanta Computer taking over production of current models. In other words, existing Apple Watch Series 2 and 1 models should be kept on sale at reduced prices after Apple Watch Series 3 hits. To prepare for Apple Watch manufacturing, Compal has been moving equipment for mass-production of tablet, smartphone and wearable devices from plants in Eastern China to Chongqing since the second half of 2016. “Compal has recently moved equipment for smart device production to plants in Chongqing, preparing for Apple Watch manufacturing, and the orders will help fill the plants’ empty capacity caused by decreasing notebook orders,” reads the report. Compal is the second-largest notebook manufacturer. Just last year, the company assembled and shipped five million wearable and Internet of Things devices to clients. Apple does not report Apple Watch sales, but research firm Canalys estimated that 11.9 million Apple Watch units shipped in 2016, accounting for 49 percent of overall smartwatch shipments. Chinese-language Economic Daily News previously said that new Apple Watch models would get unveiled in the fall of 2017 with battery life and performance improvements. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted Apple Watch Series 3 would include cellular-enabled models, potentially cancelling the need to pair the wearable device with your iPhone. Other rumored features: a design similar to current models and a screen with glass-film panels versus touch-on-lens panels on Apple Watch Series 2. The original Apple Watch, now dubbed Apple Watch Series 0, launched in April 2015.

The update simplifies the user interface to allow for better navigation and makes it easier to find downloaded music that can be played offline. Listeners on Android can now also read the lyrics along with songs as they listen, listen to Beats 1 shows and get For You recommendations for playlists and albums based on their individual music selections. The app is free to download, but requires an Apple Music subscription to function (after the three-month free trial has expired).

Until then, Apple said the model can be created by selecting the 6-core option and using the configure-to-order options to match the 8-core model's upgraded tech specs. Packaging changes are likely the only reason why the 8-core model is currently unavailable as a stock configuration to resellers and customers, given that the base model customized with an 8-core processor and dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs for the same price currently ships in 1-3 business days on Apple.com. Apple adjusted its Mac Pro configurations and pricing yesterday. The former 6-core model with dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs and 16GB of RAM for $3,999 is now the $2,999 base model, while the previously configure-to-order 8-core model with dual D700 GPUs and 16GB of RAM is now the high-end stock configuration for $3,999. Apple listed the new Mac Pro configurations on its online store on Tuesday, but the 8-core model is currently unavailable for customers to order. Apple's website briefly said the 8-core model would be available in "30 business days," somewhat in line with the end of April, but that estimate was quickly removed. Apple has discontinued the previous base model, equipped with a quad-core Xeon E5 processor, dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs, and 12GB of RAM. The bigger news is that Apple said it is working on a "completely rethought" Mac Pro featuring a modular design. The all-new Mac Pro, which won't launch until at least next year, will be Apple's highest-end, highest-throughput system, and it will be accompanied by a new Apple-branded pro-focused external display. Apple also said that it is working on new iMac models that will be unveiled later this year, but it remained tight-lipped about what to expect. It is rare for Apple to pre-announce future products in this manner, but it was a welcomed response to concerns that Apple was no longer focused on professional users. Given that the current Mac Pro still has over three year old hardware, prospective buyers should weigh the price drop against the old tech before purchasing the computer. Some professionals might consider waiting for the completely redesigned and modular Mac Pro launching at some point after 2017. (Thanks, Holden!)

What gets me about the trash can Mac Pro is how they repeated the same mistake made 13 years earlier with the G4 Cube, only this time in such a way that it is much harder to correct. The Cube didn't have the expandability professionals wanted, and on top of that the newer/better G4 internals ran too hot inside the enclosure for it to be practical, resulting in the Cube being discontinued only a year after it was released.

Data collected from technology research firm Creative Strategies reported that 40 percent of U.S. consumers have raised concerns about security risks of adding a credit or debit card onto their iPhone, while more than 60 percent aren't even familiar with contactless payments. While data from a recent Nilson Report noted that Apple Pay's rate of acceptance has "more than doubled since 2015," only a third of stores based in the U.S. have accepted it as a form of payment. Many well-known companies have rolled out support for the service, including Best Buy and Whole Foods, but there remain notable absences from Apple Pay's retail supporter list, namely Target and Wal-Mart. Braden More, the head of partnerships and industry relations at Wells Fargo, asked, "If you can’t use it everywhere, why are you going to switch?" This reticence by consumers to jump in on Apple Pay's launch is said to have permeated within the company surrounding its debut, to the point where Apple executives "were reluctant to promote it." Apple Pay has been noticeably absent from the company's advertising strategy since its launch, with just two Apple Pay-focused commercials being made in nearly three years. Apple expected consumers to embrace Apple Pay as energetically as they did iTunes—an instant hit when it launched in 2003—because executives felt it was faster and safer than existing payment systems, a former employee on the project said. When retailers didn’t support it initially, the person said, Apple executives were reluctant to promote it and invest in retail terminals that would spur adoption. More recently, the company has become less concerned with Apple Pay's slow adoption over the past few years, because it still sees the mobile wallet as a nascent service whose domination over the industry will come with time. "Does it matter if we get there in two years, three years [or] five years?" Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue said in an interview. "Ultimately, no." Cue compared Apple Pay's adoption as faster than other mobile wallets and thinks it could go so far as to replace cash, debit and credit cards as a primary payment system. Until that happens, Apple Pay vice president Jennifer Bailey is working on beefing up the company's retail training so that users aren't more knowledgable of paying with the service than employees. The company is said to be working with retailers to add Apple Pay instructions into work manuals as a way to spread knowledge of the mobile wallet's check-out process. Apple Pay made $30 million for the company in the last fiscal year, accounting for a small portion of Apple's total services business, which made $24.35 billion in total in the same period. While adoption is low and consumer knowledge remains slim, Apple's services business -- which includes iCloud, the App Store, iTunes, and more -- has become a point of focus for the company, so much so that it expects to double its revenue in this area by 2021, Apple Pay expectedly included. For this reason, David Roberts of Nilson said that Apple Pay is right on the cusp of a wider, "ubiquitous" acceptance. Nilson Report publisher David Robertson said that with about a third of U.S. retailers adopting it, Apple Pay is on the cusp of broad acceptance. “It’s going to become so ubiquitous that we will all do it,” he said. Notably, the rest of 2017 is a big year for Apple and Apple Pay, as the year marks the three-year anniversary of Apple Pay, as well as the end of three-year contract agreements that the company made with banks and credit card issuers back in 2014. Apple will begin negotiations to renew these contracts for the next few years, which the company hopes to be a major contributing factor in helping to double its services revenue over the next four years.

Rating: 10 Votes DrewDaHilp1 16 hours ago at 08:04 am The problem isn't with Apple or Apple Pay, I use it whenever I can. It's faster than using a chip card. The problem is with the big retailers not adopting it for their own reasons i.e not being able to track purchases. Rating: 10 Votes ZCT 16 hours ago at 08:16 am In all fairness, American consumers are notoriously slow to adapt to changes in payment methodologies. Contactless and Chip and PIN systems have existed outside of America for well over a decade, yet so many American machines still have a Post It attached to them saying that the chip reader doesn't 'work.' Our banks have kept us in the dark and moved at snails pace to adapt to changes in world banking, and it's pretty sad. After all a piece of VHS tape glued to a plastic card is a bit of a 1980s solution to things. Heck, we're still using Imperial measurements over here, while the rest of the world adopted metric several decades ago. Rating: 9 Votes yelnam 16 hours ago at 08:10 am The problem is that we, the customers, don't know when checking out if ApplePay is accepted. It's a hassle if we try but it doesn't work.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile This iPhone 8 would be so much hotter than the Galaxy S8 Image Source: ConceptsiPhone Zach Epstein @zacharye April 5th, 2017 at 10:27 AM Share Tweet For the first time ever, Samsung will become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world in about two weeks when it comes to smartphone design. Apple has always had the edge in the past thanks to the thin plastic Samsung used on its phones for the first few years after entering the market, and then the gap narrowed in 2015 when the company finally switched to glass and metal. Now, in 2017, Samsung has stolen the crown with the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, which feature a design that puts Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design to shame. Thankfully, Apple has no plans to use the same design a fourth time when comes to the iPhone 8, and now a new video imagines a next-generation flagship iPhone that manages to outshine Samsung’s new smartphones. Don't Miss: How to get free network TV and home phone service for the rest of your life Expectations for the upcoming new iPhone 8 — or iPhone Edition, or iPhone Pro, or whatever Apple ends up calling it — couldn’t be higher. Apple’s tenth-anniversary iPhone is expected to feature a bold new design with an OLED display that takes up most of the front of the phone. The home button will reportedly be removed and replaced with a virtual home button like the one on the Galaxy S8 (but so much better, obviously) and the bezels around the screen are expected to be much narrower than before. Now, a new iPhone 8 concept created for the ConceptsiPhone YouTube account by a graphic designer called “incriptor” images what Apple’s upcoming new redesigned iPhone might look like. The result, though not grounded in reality, is stunning. Some aspects of this iPhone 8 render are probably reasonably close to reality. The general look of the phone is likely close to what Apple is going for, and Apple executive Jony Ive has said on record that his dream is an iPhone that looks like one continuous piece of glass. Where this concept takes a sharp turn away from reality, however, is in its use of displays on the edges and back of the phone. The idea of a small, invisible screen on the back of an iPhone that displays notifications is actually pretty awesome. It’s also not even a remote possibility on the iPhone 8. But hey, it never hurts to dream, so check out the video below.

It also suggests that Apple will continue to offer a choice of two generations of Apple Watch at different price points. Digitimes reports that while Quanta will remain the sole supplier of the new model, a new supplier, Compal Electronics, will be added to the roster to continue production of older models … NordVPN Currently, Apple Watch orders are solely handled by Quanta Computer. The upcoming next-generation Apple Watch, which is scheduled to be released in the second half, will continue to be manufactured by the Taiwan-based ODM; however, production of the existing second-generation Apple Watch will be partially given to Compal. While the company refused to comment, Digitimes noted that it has recently relocated equipment for smart device production. Compal is one of the world’s largest contract notebook manufacturers, and last year shipped 5M wearable and Internet of Things devices. The earlier report suggested that we’ll see little to no change in the external design of the Series 3 Watch, and was also pessimistic about the prospect of major new features, suggesting that performance and battery life would be the main focus. However, one analyst does believe that the company plans an LTE version, allowing a data connection without a companion iPhone. Zac recently outlined the benefits this would bring to the device. In a recent reader poll, around a third of you would pay a premium for a LTE Watch, either through increased purchased cost, an additional carrier subscription, or both.

The Cupertino heavyweight has purportedly reached out to popular television networks HBO, Showtime and Starz with a proposition to sell subscriptions to their channels in a single bundle, Recode reports. While the company already sells the channels individually, the new deal will merely bring them in one package. Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE Unlike standard cable providers that require customers to get a basic subscription before selling them preemo bundles, the Big A wants to offer the bundles as a standalone product and distribute it via iOS and Apple TV. While the iPhone-maker currently sells HBO, Showtime and Starz independently for $15, $11 and $9 a month respectively, it remains unclear how much the new bundle might cost. Apple was previously rumored to be considering offering its own streaming service back in 2015, but things ultimately fell through as the company failed to negotiate acceptable prices with the networks involved. Since then, the Cupertino behemoth has been repeatedly embroiled in original programming speculation. Following reports that the company had briefly discussed buying out Time Warner to ramp up its original content efforts, the Wall Street Journal hinted Apple could bring a new wave of high-quality series – like Westworld and Stranger Things – to its own Apple Music streaming service. Although the rumored bundles won’t introduce any original series, Apple could weigh out whether there’s enough demand to venture into producing its own content in the future.

Supply chain sources are now saying that Tim Cook’s company is scheduled to release the Apple Watch Series 3 in the second half of 2017, and this could mean that the techie timepieces could be unveiled around the same time as the iPhone 8 and other iPhones.  On Wednesday, Chinese newspaper DigiTimes reported about hearing directly from upstream supply chain Compal Electronics that the next-gen Apple Watch is slated for release in the second half. Compal has apparently entered a deal to produce Apple’s second-generation Apple Watch as Taiwan-based Quanta Computer takes the helm in manufacturing the third-generation smartwatch. In 2016, Apple shipped around 11.9 million Apple Watch devices, and the figure is said to account for 49 percent of the Cupertino giant’s overall smartwatch shipments. This year, Samsung’s biggest rival seems to be determined to ship more watchOS-running smartwatches to consumers all over the world.  READ: Galaxy S8+ vs. iPhone 7: Which Has Better Battery Life? While the supply chain did not give a specific date on when consumers can expect the Apple Watch Series 3 to launch, MacRumors says the second half timeline corroborates what Chinese language publication Economic Daily News reported early this year. The news site stated that the next Apple Watch models are expected to be unveiled in the third quarter of this year.  MacRumors pointed out that just like last year, Apple could be introducing the new wearables to the public this September. It can be noted that last year’s Apple Watch Series 2 was launched alongside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September, so the tech giant could be keeping the same timeline for its next releases.  According to latest reports about the next-generation iPhones, however, Apple could be pushing back the release of the smartphones to October or November. Should this turn out to be true, then it’s possible that the company could be holding separate launch events for its new smartwatches and the iPhone 8. SIG analyst Christopher Rolland previously predicted that the Apple Watch 3 could come with a faster processor, cellular connectivity and a bigger battery. Meanwhile, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said the new smartwatch models could have LTE connectivity.  Apple is reportedly unveiling new smartwatch models in the third quarter of 2017.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Michaela Rehle More like this Macs 'do more' than iPads says Apple’s Tim Cook Apple loses its Imagination, will build its own GPU Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell “I would rather compete with Sony than compete in another product category with Microsoft. That’s because Sony has to rely on other companies to make its software. We’re the only company that owns the whole widget–the hardware, the software and the operating system. We can take full responsibility for the user experience. We can do things that the other guy can’t do.” Steve Jobs, 2002. Apple’s “whole widget” approach has become legendary since Steve Jobs described it fifteen years ago, but since the company was stabbed in the back by trusted iPhone partners turned copycats, it has intensified this approach. You got to own it Traditionally, Apple has achieved success by creating unique user experiences. This focus that has served it well, enabling it to carve a highly profitable business in a deeply competitive industry, despite two damaging disasters: Microsoft's alleged attempt to emulate the Mac with Windows; The invasion of the Android UI snatchers. Both events damaged the AAPL bottom line, and both revealed that software patents aren't protection enough. You need to control the primary technology. That’s what the company is trying to do. Apple under Tim Cook makes no bones about this. Cook has been crafting a business built around proprietary tech for a very long time. The move to acquire Beats gave it a majority slice of the headphone market and a powerful service offering (Apple Music); PA Semi and Passif Semi gave it the industry’s best mobile processor; the Authentec, PrimeSense, VocalIQ, LinX, and other key purchases mean many of the components used inside its devices are unique to Apple, which is why competitors can’t support the same deep system level integration. With each investment, Apple becomes harder to emulate. The logic is simple: “if they can copy the software, let's also invent the silicon our software runs on”. That's the significance of control of the primary tech. Pushing things forward Apple isn't shy about this. "Today we do much more in-house development of fundamental technologies than we used to," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said at a February conference. "Think of the work we do on processors or sensors. We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality." The thing is, the nature of business is that third party partners who become successful by working with Apple on key technologies are under shareholder pressure to work with other people too. That's fair enough, but when Apple’s business has become the cash cow for key partners it can easily be argued that Apple’s success helps drive R&D spending that is then used by its competitors.  Tired hacks The tired hacks, fortune tellers and pusillanimous philosophers often criticise Apple's power to innovate. Such cynicism got a boost this week, when Apple admitted it dropped the ball on its professional Mac audience with the Mac Pro.  Reading between the lines I think Apple has changed its plans, because it now realises it needs a Mac Pro with the horsepower to drive the creation of VR, AR, and AI technologies on which it is about to stake its future. Why else has it taken the company three years to realize it needs 18 months to announce something new? That sounds like a strategic change to me, not an error. The HTC Vive is the best shipping VR solution in the world right now. The system depends very much on the support of a powerful PC. This seems to be the model behind VR systems from others. Why would Apple be different? Everything is connected Everything is connected. The wealth of the mass is tied to the greed of the few. Imbalance in this – and in anything else -- has consequences. Through this lens recent Apple announcements both seem to lead in the similar directions. We know an Apple-developed GPU may provide the kind of technological chops to enable Siri to become smarter, as well as delivering the power to drive these “amazing” AR experiences Tim Cook keeps banging on about. We know the Mac Pro may be part of this. And those Mac on ARM rumors just don’t seem to want to disappear. If Apple is now moving gung-ho forward on AR experiences, then it's reasonable to expect company management to try to focus every element of the company's platform on the new tech. We're certainly seeing it's platforms become more focused as part of a whole – the macOS rebranding exercise last year wasn't just cosmetic. From Swift through to Metal, we see each of the platforms begin to share key technologies. Meanwhile development of the A12x chip is no doubt accelerating, only this time helped by the 25 members (so far) of Imagination's developer team Apple has hired in the last few months. Reality distortion That's why when you compare Imagination's news this week that Apple intends ceasing licensing payments within eighteen months with Apple’s announcement that it won’t have a new Mac Pro for between 12-18 months, it's hard to avoid speculating that there may be a connection between those two time frames. What is the nature of the reality distortion the company plans to reveal?  Google+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple?

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares.

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career).

This lets you send cash from your bank account to someone else using Apple’s fast and secure payment service rather than manually entering in and saving your debit card information. Sony A6500 Apple Pay support in Western Union’s iPhone app will be limited to the United States to start then expand to the United Kingdom later this year. Apple Pay payments even works with domestic bill pay in the United States, and Apple Pay cash transfers can be sent to over 200 countries and territories around the world. Western Union says over half of all money transfer transactions using their service are started with the mobile app. Apple Pay support adds another layer of security and convenience which should make the process even easier and safer. In other Apple Pay news, yesterday Starbucks rolled out the ability to send gift cards using Apple’s payment service, and last week Square expanded their Apple Pay readers for small businesses to the UK. Western Union’s iPhone app is available for free on the App Store.

Perhaps, as we learn today from a supply chain report that Compal Electronics has entered Apple's supply chain for Apple Watch and will begin shipping products in the second half of 2017, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.   Currently, Apple Watch orders are solely handled by Quanta Computer. The upcoming next-generation Apple Watch, which is scheduled to be released in the second half, will continue to be manufactured by the Taiwan-based ODM; however, production of the existing second-generation Apple Watch will be partially given to Compal.   Compal is the second largest notebook ODM worldwide and has been aggressively expanding into non-notebook businesses over the past few years. Compal shipped five million wearable and IoT devices in 2016, and the volume is expected to increase to over 10 million units in 2017 with the Apple Watch being a major growth driver, the sources noted.   Apple is estimated to have shipped 11.9 million Apple Watches in 2016, accounting for 49% of overall smartwatch shipments, according to research firm Canalys.   Apple's Tim Cook stated during last Quarter's Financial Conference that "It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. Both units and revenues with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the bestselling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved with higher customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin."   Apple's move to bring on Compal as a second supplier shows that they don't want to be short again during the holiday quarter.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

April 05, 2017 08:45 ET Net Element Launches Apple Pay Support in Russia PayOnline provides merchant support for Apple Pay's rapidly growing mobile acceptor base in Russia MIAMI, FL--(Marketwired - Apr 5, 2017) - Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE) ("Net Element" or the "Company"), a provider of global mobile payment technology solutions and value-added transactional services, today announces that its PayOnline subsidiary has launched Apple Pay support in Russia. According to Apple, Inc., the global number of Apple Pay users is growing at a rate of over one million per week, while transaction volumes are up 500% over the last year. Since launching in Russia on October 4, 2016, the number of Apple Pay users in the country has increased to an estimated 200,000 and continues growing.  As a fully integrated electronic commerce platform, PayOnline is at the forefront of the payments industry in the region and poised for expansion into North America. It is well positioned to capitalize on this growing trend by enabling and supporting mobile and e-commerce merchants to accept Apple Pay. "As the shift to mobile payments continues, PayOnline delivers the necessary support and tools merchants need to make payments a seamless part of online and mobile purchases," says Marat Abasaliev, head of online solutions for PayOnline. "By delivering support to merchants that use Apple Pay, PayOnline demonstrates its ability to meet the growing demand for secure, convenient and quick transactions." Apple Pay gives consumers an easy, secure and private way to pay in stores, within apps, and on websites using the devices they have with them every day. For merchants, accepting Apple Pay is faster and more secure than accepting traditional credit and debit cards since every transaction on the customer's iPhone or iPad requires Touch ID -- a fingerprint identity sensor -- authentication or passcode. In addition, because actual credit or debit card numbers are not disclosed, merchants accepting payments via Apple Pay are not handling sensitive payment information in their systems. About Net Element Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE) operates a payments-as-a-service transactional and value-added services platform for small to medium enterprise ("SME") in the US and selected emerging markets. In the US it aims to grow transactional revenue by innovating SME productivity services such as its cloud based, restaurant point-of-sale solution Aptito. Internationally, Net Element's strategy is to leverage its omni-channel platform to deliver flexible offerings to emerging markets with diverse banking, regulatory and demographic conditions such as UAE, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan where initiatives have been recently launched.

Reuters/Robert Galbraith The iMac 2017 refresh that has long been overdue is finally happening. Apple is set to update its desktop lineup in the coming months, which should satisfy fans that have been sorely waiting for an upgrade. What’s more, the company is adding something new to the mix: pro variants. It has been a while since Apple updated the iMac. The most recent iMac unit was released on Oct. 13, 2015. The company has not really given any clear details about its successor lately, that is until April 4. “We have big plans for the iMac,” said Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller during a recent reporter roundtable at the California-based tech titan’s Machine Shop hardware prototyping laboratory (as quoted by Buzzfeed). “We’re going to begin making configurations of iMac specifically with the pro customer in mind.” This is definitely great news, especially since Apple made good on its promise. Tim Cook, the company’s CEO, previously made it clear that the desktop lineup was still very much on board even though it wasn’t often mentioned. Cook also assured investors during the February shareholder meeting that the Mac maker is focused on its professional customers and declared that fans will see Apple “do more” in the pro area. The company did not disclose specific details about the upcoming iMac Pro 2017 model, but it revealed that it’s not going to feature a touchscreen display. “Touch doesn’t even register on the list of things pro users are interested in talking about,” said Schiller. “They’re interested in things like performance and storage and expandability.” Going pro with the iMac is the right direction for Apple. The move is really not surprising since the all-in-one desktop computer is only second to the MacBook in terms of Mac popularity among the company’s pro users. The tech giant’s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi can attest to that. The iMac has become increasingly more powerful with every upgrade, making it a popular choice for professionals even though it started out as a computer for average Joes and plain Janes. “The iMac has seen an incredible evolution over the past decade,” said Federighi. “The original iMac you wouldn’t have thought of as remotely touching pro uses. But today’s 5K iMac in its top configurations? It’s incredibly powerful. Tasks that previously would have required the Mac Pros of old are now being well addressed by today’s iMac.” RELATED STORIES: Apple iPhone 8 / Edition could have iPad-like pricing due to premium specs Apple Car venture still on-going: Project Titan reportedly operating in low-key fashion with 2021 target Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Banks lose fight on Apple Pay Google Calendar offers Apple OS compatibility with new native iPad version Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 Coal markets in Asia affected 0 Shares 2 Australia steps up measures to detect and deter sharks 0 Shares 3 Large-scale solar projects on the rise 0 Shares 4 MACA preferred tenderer for earthworks project 0 Shares 5 Marine animals perish due to microplastics 0 Shares 6 NBA Trade: Carmelo Anthony could join Damian Lillard, C.J.

How Apple’s 2017 iPhone campaign will work looks a little something like this, according to the latest information: two iPhone 7s models that will look and feel like the current generation iPhone models, just with updated internals, and the iPhone 8 – the new flagship model. TrendForce recently waded in on the rumours, publishing a report about the iPhone 8’s apparent specs as well as how many units it expects Apple to sell in 2017. Apple will sell A LOT of iPhones in 2017/18. This seems to be the general consensus amongst analysts and industry insiders. The reason for this spike in sales, of course, is the design refresh – the iPhone 8 will be the first truly new iPhone in almost three years. Don’t expect these high prices to put off buyers, though. Kate Huberty – an analyst at Morgan Stanley – reckons demand for the iPhone 8 is currently being grossly under estimated. Market watchers predict an upswing in sales of around 10% for 2018, off the back of the the iPhone 8’s release. However, Huberty believes this isn’t right; she believes it will be more like 20% – a far more significant number. I think she is right, too. The release of the iPhone 8 is going to be like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on steroids. “We do not think the super cycle is fully appreciated,” Huberty told CNBC PRO in an exclusive interview. “What we expect in September is a phone that has significant advancements in technology: OLED screens, 3-D sensors, wireless charging [and] likely some more advanced software in the area of artificial intelligence.” Apple fans, loyal as they are, have been patiently waiting for this phone to happen. In true Apple-style, we’ve seen a steady flow of leaked information and details about the phone. All of them are glowingly positive and have helped create a huge buzz around this year’s release. In this respect, it reminds me very much of the run-up to the iPhone 6 launch which was, of course, the last major design change Apple undertook. TrendForce says Apple will produce 100 million next-generation iPhone units, a huge number even by Apple standards. Though this will be the tip of the iceberg for the fiscal year, as it expects Apple to shift around 230 million iPhones throughout the year – a 6% increase on 2016. iPhone 8 Release Date & Launch: September Launch Apple will apparently announce its new iPhone 8 during its customary September slot. Demand for the handset, however, is expected to be massive, meaning there will almost certainly be delays as Apple struggles to meet demand. Word of the September launch date was noted by Mac Rumors, as was the alleged, ACTUAL name of the iPhone 8 which will apparently be called the iPhone Pro. Given Apple’s recent iPad launch event, this name makes a lot of sense. It now has iPad and iPad Pro; MacBook and MacBook Pro; and, finally, once September comes around, iPhone and iPhone Pro. “Suppliers generally had good things to say about the upcoming iPhone 8 launch (for our purposes iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus, and iPhone Pro) as new features drive a more complicated manufacturing process and higher ASPs,” the note says, according to MacRumours. The blog added: “We now believe that all three devices will feature wireless charging and will all be launched in the normal September timeframe, although the majority of iPhone Pro volumes may not be available until Q4.” Bizarrely, Apple is said to be still testing designs for the iPhone 8; apparently it is not quite set on the overall look and feel of the handset. The core new attributes and features will almost certainly be fixed. Apple will likely just be finessing the outer aesthetics of the handset. iPhone 8 – First With AMOLED The iPhone 8 will be the first – and only iPhone in 2017 – to support an AMOLED display. That display will also be 5.8 inches, the biggest iPhone display in history. However, this 5.8in display will fit inside a chassis around the same size has the current generation iPhone 7. How? Simple: Apple’s decision to ditch the Home key on this model left it with A LOT more room to play with on the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8’s display will be a 2K setup with a display ratio that could exceed 2:1, TrendForce suggests. The OLED panel will have a slight curve, but it won't be anything like what we've seen on Samsung's phones. “The curve will be gentler than screens in Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge handsets. This is partly due to the challenges of making curved glass covers to match screens, according to the source,” said Nikkei staff writer Debby Wu. “While the curved screen will allow a viewable area of about 5.2 inches and make the iPhone even sleeker, it will not offer significant new functions" The iPhone 8’s OLED panel is costing Apple quite a bit more than the iPhone 7’s display and this will obviously mean the iPhone is priced higher. A lot higher, most likely, because it won’t just be the display that costs more. Where things get a little more interesting is when you dig down into the components that will make the new iPhone tick. By itself the new OLED panel isn’t that expensive ($15 vs $9 for the one inside the iPhone 7), but it is this alongside other components which hike the cost of making the phone. This is great for Apple’s suppliers, TPK, for instance, is expected to see its margins increase from 11-12% to 22%. But bad for consumers. Why? Simple: Apple loves its high profit margins, so when the price of materials goes up so too does the price of the handset. Hence the $1000 figure being bandied around. This, combined with higher costs for other, intricate components, is why the iPhone 8 will likely retail for $1000+ when it arrives later on this year. The display WILL NOT be curved, the report added, but will feature 2.5D glass on the front just like current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Beyond this TrendForce believes the iPhone 8 will pack in 3GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. Expect to pay $1000+ for this model. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will feature similar sized displays to current models. They will also have the same display resolution, though we’re hoping Apple updates the standard model to 1080p, seeing that it is now 2017. Apple may also kill the difference in spec and performance between the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus models in order to drive adoption of the handsets. TrendForce expects iPhone 8 sales to be off the hook, after three year’s worth of boring updates. I think they might be right. iPhone 8 – First With AR?  Another BIG rumour doing the rounds about Apple’s iPhone 8 is that it will be the first iPhone to feature Apple’s new AR technology. The company, up to now, as been fairly quiet on the AR/VR front, though Tim Cook has said multiple times that he believes AR – not VR – will be the technology of the future. Gene Munster, a relatively well known Apple analyst, claims Apple has over 100 engineers working on AR for the iPhone 8. He also says that this new AR technology will represent a huge paradigm shift in the mobile space that will force all over players to up their respective games considerably. Munster’s claims were also backed by a report in Bloomberg, which notes that Apple is hard at work on an AR technology that will become a central component of its iPhone platform. A pair of AR glasses are also said to be in the product pipeline as well, though these won't likely appear until 2018/19. "Revolutionary" Front Camera - Ming-chi Kuo According to reputable KGI Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo - you know, the one with a near 100% accurate track record when it comes to Apple and iPhone predicitons - the iPhone 8 will feature a "revolutionary" front camera setup. Part of this will incorporate a new 3D sensor, this will apparently work in tandem with the 2D images produced by the camera sensor to create unique "3D selfies"; we're not sure exactly what this means just yet, but it sounds interesting to say the least. This tech will also reportedly be used in the phone's facial recognition features, lending further fuel to the idea of Apple either replacing or supplementing TouchID with facial recognition for unlocking the phone, remote payment, and in-app or online purchases via Apple Pay. Apple also owns Israeli tech firm RealFace, which is apparently at the forefront of this tech and even has facial scanning that can discern the differences between identical twins. "Sensors used in the new camera will be able to perform depth of field calculations using a dedicated Infrared transmitter and receiver," reports PhoneArena. The camera sensor will be a Sony module, while the infrared components will be supplied by Foxconn Sharp. "IR signals are sent out from the phone, and then are bounced off objects and are detected using the 1.4MP IR receiver. The report adds that Apple will add 3D sensing rear-facing cameras in 2018 models and beyond. This would allow Apple to get rid of the large dual-camera system found on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus. With Apple well ahead of Android in 3D camera algorithms, according to the KGI analyst, the new technology could be unique to the iPhone for some time." Too Expensive?  If you’re running an older handset and have been patiently waiting to see what Apple comes up with inside Q4, you might want to consider an alternative approach – buying the iPhone 7 or iPhone 6s instead. Why? Simple: reconditioned, you can pick one of the top tier models up for around 40% cheaper than buying a handset brand new. Reconditioned means the handset isn’t new, but because they’re “certified” at places like Gazelle it means they look new. And if something LOOKS new who cares if it's not?  I discovered “reconditioned phones” a couple of years ago when, eager to get out of the contract-loop, I decided to pull the trigger on a reconditioned iPhone 5s, as it was a lot cheaper than a new one (this was when the iPhone 6 had just come out). The handset was great, worked perfectly, felt as good as new, and it only cost me $350. And that meant no more contracts. Nowadays, you can pick up the iPhone 6s Plus 128GB for $529 (down from $949 RRP for a new one). Similarly, move back a generation to the still-excellent iPhone 6 Plus and you’re looking at even bigger savings – around $359 for 128GB iPhone 6 Plus model. Granted, the reconditioned route isn’t for everybody. But if you’re in the market for an iPhone with high storage and you don’t want to pay the best part of $900 or lock yourself into a contract until 2019 then it is definitely worth a look.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Gabor Balogh Why ditching Imagination is critical for the iPhone’s future Chris Smith @chris_writes April 5th, 2017 at 8:47 AM Share Tweet British company Imagination Tech announced earlier this week that Apple will stop using its graphics processing unit at some point in the following two years. Imagination stock tanked almost immediately, with the news wiping more than £500 million from the company’s market capitalization. Apple stayed quiet, but the confirmation that it’s developing its own GPU for the iPhone is probably the best iPhone news we got all year. Apple may be getting ready to revolutionize mobile GPUs just as it did with mobile CPUs a few years ago. The move is crucial for the future of the iPhone and maybe even the Mac. Don't Miss: NASA’s Cassini spacecraft is about to attempt something truly insane Apple can both drop manufacturing costs for the iPhone and accelerate innovation by designing its own graphics chips for the iPhone. Analysts who talked to Reuters explain that Apple is looking to reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers of critical iPhone components. The GPU is one such component, especially considering that Apple is preparing to launch its first devices that will support augmented (AR) and virtual reality (AR). One of the first hints that indicated Apple is getting more serious about the iPhone’s graphics performance was the announcement of Metal. “By promoting Metal instead of relying on other existing standards, Apple is not only able to control what graphics chip functionality is exposed at its own pace but also blur the line for developers between coding for desktop and mobile GPUs,” VR startup Ether’s founder Pius Uzamere said. More recently, Apple CFO Luca Maestri also talked about the importance of controlling the essential technologies that can give the iPhone an edge over the competition. “Today we do much more in-house development of fundamental technologies than we used to,” he said at in February at a conference. “Think of the work we do on processors or sensors. We can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality.” Maestri did not disclose any specifics related to Apple’s move to replace Imagination chips with its own designs. But, in case it wasn’t clear enough already, timing, cost control, and product quality are key elements for Apple. The recent suit filed against Qualcomm is one other indication that Apple wants to keep costs down when it comes to critical iPhone components. The incoming iPhone 8 is expected to be even more expensive than any of its predecessors, as Apple is getting ready to introduce new technologies never seen before in iPhones. Some of the cost will be passed down to buyers, but Apple’s iPhone margin might also take a hit. Producing its own graphics chips may be one way to keep cost down while significantly enhancing performance. After all, we’re just getting started with AR and VR, and Apple probably wants the iPhone to be part of this next-gen tech revolution. And who knows, a direct side-effect of Apple designing its own GPU might be felt over on the Mac in the coming year, a platform that’s closely connected to all of Apple’s iPhone dreams.

The timeline matches a Chinese-language Economic Daily News report that claimed new Apple Watch models will be unveiled in the third quarter of 2017, aka fall, with battery life and performance improvements. Apple Watch Series 2 models and slightly upgraded Series 1 models launched in September alongside the iPhone 7, so it is reasonable to assume that Series 3 models could launch in September as well. The original Apple Watch, now dubbed Series 0, launched in April 2015. In addition to a faster processor and longer battery life, cellular connectivity has been a long-rumored addition to the Apple Watch, and SIG analyst Christopher Rolland believes LTE capabilities could be included in Series 3 models. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also said LTE could be added as early as 2017. With a cellular connection, Apple Watch owners would not need a paired iPhone nearby to do things like make phone calls or stream Apple Music content, but a separate data plan from a carrier would likely be needed. Apple is also expected to switch to a glass-film touchscreen this year in place of the current touch-on-lens solution, but it is unclear if this change would have any obvious consumer-facing benefits. The overall design of the Apple Watch has not changed since the original models launched in April 2015, but one report yet to be substantiated claims Series 3 models will have few if any significant hardware changes. Apple has instead introduced new bands each season to offer a fresh look and feel. Few other details are known about the next Apple Watch at this point, and no parts have leaked from the supply chain yet. Apple has filed patents for a number of ideas that could eventually be included in an Apple Watch, such as a heart rate identification system, modular bands, haptic feedback band, and a band with a built-in charger. More significant health and fitness features could be added pending further FDA approvals. Quanta Computer is expected to remain the primary manufacturer of the Apple Watch, with some production reportedly shifting to Compal Electronics.

Rating: 5 Votes Zorn 17 hours ago at 07:03 am Ugh, this LTE-on-a-watch obsession frustrates me so much. These things already have garbage battery life - that needs to be improved, not made worse. It's such an absolute fringe case to need to make phone calls on your watch without having your phone anywhere nearby. I'm sure there are a few marathon runners or Olympic athletes that will probably appreciate being able to wear short shorts without a phone in the pocket, but mainstream users do not want a heavier, chunkier watch that has 40% less battery to accommodate an LTE radio they will never use, and have to pay an extra monthly carrier fee for.

A fresh report has cropped up claiming that Apple may delay the launch of the iPhone 8 to October or November due to “issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels”. Furthermore, a separate report refutes all reports of iPhone 8 costing more than $1,000, and states that it could cost less than that. Economic Daily News (via Digitimes) reports that the iPhone 8 may be delayed due to “technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels, and the adoption of a 3D sensing system.” This is slightly different from an early report that said that the iPhone 8 may come in limited quantities when launched in September, and full-fledged availability could be delayed until the end of the fourth quarter. The iPhone 8 is also expected to be called the 'iPhone Edition' – taking cue from the Apple Watch series calling its most premium line Apple Watch Edition. If you remember, the Apple Watch supply was also delayed till much later even though it was unveiled in September, and Apple may be forced to do the same this time around. Apple has reportedly ordered 70 million OLED display panels from Samsung, its exclusive dealer for OLED this year, and Samsung is said to be preparing for 90 million just in case. Thus, supply of components is not really the problem, and ‘technical issues’ are really to be blamed. In any case, because of all these radical changes, the iPhone 8 is reported to cost north of $1,000. This is mainly because the cost of production for the iPhone 8 will go up, and Apple looks to keep its profit margin intact. The high cost can be attributed to the OLED displays as they are much more expensive than the LCD displays. However, a fresh investor note from UBS analyst Steven Milunovich published by CNBC suggests that the iPhone 8 could be priced starting $850 to $900 (roughly Rs. 55,100 to Rs. 58,400). Milunovich claims that the factory cost of the 64GB iPhone 8 will be $70 to $80 (roughly Rs. 4,500 to Rs. 5,100) higher than the iPhone 7s Plus model, which brings him to the above mentioned prices. Furthermore, the analyst believes that the iPhone 8 will account for 45 percent of shipments during the fiscal 2018, which is significant in number. Milunovich also says that while the Galaxy S8+ will be much larger in display size, Apple’s iPhone 8 will come with exclusive features like a ‘3D front camera, embedded fingerprint sensor and higher quality facial recognition’ to improve its weightage in the market. The iPhone 8 is expected to introduce wireless charging, waterproofing, a front 3-D sensor camera, and no Home Button.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Dubai News Reveals another Apple Store under Construction that will have a Spectacular View of Dubai Fountain | Main | Apple's High-End iPhone 8 Shipping Date may be slightly pushed out to Mid-Q1 for Technical or Strategic Reasons » April 04, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals a New Security Feature Coming to Siri   Recently the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that revealed a new security feature coming to Siri. While it sounds very simple, this new feature could actually pack quite the punch in that it could be extended to a whole host of future devices. Today we have passwords we type in and Touch ID. In the future, we may also have facial and voice recognition. You may have a vocal password that also carries an audio footprint. Technically it's Voice Biometrics, a feature that's not associated with Siri today. In the future, if Siri doesn't recognize the voice of the owner of the device, accessing Siri or the computer associated with it will be impossible.   Patent Background   Intelligent automated assistants (or digital assistants/virtual assistants) provide a beneficial interface between human users and electronic devices. Such assistants allow users to interact with devices or systems using natural language in spoken and/or text forms.   Up until now when a digital assistant has been invoked with a voice command, the digital assistant is responsive to the speech itself, not to the speaker. Consequently, a user other than the owner of the electronic device is able to utilize the digital assistant, which may not be desirable in all circumstances.   In addition, due to the prevalence of electronic devices and digital assistants, in some circumstances a user may provide a spoken user request to the digital assistant associated with their electronic device, and several other electronic devices in the room would respond unintentionally.   Training Siri to Know your Individual Voice   Apple's invention provides a method to train Siri to know the voice of the owner of the iDevice before responding to a command. Apple's patent FIG. 8B noted below illustrates a process for recognizing a speaker to invoke a virtual assistant.   Today a user will say "hey Siri" and Siri will respond. In the future, the command to call up Siri may be customized to your voice. For instance, a user sets up Siri to recognize the phrase "Hey there, Boss." The customized phrase and the voice must match what's in Siri's database before the digital assistant will respond. The customized phrase is technically referred to in Apple's patent filings as a "Lexical Trigger."   Today if your phone is left at your office desk unattended, someone may still be able to access Siri even if they can't get into your system because you've secured it with Touch ID.   In the future, in order to access Siri, a person will have to know a passcode, use a fingerprint or be recognized by the system via face recognition. Unless your iDevice recognizes you on multiple security levels, Siri will remain unresponsive to commands or requests.   In the future, your Apple TV may only respond to specific users within a household. This way children or teens won't be able to make big purchases or rent movies because Siri can't be engaged and it won't let anyone make a purchase.   You can imagine this kind of security eventually being applied to your vehicle or your home doors in the future. If Siri isn't greeted with the right lexical trigger or doesn't recognize you as the owner of the car, it will fail to start, period. If it's part of home automation, your home door may not open even though someone may have the key.   Apple's patent pending invention is quite simple and yet it packs an interesting punch by delivering a new layer of security for future iDevices, Macs and beyond.   Apple's patent application was filed back in Q2 2016. Considering that this is a patent application, the timing of such a product to market is unknown at this time.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Net Element Launches Apple Pay Support in Russia PayOnline provides merchant support for Apple Pay’s rapidly growing mobile acceptor base in Russia MIAMI, FL – (NewMediaWire) – April 05, 2017 – Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE) („Net Element” or the „Company”), a provider of global mobile payment technology solutions and value-added transactional services, today announces that its PayOnline subsidiary has launched Apple Pay support in Russia. According to Apple, Inc., the global number of Apple Pay users is growing at a rate of over one million per week, while transaction volumes are up 500% over the last year. Since launching in Russia on October 4, 2016, the number of Apple Pay users in the country has increased to an estimated 200,000 and continues growing.  As a fully integrated electronic commerce platform, PayOnline is at the forefront of the payments industry in the region and poised for expansion into North America. It is well positioned to capitalize on this growing trend by enabling and supporting mobile and e-commerce merchants to accept Apple Pay.  „As the shift to mobile payments continues, PayOnline delivers the necessary support and tools merchants need to make payments a seamless part of online and mobile purchases,” says Marat Abasaliev, head of online solutions for PayOnline. „By delivering support to merchants that use Apple Pay, PayOnline demonstrates its ability to meet the growing demand for secure, convenient and quick transactions.” Apple Pay gives consumers an easy, secure and private way to pay in stores, within apps, and on websites using the devices they have with them every day. For merchants, accepting Apple Pay is faster and more secure than accepting traditional credit and debit cards since every transaction on the customer’s iPhone or iPad requires Touch ID — a fingerprint identity sensor — authentication or passcode. In addition, because actual credit or debit card numbers are not disclosed, merchants accepting payments via Apple Pay are not handling sensitive payment information in their systems. About Net Element Net Element, Inc. (NASDAQ: NETE) operates a payments-as-a-service transactional and value-added services platform for small to medium enterprise („SME”) in the US and selected emerging markets. In the US it aims to grow transactional revenue by innovating SME productivity services such as its cloud based, restaurant point-of-sale solution Aptito. Internationally, Net Element’s strategy is to leverage its omni-channel platform to deliver flexible offerings to emerging markets with diverse banking, regulatory and demographic conditions such as UAE, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan where initiatives have been recently launched.

Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements can be found in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed by Net Element with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

He even apologized to the people out there who might be bummed that Apple hasn’t upgraded the Mac Pro in the last several years. Schiller says that Apple is going to come out with something great to replace the current Mac Pro. It seems Apple has realized that with the Mac Pro they focused more on clever design that actual usefulness for the pro users the machine was aimed at. Apple fans in the professional world have also been more than a bit upset that Apple discontinued that external display that many pro users used along with their desktop computers. That failing will be addressed as well with a new external display in the works according to TechCrunch. The rub for Mac Pro and Mac display fans is that none of these new products will land this year. That is a bummer considering we aren’t even out of the first quarter of 2017 yet. The only thing we will see this year will be a bump in the performance of the existing computer, presumably with new processors of Kaby Lake or other flavors. Schiller also gave up some details on sales of Apple computers, something Apple is typically very mum on. According to Schiller Apple sells a ratio of 80% notebooks to 20% desktops. MacBook Pro notebooks are selling very well with 20% growth for fiscal Q1 year over year. Schiller notes that a single digit percentage of Mac customers use the Mac Pro and because of that Apple is completely rethinking the Mac Pro. What we know so far is that the new Mac Pro will be modular, presumably to allow for upgrades easily down the road. This is something Apple has lost out on greatly against Windows machines that are easily upgradeable in all aspects.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple Developing Its Own iPhone GPU to Have Greater Control of Its Products By Omar Sohail Apr 3, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit For the longest time, Apple has relied on Imagination Technologies’ high-end PowerVR GPUs to deliver the impressive scores you see in benchmarking runs as well as the fluid gameplay in graphically intensive gaming apps. However, it looks like the run of that beautiful partnership might come to an end as the California-based tech giant is looking to exert greater control over its mobile devices by developing its own graphics processors. Nearly 50 Percent of Imagination Technologies’ Revenue Comes From Apple – Company Believes That iPhone Maker Cannot Come up With Its Own GPUs Without Infringing Patents If future iPhones come with Apple’s own GPUs, it would be a massive blow for the mobile GPU designer as it would not receive any royalties from any iPhones or iPads that are produced, most likely starting from next year. There were also rumors that Apple was contemplating a takeover of the British chipmaker, but it looks like the talks did not proceed well. Related Apple Equipping Its Macs With ARM Processors or Touchscreens Is Still a Distant Dream Coming to the matter at hand, even if Apple successfully manages to produce its own graphics processor for the iPhone and iPad, Imagination Technologies is under the impression that the tech giant would not be able to come through without infringing upon the latter’s patents, as stated below. “Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (“GPUs”) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs, and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology. Advertisement Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it.” Most of you might not know this, but the GPU present in both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a custom PowerVR GT7600 which is the as the chip present in Apple’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus. The company’s A10 Fusion is significantly faster, but there were minimized developments from the GPU side. Related Apple Could Delay Its iPhone 8 to October or Even Later, According to Latest Report That being said, it is possible that Apple introduces a more efficient and powerful iteration of GPUs with each iPhone release, separating the successor from its predecessor by a huge margin. Do you guys think that the company will be able to pull this off? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

Apple Music for Android updated to v2.0 with a redesigned user interface Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/04 12:02pm PDTApr 4, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Applications News Apple Music doesn't have the best reviews in the Play Store. Some of that is clearly because Apple, but there were also some legitimate issues with the app that earned it mediocre reviews. In today's v2.0 update, Apple has reportedly addressed some of them with a revamped user interface. The v2.0 update seems aimed at making the Apple Music app less cluttered. Here's the changelog. An all-new design brings greater clarity and simplicity to Apple Music: Now Playing. Read lyrics for songs as you listen. Library. Navigate your music easily and see the Downloaded Music you can play offline. For You. Get recommendations for playlists, albums, and more—based on music you love. Browse. Listen to new music first, plus playlists for any mood or activity. Radio. Tune in to Beats 1 shows or listen to stations for any genre. The updated build seems to get to the point in each screen. There's less scrolling and fewer menus. It also looks a bit more like iOS, and is reportedly faster than the old version. There are some screens of the old version below for comparison. Apple Music costs $9.99 per month for an individual membership, but there's a three-month free trial for new users if you want to check it out.

I have a work iPhone and it offers tons of nothing of value in all areas of my life in comparison to Android and others offerings such as Spotify and Pandora. Sruly J To get whatever extra business they can get. Andrew Palmer What a stupid question. SyCoREAPER What a stupid answer. Shame-sung C.E.O It's to make Insecure Android users like your self feel upset. Because choices are great. Spotify is far more superior then Google Play and not as good as Apple Music. but still good. The answer you need to "Google Search" is Capitalism . SyCoREAPER You're just mad that I shit all over your Tizen comment in another thread. Go home and cry some more that your failed fanboy OS didn't take off. Shame-sung C.E.O You mean the one i set fishing line and i caught a moron? Tizen is a joke = Garbage. Thus you got all butt hurt and wrote a stupid reply. Way to get dragged! LMFAO!!! Another fail reply. Suicide_Note I'd love to use Spotify more, but until they remove the cap on how many combined artists/albums/songs you add to your library (i think it's around 10,000), then I'll stick with Play Music. SyCoREAPER Your blocked not for being a troll but being bad at it. Enjoy your pathetic life of harassing others. Shame-sung C.E.O You know you lose when you make up excuses to block anyone. Blocking someone is the ultimate way to say "Your right and i'm wrong so im scared and i will block you now" LMFAO! AbbyZFresh Let's ask the 10+ million Apple Music users on Android why they made their choice hmmm. tim242 Those aren't users... cdotlawrence Here's the thing: Apple Music I think is easiest for getting your own music on your phone. Student discount is great and 100,000 song library? Hugely underrated Google Play Music is ok. Let's you have good size library, but no student discount and app can be painfully cluttered and complicated. Spotify is clean. Not an amazing design, but prolly best. Have some great music discovery features. The best. And student rate is great. But 10,000 song limit has been and still is a deal breaker. Oh and you CAN upload your own music but it's not easy and often doesn't work too well tim242 Apple Music has 20 million users. Do you really believe half of those are on Android? C'mon! Abhishek Saral No Spotify in India. Apple Music cheapest in the world in India. Just 2$/mo. More songs. Beats 1. Why not to subscribe to Apple Music? SyCoREAPER That is a valid comment unlike the other clowns (exception being Sruly J) below. Interesting in cost difference Abhishek Saral It's 1$/mo for me with Student Discount. LOL SyCoREAPER Thank you for providing some valuable and interesting input. Mitul Vohra dude is there a way to verify other than institute email? i don't have one. Abhishek Saral No man I don't think so. It verifies using Unidays and requires a .edu email id. If your university doesn't give you an email then it might not be possible. demarcmj For the same reason Google has apps on iOS. SyCoREAPER I didn't mean exclusively why is it on Android, but why choose it when there tons of options available (which Abhishek Saral gave a valid example why) I would also ask the same of why Google apps are on iOS. And I know why, but it's the principle demarcmj "but why choose it when there tons of options available" There aren't "tons" of mobile OSes, and there aren't any with as many users as Android. SyCoREAPER What the Jesus on a Dinosaur are you talking about? There is Pandora, Spotify, Google Music, Tidal, Groove, Slacker, the list goes on. demarcmj Misunderstood what you were saying. I thought you were saying why choose Android when there are tons of options. I was trying to tie it back to your original question "why are there Apple Apps for Android." Because users. That is the answer. brian. I would say that perhaps Apple is using it as a sort of experience with apps for Android. If it is something they can make money doing, then I would say that's a good reason to do it. In this case, it is more practical since it can make money on whatever platform. Obviously Google and Apple have different business models but with Apple Music like Google Apps, the more users the better. SyCoREAPER It just blows my mind that they allow it. Kind of like how Amazon doesn't allow Google Play and Google Play doesn't allow Amazon appstore. Especially since Apple is the epitome of everything wrong with this world sueing everyone for everything. brian. Well, I don't really mind your opinion of Apple, but why not have Apple Music on the Play Store? It just makes the Play store more robust. I am also not sure though, but is Google Play Services required for Google Play music? tim242 Google Music is available for iOS, so no Play Services required. brian. Yes, I realize that Google Play Music is on iOS, which does not have Google Play Services. However, Google Now functionality is on iOS but does require Google Play Services to work. (edit: ...on Android) tim242 I think that is for the extra features of Now on Android. They put a stripped down version on iOS. I can't think of anything missing from Google Music on iOS. But, I could be wrong on that brian. Correct, but that could be because of Google Play Services. You cannot set reminders of phone alarms using Google Now on iOS. Siri obviously takes that job. But it's the same with Google Play Music, you can use Google Now to play music from Google Play Music (I read that it finally works with Google Assistant). That could require Google Play Services. My question is, does it? If it does, that answers the question as to why you can get the app on Amazon's tablets. Nathan J Because while fanboys and fangirls rage against "iSheep" and "fandroids," in the real world, Apple and Google work well together in a number of ways. iOS only runs on something like 15% of smartphones, with Android running on about 85%, so Apple of course wants to reach those people. They might feel the hardware they produce is superior to that of Samsung, LG, HTC, Motorola, and the others, but they're not about to leave money just sitting on the table. The better question might be why there are Android apps on the iPhone, but the answer to that is that Google deals in information gathered from apps and services, not hardware. Letting iOS users use Google services is just good business for them. Ome Dries Not that I am subscribed to Apple Music, and am in a position to judge. But it seems to have gotten worse, it seems a bit amateurish now . dcdttu From what I understand, you can't even cast. I don't know if they have plans to ever allow it, either. vmxr at least they respect global users and offered their app to them unlike google music or microsoft groove which is limited to specific countries dcdttu This is literally the only product that Apple offers on non-iPhones. Google Play Music is on both platforms *and* web. So I guess it all evens out? vmxr no they are not, i can't get google music subscription i don't even get the chance to use google music as local music player because its not available, on the other side i can get apple music subscription and the music player on my android, ios and windows :) Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Jay Considering GPM is less than 60 countries, where as Apple at least offers it 95 percent of the markets it operates in AND does country sensitive pricing i.e. 2 dollars in India, i would take them over it. I will even deal with iTunes for it, at that pricing. Though i got access to spotify, i have been trying it out again since my sub there expired (tend to purchase yearly ones) and find it just fine for my needs for now. Malhaar Kale But it censors music tracks. (At least when I had checked it last time). Genuine question - have they stopped doing it? Jay It has full support for explicit music in India now, for a while. Malhaar Kale That's amazing. Wasn't aware Loved FYI, Even Google play music offers the same 2$/ Album in those same price sensitive areas like India. Apple music is no better Roh_Mish Apple music has subscription for streaming here. Play music doesn't. Jay Which has little to do with the topic in hand. Your FYI is kinda wasted since i live here in India and already knew that. We were talking about streaming networks here and GPM does not offer streaming as an option in India yet. Loved Good to know Samarth Well, since there's no Spotify in India, my circle and I are completely satisfied with Apple Music. This update makes the app fast and very friendly. Sundeep I'm in the same boat. Spotify release already dammit! Carson Saldanha Not Play Music? Samarth Nope. Not available. Carson Saldanha Says here that it is: https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/google-play-music-india/ Is the subscription service not available? Jay Nope and it says so in the article you linked itself. While the Play Music store has launched, there are some caveats. It doesn’t include the Spotify-like ‘All Access’ streaming service and there’s no radio or podcasts yet. mrjayviper that's a huge market to ignore! looking at you Google/Spotify Jay God knows why! They have movies, books and even offer albums for sale, but streaming? 404 logic not found Suicide_Note Personally, i think the old version looks better than the new one. brian. As an iPhone user, I must agree with you. This is why I use a 3rd party music app. The good thing about Apple Music on iOS is that it plays nice with 3rd party music apps. Add something to your Apple Music library, and it will show up on the 3rd party app too. On Android, you don't get that option. That's a big bummer. If someone is using Android, I don't think they can go wrong using either Spotify or Apple music. tim242 Google Music all the way. Best value, since you get YTR included. brian. You're right, it's a great value! I don't need YTR because of my habits. Plus I'm still on Student Discount prices for Apple Music, so it's half price. Also, if I need to use ad-free youtube videos, Safari supports and adblocker and there's a work around to get audio only using the Safari browser and control center. It's kind of a pain, but I don't use it often. Nathan J Safari-only ad blockers (I forget what they're called) are okay, but AdBlock blocks all the ads. It's like $1.99 though, but worth it. P. Sherman "This service is not available in your country." Screw Google, man. Jay So much of this. GPM is pretty much dead for most areas. VAVAMk_2 I love Spotify but man is YouTube Red nice. Kamran Mackey Uh, hell no. Spotify is king in the music streaming world and that's been proven over and over again. YouTube Red means almost nothing, and it's available in what, like maybe three countries? Google needs to seriously get their shit together. tim242 I'm blocking you. Nathan J Spotify has licensing fragmentation issues. Maybe it's not as serious as Google Music and YouTube Red, but let's not pretend that Spotify doesn't have regional issues at all. They definitely do. Nathan J To clarify this, some third-party music apps are just frontends for Apple Music/iTunes. They just access the iTunes library. That's it. TinyPlayer and Spotify are two music players that don't access the iTunes library. The iOS file system is locked down and user data is sandboxed by app, but there are a couple of data stores apps can request permission to read. The ITunes library, and the camera roll. The former is read only, while the camera roll can be written to. brian. Correct. What I am trying to get at with 3rd party music apps on iOS, is that they do give you access to your Music "folder" on iOS. I know you cannot write to it, but it does allow you to use Apple Music, and not have to go through the trouble of using the Apple Music UI, which I don't like. That's one of my biggest gripes about music on iOS, you can just plop in some music and it just reads. Apple Music on iOS, Google Play Music, and Spotify are all restricted as well on Android. Use the apps or your out of luck. George Byers The only time I see people using Apple music on Android is because they got it for 6months free with a new contract with a carrier in the UK called EE... TFN I used it because i recently bought an iPad (Sorry android tablets are :/ ). The Apple music app on iOS was decent but was always crashing and sluggish on my android. After the three month trial i quit and went half price student on Spotify. No regrets with cross platform control brian. I was doing research on the student discount. It looks like Spotify offers it for 1 year, or 2 years... I can't quite remember. Apple Music will give it to you for 4 years, and on an iOS device, it plays well with 3rd party music players, so you're not bound by the Apple Music app. If you have an Android phone, however, it doesn't. But hey, choice! Whatever best suits you. Jayson Stephenson Still better than Google Play Music. Brian Demodulated Why? brian. I'm not going to say which is better. I'd say they're both bad. On iOS, I don't use the default music app so I haven't had much experience with that. When using an Android phone, I used Apple Music briefly if I wanted to listen to something I didn't have on me at the time. But Google Play music is a mess. I hate the artist selection view, which is how I navigate through all my apps. PowerAmp has been my go to for Android, especially now they enabled sorting by Album Artist. SyCoREAPER Agree that PowerAmp is king but without streaming it put's it into a different category brian. You are correct, I would say it's not equal to Apple Music or Google Play Music. This is because of my use case; I understand other people have different ways of using an app for music. Most of my music is owned and local, so I don't have a huge need to stream everything. Just certain things from time to time. In the way of just playing and finding the music you want, PowerAmp is much better than both Apple Music and Google Play Music. VAVAMk_2 Power Amp is great for locally stored music. Brian Demodulated I agree that GPM could use a better browsing interface. However, I love their streaming service, especially because I can stream my own uploaded music as well as their subscription library with the same app. I either stream while I'm on the go, or I decide in advance which albums to download and can browse easily if I only show downloaded albums. tim242 /s P. Sherman Yes. Especially since GPM is NOT AVAILABLE in my country to begin with. It's absolutely shameful. Claude Gohier Needs Chromecast support. Carson Saldanha LOL GOOD. LUCK. Claude Gohier I know. But meanwhile, not interested. chandrizzle Android Auto would be nice too Dirk Reminds me of Zune, EcE Serious question. Other than the service not being available in X or Y country, why would anyone use it instead of Spotify, Play Music or any of the rest? Is it any better at anything? Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher Maybe a recent iOS convert needs their play lists... brian. Preference, and new Android converts for iOS. I would also say that Beats 1 and perhaps people like the UI better. I'm not saying any of these are what I prefer, but those could be reasons. Either way, options are good. EcE Hopefully someone that uses it will answer. I see pricing is similar to Spotify. I hate Spotify's new "listening on" feature. It's really buggy. But reading the comments here, the lack of casting is a big no for me. I'd go through the trial but I'm too lazy to give them my cc info. brian. My suggestion is download Apple Music and use it with local music you may have on your phone. If the UI isn't your preference, delete it. gpatrick15 I use it because I like the interface and the selection of playlists better. It brings what I want to my attention better than Spotify. I only got it when I had a brief stint with an iPhone, but I kept it after moving back. Conversely, my wife, who's more hands on in her music selection, uses Spotify on her iPhone. Another selling point to me is that anything currently in my iTunes library is made available to stream on my phone. So when listening to mixtapes and singles that may not be on Apple Music, I can just download them to my iTunes library and they'll sync over. To my knowledge Spotify doesn't offer that, but I know Google does. EcE Thanks for the input Brian Demodulated The 3 month free trial is a good reason to use it at least for a while. abazigal Differing music selection. If you want Taylor swift for example, Spotify is out of the question. Apple Music is also more integrated with Apple devices and services (Siri integration on ios devices, and there is no Spotify service for the Apple TV), but I am not sure how relevant that is for android smartphone owners. DaveCXT One reason could be family sharing... that's really the only reason we considered it since my wife is on iPhone she preferred Apple Music. And we might have stuck with it except for lack of Chromecast support (casting to chromecast, or our AndroidTv) and the BIG turn off for me was that Apple Music didn't rotate with phone horizontal in a car mount. I don't know if they fixed that or not. She finally settled and started using Play Music subscription, and now we get the family sharing for YouTube Red, Apps, Movies etc. That outweighed her familiarity with Apple Music and saved playlists. Jay Costing? Here in India it's 3 dollars a month for the family share option. I have my family on it, with a mix of pixel, samsungs and iPhones. disqus_mrEZ1BWwek Anyone know why it says this version isn't compatible with my device (OnePlus 3)? SpasilliumNexus Because of whatever you're running on the phone. Shows up compatible here on 3T with OOS Open Beta 4. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4bab1cfba435fd009bd0fa2e223e05a036c0f0e20e9e1ba8174a887f9ac8ba42.png Zorn I have the OOS Open Beta 4 installed as well. Still greyed out and says this version is not compatible with my device. No idea. Rebel without a Clue I wonder why, 3T here running a rooted custom rom and it's compatible with it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Both Apple Music and Google Music are terribly awful. Google Music at least lets store 50 000 tracks, although it matters less and less each day... Spotify is the king. Brian Demodulated The fact that Spotify doesn't let you upload your own music is the dealbreaker for me. I own tons of CDs that aren't on any streaming service so it's amazing to have that content accessible within GPM. Daniel Tiberius You can if you run the desktop app. WillSympson I'm really glad I never got stuck in the apple ecosystem. Their design language is just getting worse and worse to me. Manikandan Guru Looks ridiculous af. Typical Apple. thomas sim The only Android apps that consistently crashed or hung, Apple Music. It felt like it never left beta state which I was using since beginning. Reason I use it instead of Spotify ? Slightly larger song base for Asian artist ( at least those I listen to ) Shailesh Kumar OMG! That Black Status Bar is killing my eyes. Deborah Sawyer Who freakin' cares. Why do we have Android in the first place? I don't need or want Apple software on my Android phone. Nicholas Conrad Oh, that'll be nice for 14 people. Joannaescott Google is paying $97 per hour!

Diskus1 I really wonder if Apple Music actually has more subscribers on Android than Google Play Music does... amazing how bad Google promotes and develops the Music app. Bikas A big surprise for me is their pricing in India, it's so apt. They are charging Rs.120 (< $2) / month which is quite competitive and good. They can potentially win against Spotify ($9.99/month) and Play Music (if launched). But their major problem is music services here like Gaana (Rs.60/month), Wync or Jio Music (free with career).

The company issued a press release Monday announcing an abrupt end to the relationship between the two companies — it had supplied Apple with its PowerVR graphics processing units (GPUs), which were deployed in every iPhone since the first one. Read: Apple Might Be Making Its Own GPUs Post the announcement, Imagination Technologies’ shares fell 7.64 percent at the time of filing this report. The declining share price could actually open the door to Apple buying out the company itself, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing a note from investment bank Jefferies. "A Byzantine analysis would have Apple intent on taking over Imagination for PowerVR, and using the warning of cessation to depress its prey's valuation (and emphasize its dependence on Apple) before pouncing. A version of this would see Apple standing by to acquire IMG's IP (intellectual property) in any future crisis – perhaps at least providing a safety net to value," Jefferies said in a note Tuesday. The fact that Apple could be working towards making its own GPUs should not come as a surprise — the company has acquired many chip makers including the P.A. Semi microprocessor design company, which made processors for Intel. The company is reportedly one of the bidders in the sale of Toshiba’s chipset manufacturing unit. Read: Apple And Google Among Bidders For Toshiba’s Chipset Unit  “Apple has used Imagination’s technology and intellectual property for many years. It has formed the basis of Graphics Processor Units (GPU) in Apple’s phones, tablets, iPods, TVs and watches. Apple has asserted that it has been working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination’s technology,” Imagination Technologies said in its press release, announcing the end of the relationship between the two companies. The company had also asserted its doubts to whether Apple could actually design a GPU without violating one of its patents. “Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple’s assertions,” it stated.

What we didn’t appreciate completely at the time was how we had so tailored that design to a specific vision that in the future we would find ourselves a bit boxed in — into a circular shape.” As well as offering a more tailored computer, the company will also create a professional-class display to ship alongside its new business offering, the company's Phil Schiller, SVP of worldwide marketing, told press at a roundtable earlier this week. “We are completely rethinking the Mac Pro,” Schiller said at a press recent roundtable. “Since the Mac Pro is a modular system, we are also doing a pro display. There’s a team working hard on it right now.” He said the company is hopeful it can address the professional market, something that the current Mac Pro doesn't quite achieve. As well as boasting top of the range hardware when it's launched, the Mac Pro will also be futureproofed against any new technical enhancements, with a modular system lending itself well to such a vision. “We made something bold that we thought would be great … and what we discovered is that it was great for some and not others — enough so, that we realised we had to take another path ... and look for the next answer,” Schiller said. However, don't go putting money aside for a new professional Mac Pro this year. There's still a long way to go until it will be ready to start shipping, Schiller said.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 5, 2017 at 8:21AM Music streaming services accounted for the majority of all music revenues in the U.S. in 2016 for the first time ever, according to recent data released by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A report published by the RIAA said that estimated retail revenue from recorded music in the U.S. grew by 11.4% in 2016 to $7.7 billion, and streaming music accounted for 51% of that revenue. "The primary driver of that growth was a doubling of paid streaming music subscriptions, which helped the American music business experience its biggest gain since 1998," the report said. Image source: Apple.  The music streaming facts These subscription services include Spotify Premium and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music, while the broader music streaming segment includes additional services like Pandora (NYSE:P), SiriusXM, and ad-supported services like YouTube.  Streaming revenue brought in $3.9 billion in 2016, which was an increase of 68% year over year. What's fascinating about this is how fast streaming revenue took over the industry. As you can see from the bar chart below, streaming revenue accounted for just 9% of all music industry revenue in 2011 -- now it accounts for 51%. Image source: RIAA. While revenue grew across all streaming music categories, paid subscriptions skyrocketed from $1.1 billion in 2015 to $2.4 billion in 2016, an increase of 114% year over year. RIAA noted that paid subscription services now account for about one-third of all U.S. music industry revenue now. What it all means for streaming players All of the above facts aren't just important for the music industry as a whole, but also for Apple, Spotify, Pandora, and others. 2016 marked the first full year of Apple's paid subscription music service, which Apple says is "well past" 20 million subscribers right now. But the company's streaming service still falls far short of Spotify Premium's 50 million paid customers. The huge increase in subscription music streaming revenue shows the market's viability, and it is forcing some companies to shift strategies. Pandora finally launched its first on-demand music streaming subscription service just last month, called Pandora Premium. The service lets users select which songs they want to listen to, download the songs for offline use, stream ad-free music, and get personalized music recommendations for $9.99 per month. Up until last month, Pandora didn't offer a paid subscription service that fully matched Apple's and Spotify's on-demand streaming of songs and albums. Based on the RIAA data, it appears that Pandora's new subscription model is a step in the right direction, albeit a late one. Pandora severely lags behind Apple and Spotify, with just 4 million paid subscribers right now. Still plenty of uncertainty While increased music streaming revenue is a good thing for both the music industry and the companies betting on subscription services, there are a still a few problems.   The most glaring is that while U.S. music revenue ticked up in 2016, it's still only half of what it was in 1999. Cary Sherman, the chairman and CEO of RIAA, wrote in a blog post last month: A year of growth in the U.S. music business is welcome news. It suggests that years of patiently nurturing a nascent streaming marketplace has begun to pay off. But it does not erase 15 years of declines, or continuing uncertainty about the future. And that uncertainty may continue to plague music steaming services going forward. Apple was forced to transition away from digital downloads and toward its streaming service, but it's still eclipsed by Spotify and needs much more subscriber growth if it wants to be the music streaming leader. Similarly, Pandora is playing catch-up to the premium subscription model, and it's unclear how the company will distinguish itself from the competition -- or if there's even enough room for another large music subscription player. If 2016 was a good year for the music industry and the companies betting on its streaming future, then this year is one in which streaming companies and their investors should be cautiously optimistic.  Chris Neiger has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Rich Duprey, Steve Symington, and Timothy Green (TMFCop) Apr 5, 2017 at 8:09AM The market indexes may have pulled back from their record highs hit last month, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of companies not ready to run higher still. We asked three Motley Fool contributors to look into the tech sector to pick out three of their favorites that can continue having a huge, positive impact on your portfolio over time. See if you don't agree that Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and what some might consider a dark-horse candidate, Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), still have a lot to offer. Image source: Getty Images. This winner will keep winning Steve Symington (Twilio): Twilio already boasts an enviable leadership position in its niche. The cloud-based communications platform company added over 2,000 new active customer accounts last quarter alone -- bringing its total customers at the end of last year to 36,606 -- including new efforts with companies such as Capital One, Atlassian, UK-based Paymentsense, and Blue Cross Blue Shield. And that's not to mention that it serves industry juggernauts including Uber, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon.com. As a result, Twilio saw revenue rocket 60% year over year last quarter, to $82 million, while its GAAP net loss per share narrowed significantly to $0.15 from a net loss of $0.48 per share in the same year-ago period. (The company broke even on an adjusted basis, which excludes items such as stock-based compensation.) Twilio is, after all, primarily investing in its business right now to drive innovation and take as much market share as possible. That doesn't mean Twilio isn't susceptible to disruption. Last month, for example, one analyst noted that ride-sharing specialist Lyft is considering Vonage's competing Nexmo platform as an alternative. But considering Twilio's enviable growth to date, it's par for the course to see late-comers try to grab a piece of pie in these early stages of growth. In the end, though, Twilio stock has nearly doubled since its initial public offering at $15 per share last year, I think it's a winner that should keep on winning. And I'm convinced Twilio still offers upside for patient, long-term investors willing to step in now and watch its growth story continue to unfold. Image source: Apple. A supercycle of potential  Rich Duprey (Apple): Samsung had a lot riding on the line when it launched its new Galaxy S8 smartphone, and while it delivered a new sleek, innovative device, it was no iPhone killer. There was no real "wow" factor with it, just a few incremental advancements, which means Apple's own new smartphone iteration later this year will be the real tech development. And it's quite possible Apple is going to enjoy some huge numbers when the next iPhone hits. After a lackluster performance with upgrades over the past two years, some analysts think Apple could have a monster on its hands as iPhone 6 users look to upgrade their devices, leading the company into a "supercycle." JPMorgan Chase analysts think the market underappreciates the sales Apple can generate, but "it depends on Apple delivering a good product." They're confident that is coming. What they're not feeling so bullish about is Apple Services, the segment that generated the best growth of any for the tech giant. Services has become Apple's second-largest segment behind iPhones, generating more than $24 billion in sales last year. Revenue from the division surged 18% in the first quarter versus 5% growth from iPhones, but admittedly it's starting from a much smaller base. iPhones generated $54 billion in sales in the first quarter; services just $7 billion. JPMorgan's analysts think that business is just a lot more challenging than any other part of Apple, and though it has some smart people working on it, they haven't shown they're capable just yet of capitalizing on the potential. But the potential is still there, so it could be a big winner in the years to come. There may come a day when Apple is as well known for the services it sells to the users of its products as it is for the gadgets it sells, but right now Apple's fortunes rise and fall on the iPhone, and although its stock has already gained 25% so far in 2017, the returns may have their own supercycle in the near future. Image source:Fitbit. A tech stock left for dead Tim Green (Fitbit): To say that fitness-wearables company Fitbit is going through a rough patch would be an understatement. Sales tumbled during the crucial holiday season despite a slate of new products, with the company vastly overestimating demand. Layoffs and some executive shuffling followed, but the hole Fitbit has dug for itself is deep. The company expects revenue to drop by as much as 30% in 2017, and both non-GAAP net income and free cash flow are expected to turn negative. The stock has plummeted, not surprisingly. Shares of Fitbit are now down nearly 90% from their all-time high set in 2015, and they're down about 56% over the past year. The market values Fitbit at just $1.3 billion, less than its expected sales in 2017. Fitbit stock deserves much of the pounding it has received, but a value case can still be made. Fitbit's balance sheet contains $700 million of cash and no debt, meaning that the market is really only valuing Fitbit's business at about $600 million. Now, Fitbit does expect to lose as much as $100 million this year on a free cash flow basis, so this cash balance will likely decline. But the market is extremely pessimistic on Fitbit's prospects nonetheless. It won't take a roaring comeback for the stock to soar, only something modestly better than the worst-case scenario. Fitbit stock is risky, as things could just keep getting worse. But April is a good time to bet on the stock if you have any confidence at all in the company.

You may want to hold off buying one for a while if you can wait, because some big changes are coming. According to TechCrunch, Apple is giving its existing Mac Pro a "performance bump" today and planning to announce improved iMacs later this year. But Apple has some bigger changes for the Mac Pro later down the line.

It's something Tim Cook hinted at in December last year. "If we've had a pause in upgrades and updates, we're sorry for that — what happened with the Mac Pro — and we're going to come out with something great to replace it," he added. Schiller told reporters that Apple currently has nearly 100 million Mac users. It's been four years since the Mac Pro got a significant update, but that's changing. Apple is working on a new Mac Pro and a new external Pro display, but don't expect them to be released any time soon. "As part of doing a new Mac Pro — it is, by definition, a modular system — we will be doing a Pro display as well," Schiller said, according to TechCrunch. "Now you won't see any of those products this year; we're in the process of that. We think it's really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system, and that'll take longer than this year to do." For now, Apple is updating the existing Mac Pro for customers who can't wait many months for the new model to come out. Starting today, the $2,999 Mac Pro will offer a 6-core Intel Xeon processor, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs, and 16GB of memory. The $3,999 version offers an 8-core processor and dual D700 GPUs. advertisement | advertise on newsday The Mac Pro upgrade comes after Apple last month quietly announced a new, $329 iPad to replace the againg iPad Air 2. The company also tweaked its iPhone lineup, adding a (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus and releasing the iPhone SE in 32GB and 128GB capacities to replace the existing 16GB and 64GB models.

Is Leaving Money on the Table Apple should go even bigger with its premium iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 5, 2017 at 8:45AM Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch its much-rumored premium iPhone with an OLED display. The phone itself, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, is expected to fit in a physical footprint like that of today's 4.7-inch iPhone. The cool part, though, is that Apple is reportedly going to fit a full 5.8-inch OLED display in that footprint. Now, Kuo says that not all that 5.8 inches of the display will be what he refers to as "active display area." Indeed, a sizable portion of the display will be dedicated to what he refers to as an "area for functions (e.g., allocation of virtual buttons)," leaving just 5.2 inches of active display area. Image source: Apple. This all sounds good, and I think the phone has the potential to do quite well in the marketplace, even at a relatively high price compared with the "standard" iPhone models. However, I can't help thinking there's one obvious omission from Apple's upcoming product lineup. Where's the big OLED iPhone? When Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) announced its Galaxy S8 series of devices, it rolled out two models. The first, known as the Galaxy S8, features a 5.8-inch full-face OLED display. This model, Samsung says, will sell for $720. Samsung also offers a higher-end variant, called the Galaxy S8+, which includes a larger 6.2-inch full-face OLED display. The company charges $840 for this one -- a hefty $120 premium. Apple is expected to charge north of $1,000 for the upcoming OLED iPhone, and to be blunt, I think the company will still see robust demand for the device in that price range. However, I can't help thinking Apple is leaving money on the table by not planning a larger option alongside the 5.8-inch option -- say, 6.2 inches. Such a device could command a premium over the "standard" OLED iPhone and, with the right additional features, could be a strong seller. The ultimate impact from the introduction of such a product would be a richer product mix with higher iPhone average selling prices and potentially higher total profits, too. Maybe that'll be next cycle's trick What Apple could potentially do is save such a larger premium iPhone for its next product cycle. After all, once this year's OLED iPhone hits, Apple will need to come up with ways to make next year's products compelling enough to spur iPhone upgrades and capture more premium smartphone share. Going forward, I could see Apple releasing not one, two, or even three new smartphones per year, but at least four: the two "standard" iPhone models -- the successors to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- and two "premium" iPhone models. Apple could conceivably endow such a larger premium iPhone variant with even more features than it can fit in the bill of materials of the smaller premium iPhone. Such a device would certainly be quite expensive -- at least as smartphones go, anyway -- but I suspect a large segment of the iPhone buying population would be willing to pay more just to have the very best features and technologies. After all, that's the thinking behind this year's OLED iPhone, right?    Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.
