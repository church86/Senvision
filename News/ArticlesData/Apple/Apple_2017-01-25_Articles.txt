The projects will support Apple's renewable energy needs for its Reno data center. In the coming weeks, NV Energy will file an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) to enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) for the solar power plant. The project will bring NV Energy's total to more than 529 megawatts of new solar resources in construction in Nevada or under review for approval. This is in addition to the 491 megawatts of universal solar resources in Nevada currently serving NV Energy customers. Apple will also dedicate up to 5 megawatts of power to NV Energy's future subscription solar program for residential and commercial customers. "We are proud to play a role in helping Apple meet their energy needs with Nevada's abundant solar resource," said Paul Caudill, president and CEO of NV Energy. "In partnership with our customers, we continue to develop a more balanced fuel mix in a way that benefits the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs for Nevadans, particularly those in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 357 and 396, and advances the state's policy goals." "Investing in innovative clean energy sources is vital to Apple's commitment to reaching, and maintaining, 100 percent renewable energy across all our operations," said Apple's vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson. "Our partnership with NV Energy helps assure our customers their iMessages, FaceTime video chats and Siri inquiries are powered by clean energy, and supports efforts to offer the choice of green energy to Nevada residents and businesses."

 Siri is coming to Apple Watch apps BI Intelligence Jan. 25, 2017, 10:03 AM 1,001 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Google is preparing to launch two Nexus-like smartwatches The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] The Apple TV is a mess — and hardly the 'future of TV' Apple advertised This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. A new beta version of Apple’s watchOS — the operating system for the Apple Watch — revealed the company is opening up some Apple Watch apps to its voice assistant, Siri, according to Business Insider. These include fitness apps, payments, rides, and messages. While the software is still in development, this will eventually allow Apple Watch owners to do ask Siri to complete actions like ordering an Uber through their Watch rather than having to do it through their phone. Voice assistant integration into the Apple Watch could improve the user experience. A pitfall of overall smartwatch industry is a lack of functionality. This is in part due to the smaller screen size, which limits what apps can show at any one time. Voice-integration removes the friction that might arise out of trying to navigate the small screen with their fingers. Adoption of voice recognition in smartwatches could make the devices more useful, even allowing them to eventually challenge the supremacy of the smartphone as a key to the connected world (that is, the car, home, workplace, etc.). The move could indicate Apple’s strategy for the emerging voice assistant, which differs from rivals Google and Amazon. While the latter two companies are baking their voice assistants, Google Assistant and Alexa, into connected home hardware, Apple appears to be taking a more ubiquitous approach, turning Siri into the universal platform. Siri is now available on all four devices and operating systems — iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and MacOS. Moreover, as Apple’s wireless connected earphones continue to enter the market, Apple is positioning itself as a major player in the voice assistant market. When they first broke onto the scene, smartwatches were touted as the next generation of devices set to transform consumers’ lives. And brands, service providers, and the healthcare segment were ready to capitalize on their “always on” nature, which promised to provide greater insight into consumer habits. But while the market initially grew rapidly, it has begun to cool off, as consumers become impatient with the technology's lack of distinct capabilities, such as LTE connectivity and device-specific apps. In the next few years, the smartwatch market will likely see the addition of new functionality and increased capabilities, which will see the device shipments grow at an annualized rate of 18% through 2021 to reach 70 million units. However, smartwatches are reliant on a number of factors in order to generate any sort of meaningful consumer demand. Until such a time, adoption of smartwatches will likely be sluggish, as consumers wait for vendors to produce products that can run independently from their phones and provide more useful functions. So what does this mean for the device championed as the replacement for the smartphone? Should vendors manage to implement a lower price point, better functionality, and expanded use cases, there is a vast potential for accelerated global growth. Moreover, because of the low adoption rate thus far, there is still ample opportunity for new entrants to join the market, and capture mind share. Laurie Beaver, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on smartwatches that examines all areas of the smartwatch market, including a five-year forecast, key growth trends, market leaders, consumer demand, and more. It also discusses the need for the inclusion of standalone capabilities in smartwatches, as well as the importance of bringing both better apps to the devices and greater consumer awareness of capabilities. Lastly, it explores the nascent smartwatch app market, including its shortcomings and how it can be improved. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: Demand for smartwatches has cooled as consumers wait for better functionality. But early demand suggests the market could take off when functionality improves.  Apple will continue to drive a large portion of the overall market, however, Android Wear devices will quickly catch up as emerging markets begin to adopt the technology. Health and fitness remain a dominant segment of the smartwatch market, providing healthcare workers and hospitals with savings opportunities. As technology and app development advances, the benefits of smartwatches within these segments will become even more robust. The future of the smartwatch market remains somewhat unclear, however, there is profound opportunity for businesses and developers to begin exploring the nascent smartwatch market. This will give them a head start against competitors. In full, the report: Forecasts smartwatch shipments through 2021 for both overall device shipments as well as by operating system. Provides an overview of the main players in both hardware and software, and how they will size up in the future. Demonstrates the effect of Apple’s entrance into the market, and why it's unlikely to dictate future growth. Gives insight into what technologies need to be worked on in order to incentivize future growth, the effects they will have on the market, and how they can be used. And much more.

The company has made a commitment to clean energy and has been building solar power plants both in the U.S. and China. I’ve looked into Apple’s efforts with solar energy and its many new installations. I want to put what Apple is doing in perspective with some numbers. Typical solar farm. Via Shutterstock The recent news item that triggered my research into Apple and solar power was this announcement from NV Energy, Inc. NV Energy and Apple announced today [Jan 25] they have reached an agreement to build 200 megawatts of additional solar energy in Nevada by early 2019. The projects will support Apple’s renewable energy needs for its Reno data center. That number, 200 MW (megawatts), caught my eye, because that’s a pretty good-sized solar energy plant. The physicist in me started thinking about the numbers. Perspectives First, commercial solar power plants tend to be somewhat smaller than coal or nuclear plants. They range in size from about 13 MW to 280 MW. By contrast…. A typical (500 megawatt) coal plant burns 1.4 million tons of coal each year. As of 2012, there are 572 operational coal plants in the U.S. with an average capacity of 547 megawatts. Nuclear power plants, of which the U.S. has 61 sites, tend to be about the same size as coal plants. That is, each reactor. Some sites have multiple reactors. Fort Calhoun plant in Nebraska has one reactor with the smallest generating capacity1 of 479 megawatts (MW). The Palo Verde plant in Arizona has three reactors and has the largest combined generating capacity of about 3,937 MW. One solar plant that particularly intrigues me, one done in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy, is the Crescent Dunes power plant near Tonopah, Nevada. Instead of photovoltaic cells (PV), it uses heliostats (moving, aluminum mirrors that follow the sun), to focus sunlight onto a 640 ft (195 m) tower and heat salt to molten. The environmentally friendly molten salt can be stored and can generate steam and electricity even when the sun is down. Its power capacity is 110 MW. Crescent Dunes solar power plant near Tonopah, NV What can a megawatt (MW) of power do? The average home in the U.S. consumes 10,837 kW-h (kilowatt-hours) of energy in a year. That’s an average power draw of 1.23 kilowatts. And so a megawatt (MW) of power can sustain about 800 homes. A mere 50 MW solar power plant could sustain 40,000 homes (in the daytime). As an aside, the average electricity cost in the U.S. (2015) was 12.7 cents/kW-h. The highest rate is Hawaii at 27.1 cents/kW-h. The lowest is Louisiana at 9.05 cents/kW-h. How Many Plants Does Apple Have? A quick check of Google shows that Apple has or is building many solar power plants. It’s doing this by itself in some cases or in concert with local power companies that have expertise in solar power. Here’s what I found in a casual search. No one website lists them all that I could find. But Apple notes that a total of 4 GW of capacity are in the planning stages. California Flats Solar Project, Monterey County – 280 MW* (First Solar + Apple) Mesa, AZ, 50 MW Florence, AZ, 50 MW Maiden, NC, 12 MW Claremont, NC, 17.5 MW Conover, NC, 10 MW Boulder City, NV, 100 MW Reno, NV, 200 MW* *indicates planned or under construction. Apple: “Our 4 gigawatts of clean energy projects around the world will avoid more than 30 million metric tons of carbon pollution by 2020. That’s the equivalent of taking more than 6 million cars off the road for one year.” A very good summary of Apple’s ambitious plans can be found here: “How Apple’s Solar Strategy Evolved.” What may not be well known is Apple’s work with China. From Apple’s website: We’re building 200 megawatts of solar in China, starting with a 170-megawatt solar project in Inner Mongolia, to begin offsetting our manufacturing emissions. We’re also working with suppliers to install more than 4 gigawatts of new clean energy worldwide, including 2 gigawatts in China by 2020. And over the next two years, Foxconn will install 400 megawatts of solar to cover the energy use of its iPhone final production facility in Zhengzhou. Let There Be Light Apple is doing an amazing job of doing its part to provide clean, renewable energy for its own corporate and data center needs as well as, in some cases, the community. What it doesn’t use for itself, it will sell on the open market. How the new administration approaches renewable energy, especially solar power, remains to be seen. But concerns are being expressed. No doubt, Apple’s commitment to solar power technology both in the U.S. and China has—and and will again—come up in discussions with the new U.S. president. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, Solar Power 5 Comments Add a comment ibuck January 26, 2017 When you talked about size of the power plant, my first thought was of acres of land used. So I was a little bit disappointed that you were only referring to generated output. Which is fine, and in line with the thrust of your post. But still I mused about the land used. Though coal power plants are probably smaller than solar farms, that coal plant footprint should include the size of the hole in the ground called a coal mine (as well as lots of environmental damage for miles and miles). One often sees solar panels on the ground as in this solar farm on top, probably fenced off for security purposes. But in residential solar and many commercial or industrial solar panels are placed on the roofs of buildings. I hope future solar installations include many atop automobile parking facilities, where they could simultaneously gather energy and keep vehicles beneath them cooler. BTW, here in N California, our December PG&E bill has us paying (including clean electric generation charges) 18.4 cents per kWh. January 26, 2017 at 6:32 EST PM John Martellaro January 26, 2017 ibuck: I saw acreage figures for many of the solar sites, but in an article this short, I thought it important to avoid too many site details and focus on the megawatts of the various kinds of power plants. That was interesting to me. Indeed, one has to weigh the land footprint against the carbon footprint. January 26, 2017 at 7:08 EST PM MacFrogger January 26, 2017 Hey John – nice article. A few additional points: 1. Don’t forget Al Gore sits on Apple’s board – and he’s an effective advocate for these moves and Apple’s broader commitment to renewable energy. 2. Most people don’t know that coal plants produce LOTS of (mostly unregulated) radioactive waste – no that’s not a typo – and release 10x more radiation into the environment than a comparably-sized nuclear power plant. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/ 3. While solar PV and wind energy have had a marginal impact on the coal industry, the primary cause for the decline of this industry (and the coal mining jobs that go with it) is the substitution of cheap natural gas for coal in domestic power plants. This cheap natural gas is coming from fracking. It’s especially important to understand this last point – and its ramifications. (You may not personally approve of fracking but facts are facts. “Alternative facts” don’t apply here.) Now imagine you are Donald Trump and your goal is to revive the coal industry. Going after environmental regulations won’t revive coal, because they’re not the reasons why gas costs less than coal. You’d have to find a way to tinker with the “free market” to lower the price of coal (with subsidies?) and/or find a way to raise the price of gas (perhaps with a tax?). Neither of these are politically palatable options, and you can only imagine the howls of protest from the gas industry who would claim that Trump is meddling in free markets and promoting one part of the fossil fuel industry over another. Now pretend that you are a utility CEO and you have to make a large capital investment in a new power plant with a lifespan measured in decades: Which fuel would you choose to burn? Gas costs less than coal, produces less CO2/unit of power, and overall burns much cleaner (see point 2 above). There’s other advantages to gas as well, but let’s keep it simple for now. Whether you personally believe Trump is good or bad doesn’t matter – you realize he will serve his time and be gone. Then what happens if the pendulum swings the other way and there’s a carbon tax applied because by now climate change is causing widespread disruption? The only sound business decision is to go with gas, because you have to think about this investment in terms of decades – not whatever time Trump occupies the Oval Office. Bottom line is this: people say there is no longer any bi-partisanship left in DC. As Trump might tweet: WRONG! There is plenty to be had if you look a little bit closer. It doesn’t matter if you are a D or an R – if you are from Kentucky or West Virginia you are pro-coal. But similarly, even otherwise staunch conservative Senator Grassley (R-Iowa) is a strong supporter of wind energy because Iowa has a great deal of wind. Such is even the case for new DOE head Rick Perry, who’s buddy T. Boone Pickens is heavily invested in wind and the state of Texas is one of the leading wind energy producing states in the US. I could cite other examples; I even have a fleeting recollection of Grassley saying something in the past like they (the Congress) would get rid of wind energy subsidies over his dead body. In summary: the GOP is not monolithic and remember all politics are local. And Trump will not be bringing back the coal industry – its in permanent decline. January 26, 2017 at 10:35 EST PM MacFrogger January 26, 2017 I should add that even though coal plants release more radiation to the environment than nuclear plants, the amount is still low – since we’re dealing with facts here. January 26, 2017 at 10:43 EST PM Lee Dronick January 27, 2017 Let us not forget the small solar systems. Over parking lots, on roofs of homes and larger buildings. Up the street is portable unit that is sitting on parking lot and looks like it can charge two vehicles. January 27, 2017 at 4:02 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Apple’s new MacBooks now officially a flop as Windows PCs take high end market share 7 by Surur  @mspoweruser Jan 26, 2017 at 22:38 GMT1 day ago Nearly 10 years ago, in 2009, the NPD famously announced that Apple had more than 90% of the high-end PC market for PCs costing more than $1000. A lot has happened since then, including the ascendancy of the iPhone as Apple’s profit centre, and more recently Microsoft’s Surface line, which inspired PC OEMs to do a lot better in terms of innovation and quality. The result of Apple taking its eye of the ball has been the recent release at the end of October 2016 of the new Macbook Pro, with its biggest innovation being the touch bar and the removal of a large number of essential ports, to be replaced with USB-C slots, resulting in the device being famously slated as another example of Apple’s “dongle-hell” obsession. Now Microsoft ‘s CFO Amy Hood has confirmed that this malaise has resulted in Windows OEMs making gains in Apple’s so far hallowed high margin terrain. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood tells me that Windows OEM partners took share from Apple at the high-end of PC market last quarter. — Dina Bass (@dinabass) January 26, 2017 @PiotrGoreckiJr that, according to Microsoft, pricy Windows machines are beating out Apple more often than previously — Dina Bass (@dinabass) January 26, 2017 Microsoft’s financial results also confirmed as much, noting that Windows licensing revenue from OEMs for consumer devices grew 5% primarily due to a higher mix of premium devices. Microsoft famously claimed that with the announcement of the Surface Studio, which caused many to claim Microsoft is more innovative than Apple, and Apple’s announcement of the disappointing MacBook Pro “more and more Mac users were switching to Surface.” It seems Microsoft’s Surface line was not the only beneficiary, which is good news for OEMs struggling with the slow decline of the PC market. Hopefully an increased share of the high-end market will also result in greater profits for Windows OEMs, which should lead to better engagement with Microsoft’s direction regarding PCs, laptops, VR headsets, IoT devices and even possible once again smartphones in the future. Either way the news is a celebration for Windows fans who prefer to have both style and function in their computers. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

According to Philip Elmer-DeWitt, the creator of the Apple 3.0 website, 12 institutional and 5 independent analysts all forecast a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales during the December quarter. The average sales figure from the 17 analysts was 77.3 million iPhones, which would represent a 3.4% increase over the 74.8 million Apple reported for the fourth quarter of 2015. Analysts' estimates ranged from a low of 75 million to a high of 80 million. Apple set a record for iPhone sales in 2015's December quarter, but in each of the following three quarters, its iPhone numbers were down from the prior year's. The nine-month stretch was the only period in the iPhone's history during which Apple sold fewer smartphones than in the same span a year earlier. If the analysts Elmer-DeWitt polled are accurate -- at times, averages of their forecasted numbers have been prescient -- it would bolster the theory that 2016's downturn was largely due to the enormous sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014-2015. Those models fueled increases of up to 46%, posting numbers that were ultimately impossible for the follow-on iPhone 6S and 6S Plus to match. Apple will reveal the number of iPhones sold in the December quarter on Tuesday, Jan. 31, shortly before it hosts a conference call with Wall Street. That earnings call, audio-cast on Apple's website, will begin at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET). Computerworld/Data: Apple, Philip Elmer-DeWitt Apple will report a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales next week, say 17 financial analysts, who forecast an average boost of 3.4%.

Image: Apple By Stan Schroeder2017-01-25 15:20:26 UTC If you hopped over to the LG UltraFine 5K display in Apple's online store recently, you may have noticed that something is missing: a star rating.  A Redditor accused Apple of removing the rating after a "storm of negative reviews," most of which had to do with the monitor failing to wake from sleep. However, it now appears the listing never had any reviews in the first place. SEE ALSO: Apple's website just got an update only total geeks will notice As of this writing, the product has no "Ratings & Reviews" section; we couldn't find a single user review for this particular monitor on Apple's site. In contrast, LG's smaller, 4K UltraFine monitor has a visible star rating at the time of this writing. Check out the screenshots of both products's pages, below. Image: Stan Schroeder/Mashable/Apple Image: Stan Schroeder/Mashable/Apple The rating for the 4K display is quite poor — only 2.5 stars — with many reviewers slamming the monitor for not waking from sleep when connected to a MacBook Pro, and some using that product's reviews section to complain about the 5K version.  "The display remains dark when connected to a 2016 MacBook. Once connected, the MacBook slows down and eventually crashes," one reviewer wrote, echoing similar complaints on Apple's support board.  "Decided to replace my Apple Thunderbolt display with the LG UltraFine 5K for my 2 monitor setup. The 5K has been a disaster. Black screen, screen flashes, eventually leading to a locked up computer," wrote another.  The two LG monitors were a sort of a replacement for Apple's own Thunderbolt displays, which were discontinued in 2016 and have been featured prominently during Apple's last Mac-centric event.  Update Jan. 25 12:06 p.m.: A source at Apple who didn't want to be named says the rating system, which will be exactly the same as it is for the 4K unit, will be turned on later today. Second update, Jan. 26, 4:04 p.m.: It now appears the reviews section on the 5K monitor was never active before Jan. 25. It is active now, and though there are still some complaints about the monitor not waking from sleep, accusations that Apple may have censored content on the page are unsubstantiated.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jan 26, 2017 at 5:49PM CEO Steve Mollenkopf. Image source: Qualcomm. Mobile chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported fiscal first-quarter results last night. While the results as well as guidance mostly topped analyst expectations, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent lawsuit against the company expectedly dominated the subsequent earnings call ("Apple" was mentioned 74 times). For good reason, too, since Apple is widely considered Qualcomm's largest customer, combined with the fact that the lawsuit threatens Qualcomm's licensing model. Beyond a few brief statements, this is the first time that Qualcomm has commented publicly and in granular detail regarding the suit. Here's what management had to say. Prepared remarks CEO Steve Mollenkopf first noted that the two companies have historically had a strong relationship, and Qualcomm intends to "remain a good supplier" despite the legal complaint. The company would naturally have preferred to settle its dispute with Apple in private negotiations instead of litigation, but it remains confident that it can defend itself in court. Mollenkopf summed it up: "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." President Derek Aberle continued: Touching briefly on Apple's complaints filed in San Diego and China, it claims that Qualcomm should be required to license its cellular standard essential patents, or SEPs, to modem suppliers. That even when licensing those patents at the device level, Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties on the price of the cellular modem chip inside the device. These positions, however, are inconsistent with long-standing industry practice, the [intellectual property rights] policies of the relevant standard-setting bodies, the realities of licensing large portfolios of patents, and basic notions of efficiency, fairness in economics. Aberle points out that device-level licensing is utilized throughout the industry by many major patent holders beyond Qualcomm. (Apple is seeking chip-level licensing.) Qualcomm says its patents also contribute to many other features in modern smartphones beyond cellular connectivity, further justifying device-level royalties. Shifting to chip-level royalties would then introduce different layers of licensing for all the various chips that Qualcomm enables or sells itself, so it licenses the entire portfolio for the sake of efficiency. Apple says that there is no limit to the royalty rates, which is why it seeks per-unit royalty relief in the form of "rebate" payments. Aberle says this is untrue: In addition, it is well known that Qualcomm has per-unit running royalty caps as part of its licensing program. This effectively results in licensees not paying running royalties as a percentage of the device price above a certain net selling price of any given device. Apple's claim that royalties are uncapped is simply incorrect. Aberle also reiterated that Qualcomm believes Apple is instigating these regulatory attacks as well as providing inaccurate information: Apple claims that Qualcomm retaliated because Apple cooperated with government investigations. To be clear, we did no such thing. We simply objected to Apple making false and misleading statements and withholding information to motivate attacks against Qualcomm. We welcome the opportunity to have Apple's claims heard in court, where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits. We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of extortion are false. There should be no immediate impact to sales from the lawsuit, either. Apple still needs modems, and Qualcomm will still supply them. CFO George Davis said, "We are not forecasting any impact to revenues related to the dispute with Apple, as we are continuing to meet their supply needs in good faith and expect Apple will continue to meet its obligations." Questions and answers As usual, the analyst Q&A often provides more color. Qualcomm affirmed that Apple does not have a direct license, but rather an indirect license through its contract manufacturers. Qualcomm isn't worried about collecting, said Aberle: Apple does not have a direct license with Qualcomm today. And so the royalties on Apple products that get paid to Qualcomm are reported and paid by their contract manufacturers. So although we do have a dispute now with Apple and they are challenging some of the offers and some of our licensing terms, the contracts that we have in place with their suppliers remain valid and enforceable. And we would expect that our licensees will continue to comply with the terms of their agreements. And we would also hope and expect that Apple would not interfere with the terms of those agreements. But of course, we can't fully control those actions. When asked about the exclusivity and monopoly power allegations, general counsel Don Rosenberg (who incidentally used to work for Apple a decade ago), downplayed the idea that Qualcomm wields monopoly power: With regard to your question about so-called exclusivity deal, first of all, we -- I think you called this monopoly power or had monopoly power. We don't believe we have monopoly power in the chip market or any other market. And nor do we have an exclusivity arrangement. We have never prevented Apple or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers. And in the Apple case, it's pretty clear since, as you know, they have been buying from Intel fairly recently. So it's a mischaracterization to call it an exclusive dealing arrangement. This is a little murky, since Apple had been exclusively buying basebands from Qualcomm for five years, and only started buying from Intel after the alleged exclusivity ended. Overall, Qualcomm thinks Apple is simply trying to finagle lower payments -- lower being beneath fair value as established by its hundreds of other licensing deals with many companies over the years. That risks somewhat oversimplifying Apple's complaint, because Apple is also accusing Qualcomm of various forms of anticompetitive behavior. Whether or not those allegations stand up in court remains to be seen. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple and Qualcomm.

In fact, those MacBook fans out there who are due for an upgrade but don’t want to deal with dongle hell might actually appreciate Best Buy’s new offer. Don't Miss: Netflix for Android just got a new feature iPhone owners will never see Starting Thursday and running all the way through Saturday, Best Buy customers who buy a select MacBook Pro or MacBook Air with a 3-year AppleCare plan will save $300 on their purchase. The AppleCare purchase alone costs $249.99, which means you’re better off getting the extra protection with the new Mac and still getting $50 in savings. The deal is only valid in brick-and-mortar stores, or if you order online and select in-store pickup. The deal may not be valid in combination with other offers that might be available at Best Buy. For the MacBook Air, that means you have to choose between the AppleCare savings or a different promotion that gets you $200 off. Best Buy’s new sale only covers some 2015 MacBook models, including 13-inch MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro versions. If you’re looking for discounted 15-inch MacBook Pro (early 2015) then you have to go for a different deal, one that gets you $250 off the final price, but doesn’t include AppleCare. If you’re shopping for a new iPad Air 2 (Wi-Fi-only) with AppleCare, then you can save $150 when you get a 2-year extended warranty plan that’s worth $99.99 by itself. The offer also ends on Saturday. If you’re looking for other Best Buy sales on Apple gear, check out this link.

President Trump met with tech industry leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, on December 14 and promised to discuss trade, taxes and other issues. Drew Angerer/Getty Images Advertisement “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China. How does it help us when they make it in China?” After his victory last March in the Super Tuesday primaries, that was the message from candidate Donald J. Trump, who also had criticized dozens of other companies for moving, or planning to move, production offshore from the United States. While Trump criticized Apple a number of times during the campaign, he took a very different tone at a December 14 meeting with a bevy of Silicon Valley giants, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Alphabet’s Larry Page. “I’m here to help you folks do well,” Trump said at the start of the meeting, according to a Bloomberg report. Like it or not, Apple may find itself at the center of a debate concerning the future of American manufacturing. Over the past few decades, many manufacturers have moved jobs from the United States to low-cost countries. In business circles, it has been accepted that this was an inevitable evolution and that the future of the United States lay mainly in the service sector, a transition from low-paying brawn jobs to high-paying brain jobs. While it originally manufactured its computers in the U.S., Apple long ago moved to a system where it designed its products in the United States but used a network of largely Asian manufacturers, in particular Taiwan-based Foxconn, to produce components and assemble its products ranging from the MacBook and the iPad to the ubiquitous iPhone. Both the products and the process have been roaring successes, making Apple the most valuable company in the world. For the past two fiscal years, the Cupertino, Calif., firm has had sales exceeding $200 billion annually and net income of $45 to $53 billion. Moreover, the company is sitting on a cash reserve of more than $237 billion. With a market cap of approximately $640 billion, Apple is much too big to escape the notice of a president who has repeatedly stated his intention to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Trump isn’t the first president to want Apple to put more manufacturing in the United States. In February 2011, then-President Barack Obama asked the late Steve Jobs why the iPhone couldn’t be made in the U.S. The reply, according to a New York Times report: “Those jobs aren’t coming back.” When a Times reporter asked a former Apple executive why the company had focused on manufacturing in Asia, the executive said Tim Cook, Apple’s supply chain mastermind, had concluded, “Factories in Asia ‘can scale up and down faster’ and ‘Asian supply chains have surpassed what’s in the U.S.’ The result is that ‘we can’t compete at this point,’ the executive said.” Popular Now Trump Announces Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Five Rules for Selecting the Best KPIs to Drive Operational Improvement US Imposes 266% Duty on Imports of Steel from China While Apple does little manufacturing in the U.S., the company has struck back against the notion that it is not a jobs creator. Apple directly employs approximately 66,000 in the U.S., of whom 30,000 are reported to work in Apple stores. But in January 2016, the company pointed out that it was “responsible for creating and supporting 1.9 million jobs in the U.S. alone. Nearly three-quarters of those jobs — over 1.4 million — are attributable to the community of app creators, software engineers and entrepreneurs building apps for iOS, as well as non-IT jobs supported directly and indirectly through the app economy.” Is Apple Ready to Reshore? What would it take for Apple to start manufacturing substantial numbers of its products in the United States? Some observers think a deal could be in the works, where Apple reshores some portion of its manufacturing in exchange for repatriation of its substantial profits sitting overseas at a lower tax rate. The company currently has more than $200 billion in overseas accounts. President Trump has suggested a one-time 10% tax rate for these funds. Trump has also promised to substantially lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, among the highest in the developed world at 35%. Such financial incentives would certainly be needed for Apple to shift production from China. As the New York Times reported in “How China Built ‘iPhone City’ with Billions in Perks for Apple’s Partners,” Foxconn has received more than $1.5 billion from the Chinese government to build its huge factory in Zhengzhou. That factory can produce up to 500,000 iPhones a day. Not only did the local government help finance the factory and roads leading to it, but it “helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.” “I can see through political pressure and needing a seat at the table that they may consider moving some element of production or even assembly to the U.S.,” says Peter Bryant, managing partner at Clareo, a business strategy consulting firm. “I think they are going to struggle to do nothing in this area.” Moving production of iPhones to the U.S. would be not only expensive and difficult but also risky in a number of ways. Experts such as Bryant point out that moving production to the U.S. would increase the cost of the iPhone. “Apple products are already premium priced,” says Bryant. “I’m not sure there is room to keep jacking the price up. If they have to absorb that price increase, that’s a pretty big margin erosion that shareholders won’t like.” Higher production costs could lead to less investment in R&D and new technologies over time, worries Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School. As a result, he warns, “they hurt themselves and they hurt the U.S. economy.” Rather than “using the bully pulpit to push companies to put a factory in the U.S.,” said Pisano, the U.S. should bolster its trade enforcement policies so U.S. firms are not forced either to manufacture in other countries or to hand over their intellectual property. He said manufacturers would also be more likely to invest in the U.S. if the country adopted “rational” tax policies, more investment in jobs training and improved regulatory schemes that promote, for example, faster permitting of facilities and processes. Overall, he said, the U.S. needs to work to create an industrial ecosystem where manufacturers want to locate and where “high wage, high productivity” jobs are created. “I don’t want to make things the Chinese make,” said Pisano. “I want to make things the Chinese can’t because our productivity and our skill base is so much higher.” Alan Tonelson, an economist and trade expert, says Foxconn’s recent revelation that it was considering investing $7 billion to bring a flat panel display factory to the U.S. undercuts arguments that the electronics supply chain could not be brought here. He notes that Foxconn is considering creating 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in America and that it has already announced plans, as AFP reported, for a “$40 million investment in a facility in Pennsylvania to build precision tools and develop a robotics program.” “That sure sounds like supply chain stuff to me,” Tonelson wrote in his RealityChek blog. Apple will consider a complex web of factors before committing to substantial U.S. manufacturing. China offers an established supply chain, financial support and abundant manpower, but wages are rising in China, eroding its price advantages. The labor component of the price of Apple products is almost certain to diminish as Foxconn and other manufacturing partners employ more automation in the production and assembly of products. And China can be an unpredictable partner with U.S. businesses. China has blocked Apple’s iBooks and Movies online stores and recently ordered the removal of the New York Times app from the Apple store. Still, China offers a huge and growing market for U.S. companies such as Apple and retaliation by the Chinese government for a withdrawal of manufacturing by Foxconn would surely damage Apple from both a manufacturing and retail standpoint.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Software Night Shift Mode Is Finally Coming To The MacBooks And Macs By Ali Salman Jan 25, 2017 11Shares Share Tweet Submit Yesterday, Apple had seen fit to release the beta of the forthcoming macOS Sierra 10.12.4 update to developers. The update came about more than a month after the company released its macOS Sierra 10.12.2 update and a day after the release of macOS Sierra 10.12.3. The beta update can be downloaded through the Apple Developer Center or the software update mechanism from the Mac App Store. If you’re interested, a public beta tester will be available later this week. The latest beta build includes a new feature called Night Shift Mode which is making its way to the MacBooks and Macs. Night Shift Mode Is Set To Arrive For MacBooks And Macs Soon The white glow of your computer screens are often recognized as contributing factor to insomnia. The glare from laptops and smartphones can disturb your sleep cycle. To oppose this, Apple introduced the  Night Shift mode feature for iPhones. What Night Shift mode did was simple, it swept the color temperature of the display to a slightly warmer end of the spectrum – allowing less glare and blue-white glow to enter your eyes and disturb your sleep. Now, the feature is coming to the screens of your MacBooks and Macs. As reported by Macrumors, Night Shift is included in the latest beta build of macOS Sierra. This states that Apple will release the feature for laptops and desktops at some point in the near future. So if you’re one of those who use your MacBooks or Macs at night time hours, the feature will tint your computer screens orange so you can sleep better. Base Model of 2016 MacBook Pro SSD Isn’t Just Super-Fast, It Is Also User Replaceable Advertisement Apple is not the first one to introduce such a feature. There was a third-party app called F.lux that performed the exact same purpose. However, Apple shut it down on iOS before it launched its host Night Shift feature on iOS. Nonetheless, F.lux is still available for macOS and you can take advantage of it if the blue-white glow is keeping you awake. One advantage associated with Night Shift is that even if the glare does not disturbs your sleep, it is still a pleasure to use your device with a tint of orange shade at night time hours. The feature can be turned of at will if you’re editing photos or watching a movie. For reading purposes and surfing the internet, Night Shift mode is definitely a neat addition. This is it for now, folks. Do you use the Night Shift feature on your iPhone? How well has it contributed in improving your sleep?

Apple has long objected to Qualcomm's practice of charging for the "modem" chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans and its demands for a license fee based on the total price of the phones. Qualcomm was the original inventor of a number of key wireless technologies. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm over the practice on Jan. 17. But earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump named FTC Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen to head the regulatory agency. Ohlhausen had vigorously opposed the FTC's lawsuit. " e have a hard time seeing the case go forward with the dissenting FTC commissioner slated to become the head of the FTC," Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. "If the FTC abandons its case, it certainly would not be helpful to Apple, but we would guess that Apple will probably still try to push the issue." In the Qualcomm case, Ohlhausen broke her usual practice of not commenting on her dissenting votes, saying the lawsuit was "based on a flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support" and "fails to allege that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty." The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its U.S lawsuit, filed on Jan. 20, Cupertino, California-based Apple alleges Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebates and other payments owed to Apple as a result of a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation into the San Diego-based chip maker. That probe led to a $853 million fine for Qualcomm but no demand for changes to its business model. "For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," Apple said in a statement the same day it filed the lawsuit. But the intent of the suit is to challenge Qualcomm's full-device royalty model. "They're very clearly trying to attack the business model - that's crystal clear," said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein. Apple also filed two lawsuits against Qualcomm in China this week. Despite fining Qualcomm $975 million in 2015, Chinese antitrust regulators did not take immediate aim at the chip maker's business practices either. On its earnings call on Wednesday, Qualcomm said it would defend its business model in courts around the world. "There has been no sudden change in the law to make this practice improper, and it remains the most efficient and fair method of licensing," Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said.

Credit: Apple More like this Financial experts forecast more bad news for Apple Financial analysts forecast another downturn for Apple's iPhone, Mac Mac sales slide 14% as slump enters fourth straight quarter Video Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! Apple next week will report a return to iPhone growth after a three-quarter slump, a group of financial analysts predicted. According to Philip Elmer-DeWitt, the creator of the Apple 3.0 website, 12 institutional and 5 independent analysts all forecast a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales during the December quarter. The average sales figure from the 17 analysts was 77.3 million iPhones, which would represent a 3.4% increase over the 74.8 million Apple reported for the fourth quarter of 2015. Analysts' estimates ranged from a low of 75 million to a high of 80 million. Apple set a record for iPhone sales in 2015's December quarter, but in each of the following three quarters, its iPhone numbers were down from the prior year's. The nine-month stretch was the only period in the iPhone's history during which Apple sold fewer smartphones than in the same span a year earlier. If the analysts Elmer-DeWitt polled are accurate -- at times, averages of their forecasted numbers have been prescient -- it would bolster the theory that 2016's downturn was largely due to the enormous sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014-2015. Those models fueled increases of up to 46%, posting numbers that were ultimately impossible for the follow-on iPhone 6S and 6S Plus to match. Apple will reveal the number of iPhones sold in the December quarter on Tuesday, Jan. 31, shortly before it hosts a conference call with Wall Street. That earnings call, audio-cast on Apple's website, will begin at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET). Computerworld/Data: Apple, Philip Elmer-DeWitt Apple will report a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales next week, say 17 financial analysts, who forecast an average boost of 3.4%.

The company expects that the patent licenses in place with its clients will be upheld through the multiple trial processes from not only Apple, but the FTC and against the Korea Fair Trade Commission. All three claim that Qualcomm has been charging more for contracts with source-diversified clients and is said to have threatened the blocking of product shipment and withheld royalties. To that, Qualcomm comes back with a defense that the practices it is engaged in are common and accepted in its industry and that steadily growing contract rates have been the result of organic innovation and the claimed ability to advance clients’ bottom lines. “We have never prevented Apple or anybody else from buying from competitive chipmakers,” said executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenburg. On Apple’s charge in the Chinese courts that Qualcomm should not be licensing out (industry) standard essential patents for a percentage of unit sales, — i.e., Qualcomm gets 5 percent of the total price of an iPhone just for having a Qualcomm technology essential to running most mobile devices inside it — the San Diego-based company says the practice is industry standard, legal and that the technologies enable Apple to innovate on new features for its products. Furthermore, Qualcomm claims that the royalties generated per device per model is capped at a certain point. “[There] is clear evidence of vibrant competition across the mobile industry,” said Derek Aberle, president of Qualcomm. “And this environment is enabled by our broad, pro-competitive licensing program.” Qualcomm will have to start responding to the fines and legal challenges throughout the next few weeks.

Starting with iOS 10.3, you can use the Find My iPhone app. Mobile by Jason Cipriani January 26, 2017 12:32 PM PST @MrCippy Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Find your lost Apple AirPods Apple has added a new feature in iOS 10.3 that lets you track down misplaced wireless earbuds. Brian Tong is using the latest beta version of the software to show you how it works... or if it actually does. by Brian Tong 1:32 Close Drag Apple's wireless earbuds are tiny and have zero strings or cables attached to them, and while that's cool, they're always at risk of being lost. To help you find a lost AirPod, they're now a part of the Find My iPhone app. In order to use the new feature, you will need to update your iOS devices to iOS 10.3. It's currently in beta, with an official release expected in the coming months. You can sign up for the beta program here. Before we cover how to find a lost pod, there are a few caveats you need to be aware of: AirPods can only be found when outside the charging case. They must be within Bluetooth range of an iOS device tied to your iCloud account in order for the current location and play sound features to work. If an iOS device isn't within range of a lost AirPod, Find My iPhone will display the last known location and cue and play sound commands. Find a lost pod Enlarge Image Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET With iOS 10.3 installed, open the Find My iPhone app. Your AirPods will show up under the list of devices linked to your iCloud account. Tap the AirPods listing to view their last known or current location. At the bottom of the screen is a button titled Play Sound. Tap Play Sound, and then wait while the app processes your request. A few seconds later, any AirPod outside of the charging case will begin playing a sound that gets progressively louder. You can then mute either AirPod, should you find one but need to continue looking for the other. Tap Stop Playing once you've found both devices. Visiting iCloud.com/find will also support finding lost AirPods, however as of this writing it doesn't seem to be live just yet. 3 ways Apple can make the AirPods better Apple's first wireless earbuds are interesting, but there's a lot more they can do to make the AirPods really special. by Brian Tong 4:39 Close Drag 8 tips and tricks for Apple AirPods: There's more to the tiny wireless earbuds than meets the eye.

TSMC changing the game, 2016 is a turning point for the Fan-Out market. The number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. KEY FEATURES OF THE REPORT - IP trends, including time evolutions and countries of patent filings - Patents' current legal status - Ranking of main patent applicants - IP collaboration, joint development, and licensing agreements - Key players' IP position, and relative strength of their patent portfolios - Patent segmentation by technology solution (chip-first, chip-last, facedown, face-up), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package), and technical challenge (warpage, die shift) - Matrix showing patent applicants and their patented technologies - Technical solutions found in patents for warpage and die-shift issues. - FOWLP IP profiles for 18 key companies, including countries of filing, patents' legal status, patented technologies, prior art strength index, IP blocking potential, partnerships, and IP strategy - Excel database with all patents (3,100+) analyzed in this report, including technology segmentation FAN-OUT IP LANDSCAPE IS THE MOST DYNAMIC IN ADVANCED PACKAGING With Apple and its A10 processor employing TSMC's InFO-PoP technology, the fan-out market has exploded. Apple's involvement will undoubtedly generate increased interest in the fan-out platform, and market revenue is forecast to reach around US$2.5B in 2021, with 80% growth between 2015 – 2017 (See Yole Développement's August 2016 report, Fan-out: Technology & Market Trends 2016). Moreover, following the high-volume adoption of InFO and the further development of fan-out wafer level packaging technologies, a wave of new players may enter the market. The supply chain is also expected to evolve, with a considerable amount of investment in Fan-Out packaging capabilities. In such a fast-growing Fan-Out market, it is essential to deeply understand the global patent landscape in order to anticipate changes, harvest business opportunities, mitigate risks, and make strategic decisions in order to strengthen one's market position and maximize return on one's IP portfolio. Knowmade has thoroughly investigated the Fan-Out packaging patent landscape (chip-first, chip-last, face-down, face-up, single-die, multi-chip module, package-on-package, system-in-package, etc.), and this report contains detailed patent analyses including countries of filing, patents' legal status, and patented technologies, as well as patent owners, their IP position, and IP strategies. More than 3,100 patents relating to over 1,200 inventions on Fan-Out packaging have been published worldwide through September 2016, coming from 100+ patent applicants. A first wave of patent applications occurred from 1999-2006, induced by Infineon. Patent applications have increased since then, with Freescale (NXP), STATS ChipPAC (JCET), SPIL, Amkor, and TSMC entering the Fan-Out IP arena. Today the number of enforceable patents is increasing worldwide, with several companies already standing out by virtue of their strong IP position. All of major players involved has filed patents on Fan-Out packaging, except for Nanium, which does not file any patents at all but instead has adopted a different IP strategy that we discuss in this report. Another special case is the presence of patent licensing companies like Polaris Innovations (WiLAN), which in 2015 acquired key patents from Infineon/Qimonda. The visibility of such companies in the patent landscape is a tangible sign of the market explodes. In the next few years Polaris Innovations could assert its patents to make money, and in this report we present its most critical patents. We have also noted Samsung's conspicuous IP presence in the FOWLP patent landscape, despite the company's unclear market position. R&D labs are also present (i.e. Fraunhofer, A*STAR, CEA), but to a lesser extent. Most new entrants in the FOWLP patent landscape are Chinese players (HuaTian Technology, NCAP, SMIC), and more recently we have observed Apple's appearance. Apple, which this year chose TSMC's InFO-PoP technology for its A10 APE, has recently filed some patents on Fan-Out wafer level packaging (chip-last, chip-first, PoP, and SiP), reflecting a genuine interest in the FOWLP platform. KNOW THE KEY PLAYERS' IP POSITION This report analyzes in detail the IP status and IP strategies of key players and provides an understanding of their patented technologies. This report also provides a ranking and analysis of the top patent holders' relative strength, derived from their portfolio size, patent citation networks, countries of patent filing, and patents' current legal status. Furthermore, we reveal the IP strength of the key IP players involved in FOWLP technologies, and we depict their competitive IP position. JCET/STATS ChipPAC and TSMC lead the FOWLP patent landscape. From a quantitative point of view, TSMC is the most prolific patent applicant of the last few years, but according to our analyses, JCET/STATS ChipPAC has by far the strongest IP position. The company has formidable "IP blocking potential" that empowers it to deter other players to patent inventions that are similar to its own IP portfolio. TSMC is the most serious IP challenger, and it may reshape the patent landscape in the near future upon the approval of its numerous pending patent applications. Both companies feature a large enforceable patent portfolio and a long remaining lifetime of their patents. PATENTED TECHNOLOGY AND IP STRATEGY he 1,200+ inventions selected for this study are categorized by technology solution (chip-first/face-down, chip-first/face-up, chip-last), process steps (die placement, molding, planarization, RDL), architecture (multi-chip module, PoP, SiP, face-to-face package, etc.) and technical challenges (warpage, die shift). In this report we also reveal the IP strategy and technical choices of the main patent assignees. A special focus is placed on technical solutions found in patents for solving warpage and die shift issues. This report also provides an IP profile for 18 key players: Infineon, NXP/Freescale, STATS ChipPAC, TSMC, ASE, Deca Technologies, Nepes, Nanium, SPIL, Amkor, Powertech Technology, Intel, STMicroelectronics, Samsung, NCAP, WiLAN, 3D PLUS, and Apple. Each company's IP profile includes the time evolution of their patent applications, a world map of granted patents and pending patent applications, and key features and strength of their patent portfolio. USEFUL PATENT DATABASE (3,100+ patents) This report also includes an Excel database containing the 3,100+ patents analyzed in our study. This useful patent database allows for multi-criteria searches and includes patent publication number, hyperlinks to the original documents, priority date, title, abstract, patent assignees, technological segments, and legal status for each patent family member.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / General Tech / Qualcomm execs fire back at Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit Qualcomm execs fire back at Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit Matthew Wilson 1 day ago General Tech Last week, we learned that Apple had launched a huge $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm over what the company deemed to be unfair licensing agreements. The US Federal Trade Commission was also suing Qualcomm for similar reasons. Since then, Qualcomm had its third quarter earnings call, during which company executives gathered around and discussed the Apple lawsuit, with Qualcomm’s CEO in particular firing back. During the call, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, the company’s head of licensing painted Apple’s lawsuit than nothing more than a money squeezing tactic. As Cnet reports, Mollenkopf said: “Apple’s complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology.” After that, Aberle chipped in, adding that “if you peel apart all of the arguments Apple’s making, we believe firmly they’re all without merit”. He then went on to say that when it comes down to it “they essentially want to pay less for the technology they’re using”. Qualcomm just recently lost an anti-trust case in South Korea, costing the company close to $1 billion. Shortly after, the FTC began looking into Qualcomm’s business practises within the US and once Apple got wind of this, they also filed a lawsuit. The case has not been to court yet but it seems like this legal battle could drag on for quite a while. KitGuru Says: Qualcomm sound pretty confident about their chances with this lawsuit, even after losing a big anti-trust case. Either way, we will have to wait and see how it goes when this eventually makes its way to trial.

Qualcomm: After Lawsuits, Chip Supplier Tells Cupertino Company To 'Bring It On' By Denisse Moreno On 01/26/17 AT 4:29 PM Close Things are getting heated between Apple and chip supplier Qualcomm, as the company’s CEO told the Cupertino-based giant to “bring it on,” CNET reported. Qualcomm CEO Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle spent the first 20 minutes of its hour-long quarterly earns call talking about the battle against Apple. Apple Vs. Qualcomm The dispute between both companies began when Apple sued Qualcomm last Friday, days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm over patent royalty practices and for allegedly engaging in anticompetitive tactics to ensure its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. Apple also accused the company of overcharging for its chips (Qualcomm is major chip supplier for Apple and its rival Samsung). Related Stories Apple Hits Qualcomm With Two New Lawsuits iPhone 8: Apple Will Enhance Siri To Compete With Amazon and Google AI But it didn’t stop there. On Wednesday, Apple filed two more lawsuits against Qualcomm in China, accusing the company of abusing its position in the chip industry, and is asking for $1 billion yuan ($145.32 million USD) in damages. In the second lawsuit, Apple alleged the chip supplier failed to live up to promises made to license "standard essential patents" broadly and inexpensively, Beijing's Intellectual Property Court said, according to Reuters. Qualcomm Retaliates Heads of Qualcomm said the lawsuits were “without merit,” adding that Apple was all about the money and is an effort to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier, CNET reported. "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Mollenkopf said. "They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." However, Mollenkopf said he was “confident” both companies will “address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past.” He added Qualcomm would continue to supply Apple with chips throughout their dispute.

By Aimee Cliff photographer Campbell Addy “I never got taught how to do radio,” Julie Adenuga said in a matter-of-fact style, before bursting into laughter. It was a bright day in December, and the 28-year-old radio DJ was reflecting on her self-started career. She was still wearing a lush fur coat and winged eyeliner from a photo shoot earlier that day, all gothic glamor behind her clear-framed spectacles. She spoke while multi-tasking with purpose, eating cheesy pizza with one hand, firing off emails with the other. “At no stage did I sit down and read a book about [DJing],” she continued. “I wouldn’t know how to do it professionally.” It’s this unstudied approach, she said, that helps create the no-bullshit feel of her Beats 1 show — and it’s true that her presenting has a casual, free-form feel that is a rarity elsewhere on mainstream radio. But whatever she tells you, Julie is a professional in her prime. Julie’s career success isn’t rooted in books, but in her genuine roots and graft in London’s tight-knit music scene. Growing up in north London neighborhood Tottenham, she watched her older brothers Junior and Jamie (MCs Skepta and JME) launch their grime label Boy Better Know in 2005, but she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do herself. She was always creative — she studied dance in school, and sang backing vocals on JME's 2008 album Famous — but didn’t see herself becoming an artist. After dropping out of an Events Management degree, she worked in an Apple store for a little under two years. Feeling restless in 2010, she persuaded the then-pirate radio station Rinse FM to give her a show with her best friend Sian Anderson, despite neither having DJed before. The result was candid and hilarious: between the latest grime, afrobeats, and electronic music emerging from London, the two would spar and banter as though no one else was listening. Within five years, Sian was holding down a show on BBC Radio 1Xtra, and Julie was hosting the drivetime slot on Rinse. Listeners around the world learned her name in 2015, when she was chosen by Apple to anchor their new station, alongside seasoned pros Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Julie’s transition to mainstream radio wasn’t just a victory for her personal career — it’s also been a big boost for artists who are often misunderstood by the U.K.’s broadcast media. In the grime and U.K. rap scenes in general, the prejudiced institutional press so often gets it wrong; artists find themselves labeled as “aggressive,” looked over for awards and radio play, and reviewed by journalists who have little understanding of their culture or lyricism. But Julie’s daily Beats 1 show feels authentic. As a day one music obsessive with a true understanding of how artists build careers, she knows exactly how to tread the line between amplifying culture and protecting what’s so special about it. Beyond radio, she’s also dedicated to opening up the music industry to young people from diverse backgrounds, launching the One True Calling mentorship scheme with Sian Anderson in 2016. As the world looks toward the U.K., Julie’s making sure the story of British music is being told right. You and your siblings are all so creative and entrepreneurial. What were the best lessons your parents taught you growing up? To have respect. In Nigerian culture, you can't give your mum or anyone older than you anything with your left hand. That's seen as disrespectful. If an auntie or uncle walks in a room, you touch the floor. Growing up as an English-born Nigerian person, there were just things that my friends at school weren't really going to understand. But I liked [those customs]. It's not a weakness to be a nice person. ADVERTISEMENT What was it like for you growing up with all brothers? I’m definitely not the girly type. I was so comfortable growing up as the only girl. I didn’t have to go play with my friends, in the house was where the fun was — with Junior, Jamie, Jason, mum, dad. I became uncomfortable when I went to secondary school, and had to be in an environment where people didn’t really understand me. It was a very strict line of, “There’s girls, and there’s guys.” I didn’t have any close female friends. I wasn’t like them. I didn’t have hairstyles, I didn’t even comb my hair. [I went] through these phases of like, doing girly things, and thinking, I don’t like this. Finding myself was basically going back to the original tomboy that I was, and remembering that I was cool. “I want to encourage people to do stuff they’re passionate about. Putting positive energy out into the world.” What surprised you in 2016? Junior [Skepta]’s Mercury award! That was something that I never thought would happen. There were so many other people in that category — David Bowie, for a start. Everything that followed on from that, from Alexandra Palace, to shooting the documentary — everything felt so rewarding. You wrote and presented Apple’s documentary on Skepta. Is it important to you to make sure that the right people are telling grime’s story? I wouldn't want someone to tell Junior's story and not tell it right. I don't like seeing things wronged that are important to me. I think [that] ruins any credibility that that story had; every point you were trying to make is overshadowed by your incorrect information. Junior is such a delicate character, he's really easily misunderstood. [In interviews] he's so careful with what he says because he's aware that anything he does say can be taken left or right. [I thought], I probably am a good person to tell this story. Because I understand. Let me see what I can do to make sure that other people don't get it misconstrued. On the flip side, do you ever get feel frustrated with being labeled a “grime” presenter/DJ, when you represent so many genres on your show? I don't get frustrated, because it's never stopped me from doing something. When I was doing an interview for the documentary with Jamie [JME], he was talking about that moment [in the early-’00s] when loads of [grime] artists started signing record deals. I [asked] him, “How did that make you feel, as someone who's been so adamant about being independent?” He was like, "It was good, I liked that Kano, Chip, all these people were getting signed and spreading the sound, or spreading our culture, spreading that we exist to other people." For me, it's the same thing. If people feel like I'm a grime person, I like that I represent a grime person who's into other things. People think that [grime fans] just like grime, they don't listen to anything else. I'm a good representation of the fact that grime isn't just a secret club. "All platforms should be accessible to all artists. A lot of music is celebrated, but [once] you reach a certain level, it’s only Adele." There was a lot of talk last year about diversity at U.K. awards shows; do you think ceremonies like The BRITs need to improve? Kanye West made me feel like awards are really bad! Because you work so hard, and then you have to be in competition with people when you didn’t even want to be. It’s not cool! Loads of people put work into their albums and then they have to lose. My [point of view] has always been, if you’re not 100% happy with how something is going, then you should just create your own — which is what [grime YouTube channel and publication] GRM Daily done with the Rated Awards. If you could wave a magic wand and fix something about the U.K. music industry, what would it be? I would change who you have to be to get to certain places. There are places that some artists will never be, because they are a person that isn’t normally accepted in that world. There are some artists that will never be on a late-night TV show, because they don’t fit into a certain box, because they don’t adhere to certain rules. I would change that. All platforms should be accessible to all artists. A lot of music is celebrated, but [once] you reach a certain level, it’s only Adele. I would change it so the English public can see all the types of music that exist out there. How do we make that happen? I need to make a late-night TV show! What are you looking forward to in 2017? Towards the end of [2016], I was very emotional about the world. Human beings have still not learned how to live on a planet with other human beings. [In 2017] I’m gonna try and do my part; I’d love for everyone to do their part, whatever that may be. I’m going to go to Greece for 10 days, because my friend is living out there — she used to work at a major label, but she quit her job [to start the charity Hope Project, building schools for refugees in Greece]. I’m launching a live music event this year as well, and I’m going to donate all the money from the ticket sales to [Hope Project]. On top of that, I am going to start a nice dinner [event] with [art director] Sophia Tassew, that should happen monthly or bi-monthly, for creative women to just come and have some food and talk about their lives with each other. I just want to have a place where [women] can mix with people that are older, in a different stage of their career. [I want to] encourage people to do stuff they’re passionate about. Putting positive energy out into the world. Have you always been so confident? I've always been loud. Sometimes people can mistake my loudness — when I was young, anyway — for confidence. In school, I was the outspoken, crazy one. But I think my confidence [came] from knowing that I'm confident about what I'm saying. Sometimes you can shout, and think: I'm shouting so people probably think I'm saying something that's right. But now, what I'm saying is something I believe in.

With Single sign-on, HBO customers will no longer need to enter their cable credentials separately when logging in to the HBO GO app. Instead, the app will use universal credentials that are stored by Apple. HBO GO is also now available in the TV app, with full support for "Watch Next" tracking functionality. Single sign-on, introduced in December, is one of the first steps Apple has made towards streamlining the television watching experience on the Apple TV and iOS devices. It's designed to allow all cable subscribers to sign in once with their cable credentials to gain access to all cable-restricted content available within apps. Single sign-on is limited to the United States and requires both service providers and app developers to implement support for the feature. Along with HBO, more than 20 popular television apps support the Single sign-on, with a full list available via a Single sign-on support document. Not all cable providers are offering support for Single sign-on yet, so the feature is limited to Cable ONE, CenturyLink Prism, DIRECTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, Service Electric, and Sling TV.

Still waiting for AT&T Uverse to get with the single sign on..... Rating: 5 Votes avanpelt 2 days ago at 12:59 pm Until it supports DIRECTV Now, I can't use single sign-on for HBO GO. C'mon, Apple and AT&T, make it happen! We still have a standard DIRECTV account for now, but we don't pay for HBO on that account; nor am I willing to pay $15.00/month or whatever extortionist pricing they're charging for HBO on a standard DIRECTV account these days. $5.00/month on DIRECTV Now is a lot more palatable. Thankfully, AT&T finally seems to be working out the bugs with DIRECTV Now. I haven't seen a QP1501 or QP1502 error for a week or more. It's looking more and more like we'll keep the service. I'm sure once they add DVR capability, it will be a $10 or $15 per month add-on for people who got the special introductory pricing. Even with an extra charge for DVR, it will almost certainly be far less expensive than the $90/month we pay for standard DIRECTV service currently. Plus, DIRECTV Now has more channels I want to watch and less garbage I couldn't care less about compared to our standard DIRECTV service. Rating: 3 Votes justperry 18 hours ago at 07:07 am Gee. Before the single sign on, I had to individually sign on to every app. Guess what, I survived. I'm sorry to hear that it is such a difficult task that you would rather not use Apple TV then go through that horrific burden of signing on. You misunderstood me, there are no TV apps from any local providers here in the Netherlands yet they have on Android/on a PC and other hardware. It's got nothing to do with single sign on, I don't even have a TV App. Rating: 2 Votes szw-mapple fan 2 days ago at 01:02 pm Still waiting for AT&T Uverse to get with the single sign on..... It would be nice if those emojis were actually added to that error page on the Apple TV. :D Rating: 2 Votes east85 2 days ago at 01:07 pm No single sign on support for DirecTV Now streaming service yet, but I'm glad the TV app is getting more relevant. Can finally use HBO GO access with it. Good stuff. Rating: 1 Votes truthertech 1 day ago at 08:27 pm Single sign on doesn't stop the collection of data. Not quite sure why you'd think it would. If Comcast allowed SSO, they would still know when you used the apps that utilize their service since they're still the conduit for the content. They also don't lose control over their customers because of SSO. SSO is a convenience feature, that's all. It doesn't hurt Comcast or any other provider. Most likely, they just don't care enough about the ATV to make the effort. No sense in ascribing malice when plain ole apathy is the most likely answer. They, like everyone, have priorities. The ATV is probably not high on their list, or anyone's list for that matter. Including Apple's. There's a lot for you to read up on to understand why cable companies and companies streaming content, e.g., Amazon and Netflix, etc., have a lot to fear from Apple TV being successful and used by their customers. To begin with, it's not just about SSO, it's even more about compatibility with the Apple TV App, where they are trying to stop Apple's vision of a single place to access all of your content, so some companies absolutely fear the success of both the App and Apple TV in general. Comcast is desperately trying to be the hub and anything that encourages folks to route through a central service like Apple TV is a threat to their model. But there's also the control of information which you are not understanding. I've attached a link to an article that explains why Netflix is very worried about letting Apple get the information about viewer habits, etc. It's very simple for them to allow compatibility with ATV SSO and the App, and it's far from "apathy" over the issue, indeed it is the opposite as they have deep concern. Here's a few things to get you started: http://seekingalpha.com/article/4038975-apples-unique-compromise-netflix-important Here's from Business Insider. "But a Comcast app on the Apple TV could theoretically allow Comcast cable subscribers to watch live and on-demand TV on TVs in their house that don't have set top boxes connected to them, which could save them from having to rent a cable box each month." And here's from Recode : "The logical answer would be that Netflix thinks helping Apple TV build a smart TV guide — one that knows what you watch and can guess what you might like to watch — could weaken Netflix’s position. That’s because Netflix has spent a lot of time learning what you watch and learning how to guess what you might like to watch. If that special sauce becomes less special — if someone else has that information — then Netflix runs the risk of becoming an undifferentiated catalog of TV shows (and a few movies)."

Rating: 1 Votes truthertech 2 days ago at 01:25 pm Makes me feel less sad, I thought most if not all TV providers had an App on the ATV in the US. Odd there are so few of them supporting AppleTV while they have Apps on other platforms, makes me wonder why. Should be clear. They are trying to slow down adoption of Apple TV to hold on to their data collection and control over customers. Same as Amazon Prime. They are refusing to push out App for ATV because they are furiously working to grab mindshare, even losing hundreds of millions on Echo, etc., because they fear ATV. That's their freedom to choose, but customer experience is worse for those who want to use ATV Rating: 1 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iMac Early 2017 Updated models with AMD graphics options expected in early 2017. iPad Pro Early 2017?

Advertisement iOS 10.3 is real and Apple’s confirmed an iOS 10.3 update for all iOS 10-powered iPhones, iPads and iPod touches. And while the the iOS 10.3 release date is a mystery, you can try the update ahead the official release thanks to the iOS 10.3 beta. The company’s iOS 10.3 beta is available for developers and those signed up for the Beta Software Program. The Beta Software Program and iOS 10.3 beta are free for anyone with a working Apple ID. While most of you will want to wait for the final iOS 10.3 release, some of you might want to give the iOS 10.3 beta a go right now. Advertisement Installing early software like the iOS 10.3 beta has its benefits but there are also some downsides you’ll want to be aware of. We touch on both here in this updated roundup. If you’re on the fence about the iOS 10.3 beta for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, take a look at our list of reasons to install and skip the latest version of iOS 10. It should help you onto one side of the fence or the other ahead of the official release later this year. Install It If You Want to Improve the iOS 10.3 Update   1 / 8 If you want to help Apple improve the overall quality of the final iOS 10.3 release you might want to download the iOS 10.3 beta on your device ahead of the official release.  Apple's beta process allows developers (and soon, those in the public Beta Software Program) to relay feedback about the update's performance. One of the main goals of the iOS 10.3 beta is to weed out major problems before the update lands for millions of devices around the world.  If you've encountered a problem with an iOS update in the past and you're tired of dealing with issues (or hearing complaints from other users), think about helping Apple out today or at some point before the final iOS 10.3 release.  Advertisement Your efforts could prevent a nasty surprise from appearing in the final version of the iOS 10.3 update for your device.    1 / 8 11 Responses 08/31/2016 Tushar Jain @ Kays Harbor Technologies Reply The blog is indeed a good read for the Iphone users.

In Q4 the company sold 62% of all the premium devices in India with price over $450 thanks to the iPhone 7 launch. In overall sales volume, however, Apple isn't anywhere close to the top. The Indian market in 2016 was dominated by Samsung at 24%, followed by Vivo at 10%. The third position is shared by Xiaomi and Lenovo with 9% each. Counterpoint points out that Chinese companies have a combined 46% market share in 2016 from 14% a year ago. Apple still struggles to obtain a sizeable market share due to high prices and low marketing spending. Apple will be hoping that its Wistron deal for manufacturing devices in India will help. It shouldlead to lowering prices due to avoiding import fees and additional taxes.

Connect your device to either WiFi or an Internet-enabled Ethernet connection, then launch the Settings app from your home screen. Scroll all the way down to System and then select Software Updates. Install the available update and let your Apple TV 4 restart to complete the installation. Advertisement You can even perform a clean installation of tvOS 10.1.1 on your Apple TV 4 if you so desire. But remember one thing – you will be required to connect your Apple TV 4 with your computer, which is impossible to do so without a USB-C to USB-C or USB-C to USB-A cable. These cables are, thankfully, easily available from outlets such as Amazon. Apple TV Universal Search Expanded To 10 More Apps, Here's All Of Them Once you have sourced yourself a cable, connect the USB-C end in your Apple TV and the other in your computer. Now launch iTunes, select your Apple TV 4 from the top left hand corner, then click on Restore Apple TV while holding down the left Shift key (Windows) or the left Option key (Mac). Select the IPSW file (linked below) when prompted for it. The entire restore process will begin immediately and the installation will take no more than 10 minutes. But remember, the clean restore process will delete everything off your Apple TV 4. Download tvOS 10.1.1 for Apple TV 4 If you love consuming content on your Apple TV 4, then please update to the latest firmware immediately. While it may not bring anything new to the table in terms of features, but it offers bug fixes and performance enhancements in certain places. That alone is enough to make this release worthy of an upgrade.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software Download: watchOS 3.1.3 for Apple Watch Now Available By Uzair Ghani Jan 23, 2017 7Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has released watchOS 3.1.3 for Apple Watch Series 2, Apple Watch Series 1 and original Apple Watch. New watchOS 3.1.3 Update Patches Lots of Bugs & Improves Performance watchOS 3.1.1 wasn’t the best update Apple had pushed out for Apple Watch users. Soon after its release, news started surfacing that the update is bricking some Apple Watch Series 2 devices, forcing the company to pull the update altogether. Since then, Apple has been rather quiet in this arena, until today, as it has released watchOS 3.1.3. I would usually go on a limb to state that you should download the update right away for your Apple Watch. But today, I’ll advise against it and wait for reports to confirm that the update is absolutely safe to download and install. Just give it a couple of hours at least and you will know for sure. Advertisement If you are feeling adventurous, then you can go ahead and install watchOS 3.1.3 right away, nonetheless. Simply place your Apple Watch on its magnetic charger and then launch the Watch app on your iPhone. Once that is done, navigate to General > Software Update. The latest update will pop right up in a few seconds. Once it does, tap on the Download and Install button to kick things into motion. Just make sure you do not touch your Apple Watch during the entire download and installation process. Since everything happens over Bluetooth therefore it will take a while. Your Apple Watch might even leave the impression that nothing is happening at all. But trust us, there is. It just takes quite a while to install. iOS 10.3 Will Automatically Upgrade Your iOS Device's File System To APFS Once the installation is complete, your Apple Watch will restart and boot back up. Just start using it as you normally would without worrying about anything at all. But like I said – it’s best to hold back at least a couple of hours to make sure that the update is not botched in any way. Given the fiasco that was laid down by watchOS 3.1.1, we highly doubt it’ll happen this time around. But it’s always a good idea to be absolutely safe no matter what. Wrap Up watchOS 3.1.3 is aimed towards squashing bugs and improving performance for Apple Watch users. Therefore, it’s recommended for everyone to go ahead and install. Just make sure you follow every single installation protocol correctly before hitting that install button. Keeping your wearable on its magnetic charing during the installation is an absolute must. There’s nothing more horrifying than watching your Apple Watch turn off during the installation process.

Straight Talk offers cheap monthly plans with plenty of minutes, texting and 4G LTE data. It is a very attractive option for users who want the new iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus but need a lower monthly bill. Advertisement With the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus buyers pay the full price for the new iPhone, but the cheaper monthly plan prices still lead to savings over traditional carriers. A Straight Talk iPhone 6 sounds like a great deal, but there are things that buyers need to know before signing up and paying $650 for a new iPhone. You can bring your current iPhone to Straight Talk, or you can now buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 direct from the carrier or at Walmart. What you need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before you buy. Advertisement A Straight Talk iPhone plan starts at $45 a month and $60 a month for international calling. For the lower price there are some trade-offs that you need to be aware of before you buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6. Advertisement This is a pre-paid carrier, but you can set up an auto-pay plan so you aren’t always entering in codes and remembering a monthly payment. You’ll need to compare a variety of plans to make sure you are getting a deal, but for the same $45 a month you get vastly less data and need to pay for the phone each month on Verizon or $60 a month for just 1GB of data. Here are 7 facts buyers need to know about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 before buying the new iPhone on this popular pre-paid carrier. Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus The great news is that you can buy a Straight Talk iPhone 6 or Straight Talk iPhone 6 Plus. Normally we see some limitations on other carriers, but Apple is letting anyone get in on the iPhone 6 Plus demand. All of these details apply to both of the new iPhones. Advertisement Read: iPhone 6 Plus Review The Straight Talk iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display and the iPhone 6 Plus a 5.5-inch display. The iPhone 6 Plus features a higher resolution 1080P display and a camera with optical image stabilization. Both new iPhones use an Apple A8 processor, come with many sensors and an all metal design. 16GB Only, But All Color Options There is no 64GB Straight Talk iPhone 6 available. Like Walmart, the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are only available with the lowest amount of storage. Although a 16GB iPhone 6 is enough for some users, there are good reasons not to buy the 16GB iPhone 6. Straight Talk offers all colors, but only 16GB options. On the upside, you can buy the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in all three colors. This includes gold, solver and space gray. Here’s help deciding which iPhone 6 color to buy. Advertisement 4G LTE Data for the Straight Talk iPhone 6 Straight Talk started offering 4G LTE data last year, which means consumers can enjoy the same speeds as on major carriers. This is key to a good iPhone 6 experience, since many apps and services assume you are using a fast connection. Watch the iPhone 6 speed test in the video below. Same Network as Major Carriers As the iPhone 6 speed test video shows, 4G LTE speeds and coverage vary between carriers. The good news about the Straight Talk iPhone 6 is that it connects to the same networks as the big names in wireless. Straight Talk does not list the specific networks but it is very likely that the Straight Talk iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus purchased from Walmart will run on AT&T. There is a chance it will run on Verizon, but it is less likely. Here’s a look at Straight Talk coverage. Advertisement Unlimited Data With a Catch When you look at the Straight Talk iPhone 6 plans you’ll see unlimited data listed, but it isn’t unlimited. Despite the need for an asterisk, Straight Talk is more up front than in earlier years. You aren’t cut off after a set amount, but your data is slowed down after you use 3GB of high-speed data in a 30 day period. You’ll still connect, but it will likely be at slower 3G speeds. At the end of the 30 day period you’ll get your high-speed data back. Straight Talk still reserves the right to cancel your line if you use too much data, but the new terms better explain limits and use. Customer Support isn’t Up to Big Names The last time Gotta Be Mobile used Straight Talk and needed support, we ended up bounced between Straight Talk and Tracfone with no real resolution to our problem. Friends and family who switched to Straight Talk and brought their own iPhones found little help when data connectivity failed, despite a simple software solution. You may receive good support, but there is not the same store and support agent availability as with the bigger carriers, so keep that in mind. No Tethering There is no support for tethering or personal hotspots with Straight Talk. That means you can’t use the new Instant Hotspot between your Straight Talk iPhone 6 and Mac running OS X Yosemite. No hotspot or tethering options on the Straight Talk iPhone 6. In fact you can’t use any type of hotspot or Internet Sharing. It is not included in any plans and if you are eventually able to use an iPhone 6 jailbreak to do this, you risk cancellation by Straight Talk. 22 Responses 10/30/2014 Alex Reply What’s wrong with this picture? 10/30/2014 Randal Reply Check out this line of iPhone compatible projectors, display your pictures, iTunes content, and any other apps while on the go with one of these PICO projectors. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjECbaLd_ac&list=UUAgQDzRklgm9Ku7EVkqBbHA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upe6CzwbhNc 11/16/2014 Amina Reply Is there a trade in option with straight talk?

It seems like the piece just drops right off with no clear ending. Also there is a typo in the silver while explaining the color options. 08/08/2015 marcela Reply if I have an iPhone 6plus 16gb for AT&T will it work with straight talk? 05/22/2016 eagerfortheinfinite Reply Yeah – Straight Talk has “Bring Your Own Phone” 08/28/2015 Joserblack Reply 0==08 my buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63 every hour on the laptop . She has been without work for eight months but last month her income was $21480 just working on the laptop for a few hours. view it now>>>>> Get More 09/09/2015 Olivia Reply @Joserblack, Your buddy’s mother-in-law makes $63/hr, and $21480/mth, last month (from posting) was July. There are 31 days in July, which means your buddy’s mother-in-law would have worked $21480/$63=341hrs, or 341/31=11hrs/day. 11*7=77hrs/wk. I mean, if I was making $63/hr, I’d probably be working 77hrs/wk too, because I’d be making $258k but I don’t think that 77hrs/wk is classified as “a few hours”. 10/20/2015 D Reply Straight Talk customer service is worse than horrible 11/27/2015 J Reply Why do you need customer service? 12/07/2015 A Reply I bought the iPhone 6s and have had a horrible month of the internet working when it wants to 12/18/2015 Stacy Snider Reply I paid a lot for the 5c iPhone in March & half the time or more the Internet doesn’t work, if I hadn’t spent so much for the phone I wouldn’t be as upset as I am. When it says unlimited data I expected to have use of it at all times not only a 1/4 of the time. People I know that bought the cheaper phones have no trouble, so I’m very aggravated!

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple sold more than 15 million iPads last quarter 01/24/2012 at 8:10 PM by Brad Linder Over and over I hear from tablet makers that there’s not really a tablet market yet… there’s an iPad market. While it seems like every day a new Android tablet is announced, nobody is selling as many tablet as Apple yet — and Apple’s numbers just keep growing. The company released its quarterly earnings report today — and announced that Apple sold 15.43 million iPads in the most recent quarter. That’s a 111 percent increase over the same period a year earlier. Apple also sold 37.04 million iPhones, 15.4 million iPods, and 5.2 million Macs. While the iPod number actually represents a 21 percent decline from a year ago, the rest of the numbers are way up and Apple had its most profitable quarter ever. If there’s one company that industry watchers expected to have an impact on iPad sales, it’s Amazon. The Amazon Kindle Fire hit the streets in November, and while the $199 tablet doesn’t have all of the iPad’s features, it does sell for less than half the price. Amazon also has popular digital music, movie, book, and app stores which give the Kindle Fire a bit of an edge over many other Android tablets. While there are indications that Amazon has sold “millions” of tablets, the company hasn’t released exact sales figures — and Apple CEO Tim Cook says he hasn’t seen any indication that the launch of the Kindle Fire helped or hurt iPad sales at all.

Image: APPLE INDIA By Sohini Mitter2017-01-25 07:32:59 UTC The latest iOS 10 beta update, 10.3, is sure to bring cheer for Indian users as Siri, Apple's digital assistant, will now be offering cricket scores, stats and trivia.   The new feature makes Apple's intent in its fastest-growing market very clear. India is a cricket-crazy nation and the demand for such content is huge. However, Apple is actually playing catch-up with Google Now which added cricket support three years ago.  SEE ALSO: Apple had its best year ever in world's fastest growing smartphone market Apple said in a statement that Siri will be pulling in information from International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments and the wildly popular Indian Premier League (IPL). Users can ask for team rankings, live scores, individual player records, tour itinerary and other general match information. Queries can be as specific as: Show me Virat Kohli stats or as basic as when is the next cricket match?  Siri will virtually be competing with a host of popular cricket apps such as ESPN Cricinfo, Cricbuzz, NDTV Cricket, etc. that offer round-the-clock coverage of the game. Other than this, iOS 10.3 most interesting, and much-needed, feature is Find My AirPods — modeled on 'Find my iPhone' — that allows users to locate their wireless ear pods within the Bluetooth range of their iOS devices, which are signed in to iCloud.  Other incremental updates include an expanded SiriKit that supports paying and checking status of bills with payment apps and scheduling with ride-booking apps; 3D Touch on the weather icon in Maps to get hourly forecasts; Maps displaying EV charging stations, just like Google Maps, and CarPlay adding shortcuts for the last two used apps.   The iOS 10.3 rolled out on Tuesday.  BONUS: Everything we think we know about the next iPhone Topics: Apple, apple maps, apps, apps-and-software, Apps and Software, Gadgets, ios 10, siri, sirikit, Sports, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Music Photos Videos Rap-Up TV Contact Advertise Artists Desktop Site Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Google+ Music Photos Videos Rap-Up TV Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube RSS Google+ Prev Next 1.26.2017 News Drake Talks ‘More Life,’ NBA Awards, & Late Night TV Goals Notorious for granting few interviews at this stage in his career, Drake surprised fans by appearing on an hour-long episode of “Cal Cast,” a podcast hosted by Drizzy’s mentor, University of Kentucky basketball head coach, John “Coach Cal” Calipari. The in-depth interview focuses on a variety of topics, including Drake’s early success with “Degrassi,” but it also features new information about Drizzy’s upcoming More Life “playlist.” “It’s something I’m doing in conjunction with Apple,” said the 6 God. “Usually, in between albums, artists would do a mixtape but I’m doing a playlist with Apple. It’s sort of the same concept. It’s not an album but it is a body of work I’m creating, just to bridge the gap between my major releases, to keep people excited, give people new music, let people know I’m still hungry.” According to Drake, the More Life process has also reinvigorated his musical goals. “In working on that, I had to ask myself the other day, ‘Why are you doing, not only this project, but why are you still doing music? What are you still doing it for?’ This was my conclusion,” he said. “I’m doing it to be remembered as a forward thinker. I want to be remembered, much like those people we just discussed [Aaliyah and Bob Marley] as an emotion-evoking artist. I want to say things I want people to remember me by. That conversation with self set me on anew path musically and I’m excited to move forward.” In the past, he says he’s faced hitmaking expectations, but now, he feels he’s on a different path. “I finally have taken a deep breath, exhaled, let all that pressure go, and now I just want to make music that I’ll want to live with forever,” he added. “Not that I haven’t in the past, but to reevaluate that goal. That’s a big thing for me, musically. Acting is another thing that I can’t wait to dive into after I release More Life, the playlist I’m working on, and finish this [‘Boy Meets World’] tour. I think I’m gonna really start to position myself in the acting world and hopefully take some great roles. I’m working on producing things and developing. That’s really exciting.” Part of that initiative, he revealed, is a new award show for the National Basketball Association. “I’m actually producing and hosting the first annual NBA Awards this year,” he said. “I get to take the reins on it…I love hosting. I love being in a room full of iconic legendary people I look up to and having that pressure to make them laugh and enjoy their evening. Hopefully that will go well.” The 6 God seems serious about that role. In fact, he says that hosting is part of his industry end game. “My end goal, crazy enough, is I want to do like, another person I really look up to and a point in time that I miss is Johnny Carson and the appeal of that sexy late night TV that’s funny,” he said. “As I continue on along this journey, I hope to get there one day as well, where I get to put on amazing suits every night. I just want to put on Tom Ford every night and sit with a glass of wine and laugh with people I’ve spent years with in the industry or friends of mine and give people something to watch every night that makes them feel good. Hopefully I’ll get there.” Listen to the interview and see more highlights from the conversation below. On work ethic: “Doing long runs is kind of the norm for me. I’ll sleep for like 6 hours and try to get a 14-hour run in on any given day, really. But when a project’s coming to a close, we’ve gone to extremes to finish things. I’ve had an air mattress set up in the recording space where I’ll try to grab 20 minutes here, an hour here. I’ve gone five days straight without a solid 6 or 8 hour sleep. Just like everything else in life, it’s just about the time you’re willing to put in.” On his biggest fear: “My biggest fear is always, when I’m not doing it, there’s someone else that’s doing it. When I take a night off for my personal life or when I choose to decompress or relax, in the front of my mind, my biggest fear is, there’s somebody that’s not relaxing right now and they’re gonna stumble upon something.” On Sade: “40…got an amazing opportunity early on in my career to work with Sade on a remix to one of her songs. I was this close to being on it, but at that point in my career, she went and put Jay Z on it, which is obviously understandable…But I missed that. A Sade moment. My star wasn’t there yet for her to hear me out. Since then, we’ve had a great relationship.” On Bob Marley: “I definitely would have loved to sit with Bob Marley. I’ve listened to his music my entire life. I’ve studied his life. Listening to him speak in interviews I’ve seen, knowing what he stood for, I would have loved to understand where his mind was at and sat and talked with him. Working together is a whole ‘nother story. If I could sit in somebody’s presence and just build, that would probably be the guy. Him or Aaliyah. On Aaliyah: “I’m obviously a huge Aaliyah fan. She’s part of the reason why I decided to sing and rap, stemming form a conversation I had with my dad about how Aaliyah, as a woman, can make music you don’t necessarily feel self-conscious to listening as a man. With a lot of female singers, sometimes, you feel like the music is so geared towards a female audience that you kind of feel weird listening to it. Aaliyah just blurred that line and I tried to do the same thing from a male perspective. I would make music for women to listen to but guys wouldn’t feel uncomfortable playing it. She was a big inspiration for me. I would have loved to sit with her and work with her. If I could work with anybody and it would sound the way I pictured it, it would probably be Aaliyah.” Comments 0 Likes 3,100 You May Also Like Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Releases First iOS 10.3 Public Beta With Find My AirPods Feature Apple Releases First iOS 10.3 Public Beta With Find My AirPods Feature Thursday, 26 January 2017 (2 days ago) Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming iOS 10.3 update to public beta testers for testing purposes, more than a month after releasing iOS 10.2 and two days after providing the iOS 10.3 beta to developers. Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the iOS 10.3 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. A major 10.x update, iOS 10.3 introduces a new "Find My AirPods" option to help users locate a lost AirPod. Located in the "Find My Friends" app, the Find My AirPods feature marks the last known location where AirPods were connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and it allows the AirPods to play a sound to make finding them nearby easier. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Along with a Find My AirPods feature, the update also includes a shift to Apple File System (APFS). First introduced in 2016, APFS is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and includes strong encryption and other important features. Apple recommends all users make an iCloud backup before installing iOS 10.3, as the update will cause the iPhone's file system to switch over to Apple File System. iOS 10.3 also introduces a tweaked app animation, a new Apple ID profile in the Settings app, a better breakdown on how iCloud storage is being used, SiriKit improvements, new iCloud analytics options, and more. For a full list of what's new in iOS 10.3 beta 1, make sure to check out our dedicated post.Related Roundup: iOS 10 Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: CNET - Affiliate - 10 hours ago< > Embed iOS 10.3 public beta 02:08 The best new features coming to your iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch with the latest iOS update.

AppDynamics: Apple Watch's Indian connection Ramco Systems to launch services through Apple Watch One of the grouses against smartwatches has been that they look geeky - something one could sport during one's morning run or with a hoodie but definitely not in boardrooms. The Apple Watch? Well, um, it's an Apple, so we'll let that pass. Let me confess: Though I'm proud to be a geek, I hate wearing those geeky smartwatches as I have a fetish for analogue chronographs. Thus, I hadn't to be coaxed to wear the LG G Watch Urbane to work. However, how the watch looks and feels depends on the size of your wrists - my wife tried it on and wasn't impressed. In the office, it was deadline time and some of us, completing the task at hand, decided to measure our heartbeat on the Urbane, to prove how cool we were. The results gave us bragging rights and me a watch with a depleted battery. That's when I realised one major shortcoming of the Urbane. One needs to carry the magnetic charging puck at all times. I had a microUSB charger and not the puck! The Urbane runs the latest version of Android Wear. The 1.3-inch brilliant P-OLED screen has three flickable menus - apps, contacts and tasks to do. One can initiate calls from the watch, though one does need the phone to talk. Also, practically all notifications (including from Truecaller, yay!) are available on the watch. As the screen is recessed from the bezel, one might face difficulties flicking away Google Now cards. It's easy to read the screen in sunlight once one has increased the brightness with the crown. The Urbane, sadly, lacks an ambient light sensor. There are many Android Wear apps available but I ended up using Google Fit and the several watch faces, especially the chronograph one, the most. The pedometer is for casual usage, as it didn't quite match with the one on a GPS watch. GPS is another thing the Urbane misses, something one doesn't expect at this price. Also, Android Wear tends to crash, especially if you get a lot of notifications together. At Rs 35,000 (available on Amazon.in for Rs 29,990), the LG G Watch Urbane will offer serious competition to the Apple Watch when it comes to India (and we hope it will be priced similarly) but Android Wear is still a work in progress. Be it so, the Urbane is the best-looking Android watch in the market now.

Let's check it out:   Apple Music is a subscription-based app, but is currently offering a free three-month trial. After the third month, one will be charged Rs 120 a month for individual accounts and Rs 190 for a family sharing account, which allows up to six people to use the service. After confirming our account, one had to set up the genres of music one liked and one's favourite artists. Once this was done, the "For You" tab started displaying curated playlists based on one's selection. As I had selected Rock and Bruce Springsteen as my favourites, besides him, I was also pointed towards Billy Joel and The Cars. I also listen to Pop sometimes and was thus directed towards Taylor Swift and Elvis Presley, whose songs I already have in my iTunes library. I clicked on the playlist titled "Born to Run: Songs about Leaving" and they sounded quite nice on my PC speakers. Next I clicked on a playlist titled "Intro to Jascha Heifetz". Well, Violin Concerto in D sounded okay on my PC speakers, but the moment I plugged in a pair of B&O H6 headphones, I was shattered. The sound didn't do justice to the tonal variations of Heifetz's violin, so apparent on the CD or in Apple lossless recordings. The culprit: Apple streams at a lower bit rate.   Next up was Beats 1 radio, which introduced me to some new stuff which I normally don't listen to. Curated playlists, such as by Rolling Stone and Shazam, and playlists by activity are cool additions. Predictions, too, were spot on. The "Connect" tab connected me with social streams of musicians. Using the app on my iPod, I streamed music already in my library, with cloud-sharing turned on. A caveat: One can't stream to multiple devices at the same time with an individual plan. My experience with Apple Music has been so far so good, but I wouldn't be streaming classical music. I might pick it over buying albums for casual listening. I suggest you do it too.

Using the app on my iPod, I streamed music already in my library, with cloud-sharing turned on. A caveat: One can't stream to multiple devices at the same time with an individual plan. My experience with Apple Music has been so far so good, but I wouldn't be streaming classical music. I might pick it over buying albums for casual listening. I suggest you do it too.

According to the report, Apple is “mulling” a joint investment with Foxconn for a $7 billion automated display facility in the United States… This isn’t the first we’ve heard about a possible United States expansion for Foxconn and Apple. Last month, it was reported that Foxconn had held discussions about an expansion. It was also reported that Apple itself had asked Foxconn and Pegatron to investigate manufacturing iPhones in the United States. Today’s report, however, details that Apple and Foxconn are considering a $7 billion joint investment in the United States. Specifically, the two parties are mulling a highly automated display facility that would eventually create some 30,000 to 50,000 jobs in the Untied States. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou told reporters that Apple is interested in the partnership because it needs the panels: “Apple is willing to invest in the facility together because they need the [panels] as well,” Gou told reporters after the company’s annual year-end party in the Nankang district of Taipei. The U.S. production site eventually would create 30,000 to 50,000 jobs, the Taiwanese tycoon said. Gou, however, expressed doubt as to whether or not Americans would be willing to pay more for a U.S.-made product. To help combat the more expensive production in the United States, Gou pleaded with U.S. officials to offer concessions on the price of land and electricity: “In the future they may be paying some $500 more for [U.S.] products, but those do not necessarily work better than a $300 phone,” he said, after urging U.S. authorities to provide concessions on land and electricity to facilitate Foxconn’s manufacturing operations. Last week, we ran a poll asking two questions: “Should Apple manufacture the iPhone in America?” and “Would you pay more for an America-made iPhone?” The majority of readers respond that Apple shouldn’t have to make iPhones in America and that they wouldn’t pay more for an iPhone made in America. Apple itself has yet to comment on the speculation that it is planning an investment in United States manufacturing, but the company is also planning an investment in manufacturing in India.

Chance Miller - Jan. 22nd 2017 3:19 pm PT @ChanceHMiller iPad poll View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Apple is expected to overhaul its iPad lineup in 2017 with new screen sizes and software capabilities, as well as perhaps a new Apple Pencil. One lingering question, however, is what kind of connectivity the new iPads will use. Since Apple put such as focus on the power of USB-C with the 12-inch MacBook and more recently the MacBook Pro, there’s been speculation as to whether or not the iPad (and iPhone) will ever adopt the standard. What do you think? Should the next iPad use Lightning or USB-C connectivity? Take Our Poll Ben Lovejoy previously outlined the possibility of Apple switching to USB-C for its iOS devices, with a third of respondents saying that Apple would make the switch in 2018. For the iPad, however, it makes sense for it to adopt USB-C as Apple continues to market the device as a PC replacement. Switching to USB-C on the iPad would open the device up to a wide-array of accessories, thus making it a more powerful and capable device and strengthen Apple’s argument that it’s a PC replacement. USB-C is also generally more powerful than Lightning. Last year, Apple released a Lightning to USB-C cable targeted at iPad Pro users. When paired with the included 29W power block, 12.9-inch iPad Pro users can take full advantage of that power to charge their device at a much faster rate. In our review, we noted that the USB-C to Lightning cable is what Apple should have included with the iPad Pro in the first place. Specifically for the iPad Pro, a switch to USB-C would keep Apple’s branding and I/O consistent. Bringing USB-C to the iPad Pro would mean that Apple’s two ‘Pro’ products would be fully embracing USB-C and the benefits that go along with it. Switching to USB-C with just the iPad, however, would create some fragmentation between iOS devices. The iPhone would still be using Lightning while the iPad would have USB-C. On the other hand, Apple has repeatedly marketed the iPad as being just as. capable as a PC, so switching to USB-C would make the device the same as the MacBook Pro. Personally, I think the eventual goal should be USB-C across the board for Apple’s devices, but having the iPad adopt it first would ease the transition for iPhone users. What do you think? Should Apple switch to USB-C connectivity with the iPad? Should the iPad only adopt it if the iPhone does as well? Let us know what you think down in the comments.

KGI first reported that Apple was working on a design with glass back, with later reports from Foxconn, glass suppliers – and a more recent report suggesting an iPhone 4-style flat-sided stainless steel band. When we ran a poll on this, the majority of you liked the idea, but suggested that flat sides with curved edges would be ideal, and that’s what we see in this latest concept …  The concept by Imran Taylor has a slim stainless steel band connecting tapered glass edges at both front and rear of the phone, suggesting something that may be more comfortable to hold in the larger sizes of current iPhones. Apple last used a flat-sided stainless steel band with glass back design in the iPhone 4s, though the iPhone SE adopts a similar shape in aluminum. The rear of the phone shows the glass back with a vertical dual-camera arrangement that has also been suggested. It additionally shows an iPad Pro-style Smart Connector that has not been rumored. Additional images show the same design in gold, rose gold and silver. There’s also a video (with terrible soundtrack), though this combines the latest images with an older concept featuring a weird dual display that has obviously been superseded by current expectations of a Home button embedded into the display itself. What do you think of the basic design? Would this mix of flat-sided stainless steel merging into curved glass edges meet concerns about comfort when holding the phone?

Some 39% think the company should do it regardless, while a further 35% say Apple should make the switch if it does it for iPhones also. However, a quarter of readers think Apple should stick with Lightning, at least for now, citing the slightly larger size and a less robust port as drawbacks of USB-C. We previously discussed whether Apple would switch from Lightning to USB-C in future iPhones, with the majority of readers expecting this to happen this year or next … Almost a third of you expected Apple to switch to USB-C in this year’s iPhone, with slightly more expecting the move next year. Only 19% thought it wouldn’t happen at all. We argued that standardising on a single port across devices would make a great deal of sense, and that Apple might in future want to take advantage of the more flexible capabilities of USB-C – alongside the faster data transfer performance. With Apple touting the iPad as a PC replacement, the arguments for a more capable port in the iPad would be even stronger. We’re currently expecting Apple to add a new size to this year’s iPad line-up, bringing in a new 10.5-inch(ish) model to replace the 9.7-inch iPad Pro while an entry-level model fills the 9.7-inch slot. There have, however, been a couple of somewhat questionable reports that this year’s iPad launch may be pushed back into the second half of the year. Apple has demonstrated a willingness to risk unpopularity in order to move quickly on port changes, dropping the headphone socket from the iPhone 7 and adopting all-USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro.

Jay-Z and crew will continue to run the service, according to the company’s announcement, but the deal will give Sprint customers access to exclusive content through the service: Sprint and global entertainment platform TIDAL today announce a game-changing partnership that will soon give Sprint’s 45 million retail customers unlimited access to exclusive artist content not available anywhere else…  “Sprint shares our view of revolutionizing the creative industry to allow artists to connect directly with their fans and reach their fullest, shared potential,” said JAY Z. “Marcelo understood our goal right away and together we are excited to bring Sprint’s 45 million customers an unmatched entertainment experience.” While it doesn’t sound like Sprint users will get free access to the service, which like Apple Music and competitors costs $9.99 month, the companies will be supporting artists with a marketing budget that will allow for exclusive content and promotions. Tidal also has a 19.99 a month tier that offers the same experience but access to high-fidelity audio. The announcement today comes on the heels of acquisition rumors for Tidal. Back in September Apple denied reports that it had interest in potentially acquiring the service, while Samsung, Google, Spotify and others had also reportedly shown interest in making a deal alongside Sprint.  Tidal’s differentiator has long been its claimed focus on artist relations, using its CEO Jay Z’s pull in the music industry to get a long list of high-profile artists to both sign-up and offer exclusive content through the service. Its efforts with exclusive content have been called into question, however, as many of the releases later found their way to Apple Music and competing services. Late last year one of its biggest supporters, Kanye West, said competition between Tidal and Apple Music was ‘hurting the music industry’ as rumors of a possible acquisition emerged.  Questions over the service’s growth and subscriber-base also emerged this month as a report from Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv discovered Tidal had inflated its subscriber numbers, putting it at around 850,000 subscribers vs the 3 million it reported back in March of last year. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure is joining the TIDAL’s Board of Directors as part of the deal. Financial details weren’t disclosed in today’s announcement. Update: Billboard quotes a source that says the deal was worth $200 million.  blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

The temporary store is now open, and we’ve now be able to see what the interior looks like. Pingie has a set of photos showing the rather less glamorous exterior and a somewhat more basic interior, with an unfinished concrete floor. The temporary store is right next door to the permanent one, and was formerly occupied by toy retailer FAO Schwarz. There had initially been some suggestion that Apple had been planning a permanent expansion into these same premises, but it was apparently deterred by the high rent being sought. Apple reportedly argued that the value of the property had been boosted by the presence of its flagship store, turning the location into something of a tourist attraction, and that it shouldn’t have to pay for the impact of its own presence. It was that same boost in rent that drove FAO Schwarz out. Apple last updated the store in 2011, when it reduced the number of sheets of glass in the above-ground cube from 90 pieces to just 15. Steve Jobs had originally wanted a 40-foot cube, but property owner Harry Macklowe pulled off a practical demonstration to convince him that 30 foot would be a better size. It’s not known exactly what Apple has in mind for the refurbished store, though it is likely to follow the Ive-designed examples set of other new or updated stores such as the ones seen in Brussels and London.

Instead, a company with existing smartphone manufacturing facilities in the country, Wistron, is said to have been selected by Apple as its primary supplier in India. It’s not the first time we’ve heard iPhone-related rumors about Wistron … Almost a year ago, it was rumored that Wistron would be a secondary supplier for both the iPhone SE and iPhone 7 Plus. Additional reports in July and December backed the idea of the company becoming an iPhone supplier in India. Apple is believed to want to reduce its reliance on Foxconn and Pegatron in order to help drive down manufacturing costs and reduce supply-chain risk. If this latest rumor is true, it would be bad news for Foxconn which saw its first ever revenue decline last year on the back of slowing iPhone sales, hoping that the iPhone 8 would see it return to growth. It was reported last year that Foxconn was planning to open a $10B iPhone manufacturing plant in India, though subsequent reports were more vaguer on whether the planned factory was in fact geared specifically to iPhone production. Apple has been involved in long-running discussions with the Indian government about its plans there. The company wants to open a number of retail stores in the country, but has been prevented from doing so by laws requiring companies to manufacture 30% of their products within the country before they can open single-brand stores. It then sought financial incentives to open iPhone factories in India, with the government reportedly looking at a creative way to agree to this without being seen to favor the company over competitors. Apple representatives are expected to meet with government officials this week.

Some users report that they were able to resolve the issue themselves by cleaning out debris, while others have had machines replaced by Apple under warranty … The “i” key on the keyboard of my 12 inch Macbook is sticking.  It does not have the same “click” or tactile feedback that the other keys have. […] Mine too – 3 months old and return key is stuck. […] Same here – left shift key and space bar. For some, the issue appears to be dirt or crumbs getting trapped in the ultra-shallow travel keyboard. Some users in the thread report success with carefully lifting stuck keys with a spudger and using compressed air to clear out dirt or crumbs. Several others say they had to return their machines to Apple for repair or replacement under warranty – only to have the same problem on the replacement. I am on the second repair this time because the “delete” key got stuck in one corner. […] I am now on my third 12″ MacBook. Had the other two replaced because of sticking keys — one edge of the key would get stuck down and no longer press-able. First the delete key. On my next machine the right shift key. On my third machine I checked all the keys very carefully before I left the store and they all worked. Always one edge or one corner that failed. Now the left shift key failed three days ago, and today the right arrow key stuck at the bottom left corner. […] I had a stuck return key after owning the computer for 2 weeks.  I brought it in.  They sent it back to apple to get fixed and they replaced the whole keyboard.  I also had problems with the wifi so they replaced the logic board too.  I picked it up this past Friday.  By Sunday, the Tab key is now sticking. Use of needles or similar is apparently not recommended. First it was the right return key that was sticking. I took it to the Apple store where the tech tried to brush any crumbs away. He said the battery was right under that key and so he couldn’t use any thing that might puncture the battery. Apple’s support document recommends using only compressed air.

Latest News Two oil ships collide off Ennore port, Indian Coast Guard on alert British actor John Hurt, star of ‘The Elephant Man’, dead at 77 Bollywood condemns attack on SLB, calls for united stand to ensure safety of artistes AAP attempting to eat ‘laddu’ bigger than its size : Rajnath Rahul Gandhi’s Punjab programme rescheduled due to pressing engagements in UP Apple, Facebook to pay for women to freeze eggs October 16, 2014 1:30 pm . Silicon Valley is known for offering incredible job perks, but Apple and Facebook have gone to a new level, offering to freeze the eggs of their female employees. Facebook said it offers egg freezing for female employees up to $20,000. The company also offers adoption and surrogacy assistance and “a host of other fertility services for male and female employees”, the company said via email. Apple also offers egg freezing and storage, extended maternity leave, adoption assistance and infertility treatments. In a statement, the company said: “We want to empower women at Apple to do the best work of their lives as they care for loved ones and raise their families.” The benefit is worth close to $20,000. A typical round of egg-freezing costs about $10,000, with $500 or more in fees each year for storage. Two rounds are usually necessary to harvest about 20 eggs, which is considered ideal. The coverage by Apple and Facebook is part of a growing trend to beef up employee perks at Silicon Valley companies, to recruit new hires. However, the option won’t be one every woman will jump at. “This is a nice perk but of course it’s a very personal decision for every working woman,” Kellye Sheehan, from Women in Technology, an organisation for women in the tech industry, said. “When to time college, grad school, babies, starting a career, accelerating a career — all of these have huge ramifications in your life and that of your significant other,” she said. “Is the employer trying to tell us something? Agreed, working mothers have a lot to juggle. But you can’t let your employer force you into something that doesn’t fit your values or personal choices.” The idea of freezing eggs for later use was first proposed for cancer patients. Chemotherapy damages a woman’s eggs, so removing and freezing eggs of female cancer patients gave them a chance at having children later on. It is also used for “fertility preservation”, the idea being that by removing and fertilising their eggs in their 20s, women will have a better chance of getting pregnant in their 30s and 40s. Reproductively speaking, a woman’s best chance at a healthy pregnancy that results in a healthy baby is in her 20s. This is because the viability of a woman’s eggs declines over time. Fertility gradually declines in the 30s and drastically from age 35, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. The actual harvesting of the eggs is not trivial. It requires rounds of hormone injections to coax the body into producing multiple eggs at once. When the eggs mature, they are harvested via a needle inserted through the vagina. Exactly how successful the woman will be at having a child if she froze her eggs in her 20s and then used them in her 30s or 40s isn’t yet known. “We don’t yet have patients who’ve cryopreserved eggs in their 20s and are coming back in their 30s and 40s, because the technology is so new,” Jennifer Eaton, the medical director of assisted reproductive technology at Duke Fertility Centre in North Carolina, said. However centres that are using the new freezing techniques report “comparable pregnancy and live birth rates among women who freeze eggs and come back,” she said. The technology used to freeze human eggs has become much better in the last 10 years and is much more likely to result in the birth of a child than in the past, Alan Copperman, the director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, said. “Five years ago, if you’d interviewed me, I would have talked about how much better a fresh egg is than a frozen egg. But in 2014, a frozen egg is almost as good as a fresh egg,” he said. In the past, doctors used a slow freezing technique with eggs. However the egg is the largest cell in the human body and contains a great deal of water. During freezing, ice crystals sometimes form, which damage the spindle apparatus within cells that pulls chromosomes apart during cell division. Today a quick-freeze process, called vitrification, is used that is less likely to create ice crystals and results in better-preserved eggs, Dr Copperman said. Egg freezing isn’t a guarantee that you’re going to have a healthy baby, but could increase the odds, according to Marcelle Cedars, the director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the University of California-San Francisco. “I always tell my patients it’s not a baby in the freezer, it’s the possibility of a baby,” she said. No matter how old a woman is when she decides to start a family, frozen eggs are the last resort.

Swift MIT spin-out Thunkable hopes its drag-and-drop app builder can be a money-spinner too Apple’s Swift Programming Language Is Now Open Source The Future Of Enterprise App Development Is Swift Browse more... iOS developers are switching to Swift according to this Upwork study Posted yesterday by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story More info leaks out ahead of LG’s G6 launch Apple’s programming language Swift has been around for a while, but iOS and macOS developers can still develop apps using Apple’s Objective-C. According to a new study from Upwork, tech companies are increasingly looking for developers who know how to develop in Swift. Upwork is the biggest freelancer marketplace in the U.S., so the company can identify trends on the freelancer market. The company’s new study finds out the fastest-growing skills in Q4 2016 compared to Q4 2015. Interestingly, the first five skills are all tech skills, with natural language processing leading, followed by Swift, Tableau, Amazon Marketplace Web Services to automatically list products on Amazon’s marketplace, and Stripe integrations. Apple first introduced Swift in June 2014 at its WWDC event. It was introduced as a modern programming language that was supposed to replace Objective-C. But these things tend to take a while, so Apple tried to make the transition as smooth as possible. Swift and Objective-C code can live side-by-side in the same application on iOS, macOS, tvOS or watchOS. The programming language has evolved quite a lot and was open sourced in December 2015. Since then, Swift has become more mature and versatile. Some developers are even thinking about using Swift for server-side development. And today’s Upwork study is a tangible sign that companies are switching their main iOS programming language from Objective-C to Swift. Objective-C was first released in the 1980s after all. So maybe it’s time to switch to a newer programming language. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Swift Apple Developer Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 8 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 9 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next More info leaks out ahead of LG’s G6 launch Posted yesterday CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Macs & Mac OS X | 23 Jan 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (4) Apple Releases macOS Sierra 10.12.3, iOS 10.2.1, tvOS 10.1.1, and watchOS 3.1.1 by Josh Centers Apple has released small updates for all of its operating systems to address bugs and security concerns. Apart from Sierra users who have experienced problems with PDFs, most users will be best served by delaying updates. macOS 10.12.3 Sierra -- The macOS 10.12.3 Sierra update includes just a few notable fixes. Preeminent among them is a fix for the bug that caused Preview to delete OCR text layers when editing a PDF (see “Sierra PDF Problems Get Worse in 10.12.2,” 2 January 2017). The update also promises to resolve a compatibility issue with PDF documents that have been exported with encryption enabled. Unfortunately, early reports from developers indicate that many other problems with PDFKit remain; Michael Tsai of C-Command said that he is still seeing previously reported user interface and rendering bugs. For instance, open a PDF in Preview, choose Tools > Rectangular Selection, draw out a selection, and press Command-C — you’ll see a horrible display bug that appears to delete the entire page until you click again. Apple also claims that the 10.12.3 update: Improves automatic graphics switching on the MacBook Pro (15-inch, October 2016). Resolves graphics issues while encoding Adobe Premiere Pro projects on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13- and 15-inch, October 2016). Fixes an issue that prevented some third-party applications from correctly importing images from digital cameras. macOS 10.12.3 is a 1.05 GB update available via Software Update. Alternatively, you can instead download a delta updater (for 10.12.2, 1.28 GB) or combo updater (from any version of 10.12, 2.04 GB). If you’ve had PDF problems with Sierra, you probably want to install it right away. Otherwise, hold off for a few days to see if any major issues are reported online. The update also includes 9 security fixes. iOS 10.2.1 -- Release notes for the iOS 10.2.1 update are minimal: “…includes bug fixes and improves the security of your iPhone or iPad.” However, there are 13 confirmed security fixes in the update. The update — 67.4 MB on an iPhone 7 Plus — can be obtained via Settings > General > Software Update or from iTunes. Since it doesn’t appear to be a major update, we recommend holding off on updating to iOS 10.2.1 for a week or so to be sure that no problems crop up. tvOS 10.1.1 -- You can obtain the tvOS 10.1.1 update on your fourth-generation Apple TV via Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software. Other than its 9 security fixes, we know nothing about the update, but can assume that it contains small bug fixes. If your Apple TV is working fine, there’s no need to update immediately, but it’s probably worth installing next week sometime if no problem reports appear online. watchOS 3.1.3 -- Like the iOS and tvOS updates, the watchOS 3.1.3 update has minimal release notes, other than the whopping 31 security fixes. The 126 MB update can be found in Watch > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Remember that upgrading requires your Apple Watch to be in range of your Wi-Fi–connected iPhone, connected to its charger, and charged to at least 50 percent. The update will likely take longer than you expect, so allot at least an hour. Given that the watchOS 3.1.1 update bricked a number of Apple Watches, and was later withdrawn and rereleased by Apple, we recommend holding off on the watch OS 3.1.3 update for at least a week, if not more. Check out the Take Control ebooks that expand on the topic in this article: Apple Watch: A Take Control Crash Course Get to know your Apple Watch and customize it to help you focus on what you care about most. Tech expert Jeff Carlson helps you understand the watch mindset, pick out your watch, set up its faces and their complications, get the notifications you want, handle communications, and learn how the controls and core apps work. iOS 10: A Take Control Crash Course Quickly master new (and existing) features in iOS 10 on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch! TidBITS Managing Editor Josh Centers helps you come up to speed with extensive coverage of iOS 10's key enhancements, including the new Lock screen, Widget screen, and Home app, plus changes to the keyboard, Messages, Control Center, Mail, Maps, Photos, Safari, and more. Sierra: A Take Control Crash Course You can head off into the wilds of Sierra with confidence when you're equipped with Mac expert Scholle McFarland's detailed what's new list. She also teaches you new Sierra features like Siri, app tabs, Desktop and Documents folder syncing, Optimized Storage, Universal Clipboard, and Picture in Picture. Still, our favorite chapter is "Discover the Little Things in Sierra," which covers the tiny changes that make a big difference.

Apple has updated all of its operating systems, with the macOS Sierra 10.12.3 update addressing the serious bug introduced in 10.12.2 that caused Preview to delete OCR text layers in PDF files. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment B. Jefferson Le Blanc  2017-01-23 23:19 Mac laptops have had problems with graphics switching ever since Apple introduced the feature. Shouldn't they have worked out the bugs by now? As for PDFKit, native PDF support has been a feature of OS X from the beginning. Now Apple has decided to break it, and for what? Does anyone know what they think they're doing? It seems Apple hasn't got a clue, since their fix doesn't fix much. But I'll certainly take Josh's advice and hold off at least till next week when he can report back with what he's learned in the meantime. I don't do anything fancy with PDFs and have had no problems with them. But then I still use Adobe Reader to view PDF documents, not Preview. Absent that issue I've had no trouble with Sierra. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that remains the case. Reply Ed Westemeier  2017-01-24 15:09 FWIW, I updated MacOS, iOS, and WatchOS this morning and the process was smooth and trouble-free. Reply Seth Anderson   2017-01-24 15:57 I’ve been unable to connect to the App Store all morning. Normally, I wouldn’t care, and would just wait a few days, but the PDF bug is really a big deal for me and my work flow, I want it to be fixed a month ago. -- update, the updates are available via support.Apple.com, if you click around a bit (for instance for US: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1905?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US ) Reply Adam Engst   2017-01-24 16:22 Oh good - they finally posted.

Sci-Tech by Andrew Morse January 27, 2017 2:37 PM PST Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Chesnot/Getty Images Siri, meet Alexa. Apple has joined the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit group researching the uses of artificial intelligence, the group said on Friday. The Partnership's members are a Who's Who of tech heavyweights that includes Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. It also includes IBM, the creator of the Watson supercomputer system that won the TV game show "Jeopardy!" "Apple has joined the Partnership on AI as a founding member," the group said in a post. "The company has been involved and collaborating with the Partnership since before it was first announced and is thrilled to formalize its membership." The Partnership's mission is "to study and formulate best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society." Joining the Partnership is the latest indication Apple is becoming less secretive. In December, the company published its first paper on AI, a sign it was ready to start sharing some of its research. Bloomberg News reported late Wednesday that Apple would likely join the Partnership. First published Jan. 26, 11:05 a.m. PT. Update, Jan. 27 at 2:37 p.m. PT: Adds confirmation of membership. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.

If you’re a member, you can grab the update over the air by going into Settings > General > Software Update on your iOS device. The update to iOS 10.3 brings with it some notable new features. Perhaps the biggest one is Find My AirPods, which will help you locate an AirPod that you’ve misplaced. Also included with the update is a switch to the Apple File System, tweaked app animation, and more. There’s no word on when iOS 10.3 will be released to the public, but we’ll likely see at least a few more beta update before it is.

On Friday, Apple filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that Qualcomm's practices have cost Apple nearly $1 billion in damages. That complaint came on the heels of two other lawsuits -- one seeking more than $145 million in damages -- against Qualcomm that Apple filed last week in China. Qualcomm is also facing allegations of unfair and anticompetitive practices by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FTC filed a complaint against the chipmaker in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Jan. 17. 'Dominance through Excessive Royalties' The complaints center on Qualcomm's pricing and patent royalty arrangements for its broadband processors that enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to help establish standards for the telecom industry. In return for that standardization, Qualcomm committed to licensing those technologies to other companies on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. However, Apple's complaints contend that Qualcomm is charging it royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." That statement, contained in an email Apple sent to a number of press outlets last week, continued, "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Apple said in the email, "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Most recently, Qualcomm has gone even further, withholding "nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple added. Apple's two complaints in China make similar allegations, according to a report yesterday by Reuters. Those lawsuits accuse Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the global chip industry and failing to license its technologies fairly as it had agreed to do. 'A Commercial Dispute over Price of IP' In a statement issued yesterday, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen the two lawsuits filed in China. The statement included comments from Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them," Rosenberg said. "These terms were consistent with our NDRC Rectification plan. Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world." During yesterday's Q1 2017 earnings call, in which Qualcomm reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4 percent and Q1 revenues of $6 billion, CEO Steven Mollenkopf noted, "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less than the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." In December, the Korea Fair Trade Commission imposed a fine of 1.03 trillion won ($880 million) on Qualcomm for what it called an "unfair business model" for licensing technology at the handset rather than chip level. In 2015, the European Commission also launched two antitrust investigations into "possible abusive [behavior]" by Qualcomm in connection with its pricing and licensing practices for modem chipsets.

Cable, Phone Company Lines Blur Next Article > Facebook Ropes in Xiaomi's Hugo Barra To Head VR Division PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 Facebook recently appointed Hugo Barra, the former Google executive who left Xiaomi Corp, to lead all of its virtual reality efforts including Oculus. In a surprise Facebook post on Wednesday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to the media, "Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team." Mark Zuckerberg's post containing the announcement was accompanied by a digitized image of the two executives in Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. Zuckerberg wrote, "Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting." On the other hand, Hugo Barra [pictured above] posted on Twitter about his signing in with Facebook, leaving his job as the head of Xiaomi's global division. Hugo tweeted, "Joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) to lead Team @Oculus. So excited! Mark posted about it here: https://t.co/kYgIniSQiM." Hugo is to now be the Vice President of Facebook's virtual reality division. He commented on Zuckerberg's Facebook post, "It's been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now we're taking selfies in virtual worlds." Mark Zuckerberg has previously hailed virtual reality as the next major computing platform after mobile devices. It was this vision that prompted Facebook to acquire Oculus. Facebook now envisions a future which is not too distant, where people use virtual reality to socialize regularly. Zuckerberg had hailed VR as "the most social platform" in World Mobile Congress last February too. He had said, "Pretty soon we're going to live in a world where everyone has the power to share and experience whole scenes as if you're just there, right there in person." Hugo Barra was recruited by Xiaomi from a top job in Google in 2013. Getting hands on him has been a major win for Facebook. He will now be heading Oculus, which has been without a CEO since last month. Commenting on Hugo, Zuckerberg said, "I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people." Barra had helped Xioami enter into VR by launching its debut VR headset. He hence brings in some experience with software and hardware connected to virtual reality into the picture. His experience will likely find use in developing Oculus' Rift and Gear products, which have not yet gained mass appeal. © 2017 Big News Network under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > Apple Set to Join Microsoft, Google, Facebook, in AI Research Group Apple Set to Join Microsoft, Google, Facebook, in AI Research Group Thursday, 26 January 2017 (2 days ago) Apple will take a significant step toward disclosing more of its artificial intelligence research this week by becoming a member of a non-profit AI research consortium founded by five of the tech industry's biggest players. Last September, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and IBM publicly announced The Partnership on AI, an organisation established "to study and formulate best practices, to advance the public's understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society". As one of the biggest researchers in AI, Apple's name was conspicuously absent, but that looks set to change in the coming days, following a Bloomberg report on Thursday that Cupertino is ready to add its name to The Partnership's list of corporate heavyweights.According to its website, the Partnership on AI intends to conduct research, organize discussions, share insights, provide thought leadership, consult with relevant third parties, respond to questions from the public and media, and create educational material that advance the understanding of AI technologies including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning. Apple's imminent membership is just the latest indication that the company is prepared to reveal more of its work in areas of artificial intelligence. At an invitation-only AI conference held in Barcelona last month, where Apple employees discussed their work in various related fields, the company announced it would begin allowing its AI and machine learning researchers to publish and share their work in papers. Two weeks later, the first paper was published, covering Apple's work on intelligent image recognition. Cupertino is also known to be working on a range of other AI projects, including health and vital signs, LiDAR, neural networks, intelligent assistant and language modeling, and activity recognition. While the Partnership's founding members are committed to publishing a wide range of research under an open license, just how much of this work will be shared remains unclear, but we should know more soon. Apple is expected to announce its membership in the Partnership later this week.Tag: artificial intelligence Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Tech - 2 days ago< > Embed Apple Joins AI Research Group 00:45 According to a Bloomberg News report on Wednesday, Apple is making preparations to join the Partnership on AI, a group researching the uses of artificial intelligence.

Upon its release, fellow Persuasions member Jimmy Hayes caused a bit of controversy when he claimed that Jamie xx hadn't cleared a sample of the Persuasions' "Good Times," only to later rescind his accusations and admit, "I was told about it but forgot."   Now, though, bandmate Lawson is going after Apple for using the Jamie xx song in an iPhone 6 ad — but he's not claiming a typical case of recording infringement. In fact, as The Hollywood Reporter points out, Lawson likely doesn't own the rights to "Good Times." Rather, Lawson claims that Apple and its ad company Media Arts Lab have violated his right of publicity and breached collective bargaining contracts. The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, states: "Lawson's voice is prominent and recognizable in the Apple Commercial. Lawson is informed and believes and on that basis alleged that Plaintiff's voice was recognized by fans of his who saw the commercial and those fans were deceived into falsely believing that Lawson endorsed Apple and the iPhone and/or that Lawson consented to the use of his voice to advertise Apple's products."   It goes on to claim that commercial also violated the collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild (under which the commercial falls under the jurisdiction of) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Arts (under which the recording of "Good Times" falls under the jurisdiction of). Lawson claims that the process of "separately negotiated consent of the recording artists" was not obtained.   Finally, Lawson's suit claims that six months after the commercial started airing, Media Arts Lab tried to resolve the issue of not obtaining permission to use his voice by offering him "the minimum amount allowed under SAG rules for the use of his voice as if Lawson was a hired background singer instead of one of the most lauded a cappella singers in modern recording history." Jamie xx's camp has yet to comment on the situation. Watch the commercial in question below.

An Apple spokesperson has confirmed that Duffy, who ended up at the Google-owned Nest after the company he founded was acquired in 2014, will be joining Apple but declined to comment on his role. Like other recent high-profile hires by Apple, people close to the matter have speculated that Duffy is “likely to be leading a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company.” Duffy’s background also suggests a possibility that his role may be related to Apple’s HomeKit home automation framework.

According to Philip Elmer-DeWitt, the creator of the Apple 3.0 website, 12 institutional and 5 independent analysts all forecast a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales during the December quarter. The average sales figure from the 17 analysts was 77.3 million iPhones, which would represent a 3.4% increase over the 74.8 million Apple reported for the fourth quarter of 2015. Analysts' estimates ranged from a low of 75 million to a high of 80 million. Apple set a record for iPhone sales in 2015's December quarter, but in each of the following three quarters, its iPhone numbers were down from the prior year's. The nine-month stretch was the only period in the iPhone's history during which Apple sold fewer smartphones than in the same span a year earlier. If the analysts Elmer-DeWitt polled are accurate -- at times, averages of their forecasted numbers have been prescient -- it would bolster the theory that 2016's downturn was largely due to the enormous sales of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014-2015. Those models fueled increases of up to 46%, posting numbers that were ultimately impossible for the follow-on iPhone 6S and 6S Plus to match. Apple will reveal the number of iPhones sold in the December quarter on Tuesday, Jan. 31, shortly before it hosts a conference call with Wall Street. That earnings call, audio-cast on Apple's website, will begin at 2 p.m. PT (5 p.m. ET). Computerworld/Data: Apple, Philip Elmer-DeWitt Apple will report a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales next week, say 17 financial analysts, who forecast an average boost of 3.4%.

Global perspective. advertisement Apple files lawsuits against Qualcomm in China Thursday 26 January 2017 at 12:17 PM ET by Taylor Isaac ©  WikiMedia (futase_tdkr) [JURIST] Technology giant Apple [corporate website] on Wednesday announced two lawsuits against Qualcomm [corporate website] in Beijing's Intellectual Property Court. The lawsuits [WSJ report], similar to the one filed in a US district court [JURIST report] last week, allege a violation of China's antimonopoly law as well as unfair and unreasonable licensing practices. Apple is seeking 1 billion yuan (USD $145 million) in damages for the antimonopoly suit. Qualcomm claims the suits in China are an attempt by Apple to get the technology for less money. The suit in the US seeks $1 billion in damages, with Apple claiming that Qualcomm, despite being only one of many manufacturers involved in the production of Apple's iPhone, insisted on onerous and allegedly illegal prices for technology. Apple also claimed that Qualcomm took punitive measures against it when Apple cooperated in a South Korean investigation. These lawsuits follow a US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) [official website] suit against Qualcomm claiming the company monopolized a semiconductor device [JURIST report] used in cellphones. According to the FTC, Qualcomm requires cellphone manufacturers to agree to license terms which would require paying higher royalty fees to Qualcomm if the manufacturer uses a competitor's device and that the company refuses to provide licenses for competitors.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the iOS 10.3 beta update over-the-air after installing the proper certificate on their iOS device. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas are not stable and include many bugs, so they should be installed on a secondary device. A major 10.x update, iOS 10.3 introduces a new "Find My AirPods" option to help users locate a lost AirPod. Located in the "Find My Friends" app, the Find My AirPods feature marks the last known location where AirPods were connected to an iOS device via Bluetooth and it allows the AirPods to play a sound to make finding them nearby easier. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. Along with a Find My AirPods feature, the update also includes a shift to Apple File System (APFS). First introduced in 2016, APFS is optimized for Flash/SSD storage and includes strong encryption and other important features. Apple recommends all users make an iCloud backup before installing iOS 10.3, as the update will cause the iPhone's file system to switch over to Apple File System. iOS 10.3 also introduces a tweaked app animation, a new Apple ID profile in the Settings app, a better breakdown on how iCloud storage is being used, SiriKit improvements, new iCloud analytics options, and more. For a full list of what's new in iOS 10.3 beta 1, make sure to check out our dedicated post.

Even allows you to remove them from your account. THAT has been a missing feature since day one. Previously doing so required access to the device OR it needed to be done in iTunes.

Why? While it is true that Apple typically releases developer betas and public betas at the same time, the company always waits a while between a developer release and a public beta release with the first beta for each new iOS version. Since public betas are installed on iPhones and iPads owned by end users while developer betas are theoretically only installed on test devices, Apple just likes to ensure that there aren’t any major bugs before new software is pushed out to the public. Well, it’s been a day and iOS 10.3 public beta 1 is now available to download on any compatible iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Don't Miss: Everything new in iOS 10.3 We went over all of the new features added to iOS 10.3 in a post earlier today, but we’ll give you a quick rundown again right here. “Find My AirPods” is the big addition, allowing AirPods owners to locate lost AirPods by viewing their last known location on a map. There are also new app transition animations, a new Apple ID profile page in Settings, a new 3D Touch feature in the Maps app, and more. But now it’s time to stop reading about iOS 10.3 public beta 1 and start installing iOS 10.3 public beta 1. Apple’s new public beta is available as an over the air (OTA) download to anyone registered with Apple’s public beta program. Simply open the Settings app, go to General and tap Software Update, and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install iOS 10.3 public beta 1. Here’s the fill list of compatible devices: iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s iPhone 5c iPhone 5 iPad Pro 12.9-inch iPad Pro 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad 4th generation iPad mini 4 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 2 iPod touch 6th generation Trending right now: Amazon sale drops Fire Essentials Bundle to its lowest price ever Netflix for Android just got a new feature iPhone owners will never see New report offers first leaked details on Google’s Pixel 2 phone See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Look at one of the most stunning iPhone 8 concept designs we’ve ever seen BGR News Get a $100 AT&T Visa® Reward Card DIRECTVSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Apple’s iPhone 8 might look a lot like this BGR News Just when you thought Windows Phone couldn’t get any more dead… BGR News Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo Finance

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the 10.12.4 macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website, which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings iOS's popular Night Shift mode to the Mac, allowing users to cut down on blue light exposure. Believed to affect sleep by upsetting the body's circadian rhythm, blue light is thought to be more harmful than yellow light. With Night Shift, the Mac's display automatically shifts from cool to warm at sunset and then shifts back at sunrise. Users can also set custom times for the display's colors to shift, or toggle the effect on manually. A Toggle to turn Night Shift on is available in the Notification Center, and Siri can also be used to activate the feature. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 also includes Shanghainese dictation support, cricket scores for Siri, and PDFKit improvements.

Is that really what the owners want? How very sad. Even after adding about a 100 to my ignore list, I still see this nonsense. I guess it's time to add more. However it would appear the supply of useless contributors is endless. How many ignored people can be added to the list by the forum software? What's the point of my post? Seems fairly clear--asking another user about a post that that user made which was fairly generic and/or vague at best, to see if there was anything in particular to it. (Especially in the context of the user making similar generic/vague posts of that nature before.) Not sure how anything else you brought up ties to anything related to my post. On the other hand, seems like what you bring up can quite directly apply to some of your own posts, like this one: What gets me is when I'm sitting at home watching a movie and I hear dogs barking outside, loud trucks idling, and people talking. This is unacceptable and has to end. And BTW, when I'm going to drive on the freeway at rush hour, I want all those other cars off the freeway!

I haven't logged into MacRumors for so long I can't even remember what my account used to be, and I reregistered just to say THANK YOU. I love Apple of old, and I love Apple now. Maybe those who don't feel the same can switch to Windows and Android, or at least start adding value to the forum. Regarding the actual topic, I've used f.lux for years, including on jailbroken iPhones back when I did that. Night Shift functions way more smoothly, and I'm expecting the same to apply to macOS. I still have issues on there with f.lux, where sometimes it'll flicker, or if I quit it it won't disable. These are the cons of switching through color profiles to make it work. However, the ability to disable per-app may be missing (anyone looked into it?), which I'll submit a feature request to Apple for.

Beta testers who have signed up for Apple's beta testing program will receive the 10.12.4 macOS Sierra beta through the Software Update mechanism in the Mac App Store. Those who want to be a part of Apple's beta testing program can sign up to participate through the beta testing website ('https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/'), which gives users access to both iOS and macOS Sierra betas. Betas should not be installed on a primary machine due to the potential for instability.

Believed to affect sleep by upsetting the body's circadian rhythm, blue light is thought to be more harmful than yellow light. With Night Shift, the Mac's display automatically shifts from cool to warm at sunset and then shifts back at sunrise. Users can also set custom times for the display's colors to shift, or toggle the effect on manually. A Toggle to turn Night Shift on is available in the Notification Center, and Siri can also be used to activate the feature. macOS Sierra 10.12.4 also includes Shanghainese dictation support, cricket scores for Siri, and PDFKit improvements.

Qualcomm, which is a major supplier of wireless connectivity chips to Apple and Samsung devices, is also alleged to have under delivered on promises it made to license patents widely and inexpensively, according to Reuters. Apple is now seeking 1 billion yuan (£115 million) in damages as a result. The lawsuit comes after the FTC issued a complaint against Qualcomm on 17 January, in which the company was accused of using anti-competitive tactics. Apple also issued a complaint on Friday to the federal court in California, requesting $1 billion in rebates for overcharged Qualcomm chips. It now appears the lawsuit has spread to Qualcomm's eastern divisions. Although the company has not seen the lawsuit brought by Apple, Qualcomm stated the complaint "alleges a violation of China's Anti-Monopoly Law, and the other requests a determination of the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple for Qualcomm's cellular standard essentials patents". Qualcomm claimed it has attempted to settle the matter with Apple, but insist the tech giant is simply trying to manoeuvre for a better deal. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology," said Don Rosenberg, executive VP and general counsel of Qualcomm. "Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them." But Apple contests that it's regularly charged over "five times" more in its transactions than other companies, according to a statement to Business Insider, relating to its complaint on Friday. "Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined," the company said. "To protect this business scheme, Qualcomm has taken increasingly radical steps - most recently withholding nearly $1 billion in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," it added. Pressure is mounting against Qualcomm as the company faces legal action for unfair practices around the globe. In February 2015 Qualcomm was forced to hand over $975 million to China following a yearlong antitrust probe, and was most recently fined $854 million by South Korean authorities for unfair practices in patent licensing.

On Friday, Apple filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that Qualcomm's practices have cost Apple nearly $1 billion in damages. That complaint came on the heels of two other lawsuits -- one seeking more than $145 million in damages -- against Qualcomm that Apple filed last week in China. Qualcomm is also facing allegations of unfair and anticompetitive practices by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FTC filed a complaint against the chipmaker in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Jan. 17. 'Dominance through Excessive Royalties' The complaints center on Qualcomm's pricing and patent royalty arrangements for its broadband processors that enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to help establish standards for the telecom industry. In return for that standardization, Qualcomm committed to licensing those technologies to other companies on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. However, Apple's complaints contend that Qualcomm is charging it royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." That statement, contained in an email Apple sent to a number of press outlets last week, continued, "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Apple said in the email, "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Most recently, Qualcomm has gone even further, withholding "nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple added. Apple's two complaints in China make similar allegations, according to a report yesterday by Reuters. Those lawsuits accuse Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the global chip industry and failing to license its technologies fairly as it had agreed to do. 'A Commercial Dispute over Price of IP' In a statement issued yesterday, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen the two lawsuits filed in China. The statement included comments from Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them," Rosenberg said. "These terms were consistent with our NDRC Rectification plan. Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world." During yesterday's Q1 2017 earnings call, in which Qualcomm reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4 percent and Q1 revenues of $6 billion, CEO Steven Mollenkopf noted, "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less than the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." In December, the Korea Fair Trade Commission imposed a fine of 1.03 trillion won ($880 million) on Qualcomm for what it called an "unfair business model" for licensing technology at the handset rather than chip level. In 2015, the European Commission also launched two antitrust investigations into "possible abusive [behavior]" by Qualcomm in connection with its pricing and licensing practices for modem chipsets.

Cable, Phone Company Lines Blur Next Article > Facebook Ropes in Xiaomi's Hugo Barra To Head VR Division PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 Facebook recently appointed Hugo Barra, the former Google executive who left Xiaomi Corp, to lead all of its virtual reality efforts including Oculus. In a surprise Facebook post on Wednesday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to the media, "Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team." Mark Zuckerberg's post containing the announcement was accompanied by a digitized image of the two executives in Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. Zuckerberg wrote, "Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting." On the other hand, Hugo Barra [pictured above] posted on Twitter about his signing in with Facebook, leaving his job as the head of Xiaomi's global division. Hugo tweeted, "Joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) to lead Team @Oculus. So excited! Mark posted about it here: https://t.co/kYgIniSQiM." Hugo is to now be the Vice President of Facebook's virtual reality division. He commented on Zuckerberg's Facebook post, "It's been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now we're taking selfies in virtual worlds." Mark Zuckerberg has previously hailed virtual reality as the next major computing platform after mobile devices. It was this vision that prompted Facebook to acquire Oculus. Facebook now envisions a future which is not too distant, where people use virtual reality to socialize regularly. Zuckerberg had hailed VR as "the most social platform" in World Mobile Congress last February too. He had said, "Pretty soon we're going to live in a world where everyone has the power to share and experience whole scenes as if you're just there, right there in person." Hugo Barra was recruited by Xiaomi from a top job in Google in 2013. Getting hands on him has been a major win for Facebook. He will now be heading Oculus, which has been without a CEO since last month. Commenting on Hugo, Zuckerberg said, "I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people." Barra had helped Xioami enter into VR by launching its debut VR headset. He hence brings in some experience with software and hardware connected to virtual reality into the picture. His experience will likely find use in developing Oculus' Rift and Gear products, which have not yet gained mass appeal. © 2017 Big News Network under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Instead of a dozen grocery-store roses, give your love a bouquet of blooms that are fresh, beautiful and locally grown right here in New Orleans -- on urban farms, no less. Why? Local flower farmers offer organically grown arrangements filled with flowers you won't find in many stores. For a more long-lasting surprise, give your sweetie a "flower share." The farm subscriptions offer bouquets every week for four weeks beginning in the spring (typically April), so she'll remember your love long after Cupid's big day. Pistil & Stamen Flower Farm and Studio Denise Richter and Megan McHugh operate Pistil & Stamen flower farm on urban gardens on St. Claude Avenue and Oretha Castle Haley Boulevard. This year, they're offering Valentine's Day bouquets by pre-order for delivery or pick-up, as well as selling flowers on Feb. 14 from 2-7 p.m. in their studio, 1900 St. Claude Ave. Though the flowers may vary, bouquets may contain snapdragons and anemones, available in classic vases or in handmade ceramics by local potter Osa Atoe. In the spring, Pistil & Stamen also will have a flower share program. Subscribers will receive four weeks of fresh flowers (four bouquets for pick-up) in April or May for $80. Flowers can be picked up on Friday or Saturday of each week at Arrow Cafe, 628 N. Rampart Ave. Depending on the weather and other variables, "April flower share members can anticipate sweet peas, anemones, ranunculus, daffodils, snapdragons, sweet William and other beautiful flowers," McHugh said. "May flower share members can anticipate lisianthus, cosmos, lilies, scabiosa, foxglove, delphinium and other premium flowers." For details, go to pistilandstamenflowers.com.  Flowers grown by Marguerite "Margee" Green of Cow Apple Horticulture in St Roch. Photo provided by Cow Apple Horticulture  Cow Apple Horticulture Horticulturist and florist Marguerite "Margee" Green operates her own flower farm, Cow Apple Horticulture, as well as runs Press Street Gardens, the New Orleans Center for the Creative Arts' school farm. For Valentine's Day, Cow Apple is offering bouquets to be delivered Feb. 13-14 or picked up on Feb. 14 at her Bywater studio, 4200 Dauphine St. Orders must be placed at www.cowapple.com. "Flower availability will vary depending upon weather, but customers can look forward to snapdragons, narcissus, tulips, sweet peas and fresh, fragrant herbs," she said. Prices range from $25 to $65 with a delivery option. "Other locally made add-ons are available such as cards and ceramic vases," she said. Cow Apple also will offer a spring flower share program from April through June. Subscribers will receive fresh bouquets to pick up weekly, with prices ranging from $75 for a month's subscription to $205 for a three-month subscription.  Flowers by Pistil & StamenJacqueline Kay Photography  Press Street Gardens Press Street Gardens will offer a twist on a flower share idea this year. For $65, customers "will receive a flat of specialty cut flower transplants to grow in their garden," Green said. "Trays are limited, and sales begin Feb. 1 and run through Valentine's Day. This is perfect for a gardener who wants to grow her own bouquets." To sign up, go to shop.noccainstitute.com. Nectar & Blossom Florist and flower-grower Danielle F. Martin operates Nectar and Blossom Floral and Design Studio in Old Arabi.

Subscriptions are on sale for $75 until Feb. 14 and will go to $80 after that.  Subscribers may choose between April or May, and pickup will be on Fridays at The Coffee House, 7265 St Claude Ave., Arabi.  To sign up, visit nectarandblossom.com or email nectarandblossom@gmail.com. Nola Tilth & St. Claude Flower Farm Nola Tilth, a community garden and flower farm in New Orleans East, and St. Claude Flower Farm, an organic urban garden in the Upper 9th Ward, offer two spring flower share options.

The group, Partnership on AI, was established back in September with its goals to achieve ethics, fairness, inclusivity, privacy and trustworthiness — values you’d expect Apple to believe in. At the tamest he company didn’t jump in on the boat but that may be changing. Apple has agreed to now join the non-profit, Bloomberg reports. Apple’s admission into the group could be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives at Apple and the Partnership on AI declined to comment. There’s a high chance that Apple decided not to join in the first place due to its secrecy culture. The group also focuses on collaboration between researchers working for different companies. To provide a regular, structured platform for AI researchers and key stakeholders to communicate directly and openly with each other about relevant issues. Over the past several months it seems as Apple is opening up its AI research teams allowing them to publish research papers. This is likely due to the fact that most researchers wouldn’t join Apple if the company didn’t allow them to share their work. Tags: artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Partnership on AI About Peter Cao Peter has a passion for music and technology. He conceits himself by religiously rocking the Apple brand.

Register for an Exam Today> Qualcomm Hit with More Apple Lawsuits By Shirley Siluk / NewsFactor Business Report PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 Chipmaking giant Qualcomm is facing yet more accusations that its business practices are unfair and anticompetitive, with Apple filing lawsuits in the U.S. and China. On Friday, Apple filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California alleging that Qualcomm's practices have cost Apple nearly $1 billion in damages. That complaint came on the heels of two other lawsuits -- one seeking more than $145 million in damages -- against Qualcomm that Apple filed last week in China. Qualcomm is also facing allegations of unfair and anticompetitive practices by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. The FTC filed a complaint against the chipmaker in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Jan. 17. 'Dominance through Excessive Royalties' The complaints center on Qualcomm's pricing and patent royalty arrangements for its broadband processors that enable mobile phones to connect with cellular networks. Qualcomm's modem chip design was used to help establish standards for the telecom industry. In return for that standardization, Qualcomm committed to licensing those technologies to other companies on FRAND (fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory) terms. However, Apple's complaints contend that Qualcomm is charging it royalties for "technologies they have nothing to do with." That statement, contained in an email Apple sent to a number of press outlets last week, continued, "The more Apple innovates with unique features such as TouchID, advanced displays, and cameras, to name just a few, the more money Qualcomm collects for no reason and the more expensive it becomes for Apple to fund these innovations." Apple said in the email, "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties. Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined." Most recently, Qualcomm has gone even further, withholding "nearly $1B in payments from Apple as retaliation for responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies investigating them," Apple added. Apple's two complaints in China make similar allegations, according to a report yesterday by Reuters. Those lawsuits accuse Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the global chip industry and failing to license its technologies fairly as it had agreed to do. 'A Commercial Dispute over Price of IP' In a statement issued yesterday, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen the two lawsuits filed in China. The statement included comments from Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them," Rosenberg said. "These terms were consistent with our NDRC Rectification plan. Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world." During yesterday's Q1 2017 earnings call, in which Qualcomm reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4 percent and Q1 revenues of $6 billion, CEO Steven Mollenkopf noted, "Apple's complaint contains a lot of assertions. But in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property. They want to pay less than the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology." In December, the Korea Fair Trade Commission imposed a fine of 1.03 trillion won ($880 million) on Qualcomm for what it called an "unfair business model" for licensing technology at the handset rather than chip level. In 2015, the European Commission also launched two antitrust investigations into "possible abusive [behavior]" by Qualcomm in connection with its pricing and licensing practices for modem chipsets.

Qualcomm Hit with More Apple Suits Next Article > Facebook Ropes in Xiaomi's Hugo Barra To Head VR Division PUBLISHED: JANUARY 26 2017 Facebook recently appointed Hugo Barra, the former Google executive who left Xiaomi Corp, to lead all of its virtual reality efforts including Oculus. In a surprise Facebook post on Wednesday night, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed to the media, "Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform. They'll enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before. Hugo is going to help build that future, and I'm looking forward to having him on our team." Mark Zuckerberg's post containing the announcement was accompanied by a digitized image of the two executives in Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters. Zuckerberg wrote, "Hugo's in China right now, so here we are together in VR. It seems fitting." On the other hand, Hugo Barra [pictured above] posted on Twitter about his signing in with Facebook, leaving his job as the head of Xiaomi's global division. Hugo tweeted, "Joining Facebook as VP of virtual reality (VPVR!) to lead Team @Oculus. So excited! Mark posted about it here: https://t.co/kYgIniSQiM." Hugo is to now be the Vice President of Facebook's virtual reality division. He commented on Zuckerberg's Facebook post, "It's been a dream of mine to work in virtual reality even back when AR/VR were just figments of science fiction; now we're taking selfies in virtual worlds." Mark Zuckerberg has previously hailed virtual reality as the next major computing platform after mobile devices. It was this vision that prompted Facebook to acquire Oculus. Facebook now envisions a future which is not too distant, where people use virtual reality to socialize regularly. Zuckerberg had hailed VR as "the most social platform" in World Mobile Congress last February too. He had said, "Pretty soon we're going to live in a world where everyone has the power to share and experience whole scenes as if you're just there, right there in person." Hugo Barra was recruited by Xiaomi from a top job in Google in 2013. Getting hands on him has been a major win for Facebook. He will now be heading Oculus, which has been without a CEO since last month. Commenting on Hugo, Zuckerberg said, "I've known Hugo for a long time, starting when he helped develop the Android operating system, to the last few years he's worked at Xiaomi in Beijing bringing innovative devices to millions of people." Barra had helped Xioami enter into VR by launching its debut VR headset. He hence brings in some experience with software and hardware connected to virtual reality into the picture. His experience will likely find use in developing Oculus' Rift and Gear products, which have not yet gained mass appeal. © 2017 Big News Network under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple is joining the 'Partnership on AI' to Advance Public Understanding of Artificial Intelligence Technologies | Main | Surprisingly Facebook was granted a Patent for 3D Gesturing on a Smartphone earlier this Month » January 26, 2017 Apple Patent Reveals New MacBook Hinge System with Torsion Bar to Provide Variable Cover Resistance   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals an invention relating to a MacBook hinge system that uses a torsion bar in its construction. Scott Krahn is credited as the inventor of a 2014 'Friction Hinge System' patent for Reel Precision Manufacturing Corp in Minnesota. Today Krahn is credited as the inventor of an Apple invention for a 'Torsion Bar Design' that is part of a Notebook hinge system that could provide variable cover resistance making it easier to open and close a MacBook.     Apple notes in their patent filing that "It is often desirable to provide an assistive biasing force when moving the upper component of the laptop between closed and open positions. Unfortunately, a conventional friction-based hinge assembly provides a fixed resistance over a range of motion of the hinge assembly. Consequently, any variations made in the amount of resistance applies to the entire range of motion and cannot be targeted to particular portions of the range of motion or in particular directions.   Apple's invention describes various embodiments that relate to torsion bar assemblies suitable for adjusting a resistance of pivotally coupled components.   The idea appears to be creating a hinge system that will be easier and faster to open the lid of a MacBook before the resistance begins to kick in allowing the user to adjust the display to their liking.   Apple notes that while a friction-based hinge allows pivotally coupled components of the electronic device to be maintained in any number of angular positions with respect to one another, the friction-based hinge generally provides only a consistent amount of force throughout an angular travel of the friction based hinge, i.e. the response force profile of a friction-based hinge is a constant resistive force.   To vary an amount of force supplied in response to rotation of the pivotally coupled components, a torsion bar can be added to the friction-based hinge to provide one means for changing an amount of force required when rotating various portions of an electronic device. This may be desirable when the amount of force required during rotation in one direction is desired to be noticeably less than the amount of force required during rotation in another direction.   Similarly, this may also be desirable when the amount of force required during rotation is desired to vary with the angle of rotation, thereby producing a varied response force profile.   Apple's patent FIG. 1A noted below shows a perspective view of a Notebook; FIG. 3B is a perspective view of a two bar torsion bar assembly; FIGS. 4D and 4D show a view of torsion bar assemblies with varying cross-sectional sizes; FIGS. 7A-7B show perspective views of a hollow hinge assembly integrated with a torsion bar assembly.   Apple's patent application 20170023984 was filed back in Q3 2015. This is a fairly complex invention that engineers will appreciate to review here. Considering that this is a patent application, it's unknown if Apple will ever adopt such a MacBook hinge system or its timing to market should it be given the green light of approval.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search LG G6 reportedly picks waterproofing over removable battery Chris Davies - Jan 26, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit More signs point to the LG G6 ditching the features that have made the G-Series the choice for Android power-users, following Samsung and Apple in emphasizing style instead. Whispers about the G6, which is expected to be officially unveiled in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress 2017 next month, have circulated for some months now, with speculation about what LG would do following the less-than-enthusiastic reception of the LG G5. Now, with the latest batch of leaks, the strategy is starting to get clearer. With the G5, LG had opted for a fairly controversial feature set. Not only did the phone stick with a removable battery design – something Samsung, Apple, and most other smartphone manufacturers have shifted away from, in the name of convenience and reducing overall device thickness – but it introduced a novel modular system. That allowed the base of the G5 to be removed, and then replaced with different attachments such as better speakers. Unfortunately, while that left the G5 with plenty of geek-appeal, it nonetheless lacked sales-appeal. LG demurred at first, but later confirmed that it was abandoning the modular approach in the G6. However at the same time it’s also apparently ditching the removable battery. According to a source familiar with the upcoming flagship smartphone speaking to CNET, LG’s decision came down to weighing the popularity of being able to switch out the battery versus that of waterproofing the phone. With Apple’s iPhone 7 now water-resistant, the Galaxy S7 similarly protected, and this year’s Samsung Galaxy S8 almost certain to offer the same, LG’s devices were beginning to look under-equipped. Though it’s not impossible to offer a removable battery in a waterproof handset, it’s a lot trickier than sealing the whole thing, plus generally more bulky. It’s not the only compromise. As per previous reports, LG is said to be opting not to use Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 835 chipset, instead relying on the older – but more readily available – Snapdragon 821. That, we’re led to believe, is because Samsung supposedly has earmarked the entire first batch of Snapdragon 835 silicon for its Galaxy S8: if LG had wanted to use the chipset, it would have had to wait until April 2017 to launch. In doing so it would have missed its opportunity to get the G6 to market before the Galaxy S8, which is apparently seem as a priority for the company. Other specifications are said to include a 5.7-inch, 1440 x 2650 display with a relatively unusual 18:9 aspect, dual-lens 16MP/8MP camera on the rear with one regular and one wide lens, and 4GB of RAM. LG is believed to be slimming down the G6’s display bezels, too, in keeping with the general fashion within the smartphone space right now. As for software, as well as Android 7.1 Nougat, the source claims the G6 will be the first non-Google-device to feature the latest Google Assistant. Building on Google Now and other search features, it’s the same technology that powers the Google Home smart speaker. Intriguingly, LG is said to have initially planned to bake Amazon’s Alexa into the G6 – just as the company has done with its latest refrigerators – but eventually opted not to do so after deeming the system not quite ready for phones.

"Hugo shares my belief that virtual and augmented reality will be the next major computing platform," Zuckerberg wrote. "Hugo is going to help build that future." Facebook paid what amounted to $3 billion for Oculus three years ago as Zuckerberg declared virtual reality the next big thing. He recently said Facebook will likely pour another $3 billion into the operation in the next few years to boost sales, accoding to The Motley Fool. Apple's Partnership on AI Apple will join the Partnership on AI, an artificial intelligence research group that also includes heavyweights Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, Bloomberg reports. The nonprofit association announced its formation last September. In October, Apple hired Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov to lead an AI research team. Meanwhile, Apple has hired Greg Duffy, who founded security camera firm Dropcam and worked at Alphabet's Nest, according to The Information. Duffy may be "leading a special project at Apple that is operating like a startup within the company", the report said. Qualcomm's FQ1 earnings Mobile chip maker Qualcomm has reported FQ1 2017 earnings that beat analysts' expectations. However, revenue came up short of forecasts due in part to softness in the China market, the vendor said. The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 on sales of $6 billion for the quarter, ahead of the $0.97 EPS and $5.8 billion in revenue in the same period last year. Analysts projected Qualcomm's earnings to come in at $1.18 a share on sales of $6.12 billion. For FQ2 2017, Qualcomm guided to revenue in the range of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.15 to $1.25 per share. Microsoft's Intune education Microsoft has announced Intune for Education, a new cloud-based application and device management service built on the vendor's existing Intune service and tailored for shared learning environments, the company said in a blog post.  Intune manages Windows, Android and iOS devices. In addition, Microsoft said that OEMs Acer, HP and Lenovo will be offering Windows 10-based PCs priced at $189 for the education market, directed at schools contemplating buying Chromebooks. Microsoft has also unwrapped a new update of its Minecraft platform specifically for education. Meanwhile, in a separate blog post Microsoft has said that its FastTrack program, intended to boost business adoption of the company's cloud portfolio, is now available for Windows 10 and Dynamics 365 migrations. ServiceNow's Q4 sales pop Service management vendor ServiceNow has posted a $23.6 million loss from operations, a net loss of $32.6 million, or $0.20 per share, on a 35 percent year-over-year revenue climb to $386 million for Q4 2016. The company's subscription revenue ran up by 41 percent to $345 million as its professional service and other revenues segments came in flat at $41 million when compared to the same period last year.  For the full year, the company recorded sales of $1.4 billion, amounting to a 38 percent climb from last year, and a net loss of $452 million, or $2.75 per share. Subscription revenues spiked by 44 percent from last year to $1.2 billion, the company said. CompTIA's advisors CompTIA has launched the CompTIA Advisory Council on Cybersecurity to address cyber security concerns facing businesses and government, the trade association has announced. The group's charter is to identify ways that CompTIA can develop specific initiatives to advance cyber security readiness. Its nine members span cyber security experts, policy makers, government officials, academics and consultants. Separately, CompTIA has rolled out four new guides aimed at helping MSPs and solution providers with contracts, hiring, marketing and M&A activities. IoT's analytics market The Internet of Things (IoT) analytics market is expanding from the cloud to the edge of the network, according to an ABI Research report entitled Edge Analytics in IoT. Advances in compute capabilities and the lower cost of communications hardware have opened new opportunities to apply analytics closer to the point where data is generated or collected, the researcher said. The firm is projecting the volume of data captured by IoT-connected devices to grow six-fold by 2021 to 2,000 exabytes.

I’m actually hopeful about this new mode as I just don’t believe we can change people’s behaviors and the bright screens are what distracts me, but it seems like a lot of people disagree. And this week we have learned that the next update for the Apple Watch operating system will introduce a movie theater mode. Learn the details about the new Apple Watch movie theater mode, after the jump. According to Apple’s developer guide, Apple will be adding a new Theater Mode to the Apple Watch in the upcoming watchOS 3.2 update. The new feature called “Theater Mode” easily allows users to mute sound and disable waking the screen when raising your wrist, making it ideal for those looking to avoid interrupting fellow theatergoers at a movie or play. Notifications will still arrive on the Watch with haptic feedback, which can be viewed by pressing the digital crown or tapping the screen when they arrive. I have owned the Apple Watch since the first day it went on sale, and it has become a part of my daily life. The other day at Sundance I left my condo without the watch, and I felt naked all day without it. I mainly use the advice for a quick look at notifications and have always found it to be annoying that there wasn’t a way to disable to watch during movie screenings. I usually turn on the “do not disturb” function which means my watch does not light up with alerts and I don’t receive the haptic feedback buzz, but still a significant movement of my hand could turn the face of my watch on. Luckily, I wear long sleeved hoodies most of the time, so it’s covered up and not a distraction to anyone. I could just turn the device completely off, which I have done in instances I don’t wear long sleeves, but I always seem to forget to turn it back on when leaving the theater. One of the other big uses of my Apple Watch is to track my activity, and it does not do that while it’s off, so if I forget to turn it back on for a half hour or hour, I have lost that data. I know, not a huge deal, but I try to capture it all. I can understand why someone would want to have the haptic feedback enabled because you would be alerted of an important phone call or text (say from the babysitter or from the hospital for an on-call doctor). Turning off the phone or putting it on do no disturb mode is not an option for these type of people. I like that the new watch update will bring the ability to turn the watch face off completely until you press the digital crown. If people enable this mode in the movie theater, this should prevent the watch from being a distraction from the people around the wearer of the device. Of course, this still requires the watch wearer to be considerate and turn the mode on. If only there were a way to alert the watch to its location in a movie theater and auto enable the feature.

Apple took its legal war with Qualcomm to China, filing lawsuits there accusing the chip-making giant of illegally wielding monopoly power. Apple confirmed the suits and referred to comments it released when it filed an anti-trust suit against Qualcomm in the US last week. "For many years, Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with," California-based Apple said. "Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties." Qualcomm, also based in California, said that it had not seen the legal complaints but that a press release from a Beijing court said one of the filings accused the company of violating China’s anti-monopoly law. The other asked for a determination regarding terms of a patent licence agreement. "These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology," Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said. "Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world." Last week Apple sued Qualcomm in US federal court, accusing the chip-maker of abusing its market power to demand unfair royalties, echoing recent charges by US anti-trust regulators. The suit accuses Qualcomm of building a business model based on its rights to technologies that are considered telecommunication industry standards and then ramping up royalties when Apple innovated its mobile devices with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets. Apple said in the US court filing that it has been overcharged "billions of dollars" by its chip-making partner’s "illegal scheme". The company also claimed Qualcomm owes it $1bn but is refusing to pay in retaliation for Apple’s co-operation with South Korean anti-trust regulators looking into the chip-maker’s actions in that country. Last month South Korea’s anti-trust watchdog slapped Qualcomm with a record fine of more than $850m for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chipsets used in cellphones. Qualcomm will appeal the decision, seeking a stay in the Seoul High Court while the process takes place. "Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world ... by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said. Apple noted in the US suit that Qualcomm’s business practices have come under scrutiny by anti-trust regulators in an array of countries for selling its smartphone chipsets only to makers agreeing to its "preferred licence terms" for essential mobile telecom patents. Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices. Apple’s legal complaints in China and California argue that Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties on the prices of modem chips and not on what is paid for smartphones, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said on Wednesday. He contended that the position was at odds with long-standing industry practice. "Apple’s complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property," Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on the earnings call. "We intend to remain a good supplier to Apple even while this dispute continues." AFP Please login or register to comment.

In the 60-second spot’s dramatic close, a huge screen consumed by the menacing face of Big Brother (the iconic character from George Orwell’s novel 1984) explodes into a bright shower of light while a narrator reads the words scrolling up the screen: “On January 24 Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like “1984.” The commercial originally aired 1 a.m. on December 15, 1983 in Twin Falls, Idaho to ensure its eligibility for 1983 advertising awards programs. A 30-second version also ran in theaters starting January 17. Despite much hand-wringing by Apple executives, the Super Bowl placement paid off big time when sales of Macintosh computers exceeded $3 million after the commercial aired. Marcel Brown, editor of This Day in Tech History, recalls watching the commercial: “I was 9 years old then and I vaguely remember seeing the commercial, but I also remember being more interested in watching the Raiders beat the Redskins at that time. It wasn’t until many years later that I actually recalled the commercial. Yet when I recalled it, it was as if I remembered that commercial all along. I guess even though I didn’t appreciate it at the time, I somehow knew that moment truly was changing the world.” Watch Apple’s “1984” commercial: Watch the trailer for the movie 1984 (a remake of the 1956 original), based on the dystopian novel by George Orwell published in 1949: Log in or register to post comments Related Latest Reviews News Flashback 1968: Father of the Video Game Console Makes His Mark CES Rewind: The First 25 Years in Pictures Flashback 1998: AOL Goes Hollywood Flashback 2001: Holiday Tech Flashback 1889: Coin-Op Phonograph Foreshadows Jukebox Flashback 1982: Apple Approaches McIntosh Labs Flashback 2007: Google Introduces Android Flashback 1954: The Transistor Radio Is Born Flashback 1990: IMDb Is Born Flashback 1985: Blockbuster Is Born Flashback 1980: Pac-Man Fever Flashback 1950: Transistor Receives U.S. Patent Flashback 2001: A 32-Inch HDTV Flashback 1991: An Alt-Rock Classic Is Born Flashback 2005: Apple Introduces the iPod Nano Flashback 2001 – Battle of the Bookshelfs Sure Universal Remote App Review Shout! if You Love the '80s Severtson Unveils Enhanced Acoustically-Transparent 4K Projection Screens Harry Potter Series Coming to 4K Blu-ray Onkyo TX-RZ1100 A/V Receiver Review NVIDIA Shield TV: My New Favorite Media Streamer Flashback 1984: Apple Introduces Macintosh Is High-Res Audio All Hype?

Image: lili Sams/Mashable By Brett Williams2017-01-26 17:15:32 UTC The iPhones of the future could have screens with curved edges, a benefit of the natural flexibility of OLED displays, which Apple is rumored to be considering for the so-called iPhone 8. However, a new type of display could let Apple build a curved iPhone with LCD tech. Apple supplier Japan Display announced plans to start mass producing new, flexible LCD display panels for smartphones in 2018, according to The Wall Street Journal. While the company declined to name any partners planning to use the tech, "some smartphone makers" have reportedly agreed to adopt the screens in the next few years. According to "people familiar with the matter," Apple has its eye them as well.     SEE ALSO: We might be saying goodbye to the iPhone's home button The new tech is clearly an effort on Japan Display's part to keep LCD displays in play for future iPhones; previous rumors point to the Apple shifting to OLED displays to accommodate a curved- screen design, possibly similar to Samsung's Galaxy Edge phones. Samsung Display will reportedly be the exclusive supplier of the 2017 iPhone OLED panels. Most LCD displays include of a layer of glass, which keeps the screen surface flat. But Japan Display's design solves the issue by swapping out the glass for plastic. According to the report, the plastic LCDs aren't quite as flexible as OLED panels, but they'll be pliable enough for the curved edges of a wraparound screen.     If the LCD displays work as advertised, it could be a big deal for Apple's business. According to the report, mass-producing OLED displays would require significant investments for new production lines. The flexible LCDs would likely be more cost-efficient, since the new design adapts already existing technology.  Notably, these new LCDs won't be the displays that could make the iPhone truly bendable, like the Samsung device that will reportedly launch later this year. If bendable smartphones ever actually become a reality, they're further off in the future, as there are other production challenges to be solved with the iPhone's inner components and battery before the devices could be flexible enough to bend.

 A Harvard student who received internship offers from Google, Apple, and Facebook explains how she tackles the trickiest interview questions Áine Cain Jan. 26, 2017, 12:31 PM 39,453 facebook linkedin twitter email print Think out loud, says Harvard junior Jessica Pointing. Jessica Pointing Some of the biggest companies in business today ask pretty tricky questions during job interviews. Brainteasers can be a great way of allowing candidates to highlight their critical-thinking and reasoning skills. However, in a high-stakes interview, they also pose an opportunity for interviewees to trip up. Harvard University junior Jessica Pointing has received internship offers from companies including Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, McKinsey, Bain, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. Business Insider spoke with her to find out how she approaches the most puzzling interview questions. Pointing, who features educational and career advice for high school and college students on her website, the Optimize Guide, recalls feeling stumped by a particularly difficult brainteaser during an interview — although she declined to provide the specific question. "I remember thinking, 'I have no idea how to do this. I'm not going to do well in this interview,'" she said. However, she says that dispelling your worries is the first step in successfully tackling a brainteaser. "When you get a tricky question, get rid of any negative thoughts," she said. "Think, 'OK, I can do this — now how am I going to approach this?'" Pointing says there are three steps to follow to work through a brainteaser: Repeat the question. Talk through your reasoning. Ask plenty of questions about your assumptions along the way. She says that thinking out loud will allow the interviewer to hear your thought process and that speaking through the problem will help you organize your thoughts. Plus, if it's clear you're on the wrong track, the interviewer might be more inclined to give you a hint. "The interviewer wants to hear your thought process," Pointing told Business Insider. "How you approach the problem is just as important, if not more important, than the solution itself." As a result, the biggest mistake you can make in a brainteaser isn't coming up with the wrong answer — it's panicking and blurting something out without any explanation. Jeff Zwelling, the COO of the job search engine ZipRecruiter, previously told Business Insider about one of his favorite brainteasers: "A hammer and a nail cost $1.10, and the hammer costs one dollar more than the nail. How much does the nail cost?" "Some candidates will instantly blurt out 10 cents, which is obviously wrong," he said. "They don't have to get the exact right answer, which is a nickel, but I want to see them at least have a thought process behind it."

"Its size keeps it from being a source of explosive growth," said Robert Cihra, managing director and research analyst at Guggenheim Partners. "But I think Apple can keep growing low single-digits." The Dow Jones industrial average broke above 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday, and other major indexes followed to record highs. From the time the Dow index first closed above 10,000 in 2009 to Wednesday's 20,000 milestone, Apple has been one of the best performing tech stocks, with a gain of more than 330 percent. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee hands off an Apple iPhone to a colleague at an Apple store in Palo Alto, California. Over that period, Apple's annual revenue rose to nearly $216 billion, from just under $43 billion in 2009. "The law of large numbers has caught up to Apple to some degree," said Michael Olson, senior equity research analyst at Piper Jaffray. Apple is a relatively new addition to the Dow Jones industrial average, but it's important to the Dow's future, Cihra said. But the company will face new pressures to manufacture in the United States under the new Trump administration, which has instructed trade officials to pull back from major international trade agreements. "Despite the services revenue — which is a great, high-margin business, growing nicely — we don't have margins expanding. Because we do think there could be increased expenses related to local manufacturing in the U.S," Olson said. Apple's services business, including iTunes and the App Store, is still growing quickly, with revenues up 24 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter from the year ago period. And shares are up more than 20 percent over the past year. Plus, the stock has dividends, a surge of research and development spending, and a pile of overseas cash that may be repatriated under new federal policies. There are areas that Apple could find increased growth, Olson said, including in India. "If they had access to that cash they would absolutely use it," Cihra said. — CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this report. Disclosure: Apple is an investment banking client of Guggenheim.

Fish Hatchery Road in Fitchburg’s Yarmouth Crossing shopping center. All items at Wayward Apple (except for the balloons) are handmade, and most are local, too, coming from crafters in Madison and Fitchburg. Koukas herself makes soaps and tutus. She has often sold at fairs, but dreamed of turning her hobby into a regular gig. Now she sells on consignment year-round. Items range from knit booties, hats and sweaters for babies and children to yard art, embroidered tea towels and coffee mugs. Many of the items are geared toward people who embrace their inner nerd, Koukas says: “We have a lot of fun, geeky stuff.” The candles touted as having scents that will remind users of certain cult fantasy series, including Game of Thrones, the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Harry Potter, fall under that category. × Expand Star Wars mugs, Harry Potter clocks and bottle openers are staples at the Fitchburg shop. Some of the most popular items at Wayward Apple include whimsical, multi-colored metal flowers and pigs for the yard by Mindy’s Country Crafts of Monroe, bowl-shaped knitted hot pads for heating bowls of food in the microwave by Cynthia’s Custom Designs of Fitchburg and wooden berry-picking baskets by Good Knight Woodwork of West Bend. The inventory changes regularly. Koukas is constantly amazed by the new products that come in: “There is so much talent and creativity out there.” Wayward Apple also hosts craft classes.

The lawsuit is seeking damages of £115 million, with the Apple legal team claiming Qualcomm has abused its dominant market position to charge more. One of the complaints alleges a violation of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the other requests a determination of the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple for Qualcomm’s cellular standard essentials patents. “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” said Don Rosenberg, EVP and General Counsel of Qualcomm. “Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them. These terms were consistent with our NDRC Rectification plan. “Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world. We are proud of our history of contributing our inventions to the development and success of the mobile communications ecosystem.” This latest Apple drama follows an equivalent filing in the US and a similar tussle with the US Federal Trade Commission, which has also accused Qualcomm of using its market position in a nefarious manner. The news will put a bit of a dampener on a day which has seen Qualcomm report fairly healthy results for the quarter ending December 25. For Q4, the team brought in revenues of $6 billion, a 4% year-on-year increase, but is giving itself a wide berth for the next quarter, forecasting revenues between $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion. “We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,” said CEO Steve Mollenkopf. “Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT, security and networking. We are very well positioned to lead as the semiconductor engine for the intelligent, connected world.” Tags: Apple, chip, Insults, lawsuit, Q42016 Financials, Qualcomm Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Apple iPhone 8 Rumored to Have a Very High Level of Water Resistance Compared to the iPhone 7! Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: January 26, 2017In: Technology Page 1 of 212» The Apple iPhone 7 is barely four months old into the market but talks about its successor, the iPhone 8, have already been swirling on the internet, when in fact, the latest flagship smartphone from the American tech giant will come out in September yet. Latest reports have it that the iPhone 8 shall have an IP68 rating, which indicates that it shall have a very high level of water and dust resistance. It can be recalled that the iPhone 7 features an IP67 rating, which means that the iPhone 8 will be a notch higher towards such end. The iPhone 8 reportedly has a score of six for dust resistance, which means the new iPhone is virtually dustproof with no ingredients of dust and complete protection against contact. The 8 rating, on the other hand, means that it could be submerged into 1.5 meters of water for 30 minutes without getting damaged, reports the Digital Times. The iPhone 7’s IP67 rating means that the phone can be submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes without getting damaged so the IP68 on the iPhone 8 is an improvement of half a meter. Liquid damage not covered Amid the iPhone 7’s respectable water resistance rating, Apple will not cover liquid damage in its warranty. As such, the American tech giant would not be introducing water damage coverage for the iPhone 8 warranty either. The iPhone 8 has previously been rumored to have an all-glass body that could make it better suited for wireless charging as the metal frames in the current models would dampen wireless frequency tolerances. It shall reportedly have a bezel-less display to accompany its all-glass design. According to early reports, a bezel-less display could mean taking away the physical home button and fingerprint scanner, opting for a button and fingerprint reader on the display itself. From iPhone 8 to iPhone X? Meanwhile, the CEO of a charging company has been dropping hints that the iPhone 8 could feature a wireless charging range of 15 feet and there is also an analyst who has predicted that the next Apple smartphone will be rebranded as the iPhone X. According to latest predictions, the Touch ID will be built into the iPhone 8 display and will be joined by a new security feature, which is the facial recognition. There are also reports saying that Apple may discontinue the S generation strategy although it remains as speculation at this point in time. Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at Cowen and Company, has sent out a research note to clients predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X, X evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017, details Macworld of UK. With iPhone version numbers getting alarmingly high, it would make sense for Apple to switch to a different branding convention at some point, distracting customers from quite how many of these things Apple has cranked out without fundamentally changing what it’s offering. However, some critics aver that if Apple would proceed to rebrand its biggest seller, it would be a very bold move. Some pundits predicted that the iPhone 7 would sell comparatively poorly because of its perceived lack of major new features and design changes. However, they think that everything would change this year when the iPhone 8 blows everyone away with a wide and radical range of enhancements. Pundits are increasingly predicting a big iPhone launch in 2017. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse have forecast that the iPhone 8 will feature significant innovations such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging, and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor.

The spat saw cases filed last Friday in California and this week in Beijing and were top of mind when Qualcomm conducted an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday. For 15 minutes, Qualcomm executives criticized Apple's moves, calling the two lawsuits "without merit" and accused the iPhone-maker of trying to use them as a way to reduce the royalties the iPhone maker pays to Qualcomm.  "Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in jurisdictions around the world and misrepresenting facts and withholding information,"Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said. Apple claimed that Qualcomm retaliated because it cooperated with a South Korean government investigation that ultimately saw Qualcomm fined $854 million for unfair licensing practices. Qualcomm vowed to appeal the decision. Aberle said that Qualcomm did no such thing, and the company objected to Apple making false and misleading statements. "We will prove that Apple's irresponsible claims of extortion are false," Aberle said. Apple has generated billions in profits thanks to intellectual property from Qualcomm, CEO Mollenkopf said. Qualcomm has spent billions of dollars developing mobile technologies for over three decades, and wants to be fairly compensated for the inventions shared through licensing. "Our preference is to always resolve customer disputes through negotiation instead of litigation. So it is regrettable Apple has chosen to take this path," Mollenkopf said. The value of Qualcomm's IP was established long time ago, and the patent portfolio is actually going up in value as the mobile industry moves towards 5G, Mollenkopf said. "Yet, we have never raised our royalty rates," Mollenkopf said. In the California lawsuit, Apple is seeking $1 billion in compensation for excessive royalties paid. Apple said in its filing that Qualcomm should charge royalties based on the price of the baseband chip in the mobile device, and not a portfolio of technologies. Aberle said that was inconceivable, and not in line with how chip technologies have been licensed for decades. Licensing at the component level is inefficient, and a device or modem chip maker would still need to take out licenses for other Qualcomm technologies in smartphones. Besides modems, Qualcomm has an huge arsenal of intellectual property that also covers technologies like real-time tracking and mapping, which forms the basis for companies like Uber. The excess royalties in dispute are paid to Qualcomm by contract manufacturers like Foxconn, which assemble the iPad and iPhone, and not directly by Apple. "We hope Apple wouldn't interfere with those contracts," Aberle said. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Samsung Reveals Cause of Galaxy Note7 Battery Fires, Explosions Apple Latest to 'Pile On' Qualcomm in Antitrust Lawsuits Google Voice Getting Major User Interface Update Microsoft Adds SUSE Linux Support to SQL Server vNext       Today's topics include Samsung's detailed explanation of what caused Galaxy Note7 batteries to overheat and burn, Apple's $1 billion lawsuit claiming it was the victim of anticompetitive practices by chipmaker Qualcomm, the release of the first update to Google Voice in five years and the addition of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to the list of supported Linux distributions in Microsoft's next SQL Server database release. At a press conference at company headquarters in Seoul, South Korea Jan. 22, Samsung President DJ Koh provided a detailed explanation of what caused some Galaxy Note7 smartphones to overheat and burn. Koh outlined the testing the company carried out to determine the cause and to discover whether the faults were with the phone or the battery installed in it. According to Koh, the phone itself and its software did not seem to be at fault. Instead, he described a pair of faults with the batteries that powered the phone. The first fault started showing up in Note7 handsets in the late summer of 2016. The second set happened in the replacement handsets that were supposed to fix the problem with the first set. Qualcomm has been hit with a succession of legal actions by business regulators in the U.S. and overseas charging that the chipmaker has engaged in anticompetitive practices. On Dec. 27, the company was fined $852.9 million by South Korea's Korean Fair Trade Commission for alleged antitrust violations. On Jan. 17, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed its own antitrust lawsuit against Qualcomm and on Jan. 20, Apple filed a $1 billion action claiming Qualcomm engaged in unfair licensing practices. The suit, filed in federal district court in San Diego, claims that Qualcomm used its "monopoly position" as a manufacturer of baseband chips, a critical component used in cell phones, to seek "onerous, unreasonable and costly" terms for patents, and that Qualcomm blocked Apple's ability to choose another supplier for chipsets. Google has added a fresh set of features to its Google Voice internet telephony service including support for group and photo multimedia messaging services and in-notification replies. The update is the first that Google has made to Google Voice in over five years and will become available to users of the app around the world in the next several weeks. The updated features will be available first in the Android and web versions of Google Voice and soon in the iOS version of the application. One of the biggest changes that Google has made to Voice is the user interface. The updated Google Voice app features what the company describes as a cleaner and more intuitive design for users. Microsoft has confirmed that the latest SQL Server vNext Community Technology Preview includes support for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, joining other distributions of the open source operating system from Canonical, the commercial sponsor behind Ubuntu and Red Hat Linux. SQL Server vNext is the branding Microsoft is using to evoke a more cloud- and Linux-friendly direction for its database software, which was formerly a Windows-only product. The software giant plans to release SQL Server vNext in mid-2017.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows Google Open Sources Data Visualization Tool for Machine Learning Cisco Security Business Group Continues to Accelerate Growth Amazon Go Won't Kill Many Jobs, But It May Prove a Boon to Crooks Microsoft, Harman Kardon to Take on Amazon Echo, Google Home Yahoo Suffers New Hack; 1 Billion Users Impacted This Time 10 Things T-Mobile Has Done to Move O...

Apple yesterday released iOS 10.3 beta update which comes in with a tonne of new features and functionalities. Apart from adding new features to the entire platform, the Cupertino-based giant has also brought in some new changes for Siri (Apple’s personal voice assistant).   With the new update, Siri is now more cricket friendly and can pitch in answers related to Indian Premier League (IPL) and International Cricket Council (ICC). Some of the questions you can now ask Siri are -   1. What are the 2016 IPL rankings? 2. Who leads the IPL in runs scored? 3. When is the next Cricket match? 4. Who took the most wickets last year in IPL?     This is some of the examples of what Siri can now do when it comes to questions related to cricket. India being one of the top followers of the game would definitely embrace the new functionality provided in the latest update.   The new iOS 10.3 beta update also introduces a lot of other features including ‘Find My iPhone’ will now let you find your misplaced Airpods. Further, it can also pop up a specially designed sound on either or both AirPods to help find them easily. However, the Airpods must be within the Bluetooth range of one of the connected Apple devices. If the Airpods are not within the Bluetooth range, are discharged or are in closed Airpods case, Find My iPhone will show up the time and location where the Airpods were last connected with the device. Lastly, the all new ‘Find My iPhone’ functionality will be accessible from any computer as well by going at icloud.com/find.   SiriKit domains now help pay and keep a check on the status of bills paid through payment apps or scheduled with ride booking apps. While CarPlay adds shortcuts to launch the last two used apps, the built-in Maps app now displays EV charging stations. Apple has also improved 3D Touch functionality on the Weather App which now displays hourly forecasts, chance of rain and daily high and low temperatures. iMessage now bundle all the iMessage apps and the mail conversation mechanism has also seen some improvements.   Meanwhile, Apple also expanded the update pattern to the MacOS as well. The new MacOS Sierra 10.12.4 brings a new feature called ‘Night Shift’ which basically shifts your display colour to the warmer end of the spectrum after night. The Siri enhancements related cricket has been brought in here as well.   Lastly, the US-based handset manufacturer also brought in some new improvements to its tvOS as well. The update is primarily for enterprise, education and hotel configurations and will include MDM (mobile device management) and DEP (Device enrollment program), which allows admins to remotely setup, configure and maintain Apple TV.

Apple is alleging that Qualcomm is abusing its dominant position in the chip industry and seeking $1 billion yuan (approximately $190 million CAD) in the first suit. In the second, it accuses Qualcomm of failing to license standard or essential patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms (known as ‘FRAND’ terms). “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” retorted Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg, in a statement to Reuters. “Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.” The company noted, however, that it had not yet seen the full complaints filed in the Chinese court. Apple is a major buyer of Qualcomm’s modem chips. Together with Samsung, the two companies make up 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in the most recent fiscal year, according to Reuters’ report. News broke on January 20th, 2017, that Apple was suing Qualcomm for similar anti-trust practices in the U.S. Along with those filings, Apple stated that Qualcomm is “charging for royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,” further adding: “Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined.” Apple is not the only entity to recently raise such concerns. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission charged the chipset maker with “monopolizing a key semi-conductor device used in cell phones” on January 17th, 2017 and South Korea levied a $1.1 billion CAD fine against Qualcomm in December 2016 for abusing its dominant position.

Mike Nope they just get to pocket more. Cowpoke Sal …and haters get to hate more. Matt When will Apple stop being babies and trying to sue everyone. We all know Apple can’t innovate anymore and their business is sliding downwards. And does Apple think bout suing people will give them extra free cash cause they can’t innovate and would compensate for their loss. Like how many companies are suing Apple as of now. Apple was even sued for using the name IPhone which they stole from a different company and have to pay royalties for every iPhone sold. And they stole the name Icloud and have to pay a royalty for using that name as well. Apple copies from everyone else or steals copyright names and makes it seem they were the first. Apple can not innovate so they steal from everyone else. p_lindsay Little rich coming from the company that patented the rectangle. Brad Fortin I’m sure if patenting a rectangle were that easy someone else would have done it already. p_lindsay I’m guessing nobody else realized just how idiotic the American patent system was. Glad to see you here defending apples greed again though. ???? Brad Fortin It’s not an idiotic system, it’s just that “Apple patented the rectangle” is a lie. Glad to see you’re still spreading lies, though. ???? p_lindsay It is absolutely an idiotic system and what Apple did is absolutely tantamount to patenting the rectangle. The US patent system, especially in Texas, is one of the most corrupt, broken systems on the planet. Brad Fortin And to think, Qualcomm used the exact same patent system to get its patents. Maybe this case has some merits after all, don’t you think? p_lindsay Actually it probably doesn’t have merits in exactly the same way the Apple rectangle case doesn’t, but yes, it is very likely a product of the same highly flawed system. Cowpoke Sal Trump’ll fix it. Pingback: Apple challenges Qualcomm with two new antitrust lawsuits | Mo.bi - Leading Brand In Mobile Business() Jon Duke Microsoft got slapped with an anti-trust law suit because their software was forced on users with Windows. Now, tell me Apple software isn’t forced on iPhone and iPad users. Much like internet explorer, Safari cannot be uninstalled and another browser cannot be the default. Apple is the most guilty company when it comes to anti-trust laws. The devil has no shame… ciderrules Someone clearly doesn’t understand the difference. Here’s a clue: Apple doesn’t license Windows out to HP, Dell, Lenovo and all the other PC makers. It’s impossible for Apple to violate antitrust with iOS since they’re the only ones using it. Jon Duke Thanks for clarifying. Brad Fortin The difference: Microsoft had a monopoly on the PC market, Apple has a minority of the phone market. Logic: It’s not for everyone. Jon Duke Thanks for being a typical apple fan who insults people before even thinking about it. I didn’t know. My bad for talking too fast. It totally means I’m not logical and probably stupid too. I’ll go back under the rock I live in and leave you chosen ones to rule the world. Cowpoke Sal Phew…someone got outta bed on the wrong side this morning. Brad Fortin Well, before talking about anti-trust law and the Microsoft lawsuit, did you even read what it was about and the circumstances surrounding it? Google is an amazing resource that can answer most if not all of your questions on the topic. Sorry for expecting you to use such an easy tool to do some a bit of homework. Jon Duke You are an a$$hole. Honestly. Who sh!t in your cornflakes this morning that you have to be so condescending to someone you don’t know? Brad Fortin What? Am I expecting too much by asking for someone to have a minimum level of knowledge on a subject before talking about it? If you make grandiose statements about Apple being “the most guilty company” and call them “the devil” based on your own ignorance you should expect that someone would eventually call you out on it. No need to be upset about it, just do some research next time so that you’re not speaking out of pure ignorance. They say ignorance is bliss, which must be why you’re so upset that your blissful ignorance was just interrupted. Jon Duke I’m not mad you called me out on it. I’m mad because I admitted to my wrongdoing in my first reply to you and instead of being a god damn human being with a minimum of respect for others, you added to it by calling me ignorant. Also, Apple doesn’t care about you no matter how many stranger you insult on the internet. Brad Fortin When you replied to ciderrules, who had pretty much the same comment that I did, it was a simple “Thanks” but when you replied to me it was a long diatribe, and with every reply you’ve been doubling down on it. Insults and disrespect go both ways. Contrary to what Apple haters on MobileSyrup believe I actually don’t give a sh!t who or what Apple cares about. Jon Duke There, I googled: “The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft’s victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer. It was further alleged that this restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera)” Actually, what I knew about the case was right. The issue was them bundling IE with Windows because it affected other browsers. Nothing to do with Windows being on different OEM machines. Apple does the same when they don’t allow you to change your default browser. Maybe you are the ignorant who needs to read a book. Brad Fortin Keep reading, find the context: The reason the case was brought against Microsoft was because they had an effective monopoly on the PC market (>95%) and had direct a influence on which browsers the majority of the market would use. As a result no other browsers were able to gain significant traction. There’s no such case to be brought against Apple because Apple only controls a minority of the smartphone market (50% of the browser market. There are a lot of things in this world I don’t know, but this isn’t one of them. Jon Duke That’s true. But when Apple launched the iPhone, they had the whole market to themselves and they still forced Safari which means they were breaking anti trust laws for a while before android came in and flooded the market. My whole point was that a company the could easily be accused of the same has no shame suing for it. I did go a bit strong on the devil comment though. Can we make peace now? It’s Friday 🙂 Brad Fortin Apple never had the whole market to themselves, not even for a moment. When the iPhone first launched it was competing against a market of mostly dumb phones and a few smartphones from BlackBerry, Palm, Motorola, etc, and had <1% market share. The 15% market share they have now is the highest they've ever had. They never had the same position in the phone market that Microsoft had in the computer market. Sure, peace sounds good. Also, if you're interested in Apple-Microsoft anti-trust stuff and have a few minutes to burn you might enjoy the article "Mac Office, $150 Million, and the Story Nobody Covered" on Roughly Drafted. The author's got an Apple bias, so take it with a grain of salt, but the details are very interesting and it touches on the Microsoft suit we were talking about.

Apple’s senior officials are reported to have met the  Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister, Government of India,  on Tuesday just before the meeting with the inter-ministerial team, which will be held today. The team will look into company’s demand for setting up a manufacturing unit in India.   The meeting with the Commerce Minister lasted for 40 minutes where Apple’s Global Vice President Priya Balasubramaniam along with two other officials discussed the proposal. The senior executives from Apple will today meet government officials of different departments including the ministry of electronics and IT, environment and forests discuss various incentives to set up a manufacturing unit in India.   Read also: Apple to start manufacturing iPhones in India by April 2017   Apple has asked for various concessions including a 15-year custom holiday on iPhone kits imports and other tax incentives to enter the manufacturing sector in India. The company is already reported to have selected the first Indian-based supplier for this year iPhones in India.  Wistron is reported to be the primary supplier in India for manufacturing of new iPhones. The report further adds that Foxconn and other makers will act as secondary OEMs only if demand increases.   Read also: Apple iPhone 8 to come with wireless charging, facial recognition: Report   Earlier, the company sought permission to open fully-owned retail stores in India after the change in FDI rules. To recall, the government toned down its FDI rules back in June previous year and allowed 100% FDI in single-brand retail trading in the country. The government gave a three-year exemption from local sourcing with an extension of up to five years if it’s proven that the products of ‘state-of-the- art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technology. The company has asked for an exemption from the local sourcing as it is bringing ‘cutting-edge’ technology to the country, which was turned down by the finance ministry.   For Apple, India is one of the major markets as its iPhone sales went up 51 percent year-on-year, at a time when its global sales went down. In May last year, Tim Cook visited India and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi where he discussed issues including manufacturing and setting up retail stores in the country.

Critics of Qualcomm, the world’s biggest chip-design firm, would say the lyric is a clue to the company’s business practices. Its methods have attracted a barrage of legal complaints. The latest came on January 25th, when Apple, a smartphone maker, sued it in China for abusing its clout in mobile processors and demanded 1bn yuan ($145m) in damages. Just days earlier Apple had filed a similar lawsuit in California asking for $1bn. America’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a separate complaint against the firm this month. In late December, the equivalent body in South Korea fined it a whopping $853m, which hurt its quarterly results, announced this week. These cases follow two similar ones in 2015: Chinese regulators imposed an even higher fine, of $975m; and the European Commission found Qualcomm guilty of having sold chips below cost to hurt rivals. Qualcomm is no household name, but most people with mobile phones use its technology. It is estimated to provide up to four-fifths of essential types of baseband processors, the chips that manage a device’s wireless connection. These and other chips generated two-thirds of the firm’s revenues of $23.6bn in 2016. But the secret to its profits of $5.7bn is the way it licenses its intellectual property (see chart). Qualcomm owns thousands of patents on technology deemed “essential” to build phones compatible with wireless standards. All the cases revolve around the peculiar model of how Qualcomm licenses these patents. It does not make them available to rival designers of chips and other components, but only to device-makers. These usually pay for the entire patent portfolio, rather than individual patents. And Qualcomm typically charges a percentage of the total selling price of a device—5%, according to insiders. Combined with Qualcomm’s dominant position in baseband processors, the FTC argues, this set-up enables all kinds of abuses. In particular, it alleges that handset brands have little choice but to sign up to onerous licensing conditions in order to get the chips they need. Apple, among other things, claims that per-device royalties mean Qualcomm is taxing its innovation: it must pay up for new features, such as a new kind of camera, even if these are unrelated to Qualcomm’s patents. Such accusations are not new. In the past Qualcomm has defended itself by arguing that its approach makes life easier for all involved: licensing patents for individual components would be too complex. As for the FTC’s allegation of monopoly abuse, Qualcomm said that it “has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms.” The courts will now have to sort all this out. If legal battles are multiplying now, it is because the world is in a way “done” with smartphones, says Stéphane Téral of IHS Markit, a data provider. Slower growth and tighter margins have device-makers searching for ways to cut costs. Apple’s cases are the biggest danger for Qualcomm: the iPhone-maker is its largest customer. Stacy Rasgon of Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, describes Apple’s lawsuits as an “all-out assault” on Qualcomm’s licensing model. But the firm has shown that it can recover from crises by developing new technology and making clever acquisitions. Although regulators have yet to approve the deal, the firm in October bought NXP Semiconductors, a chip designer, for $47bn, which gives Qualcomm a foothold and lots more intellectual property in two promising markets: chips for cars and connected devices, collectively called the internet of things. The world may be “done” with smartphones, but the taxman is likely to remain a force.

Photo: Keystone via AP Apple Inc has filed suit in China challenging Qualcomm Inc’s fees for technology used in smartphones two years after Chinese regulators fined the chipmaker for its licensing practices. Two lawsuits filed by the iPhone maker accuse Qualcomm of abusing its control over essential technology to charge excessive licensing fees, a Beijing court said on its microblog. It said Apple reports suffering 1 billion yuan (US$145.4 million) in “economic losses” and asks for 2.5 million yuan. Most of Apple’s iPhones and other products are assembled in China by contractors. Apple filed a similar complaint in US federal court in San Diego, California, on Saturday last week, accusing Qualcomm of demanding royalties for innovations on iPhones that have nothing to do with Qualcomm’s technology. The US lawsuit seeks US$1 billion in damages. The US Federal Trade Commission also has filed a lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of imposing unfair licensing terms on manufacturers. San Diego-headquartered Qualcomm said in a statement that it had not seen Apple’s complaint to the Chinese court, but defended its fees. The company said Apple rejected terms consistent with those accepted by more than 100 Chinese manufacturers, adding that its fees were consistent with changes worked out with Chinese regulators. “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in the statement.

Apple's earnings for Q1 2017 are out next week, and here are five things to keep an eye on. ByAdrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | January 26, 2017 -- 16:10 GMT (08:10 PST) | Topic: Apple The first quarter of its financial cycle is Apple's most profitable of the cycle. Not only does it include the holiday period, but it also includes the iPhone release period, which makes it doubly important. But with iPhone sales going soggy, and iPad sales not what they used to be, Apple is under pressure. Here are five questions to keep in mind during next week's earnings report and conference call. Must read: Five things you shouldn't buy from Apple #1: Will the iPhone return to growth? iPhone: What will the next 10 years bring? What will the iPhone of 2027 look like? Will there even be an iPhone in 2027? Read More The iPhone is the engine that powers the Apple machine, and as such all eyes will be on how well this single product line is doing above all else. Q1 2016 saw iPhone sales of 74.8 million, which while strong, weren't as strong as had been hoped for. As far as Apple's guidance for this quarter as issued back at the end of October, Apple is hedging its bets, with the revenue guidance of $76 billion to $78 billion allowing for either a small fall or gain in iPhone sales for the period. If it's been a strong quarter, driven by high demand for the iPhone 7 and the iPhone SE (the SE only represents a few million units, but it could still make the difference between growth and decline), then sales could be as high as 80 million units, but weak sales could see the numbers fall as low as 74 million. Yes, for most companies worrying about sales of "only" 74 million would be a champagne problem, but Apple is under pressure to boost sales of the iPhone back into growth territory, and anything over 75 million units would do that. A benefit to Apple for Q1 2017 is that the quarter is a little over a week longer than Q1 2016, and this makes direct comparisons a bit harder, and could make it a little easier for Apple to push the iPhone into growth. #2: Will iPad sales show signs of an upgrade cycle kicking into motion? iOS 10 was a big turning point in the iPad lifecycle because for the first time it rendered a whole swathe of iPads -- around 60 million based on estimates -- obsolete. A question of Apple watcher's minds is this: Will people spend money to upgrade their old hardware? But the long-term fate of the iPad doesn't solely rest with upgraders. Enterprise usage has also been increasing, and while consumer interest in the iPad may be fickle, enterprise may help soften the blow. But everything is up in the air, especially when you throw into the equation that some schools are turning their backs on iPads in favor of Chromebooks. It could be a very decisive quarter for the iPad. #3: How are ASPs (Average Selling Prices) doing? It's easy to focus on units sold alone, but it's also important to keep an eye on ASPs. This offers an easy way to see if lower-priced iPhones and iPads are cannibalizing sales of higher-priced units. #4: Will Mac sales be hit as hard as PCs? While Mac sales have their ups and downs, for the past three years we've seen them float around the lower 4 million and upper 5 million mark. Now, given that PC sales are a mess, it's easy to assume that this will be true for Macs, but the fact is that Mac sales appear to be resistant to the issues affecting their Windows counterparts. With a MacBook Pro update landing a few days before the Q1 2017 quarter started, this could be a source of good news for Apple. #5: How is the Apple Watch doing? While we don't get numbers directly from Apple, by keeping an eye on the "Other Products" category of the summary data (which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and Apple-branded and third-party accessories) we get a barometer of sorts. There are also other pointers to it being a good quarter for the Apple Watch: It was a holiday quarter Target was selling the first-generation Apple Watch for $199 The Nike+ version shakes up what was before quite a reserved lineup The bottom falling out of the wearables market for other players (Fitbit earnings will be interesting) See also: iPhone 8 rumors finally suggest wireless charging is on the way Does Apple need an augmented reality smartglasses product?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Hugo Barra Set to Lead Facebook's Virtual Reality Business | Main | Apple Patent Reveals New MacBook Hinge System with Torsion Bar to Provide Variable Cover Resistance » January 26, 2017 Apple is joining the 'Partnership on AI' to Advance Public Understanding of Artificial Intelligence Technologies   It's being reported that Apple is set to join the 'Partnership on AI' – an artificial intelligence research group that includes Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Apple’s admission into the group could be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives at Apple and the Partnership on AI declined to comment, according to Bloomberg.    By going to the Partnership on AI website, it's clear that Apple is late to the party being that the partnership was originally formed way back in September 2016 with Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft.   The non-profit organization aims to work to advance public understanding of artificial intelligence technologies (AI) and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. Academics, non-profits, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the Board of the organization, named the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI).   The objective of the Partnership on AI is to address opportunities and challenges with AI technologies to benefit people and society. Together, the organization's members will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology. It does not intend to lobby government or other policymaking bodies.   In October 2016 The Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council Committee released a paper on "Technology Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence."   AI technologies hold tremendous potential to improve many aspects of life, ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing to home automation and transportation. Through rigorous research, the development of best practices, and an open and transparent dialogue, the founding members of the Partnership on AI hope to maximize this potential and ensure it benefits as many people as possible.   Apple published it's first Artificial Intelligence Paper back in late December.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Bring it on, Apple — at least, that’s what Qualcomm’s top executives seemed to be saying Wednesday. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Derek Aberle, head of the wireless chipmakers’s licensing business, fired back at lawsuits filed over the past week by Apple in the US and China. Those suits, they said, are all about the money, an effort by Apple to squeeze as much money as possible from its supplier. The dispute began when the FTC accused Qualcomm of engaging in anti-competitive practices by insisting on being Apple’s exclusive supplier of baseband processors in return for reduced patent royalties. Apple then sued Qualcomm for around a billion dollars, accusing it of withholding a $1B rebate. Qualcomm described the accusations as baseless and said that Apple ‘misrepresented facts.’ The company later said that it was considering a countersuit against Apple. Instead, Apple filed a second lawsuit, this time in China, seeking a further $140M in damages. Apple started using Intel 4G LTE chips in the iPhone 7/Plus, but because these chips include technology patented by Qualcomm, it has to pay a royalty to the company. Mollenkopf claimed that the royalty rate the company demanded was reasonable given the money that Apple makes from using the technology. “They want to pay less for the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology.” While the value of Qualcomm’s patents have “tangibly and meaningfully increased over time,” it has never raised its royalty rates, Mollenkopf added. The company did, however, strike a conciliatory note in repeating earlier assurances that it would continue to supply Apple with chips during the dispute, and that it was confident the issue would be resolved. I’m confident we’ll address and get through the legal challenges underway, as we have done many times in the past. Apple referred CNET to an earlier statement. Apple believes deeply in innovation and we have always been willing to pay fair and reasonable rates for patents we use. We are extremely disappointed in the way Qualcomm is conducting its business with us and unfortunately after years of disagreement over what constitutes a fair and reasonable royalty we have no choice left but to turn to the courts.

A report from Bloomberg shares that even though there may be growth for total iPhone units shipped compared with the year ago quarter, predictions say it will be the strong rise in Apple’s services that will increase revenue for the quarter. Analysts currently predict an average selling price, or ASP, of $688 for the iPhone line in the holiday quarter, down from $691 a year earlier, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. At first, a $3 decline per iPhone doesn’t sound like a lot, but when you consider multiplying that times the estimated 76 million iPhone sold in the holiday quarter, it’s almost a quarter of a billion dollar revenue decrease. Analyst Mark Moskowitz detailed why the average selling is likely dropping. “Recent smartphone customers increasingly are opting for the iPhone 6S,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients this week as he downgraded his recommendation on Apple stock to hold. “We detect increasing concern among industry participants that smartphones in general have evolved technologically to become more than good enough to serve most users’ digital needs over multiple years or until the device breaks.” Another factor that contributed to the lower average iPhone prices was the iPhone SE. In previous years, an iPhone launch meant an increase in average selling price, but as Bloomberg’s graph shows, the iPhone SE dramatically changed that trend and continues to lower the ASP post iPhone 7. While we’ll have to wait until Tuesday to know the actual results. All of this will likely put more pressure on Apple to knock it out of the park with this year’s iPhone release. Even after revenue from services soared last year, the iPhone still accounted for almost two-thirds of Apple’s $216 billion annual sales. The handset’s importance means any ASP weakness will focus investor attention more keenly on the next iPhone, which is likely to be unveiled later this year, the device’s 10th anniversary.

A whole host of awards will be handed to educational establishments or people who work or learn in one in our Golden Apple Awards, which are returning for a second year and will look to recognise schools, academies, colleges, staff and students to shout from the rooftops about all that is good about our region's education.

More: 'You made broken look beautiful and strong look invincible' - funeral for brave Scunthorpe nurse Judges will be looking for someone who has made outstanding progress in both their practical work and in their studies and who have made an exceptional contribution to their workplace. Alexandra Seaton, a former Grimsby Institute student and Fabricom, won the award last year and was described a positive role model and "ambassador for women". Richard Stansfield, managing director of Singleton Birch, who are one of the proud sponsors of the awards, said: "It is important to celebrate and reward success of students doing well in education to inspire others to strive for improvement. "As a company we want to support the recognition of individuals and schools who have made achievements in education because it is in our interest to have a thriving and successful educational system to produce the next generation of talented and skilled employees. "Doing well in school lays the foundations in terms of knowledge and application and creates employees with a great work ethic. "I think that achievements in education be championed more often and that the Golden Apple Awards are a great chance to shout about how great our local students are." Following on from last year's hugely successful campaign, the awards are returning for a second year aimed at once again recognising the talent, skills and hard work that goes into teaching and providing education in North and North East Lincolnshire. Finalists will be shortlisted in February by an independently-selected judging panel and invited to attend the awards ceremony at the Forest Pines Hotel on Thursday, March 2. Time is very quickly running out for you to get your nominations into us, so if you know of anyone who fits the bill for any of these categories; Award for Innovation, Business Support for Schools, Star Student [under 16] or Against all odds award, then act fast! Details on how to nominate are listed below and the Golden Apple Awards represent the perfect opportunity to once again recognise and celebrate the very best in education that Northern Lincolnshire has to offer.

Awards are handed out for outstanding achievements in the following categories: Teaching Assistant of the Year, Community Award, Award for Innovation, Teacher/Lecturer of the Year, Star Student Award (under 16), Star Student Award (16 plus), Against All Odds Award, Outstanding Sporting Achievement, Apprentice Of The Year, Business Support for Schools Award and Lifetime Contribution Award.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, will likely renew fight against strong encryption Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, will likely renew fight against strong encryption By Joel Hruska on January 26, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Last year, the federal government went to war with Apple over whether it could legally force the corporation to assist it in penetrating iPhone encryption when said device was obtained as part of a criminal investigation. The case was widely seen as an attempt by the FBI to create sympathy for forcing companies to bypass their own encryption schemes and unlock hardware on-demand. But Apple’s staunch defense and widespread dissent in the court of public opinion led the bureau to back down. The FBI contracted with a third party to break into the device and dropped the case. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), President Trump’s choice for attorney general, is unlikely to let that decision stand once he is confirmed — and he’s expected to be confirmed with strong Republican support. Sessions submitted written testimony to questions from Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and the answers aren’t encouraging if you favor strong encryption without government-mandated backdoors. Jeff Sessions, at his hearing swearing-in. Sessions was asked (PDF): “Do you agree with NSA Director Rogers, Secretary of Defense Carter, and other national security experts that strong encryption helps protect this country from cyberattack and is beneficial to the American peoples’ digital security?” He responded: “Encryption serves many valuable and important purposes. It is also critical, however, that national security and criminal investigators be able to overcome encryption, under lawful authority, when necessary to the furtherance of national-security and criminal investigations.” The battle over encryption has been tumultuous, with multiple high-profile figures weighing in, and various testimonies from current and former heads of government agencies contributing conflicting opinions. FBI director James Comey, who will remain under the Trump Administration, has advocated for giving the FBI backdoors (or front doors), to device data. But both NSA Director Admiral Michael Rogers and former NSA and CIA chief Michael Hayden have directly refuted Comey, saying “I actually think end-to-end encryption is good for America.” Trump has previously spoken out against Apple’s actions in 2016 and has generally favored expanding the powers of the government in matters of national security. He has repeatedly stated that his will be a “law and order presidency,” and about the need for increased security and a strong cyberspace presence. In this regard, Trump, Comey, and Sessions himself are all wrong. Repeated testimony from experts in the field, as well as real-life events, have demonstrated that government backdoors do not work, for the simple reason that no government can guarantee it remains the sole entity in charge of or aware of those backdoors. Last August, Microsoft accidentally leaked a debugging tool it created to allow its own developers to test unsigned code, forcing the company to release a patch against it. This type of accident will happen. There is no near-term cryptographic system so good it can’t be broken, no code so perfect that anyone is willing to testify it represents an unbreakable encryption method. Given this, there shouldn’t be any debate about whether government-mandated backdoors weaken encryption or not. They did under President Obama, they will under President Trump.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files By Eric Auchard and Gwénaëlle Barzic | FRANKFURT/PARIS FRANKFURT/PARIS Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics posted in-line 2016 results on Thursday, driven by solid phone and car part sales and improved factory utilisation, while setting out a plan to boost plant capacity that could fuel revenue later in 2017. Europe's third largest semiconductor company said it had won a deal with an unnamed customer that can generate "substantial revenues" in the second half of the year, which analysts believe are tied to parts for upcoming Apple iPhones. The next generation iPhone 8 line is expected to be released by Apple in the back half of 2017. Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said ST's latest results reflect demand from automakers and phones such as the Apple iPhone 7, including "time of flight" proximity sensors that also measure ranges between a phone camera and objects in its view. "This is likely to be a new product in the iPhone 8, in addition to on-going shipments of the time-of-flight sensor," Menon advised clients. "We expect STM's strong revenue growth to convert into rising margins and further multiple expansion," he said, referring to factors justifying a higher stock price. ST Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti declined to comment on who was behind the new customer contract. "We cannot say more," he told analysts on a conference call. "We cannot give more colour." Apple demands suppliers never reveal its contracts. STOCK SURGE ST, long the sick man of European chipmakers due to erratic business performance, serial restructuring, high labour costs and relatively low margins, has seen its stock more than double from below 5 euros last July. On Thursday, shares jumped another 6.5 percent in Paris trading at 11.92 euros at 1200 GMT. UBS, which rates ST shares as "neutral", said the stock is likely to hold on to recent gains thanks to its solid near-term outlook and expected second-half revenue ramp-up, which it believes could be tied to new image sensing components for Apple. ST said it plans a major increase in capital spending on new plant capacity of up to $1.1 billion, nearly double the $607 million it spent last year and the $467 million in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro said it was a one-off increase rather than a permanently higher level of plant investment. It also forecast "better than normal seasonality" for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. ST reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $1.86 billion, an 11.5 percent increase from the last quarter of 2015 and squarely in line with what analysts, on average, expected, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue should rise 12.5 percent in the first quarter compared to the first period a year ago, it said. Gross margins marked their fifth consecutive quarterly increase by rising to 37.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the 37.1 percent, which analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters data. It forecast first-quarter gross margins of around 37 percent, plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.

Show More Since the Apple Watch Nike+ ($369 and up) became available in late October, I’ve been wearing the watch to record daily workouts. After nearly three months, I’m still infatuated with Apple’s latest smartwatch (part of its Series 2 line-up), with its built-in GPS and mostly excellent swim workout tracking. But there are three potential disappointments fitness buffs should be aware of — especially if you long to leave your iPhone behind when working out. (Quick aside: the Nike+ edition and Apple Watch Series 2 are functionally equivalent.) 1. Not many Watch apps that use the built-in GPS without your iPhone There’s no shortage of iOS fitness apps. Many of them work well on any Apple Watch, as long as it’s in proximity of an iPhone. But the number of apps that can leverage Apple Watch Series 2’s built-in GPS is still small. The list includes Apple’s own Workout app (preinstalled on all Apple Watches); Nike+ Run Club (which comes preinstalled on Nike+ edition Watches); Runkeeper; and coming soon, Strava. FitnessKeeper, Inc. Runkeeper on Apple Watch One of the more interesting iOS exercise apps on an Apple Watch is the freemium hiking and cycling app ViewRanger. You can follow downloaded cycling or hiking routes and see your GPS location on a map using just ViewRanger on your Series 2 watch. You can store up to three routes and their related maps on the Watch; more than 150,000 hiking/cycling routes are available for downloading. But the Watch app’s standalone functionality is limited. While hiking, for example, you can’t record a new route — unless your iPhone is handy. 2. Apple Watch can’t record elevation, regardless of apps Apple Watch doesn’t include an altimeter. So regardless of the app you’re using, it won’t be able to record elevation stats during a workout — unless, you guessed it, your iPhone is nearby. 3. Your fabulous new AirPods aren’t as fabulous without Siri In just a few weeks, I’ve become a big AirPods fan. It’s easy to switch between listening to music on your iPhone to jamming to a downloaded playlist on your Apple Watch. Siri is a welcome addition to the AirPods, too. Tap one of the wireless earbuds twice to summon Apple’s virtual assistant, then ask it to skip to the next track on the playlist, turn volume up or down, and so on. But here’s the gotcha: If you leave your iPhone behind, Siri won’t be coming with you. On an Apple Watch, Siri needs either your iPhone or a Wi-Fi connection to work. The upshot is that without a nearby iPhone, AirPod users must control music playback using the Music app on the Apple Watch — which can slow you down a bit. Are these deal killers? Could be, if you’re a marathoner or triathlete in training. But I suspect many people — myself included — don’t want to venture far without their iPhones.   To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

(Rob Carr | Getty Images) Print Email Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com By Dan Duggan | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 26, 2017 at 10:22 AM, updated January 26, 2017 at 10:44 AM comments The Giants' pre-draft process is in full swing with the personnel staff in Mobile, Ala., this week to scout at the Senior Bowl. While interest in the draft is picking up, most fans are focused on free agency and the current roster. So that's the focus of this mailbag. You can send me questions any time on Twitter or via email. Here we go: @DDuggan21 with the unheard of CBS depth in the draft would you, let DRC go? Guaranteed to be their at 23 and probably rd2. Use $ 4 needs? -- David Seidenfrau (@dseidenfrau) January 21, 2017 Let me start by stating that I think it would be a mistake for the Giants to let veteran cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie go this offseason. But it's at least a possibility considering DRC's $8.5 million cap hit next season. Giants coach Ben McAdoo likes to say that the team has three starting cornerbacks: DRC, Janoris Jenkins and Eli Apple. But DRC is certainly the third corner. Apple and Jenkins were the starters in the base defense when healthy, with DRC playing in the slot in sub packages. Who should be Giants' free agency priority after JPP? There was a five-game stretch from Week 10 until Jenkins suffered a back injury in Week 15 that showed the disparity. Jenkins played 96 percent of the snaps and Apple played 94 percent of the snaps, while DRC played just 52 percent of the snaps. It was clear when the Giants used the 10th pick in last year's draft on Apple that he would eventually replace DRC. Multiple people have told me that DRC wasn't happy when he learned that his role would be reduced and that he'd be moved inside to the slot. That's certainly understandable. But he never griped publicly and he came to grips with the move. DRC emerged as a leader rather than a malcontent this season. He played well in the slot and was even more valuable when stepping in when Apple or Jenkins were sidelined by injuries. Having three quality cornerbacks in today's NFL is a necessity, not a luxury. But the Giants could deem DRC's price tag too high for someone who isn't an every-down player. Perhaps the Giants will try to restructure DRC's deal by offering him more guaranteed money in exchange for a lower cap charge next season. Cutting a player of DRC's caliber wouldn't make much sense, so another option could be trading him. Of course, the Giants could also just stand pat and bring DRC back on his current contract. That's what I think they should do. But we'll see if the front office agrees after crunching the numbers. @DDuggan21 If you had to bet, where does Ereck Flowers play next season? Some say RG, but I'm going with RT. -- Tony Ain (@tonyain) January 21, 2017 This is a good question. Reese said in his season-ending press conference that Flowers could be moved from left tackle after a disappointing second season. But Reese didn't specify where Flowers could land. The most obvious destination for the 2015 first-round pick would be right tackle. But Flowers' technique issues and problems with speed rushers wouldn't be solved simply by switching sides, especially with many elite defensive ends playing on the offense's right side. Flowers' strength is his power as a run-blocker. That has led some to wonder if he's better suited inside at guard. But that's a totally different position that would present new challenges. I don't think the Giants know exactly where Flowers will wind up right now. The bottom line is he has to improve his technique if he's going to be an effective player at any position. @DDuggan21 Will the Giants sign anyone big this offseason? Resign JPP? -- Jeta R (@re2pectjeta) January 21, 2017 I think the Giants did their "big" signings last offseason. They won't be able to go out and spend top dollar on a slew of free agents again. As you mentioned, re-signing defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul could be the one big expense this offseason. As expected, Pierre-Paul is reportedly looking for a contract in the neighborhood of the five-year, $85 million deal Olivier Vernon signed with the Giants last offseason. If the Giants give Pierre-Paul a deal that rich, it's hard to see them having much leftover to go after other top free agents. Pierre-Paul is lining up to be the piece that sets the agenda for the Giants in free agency. @DDuggan21 not sure if you touched on it yet..but do you see Cruz back next year? If not, who are some outside FA WRs that would make sense? -- Ryan Sullivan (@Sull_87) January 21, 2017 I'm sure this is a topic that will come up repeatedly throughout the offseason. I addressed wide receiver Victor Cruz's future in a mailbag earlier this month (last question). Cliffs Notes version: The Giants will at least ask Cruz to take a pay cut, but I wouldn't be surprised if they sever ties completely. Whether or not Cruz is back, the Giants need to add a quality receiver or two. The draft is one option. As far as free agency, it's obviously going to depend on how much the Giants are willing to spend. There are a bunch of the mid-level options on the market. A few that could be fits are Kenny Britt, Brian Quick, Brandon LaFell, Terrance Williams and Kenny Stills.

Posted 26 Jan 2017 23:45 A logo is pictured on the factory of STMicroelectronics in Plan-les-Oautes near Geneva, Switzerland, December 6, 2016. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A FRANKFURT/PARIS: Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics posted in-line 2016 results on Thursday, driven by solid phone and car part sales and improved factory utilisation, while setting out a plan to boost plant capacity that could fuel revenue later in 2017. Europe's third largest semiconductor company said it had won a deal with an unnamed customer that can generate "substantial revenues" in the second half of the year, which analysts believe are tied to parts for upcoming Apple iPhones. The next generation iPhone 8 line is expected to be released by Apple in the back half of 2017. Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said ST's latest results reflect demand from automakers and phones such as the Apple iPhone 7, including "time of flight" proximity sensors that also measure ranges between a phone camera and objects in its view. "This is likely to be a new product in the iPhone 8, in addition to on-going shipments of the time-of-flight sensor," Menon advised clients. "We expect STM's strong revenue growth to convert into rising margins and further multiple expansion," he said, referring to factors justifying a higher stock price. ST Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti declined to comment on who was behind the new customer contract. "We cannot say more," he told analysts on a conference call. "We cannot give more colour." Apple demands suppliers never reveal its contracts. STOCK SURGE ST, long the sick man of European chipmakers due to erratic business performance, serial restructuring, high labour costs and relatively low margins, has seen its stock more than double from below 5 euros last July. On Thursday, shares jumped another 6.5 percent in Paris trading at 11.92 euros at 1200 GMT. UBS, which rates ST shares as "neutral", said the stock is likely to hold on to recent gains thanks to its solid near-term outlook and expected second-half revenue ramp-up, which it believes could be tied to new image sensing components for Apple. ST said it plans a major increase in capital spending on new plant capacity of up to US$1.1 billion, nearly double the US$607 million it spent last year and the US$467 million in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro said it was a one-off increase rather than a permanently higher level of plant investment. It also forecast "better than normal seasonality" for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. ST reported fourth-quarter net revenue of US$1.86 billion, an 11.5 percent increase from the last quarter of 2015 and squarely in line with what analysts, on average, expected, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue should rise 12.5 percent in the first quarter compared to the first period a year ago, it said. Gross margins marked their fifth consecutive quarterly increase by rising to 37.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the 37.1 percent, which analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters data. It forecast first-quarter gross margins of around 37 percent, plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.

One solution: White suggests a special-edition "Made in America" iPhone that costs an extra $100 to $200. "There will be a lot of pressure to bring some manufacturing back to the U.S.," White said. "If I were Apple, I would bring whatever they need to bring back — through the repatriation, because it may be connected — and they could market iPhones made in the U.S. and charge a premium." VCG | Getty Images Customers come to the newly opened Apple store on December 10, 2016 in Shanghai, China. Apple has already become a central point of contention between China and the U.S. when it comes to trade policy. A state-backed newspaper warned that "iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback" if President Donald Trump carried out his promised 45 percent tariffs on trade. Within his first few days in office, President Donald Trump has released executive orders that he said will improve conditions for domestic manufacturers, including a memorandum directing the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Critics of that move, including Republican Senator John McCain, noted that withdrawing from the trade deal may force American companies to forfeit their strategic positions in China. Apple's supplier dossier lists about 350 addresses in China, where some of its most high-profile partners, like Foxconn, are located. China is also key to the company's promise to return to growth next year. "Both countries need each other a lot," White said. "Foxconn, for example, employees a million people working on Apple products in China. We, as consumers — the vast majority of consumers in the U.S. — enjoy lower prices. Both countries are winning based on the way things are set up." Foxconn has said it is in preliminary discussions for U.S. expansion, and Apple does have some U.S.-made computers. Still, White said he still expects the lion's share of iPhones to be made in China going forward. Regardless, he said he expects Apple to report growing iPhone sales when it releases earnings next week. "Can [CEO] Tim Cook make Apple grow again?," White said. "I think that's what we're going to see next week." Disclosure: Apple is an investment banking client of Drexel Hamilton.

The Verge Faraday Future's FF91 car event in 7 minutes Faraday Future finally revealed its first production car, officially dubbed the FF91, tonight at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The Verge The Verge at CES 2017 CES is finally here, and it promises to have a ton of awe-inspiring technology. And The Verge is in the heart of it all! The Verge SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO When Apple removed the traditional headphone socket from its latest iPhone, part of the rationale was that wireless headphones were now coming into the mainstream. And Apple had its own player in this field, its AirPods. But then there was an unexpected delay in their launch, raising fears over technical issues. Now they’re finally here, are they worth the £159 price tag? The AirPods are not the first wireless earbuds on the market, but until the start of 2016 they all had a cable joining the right and left earbud. Now there’s a new breed of entirely wireless earbuds, but most of them don’t really work. In my testing, only Bragi’s the Headphone and Jabra’s Elite Sport wireless earbuds can keep a connection between themselves. Apple reckons it’s got that particular problem licked with a new processing chip called the W1, which regulates the connection between the earbuds and to the smartphone, tablet or computer. EarPods or AirPods? © Getty Images Double tap to activate Siri or take them out to pause or play the music. The AirPods look like EarPods with the cable cut and the slightly thicker stalks. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian If you’ve ever seen a set of Apple’s iPhone earphones, the EarPods, you know what the AirPods look and feel like. If you took the EarPods, cut the cables off, made the stalks a little thicker and ever so slightly changed that odd bud shape, you’d have the AirPods. It’s a conscious design decision that you’re either going to like or hate. They perch in your ear, unlike isolating so-called canal buds that wedge themselves in your ear canal, with the stalks going down past your earlobes. The fit is closer to an open, traditional earphone from the early 2000s than the modern canal-fitting earphone. As such, they don’t isolate you from the world around you at all. You can hear everything, even if you push them hard into your ear. As a consequence you have to have the music really quite loud to be able to hear it if you’re trying to block out the rest of your train, plane or bus commute. At work in an office, they offer almost no refuge from the chatter of those around you. But, compared to the EarPods, they leak a lot less sound. So while you can hear everything, you won’t be subjecting those around you to an impromptu tinny disco. They still bleed a little at high volume, but Apple’s done the rest of the world a favour by stopping one of the most annoying things of a modern commute – other people’s crappy music. Fit is up to the shape of your outer ear Face on the AirPods are difficult to see, hidden by your face, but side on they’re quite pronounced. Photograph: Jonathan Haynes for the Guardian The fit is relatively comfortable, but I found they hurt my ears a little after about an hour wearing them. The AirPods are very light and do not drop out of my ears, no matter how hard I shake my head, but neither would a set of EarPods without the cable dragging them down. Running while wearing them in the cold wasn’t a problem, but as I became sweaty they started to slip back from my ear canal and became much quieter. They didn’t come out but how secure they are in your ear relies heavily on the shape of your outer ear. For some people I asked to try out the AirPods, they dropped out of their ears almost immediately after they started getting up from a seat or turning their head. If the EarPods fit and stay in your ear, the AirPods will likely fit as well or slightly better without the drag of the cable. If they don’t you won’t have any luck with the AirPods. It’s also worth noting that the stalks of the AirPods bash into medium-sized shape earrings, meaning that you might have change your style to accommodate them. Audio upgrade over the EarPods Control centre integration means you can switch between the AirPods and other outputs at will. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The AirPods sound surprisingly good given the lack of a proper seal in the ear, with relatively full bass and much less of the punishing treble that’s the hallmark of the EarPods. Like most other wireless earbuds, they’re nowhere near as big a step up in quality as a set of wired earbuds costing similar. The AirPods definitely sound better than the EarPods, with more bass than Bragi’s the Headphone, but less separation and distinction between instruments and sounds. They sound similar to a good £40 – 60 pair wired earbuds. I was pleasantly surprised. Call quality was also pretty good. Although I had to crank up the volume to hear the other end, they could hear me loud and clear even when walking along a congested London street. Lack of controls Double tap to activate Siri or take them out to pause or play the music. Photograph: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple’s gone for simplicity with the AirPods, which means no buttons. In fact, there’s only one thing you can do with them once they’re in your lugholes: double tap them to either fire up Siri or pause or play music, depending on what you’ve got as default in settings (when connected to a non-Apple device the only option is pause/play). Connected to an Apple device, when you take one or both out of your ears the music pauses and resumes when you put it back in. Volume adjustment, track skipping or anything else has to either be done via Siri, which is incredibly tedious and requires a good internet connection to work, or by pulling out your smartphone. It feels a bit like Apple built the AirPods for people who own Apple Watches, because volume and play controls can be done via the wrist. Most other wireless earbuds have buttons or gestures for play controls and volume at the very least, and not having even tap gestures to skip tracks and change the volume seems like a backward step. Connection Apple AirPods being paired with an iPhone. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian The AirPods make and maintain a strong connection to other Apple products. To pair them all you need to do is open the case that they come in close to an iPhone for the first time and confirm that you want to connect them. That pairing is then shared via iCloud to your other Apple devices, should you use iCloud and have an iPad or a Mac. Switching between devices is as simple as prompting a connection from the tablet, smartphone or computer you want to use. The AirPods appear within MacOS’s menu bar, for instance, or the devices menu in Command Centre. Select them, wait for the small bong and you’re ready to go. Connected to an Apple device, the connection is absolutely bulletproof, reaching at least 10m and resisting interference as if it’s not there. The AirPods also don’t suffer from the small lag most Bluetooth headphones do when connected to Apple devices, which is only noticeable when you’re watching video and the lipsync is slightly out. They can also be used one at a time for mono audio or for taking calls. On iOS, most other Bluetooth headphones require a trip into the settings app to pair, and God forbid you have to try and connect them to a Mac – the Bluetooth audio handling has been terrible for years and simply not worth even attempting (it’s pretty bad on Windows too). Connecting to non-Apple devices Press the button on the back of the case to initiate pairing to a non-Apple device. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Things are different if you want to connect the AirPods to a non-Apple device. A button on the case puts the earbuds into pairing mode when held for a second or so, so you can find them and pair them manually. Many other good Bluetooth headphones have one-touch Bluetooth pairing – just tap your Android device on a particular spot and you’re done. But that particularly Bluetooth convenience has yet to make it to completely wireless earbuds. The AirPods’ connection to an Android device such as a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or Google Pixel XL is also not as stable as it is to an iPhone, occasionally suffering from skips rather than the cutouts that plague earbuds such as the Earins. They also do not pause the music when you take them out of your ears, and you cannot activate Google Assistant or Cortana using them – a double tap simply pauses or plays music. The case The little green LED shows you the case charge level. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian Wireless earbuds are easier to lose so almost all come with some kind of case that charges them, either when plugged in or with an internal battery. Apple’s is arguably the best designed of the lot. It’s small, the earbuds slot in, held in place by magnets, and it provides up to 24 hours of running time, or about five full charges of the AirPods. It charges via Lightning, and snaps shut with a satisfying click. The only thing missing is a battery indicator on the outside of the case, although there is a little LED just under the lid that flashes red when its out of juice. Apple reckons you get five hours of listening between trips in the case and up to 24 hours of battery life between the buds and the case, which is about right in my testing. I used them for a week between charges, listening to about five hours of music a day. For comparison, most others only get under 10 hours of battery life between charges, so what Apple’s managed here is quite remarkable. Observations Siri adjusts the volume one click at a time, which gets old really quickly Like most Bluetooth headphones and earbuds, the AirPods emit a little chime when they connect to your device The stalks hit earrings and the tops of coats or macs done up around the neck causing a loud tap or brushing noise in your ear Their while colour and stick-out stalks attract attention in your ear, much more so than other good wireless earbuds There is a feature that lets you see on a map where you last had your AirPods, if you happen to lose them, within the Find My iPhone app on iOS 10.3 Price The AirPods cost £159. For comparison, Bragi’s the Headphone cost £125 and Jabra Elite Sport cost £229. Verdict In some ways I love the AirPods. Apple’s W1 chip really does what it claims: solves Bluetooth connectivity issues that have plagued all but a few truly wireless earbuds, and with excellent battery life too. The case is also brilliant and I don’t even mind the stalk-like design. But it is Apple’s EarPod like bud design that I cannot get on with. They sound OK, but the lack of any sort of isolation makes listening to music or podcasts very difficult, even at hearing-damaging volumes. The problem is accentuated by the lack of instant volume controls. When you hit the busy street you need to crank them up to not miss anything, but when you emerge into the relative serenity of the office they suddenly sound deafening. I would pay twice the asking price for a set of canal-bud AirPods with proper sound isolation and a few more controls. For those who cannot get on with canal buds or really love EarPods, the AirPods are the best wireless earbuds going, but their advantages are quickly lost when not connected to Apple devices. For everyone else, there are already viable and similarly priced isolating alternatives available, and many more are expected this year. The new Bluetooth 5.0 specification released at the end of 2016 should also provide many of the advantages of Apple’s W1 chip, but for non-Apple devices, although it is unknown how long a wait there will be for both smartphones and earbuds using Bluetooth 5.0. . Pros: rock-solid connection, brilliant case, long battery life, seamless connection between multiple Apple devices, no lag or lipsync issues, good if not quite spectacular audio quality Cons: no isolation, less stable when connected to non-Apple devices, lack of controls, reliance on Siri requiring an internet connection Once paired with an iPhone, the AirPods are automatically available to any other Apple device logged into iCloud, and are one of the first Bluetooth headphones that aren’t infuriating to use with a Mac.

Nevada-based NV Energy has announced a solar energy partnership with Apple. This agreement will see an additional 200 megawatts added to NV Energy's solar energy capacity, and the power generated will support Apple's renewable energy initiatives for its data center located in Reno, Nevada. From NV Energy: "We are proud to play a role in helping Apple meet their energy needs with Nevada's abundant solar resource," said Paul Caudill, president and CEO of NV Energy. "In partnership with our customers, we continue to develop a more balanced fuel mix in a way that benefits the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs for Nevadans, particularly those in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 357 and 396, and advances the state's policy goals." Renewable energy and environmental impact have been major areas of focus for Apple in recent years. The company is working towards using 100% renewable energy at its facilities across the world, incorporating everything from solar energy at its new campus to methane biogas-powered fuel cells at its North Carolina data center.

Taking its legal fight against the US chip-maker Qualcomm global, Apple has filed two complaints in Chinese courts alleging that Qualcomm’s patent-licensing practices amount to extortion. The move comes days after Apple sued Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion over royalties, with Cupertino-based tech giant alleging the wireless chipmaker did not give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. “Apple has filed two complaints against Qualcomm in China. One of the complaints alleges a violation of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law and the other requests a determination of the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple for Qualcomm’s cellular standard essentials patents,” Qualcomm said in a statement on Wednesday. However, Qualcomm said it had not seen the Chinese complaints but learned about them from a Beijing Intellectual Property Court news release. Read: Nokia has sued Apple in 11 countries. Here is why “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of its efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them,” said Don Rosenberg, Executive Vice President of Qualcomm. Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of maintaining a monopoly over chips for cellular phones through a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms. While Apple uses its homegrown processors to power the iPhone, it relies on modem chips from Qualcomm especially in the US. Read: Qualcomm will continue to supply chips to Apple: Report According to a report in Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, in early 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine and lowered certain patent royalty rates for certain smartphones sold only in China as part of a settlement with China’s anti-monopoly regulator. “Qualcomm offered a patent license to Apple for Chinese sales with terms similar to those of the settlement. Apple declined to take the license, saying Qualcomm was still charging too much for key cellular patents,” the report noted. Qualcomm said it was prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world. Even though Apple has sued Qualcomm, the US chip-maker reportedly does not intend to stop doing business with the iPhone maker. tags Apple Qualcomm patent licensing chips Tim Cook more from tech Scared of losing your Apple AirPods?

(Image: Siddharth Safaya/News18.com) Taking its legal fight against the US chip-maker Qualcomm global, Apple has filed two complaints in Chinese courts alleging that Qualcomm's patent-licensing practices amount to extortion. The move comes days after Apple sued Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion over royalties, with Cupertino-based tech giant alleging the wireless chipmaker did not give fair licensing terms for its processor technology. "Apple has filed two complaints against Qualcomm in China. One of the complaints alleges a violation of China's Anti-Monopoly Law and the other requests a determination of the terms of a patent license between Qualcomm and Apple for Qualcomm's cellular standard essentials patents," Qualcomm said in a statement on Wednesday. However, Qualcomm said it had not seen the Chinese complaints but learned about them from a Beijing Intellectual Property Court news release. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of its efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology. Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them," said Don Rosenberg, Executive Vice President of Qualcomm. iPhone 7 Plus Review | Is It Still The Best Money Can Buy? Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) accused Qualcomm of maintaining a monopoly over chips for cellular phones through a "no license, no chips" policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm's preferred license terms. While Apple uses its homegrown processors to power the iPhone, it relies on modem chips from Qualcomm especially in the US. According to a report in Los Angeles Times on Wednesday, in early 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine and lowered certain patent royalty rates for certain smartphones sold only in China as part of a settlement with China's anti-monopoly regulator. "Qualcomm offered a patent license to Apple for Chinese sales with terms similar to those of the settlement. Apple declined to take the license, saying Qualcomm was still charging too much for key cellular patents," the report noted. Qualcomm said it was prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world. Even though Apple has sued Qualcomm, the US chip-maker reportedly does not intend to stop doing business with the iPhone maker.

Apple confirmed the suits and referred AFP to comments it released when it filed an antitrust suit against Qualcomm in the United States last week. “For many years, Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,” California-based Apple said in the statement. “Qualcomm built its business on older, legacy, standards but reinforces its dominance through exclusionary tactics and excessive royalties.” Qualcomm, also based in California, told AFP it had not seen the legal complaints but that a press release from a Beijing court said one of the filings accused the company of violating China’s anti-monopoly law. The other asked for a determination regarding terms of a patent license agreement, the company said. “These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm’s technology,” Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. “Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world.” High stakes Apple last week sued Qualcomm in US federal court, accusing the chipmaker of abusing its market power to demand unfair royalties, echoing recent charges by US antitrust regulators. The suit accuses Qualcomm of building a business model based on its rights to technologies that are considered telecommunication industry standards and then ramping up royalties when Apple innovated its mobile devices with features such as TouchID fingerprint recognition or digital wallets. Tech giant Apple said in the US court filing that it has been overcharged “billions of dollars” by its chipmaking partner’s “illegal scheme.” The company also claimed Qualcomm owes it a billion dollars, but is refusing to pay in retaliation for Apple’s cooperation with South Korean anti-trust regulators looking into the chipmaker’s actions in that country. South Korea’s anti-trust watchdog last month slapped Qualcomm with a record fine over $850 million for abusing its dominant market position as a maker of baseband chipsets used in mobile phones. Qualcomm will appeal the decision, seeking a stay in the Seoul High Court while the process takes place, according to Qualcomm president Derek Aberle. “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world ... by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in an earlier statement. Just the chips Apple noted in the US suit that Qualcomm’s business practices have come under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in an array of countries for selling its smartphone chipsets only to makers agreeing to its “preferred license terms” for essential mobile telecom patents. Apple relies on Qualcomm for chip-based modems that enable iPhones and iPads to communicate with telecommunication networks. Modem chips are separate from processors that act as the brains or graphics engines for mobile devices. Apple’s legal complaints in China and California argue that Qualcomm should only be able to charge royalties on the prices of modem chips and not on what is paid for smartphones, Aberle said Wednesday during an earnings call with analysts. He contended that the position was at odds with long-standing industry practice. “Apple’s complaint contains a lot of assertions, but in the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property,” Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said on the earnings call. “We intend to remain a good supplier to Apple even while this dispute continues.” — AFP More from Companies Dubai Duty Free eyes new airport for growth tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNChina follow this tag on MGNApple follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessCompanies tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNChina follow this tag on MGN+ MGNApple follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In CompaniesDubai Duty Free eyes new airport for growth Business Gallery Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Highlights: Detroit Auto Show Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Sabic to acquire remaining 50% of Shell venture 02Kurdistan may resume monthly payout to oil firms 03Saudi Aramco shelves plans for Malaysia venture Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Inside Emirates airline's engineering hangar Sep 20, 2015 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 20Images Highlights: SIHH luxury watch show Jan 18, 2017 9Images Pictures: Mohammad Bin Zayed in Mumbai Feb 13, 2016 34Images Dubai Shopping Festival 2012 in pictures Jan 31, 2012 10Images LG unveils flagship V20 smartphone Sep 07, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee World, UAE Markets Data OverviewGccEuropeAsiau.s.

The bad news: the average selling price of the handsets in the key holiday quarter ending in late December may show customers settling for older iPhone 6s models, rather than the iPhone 7, introduced in September, according to some analysts. “Recent smartphone customers increasingly are opting for the iPhone 6s,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients this week as he downgraded his recommendation on Apple stock to hold. “We detect increasing concern among industry participants that smartphones in general have evolved technologically to become more than good enough to serve most users’ digital needs over multiple years or until the device breaks.” Apple is scheduled to report quarterly results on 31 January. Analysts currently predict an average selling price, or ASP, of $688 for the iPhone line in the holiday quarter, down from $691 a year earlier, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. That’s even though the iPhone 7 Plus model costs $20 more than the iPhone 6s Plus when it was introduced. A new iPhone launch has in previous years consistently led to an increase in ASP. An ASP decline may suggest the iPhone 7’s better camera, faster processor, improved battery life and water resistance weren’t enough to draw customers away from the 6s. The trend would underscore concern that smartphone advances nowadays aren’t enough to maintain the bonanza iPhone revenue growth that the company used to enjoy. “We know what a smartphone looks like and does,” billionaire technology investor Peter Thiel told The New York Times recently. “It’s not an area where there will be any more innovation.” Apple’s revenue decline in the last fiscal year, which ended in September, represented the first such drop since 2001, as falling iPhone sales dragged down the total. Industrywide smartphone shipments were likely flat in 2016, according to researcher IDC. As recently as the second quarter of 2015, the market was growing more than 10%/year. Apple is likely to have sold about 76m phones over the holiday quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News, up from 75m handsets a year earlier. Analysts expect revenue to rise 2% to $77bn, with surging sales from the App Store and Music streaming service compensating for any dip in iPhone takings. Even after revenue from services soared last year, the iPhone still accounted for almost two-thirds of Apple’s $216bn in annual sales. The handset’s importance means any ASP weakness will focus investor attention more keenly on the next iPhone, which is likely to be unveiled later this year, the device’s 10th anniversary. Demand for this model, which analysts tentatively dub the iPhone 8, 10 or X, will be gauged by Apple’s sales forecast for the three months through March. Should it fall short of the $54bn expectation, that may suggest slack demand for current products as buyers await the new model. “The iPhone 10 gives Apple a little bit of protection,” said Gene Munster, the co-founder of Loup Ventures and long-time Apple analyst. The new device gives executives a ready excuse should the March outlook disappoint, he noted. “It’s a good get out of jail free card, since investors want to own the stock for the next product cycle,” Munster said.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 55Digital migration has ‘failed’ 9Dear Telkom, we need to talk 9Muthambi ‘ignoring’ DA on TV box report 7ICT white paper ‘not constitutional’ 7The future of radio in South Africa [podcast] Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

(AP photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 26, 2017 at 5:09 AM, updated January 26, 2017 at 8:01 PM comments Prineville may lose a factory that could bring more than 300 jobs to the central Oregon community because the region lacks the electricity to power it, city leaders said. Facebook and Apple each operate huge data centers on the bluff above Prineville, consuming tremendous volumes of energy. Even so, Prineville says it thought it had lined up plenty of electricity through the Bonneville Power Administration. When a mysterious manufacturer called "Project Falcon" approached economic development officials last year about building an energy-intensive factory in Prineville, however, Mayor Betty Roppe said the city learned its available power supply wouldn't meet the company's substantial electricity needs. "We just assumed if we had it, we had it," Roppe said. Prineville's power crunch, first reported by The Bulletin newspaper in Bend, illustrates the complexity of managing regional power supplies. It also highlights an unintended side-effect of Oregon's data center boom. The massive server farms, lured to the region with large property tax breaks, consume as much electricity as small cities. And while data centers haven't increased overall power demand nearly as much as regional energy planners once feared, they could create severe constraints in certain parts of the state. That may limit other kinds of economic growth, like the factory Prineville is courting. Tax deals worth hundreds of millions financed a new industry The BPA and regional electric utility Pacific Power agree the region generates enough power overall. The problem is that the BPA and Pacific Power lack the transmission capacity to meet industrial demand in Prineville - and, somehow, data center construction went on without anyone realizing this. That could divert Project Falcon elsewhere. "There's an economic opportunity but suddenly the community is hearing it may not be available because of problems nobody knew about. That's kind of the worst-case scenario," said Scott Bolton, Pacific Power's vice president of external affairs. The issue dates to 2012. A transformer upgrade at a substation in Crook County was supposed enable 400 to 600 additional megawatts for the region - enough to handle Facebook's power needs, new demand from Apple and additional economic development. When PacifiCorp inquired the BPA about actually obtaining 300 megawatts, though - apparently to supply Apple - the utility and city learned the power they anticipated wasn't available. According to the federal power agency, equipment retired elsewhere had an unexpected, cascading effect across its system - limiting transmission capacity to Prineville. And the agency said that limitation didn't become apparent until late last year, when Pacific Power submitted its large power request. "We need good information to plan for these large loads. They are significantly larger than any loads we've ever had to plan for before," said Crystal Ball, the BPA's Oregon liaison. Pacific Power said it's flummoxed that the agency wasn't aware Prineville needed more power: "The queue requests are well known and public and available to them," Bolton said. He declined to say, though, whether the BPA was at fault on the Prineville power crunch, acknowledging that it can be difficult to track power demand across the region. Both the utility and the agency said the Prineville issue highlights a need for better communication. "I am sympathetic to their position because they don't have perfect insight," Bolton said. For now, the BPA said it is "fast-tracking" equipment upgrades that could provide as much as 300 additional megawatts for Prineville within two years. And in time, Ball said, the agency may consider another transmission line into the region - though that can be a slow and expensive process. So Prineville's power crunch could endure for years. As Apple's data center expands, solar projects near Madras and Bend - and possible solar projects near Prineville - are seeking more transmission capacity to carry the power they generate. All that leaves everything about "Project Falcon" up in the air. Roppe, Prineville's mayor, says she doesn't know the identity of the company proposing the facility, what kind of work it does, why it wants so much power, or whether it will seek property tax breaks like the ones Facebook and Apple enjoy. "We know it's something that will bring us 340 jobs," Roppe said. "We know they're going to need a lot of water. We know they're going to need a lot of electricity." Prineville, population 9,200, is recovering from the Great Recession and Les Schwab's decision to move its corporate headquarters to Bend. Crook County unemployment, which peaked near 20 percent in 2009, now stands at about 7 percent. Still, that's well above the statewide rate of 4.6 percent, and 340 new factory jobs would handily outnumber the 200 who work at Facebook's Prineville data center. The facility could have a significant impact in the small community. With the power situation uncertain, officials in Prineville and elsewhere said Falcon is apparently looking at alternatives including Boardman, Klamath Falls, Ontario and Walla Walla, Washington. Looking back, Roppe said, she shouldn't have taken energy assurances from 2012 at face value. "I think it's my naivete," she said, "or the city being naive." -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Apple to incorporate SiriKit functionality into upcoming versions of watchOS Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Thursday, January 26th, 2017, 05:00 Category: Developer, News, Software, watchOS Per new developer documentation released on Tuesday, it looks like you’ll be able to control Siri via your Apple Watch in order to interact with third-party applications. The feature is one of a handful of enhancements expected to arrive in the upcoming operating system, watchOS 3.2, which will also introduce a “Theater Mode” option. With the update, you’ll be able to mute the sound on your Apple Watch or disable the device’s feature to wake the screen when you raise your wrist. This should allow you to be less intrusive to others when watching a movie or being in a darkened room where you’re expected to keep quiet. The SiriKit feature, which is making its way to watchOS, will allow you to speak commands to your Apple Watch. SiriKit was already available on iPhone and iPad in iOS 10, but Apple Watch may be the most useful platform for the functionality. According to Apple’s release notes on watchOS 3.2, not all apps will be able to take advantage of Siri integration, however. Instead, it will only be available to those in select domains, including messaging, payments, ride booking, workouts, calling and searching photos. As always, stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

New, 9 comments by Ashley Carman@ashleyrcarman Jan 26, 2017, 8:00am EST share tweet Linkedin Gadget makers finally reached their breaking point. After being forced to put what amounted to bad Android tablets in their devices for years, they’re ready to move beyond the screen. The proliferation of connected devices, especially the Internet of Things, was spurred by access to cheap parts. Anyone can now affordably slap a chip, accelerometer, gyroscope, and 3D-printed shell together to build something smart. But they still face one major challenge: how to give users control of their brand-new thing. Some manufacturers opt for a smartphone app; others build a touchscreen control panel right into their gadget. The touchscreen is easy, affordable, and involves no user learning curve. But still, the touchscreen presents its own problems. Software needs to be continually updated, a task that requires dedicated staff, the ability to push over-the-air updates, and the willingness of users to patch. The apps on those screens also have to be kept current, which requires a development team. And perhaps most challenging: everyone already keeps their best screen in their pocket. Our phones are powerful and consistently updated — why would we want to deal with another device? do people want another screen? So with these issues in mind, gadget makers are developing new UI paradigms in an attempt to evolve past screens. They attribute their push for voice and gesture control to users’ disinterest in staring at screens, but it seems their effort also relates back to bad Android integrations not getting any easier to maintain. There’s more at stake, too. The war for touchscreen software control has already been fought and won by Google and Apple, so whoever comes to dominate this next era of interaction could end up with all the money and investment. We’ve seen hints of this battle before, but the success of Amazon’s Echo and the onslaught of connected devices has reinvigorated gadget manufacturers to give alternative interactions another go. The question is whether these companies can uncover something people like enough to change their behavior and keep the technology alive. The Echo probably represented a one-time jackpot, not a sign of the tides changing, but gadget companies seem to think the device was representative of things to come. It’s not like they have any other choice. “The future of interaction is more subliminal and more of an undercurrent,” Gadi Amit, a designer of the Fitbit Force and principal designer at NewDealDesign, tells me. “[It’ll involve a] few carefully thought-through interactions where the computing environment is more in the background than the foreground.” Most every company is thinking about this idea. Apple’s AirPods pair with updated Apple products right out of their container sans user interaction, for example, and Snap’s Spectacles are activated by a button, no screen necessary. But perhaps no company has had as much success building hardware around screenless interactions as Amazon with its Dash buttons and Echo home device. The company’s Dash buttons are placed around users’ homes so they can make online purchases immediately upon realizing they’re running low on an item. The buttons seamlessly integrate into a home, at least if you find a massive button unassuming, and there’s no learning curve associated with using them. Everyone knows how to push a button. Dash buttons are connected and powered by cloud infrastructure, but they’re simple in execution. Amazon says they’re selling great, though we don’t have numbers to back up those claims. We can, however, assume Amazon is succeeding with its Echo line of products, including the Dot. The Echo exposed thousands of consumers to home voice control. Users can tell Alexa to turn on appliances, stream music, ask questions, or set a timer while a second form of interaction — a light — glows to signify the Echo’s listening. Amazon expanded its voice software beyond its hardware with the release of its Alexa API in 2015, which allowed gadget companies to put voice controls in everything, including watches, robots, and portable Dot-esque pucks. Seriously, look at this list of Alexa-enabled gadgets from CES. It’s bananas. These companies are betting consumers want to control their devices with their voice. Mainstream brands, including Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung also believe voice is going to be essential to future gadget interactions. Google launched Home to directly compete with the Echo, and every company emphasized their voice assistants over the past year. 2017 might be the year for Siri, or Cortana, or even Samsung’s mysterious voice assistant. No one seemed interested in using these assistants in the past, but maybe better and smarter software can do the trick. Smaller companies are experimenting with UI other than voice control, as well. They’ll likely never get a share of the market as large as Amazon, but they’re hoping to capitalize on the novelty and simplicity of their interaction technology. In some cases, they think the interactions will encourage their users to build a more natural relationship with their gadgets. These recent efforts are rooted in previous technology, all of which failed to gain traction, although that doesn’t seem to be discouraging anyone. Jake Boshernitzan, a co-founder of Knocki, envisions smart buttons, like Dash, becoming a key part of future interactions because they’re accessible and easy for anyone to use. Boshernitzan’s Knocki converts surfaces into interactive devices, similarly to how the Clapper relied on sound to register commands. “We went with taps because it activates people’s entire environment,” he says. Knocki sticks beneath or on top of a table, countertop, or wall and registers knocks as commands. It works with IFTTT, so it recognizes distinct patterns as controls for specific devices. Essentially, functionality that would have required a touchscreen can be added to a room and never consciously thought about again. These interactions become part of day-to-day life. That said, the Knocki’s predecessor, the Clapper, is best remembered as a silly infomercial we grew up watching. It still exists for $18 on Amazon, seemingly with the same packaging, but no one is rushing to buy a Clapper. Where I expect to see the most growth this year is gesture-control technology. Take two smart mirrors I demoed at CES as examples: the HiMirror Plus and the Ekko. Both mirrors rely on gesture controls for the obvious reason that no one wants to muck up their clean, expensive mirror. We’ve also seen gesture technology integrated into cars’ heads-up displays, like Navdy, where looking down at a smartphone might actually be illegal. Sang Won Lee, CEO at Qeexo, a gesture technology company, believes in gesture technology because he thinks it engages a user more thoroughly. It drives a more compelling experience, he says, which creates a better product. In some cases, gesture tech is used alongside a screen but without the conventional touch form of interaction, so in these instances, hardware makers aren’t trying to get rid of the screen so much as make it easier to handle. Gadget makers are certainly pushing hard to get users to think beyond the touchscreen but so far, most of their efforts feel more gimmicky than life-changing. In my experiences, I’ve found gesture technology, in particular, to be unfinished. I often have to gesture more than once to register a command, and I always feel unnatural waving my hand to switch screens or modes. That’ll presumably become normal for my body as I do it more, just like swiping, but it still feels bizarre. Previous attempts at creating a gesture-controlled device completely flopped. Look at gaming devices, like Microsoft’s Kinect and Nintendo’s Wii, which were both groundbreaking and fun when they debuted, to see what happened to alternative UIs in gadgets where they actually kind of made sense. only a few can win the interaction wars Although the Echo has shown voice can sell, it doesn't mean it'll work for every device. The Echo succeeds because it fits into the home environment, a place where people want silence, until they don’t. Alexa serves as an obedient assistant that genuinely makes controlling music and smart lights easier. That use case is harder to prove for other gadgets, like a watch. I don’t need to talk to my watch in the same way I talk to my Echo. I also wear my watch around the city or while out, so although it might be easier to dictate a text to my watch, the conditions aren’t always stable or silent enough to warrant voice controls. But with that in mind, maybe other companies can succeed in places outside the home. Voice or gesture control could work in cars or other hyper-specific scenarios, at least until we have self-driving cars. To usurp the phone and its touchscreen, companies have to prove their interactions are simpler and their use cases are more compelling.

Apple has also filed a second case alleging Qualcomm had broken the terms of a deal covering how Apple could use technologies it had licensed. Qualcomm said it was ready to defend its business practices in court. The lawsuits come soon after US regulators sued Qualcomm, alleging that the firm was guilty of market abuse. In its legal papers, Apple said Qualcomm was using its dominant position as a supplier of communication chips for mobile phones to squeeze more cash from firms that use its technologies. In the second legal case, Apple said that Qualcomm had denied it access to chip technologies it was entitled to under the terms of an agreed licensing deal. In a statement, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen all the details of the two cases. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology," said Don Rosenberg, head lawyer for Qualcomm. He added that Apple was offered terms and conditions that were drawn up in 2015 following a ruling by Chinese trade regulators that dictated how Qualcomm should deal with companies keen to use its modem chips. More than 100 Chinese firms signed up to these terms and conditions, he said, adding that Apple "refused to even consider them". "Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world," said Mr Rosenberg. Last week, the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm claiming it had abused its dominance in modem chips for mobile phones. The FTC said Qualcomm's use of low licensing fees was helping it to enforce its monopoly. In response, Qualcomm said the FTC complaint was based on a "flawed legal theory" and "significant misconceptions" about the way the mobile industry worked. Soon after the FTC filed its complaint, Apple followed up with its own legal action seeking $1bn (£793m) in rebates and accusing Qualcomm of overcharging it for chips. Qualcomm said it planned to fight both legal cases. The chip-maker has been hit with legal challenges and regulatory action around the world over the last few years. In December 2016, South Korean regulators fined it 1.03trn won (£698m) for breaking competition laws. In 2015, it paid a $975m (£775m) fine in China following an anti-trust probe. The European Commission has also accused it of anti-competitive practices.   Tweet LATEST NEWS • All Today news 13:10 • 28/01 Apollo 1 stars commemorated in US 12:50 • 28/01 Zhamanak: Armenian National Congress not to vie for parliament? 12:33 • 28/01 Trump closes US borders to Syria refugees 12:22 • 28/01 Armenian Army day marked at military pantheon (photos) 20:01 • 27/01 Probe reveals causes of military student’s death 19:39 • 27/01 CoE Secretary General to visit Georgia on Jan 30 19:22 • 27/01 Mike Connors, ‘Mannix’ star, dies at 91 19:13 • 27/01 French Constitutional Council rejects Genocide denial criminalization bill 18:36 • 27/01 Bundestag remembers Holocaust victims 18:26 • 27/01 German population hits record high of 82.8 million due to migrants 18:13 • 27/01 Council of Europe marks 16th anniversary of Armenia’s membership 17:51 • 27/01 Russian security service says hackers attacked major banks in 2016 17:29 • 27/01 Russian MPs pass bill to soften domestic violence law 16:59 • 27/01 Doing business in Russia easier than making US $300m investments in Armenia – economist 15:57 • 27/01 Nagorno-Karabakh key foreign policy issue for Russia – spokesperson 15:48 • 27/01 Ombudsman’s representatives visit life-termers 15:25 • 27/01 CSTO offers safeguards only against aggression – ex defense official 15:13 • 27/01 Armenia’s army efficient, capable of accomplishing strategic tasks – minister 14:28 • 27/01 We need free, competitive and fair business environment in Armenia – Karen Karapetyan 13:55 • 27/01 Merkel expected to speak with Trump about Russia on Saturday 13:44 • 27/01 John Heffern’s recent promotion serves to Armenia’s advantage –analyst 13:22 • 27/01 Armenia’s premier, Kuwaiti ambassador discuss development of bilateral economic ties 12:58 • 27/01 Turkey marks Holocaust Remembrance Day 12:45 • 27/01 Military student dies suddenly, investigation launched 12:34 • 27/01 Figures never justify facts – Armenian defense minister on army suicides 11:59 • 27/01 Part of US $200m military equipment delivered to Armenia – defense minister 11:30 • 27/01 Zhoghovurd: Exodus from Armenia’s ruling party 11:05 • 27/01 Putin, Trump to speak by phone for first time on Saturday 10:26 • 27/01 Azerbaijan continues ceasefire violations 10:15 • 27/01 ‘Democratic parliamentary elections vital for us’ – Armenian NA vice-speaker 09:34 • 27/01 Toshiba to sell slice of smartphone memory chip unit 09:21 • 27/01 Mexico condemns Trump's border wall tax proposal 20:26 • 26/01 Armenia’s premier meets with Gyumri businessmen 20:19 • 26/01 Police seek Brazilian tycoon over corruption claims 19:24 • 26/01 New opposition forming in Armenia – Richard Giragosian 19:04 • 26/01 Greece rejects Turkey soldiers' extradition 18:51 • 26/01 Armenia’s prosecutor general, head of CE office in Yerevan discuss issues of mutual interest 18:05 • 26/01 Russia says no direct contacts yet between White House and Kremlin 17:39 • 26/01 No political reason for ex-premier’s statement on secession from ruling party – Eduard Sharmazanov 17:03 • 26/01 Apple sues chip-maker Qualcomm in China 16:52 • 26/01 Armenia interested in Eurasian integration potentials – Karen Karapetyan 16:43 • 26/01 Oscar De La Hoya arrested over DUI 16:30 • 26/01 Ensuring trade turnover growth priority of Armenian-Russian investment fund – minister 16:19 • 26/01 Visa free travel to boost tourism between Armenia, Russia – premier 15:38 • 26/01 US $500 investments in Armenia expected -

Reuters/Andrew Kelly Intel Kaby Lake processors have already been announced and now fresh reports suggest that the Apple iMac 2017 may come with these chipsets. The iMac 2017 is hugely expected to be released in March. Fans want the S-series desktop chips in the 27-inch Apple iMac though there is hardly any upgrade path for the 21.5-inch iMac. The 27-inch iMac with 32GB RAM and 2TB Fusion Drive is expected to cost US$3,199.99 (AU$4,300 approx). The computer may come with a 5K display. It is also expected to come with VR support. According to PC Advisor, the 27-inch Apple iMac 2017 will likely have Core i5-7500, Core i5-7600 or the Core i7-7700K. Apple may also go for an AMD Polaris 10 graphic unit for the iMac 2017. It is rumoured that the next-generation iMac will have 10 USB 3.0 ports. Apple rolled out a new iMac back in 2015 when the Cupertino-based tech giant updated its small desktop line with Retina screen. The larger models had the Skylake processors. Since then fans have been expecting a new iMac with upgraded features and stunning specs. Apple is not ready to take a break from the desktop segment. The Apple iMac 2017 is very much in the pipeline along with some great other Macs. Apple has been a winner in the smartphone segment with every one of its iPhones setting new records. Apple CEO Tim Cook had earlier assured fans that a brand new iMac 2017 is on the cards and that desktops still play an important role in the company’s business. Apple did hold a very Mac-specific event in October where the Cupertino-based tech giant only released a MacBook Pro featuring a Touch Bar just above the keyboard. The Apple iMac 2017 was not even mentioned then. Fans were left thoroughly frustrated as they were all expecting a brand new iMac all-in-one desktop, new Mac Mini and a high-end Mac Pro.

Patently Apple was first to discover Apple's original European patent filing for flexible display that could fold back in January 2014. In December we posted a report titled "A Leading Supplier of Foldable Display Technology Confirms Five Tech Companies are Testing Foldable Smartphones." Apple along with Microsoft and others have been mentioned in a few tech reports claiming that they're working on foldable smartphones and tablets. Microsoft recently surprised the market with a detailed patent covering such devices. One of the designs that seems to be popular in the initial stages of foldable devices is the 'Fold-Out' form factor as noted in the Lenovo prototype illustrated below. As you could see by our cover graphic, Apple's patent figures clearing indicate that this future smartphone or mini-tablet could be folded out or in as noted further below in our report.   Apple invention relates to a device display with flexible encapsulation. The flexible display may bend about a bend axis when portions of a housing for the electronic device rotate with respect to each other. The flexible display may have a flexible substrate layer, a thin-film transistor layer on the flexible substrate layer, and an array of pixels having organic light-emitting diodes on the thin-film transistor layer.   A flexible encapsulation layer may be used to encapsulate and protect the organic light-emitting diodes and thin-film transistor layer of the flexible display. The flexible encapsulation layer may include a lateral dispersion layer that exhibits an anisotropic moisture diffusion characteristic. Lateral diffusion in the lateral dispersion layer is larger than vertical dispersion in a direction that runs perpendicular to the display.   Apple further notes that an inorganic conformal coating layer may coat the lateral diffusion (dispersion) layer and may serve as a pinhole filling layer (i.e., a layer that coats and smoothes particles on the lateral dispersion layer). The pinhole filling layer may be deposited using atomic layer deposition. By coating and smoothing particles on the lateral diffusion (dispersion) layer, the particles will not damage the encapsulation layer.   The pinhole filling layer may be covered with a moisture barrier layer that serves to prevent moisture from penetrating the display. The moisture barrier layer may have one or more layers of material such as inorganic material that blocks moisture.   A polymer protective layer may cover the moisture barrier layer and may be relatively insensitive to bending induced stress as the display is flexed. Because the inorganic layers of the encapsulation layer are located below the polymer protective layer and are therefore subjected to reduced amounts of bending stress, bending-induced cracks in the inorganic layers can be reduced.   In a separate patent filing discovered this morning Apple reveals new transparent strain sensors that are set beneath the display. The patent provided no examples of why this mattered, yet in context with Apple flexible foldable smart device patent we see how this could now be applied.   In respect to Apple's folding device patent, they note that it also one day apply to a laptop computer, a computer monitor containing an embedded computer, a tablet computer, a cellular telephone, a media player, or other handheld or portable electronic device or a wearable device.   It's clear that there's a race between all of the major smartphone vendors to launch foldable devices and even Microsoft and Google are noted as working on designs as well. Microsoft's is probably the most elaborate to date, though Samsung has been working on this for many, many years with a dozen or more form factors that they're considering from the simple to the exotic with scrollable designs as illustrated in their more recent filings.   Now that Apple's third invention on foldable devices has surfaced, we have to now acknowledge that this is a serious project that they're working on. Timing to market of course will always remain a mystery.   Apple's patent application was filed in May 2016.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

REUTERS/Denis BalibouseMore By Eric Auchard and Gwénaëlle Barzic FRANKFURT/PARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics posted in-line 2016 results on Thursday, driven by solid phone and car part sales and improved factory utilization, while setting out a plan to boost plant capacity that could fuel revenue later in 2017. Europe's third largest semiconductor company said it had won a deal with an unnamed customer that can generate "substantial revenues" in the second half of the year, which analysts believe are tied to parts for upcoming Apple iPhones. The next generation iPhone 8 line is expected to be released by Apple in the back half of 2017. Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said ST's latest results reflect demand from automakers and phones such as the Apple iPhone 7, including "time of flight" proximity sensors that also measure ranges between a phone camera and objects in its view. "This is likely to be a new product in the iPhone 8, in addition to on-going shipments of the time-of-flight sensor," Menon advised clients. "We expect STM's strong revenue growth to convert into rising margins and further multiple expansion," he said, referring to factors justifying a higher stock price. ST Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti declined to comment on who was behind the new customer contract. "We cannot say more," he told analysts on a conference call. "We cannot give more color." Apple demands suppliers never reveal its contracts. STOCK SURGE ST, long the sick man of European chipmakers due to erratic business performance, serial restructuring, high labor costs and relatively low margins, has seen its stock more than double from below 5 euros last July. On Thursday, shares jumped another 6.5 percent in Paris trading at 11.92 euros at 1200 GMT. UBS, which rates ST shares as "neutral", said the stock is likely to hold on to recent gains thanks to its solid near-term outlook and expected second-half revenue ramp-up, which it believes could be tied to new image sensing components for Apple. ST said it plans a major increase in capital spending on new plant capacity of up to $1.1 billion, nearly double the $607 million it spent last year and the $467 million in 2014. Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro said it was a one-off increase rather than a permanently higher level of plant investment. It also forecast "better than normal seasonality" for the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. ST reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $1.86 billion, an 11.5 percent increase from the last quarter of 2015 and squarely in line with what analysts, on average, expected, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue should rise 12.5 percent in the first quarter compared to the first period a year ago, it said. Gross margins marked their fifth consecutive quarterly increase by rising to 37.5 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the 37.1 percent, which analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters data. It forecast first-quarter gross margins of around 37 percent, plus or minus 2.0 percentage points.

Apple has a new display choice in JDI's bendable plastic LCD, if it wants to make a curved-screen iPhone 8. ByLiam Tung | January 26, 2017 -- 12:50 GMT (04:50 PST) | Topic: Mobility JDI's new product isn't as flexible as OLED screens but it is bendy enough to wrap around the edges of a smartphone like the Galaxy Edge. Image: JDI Apple supplier Japan Display Inc has unveiled a bendable plastic LCD screen that could rival Samsung's OLED displays found in the Galaxy Edge. Many reports have speculated Apple's next iPhone will have a curved if not OLED display, but the only company that can produce OLED at that scale is Samsung. iPhone: What will the next 10 years bring? What will the iPhone of 2027 look like? Will there even be an iPhone in 2027? Read More Apple may now have a new choice, thanks to current iPhone supplier JDI announcing the 5.5-inch flexible display, called Full Active Flex. JDI's new display isn't as flexible as OLED but it is bendy enough to wrap around the edges of a smartphone like the Galaxy Edge, JDI COO Shuji Aruga told the Wall Street Journal. The Full HD flexible displays are set to hit mass production in 2018, according to JDI, which is aiming to bring them to smartphones, notebooks, and vehicle dashboards. OLED screens don't need backlights and can be curved. However, as noted by the WSJ, it would be expensive for JDI to mass-produce them since it would need new production lines. The company also supplies displays to Huawei. JDI's flexible display swaps glass for plastic layers on each side of the LCD, which allows them to be flexible as well as more resistant to cracking. It could even be a battery saver since the display supports 60Hz, 30Hz, and 15Hz driving frequencies. People familiar with Apple's plans have said the iPhone maker is looking at the flexible displays for future iPhone models, according to the WSJ. "Mass production is planned from 2018, and we wouldn't do that without demand from our clients," Aruga said. In a bid to catch up with LG and Samsung in OLED, JDI announced last year that it would also start mass production of OLED displays in 2018 and has shown interest in developing flexible OLEDs.

Tech Entertainment Business Social Deals Podcast About Apps & Software Image Source: iHelp BR Apple just released iOS 10.3 beta 1 Zach Epstein @zacharye January 24th, 2017 at 1:05 PM Share Tweet Apple fans recently celebrated the 10-year anniversary of the original iPhone’s unveiling back on January 9th, 2007, but now they have a new reason to celebrate. Apple has just released iOS 10.3 beta 1, the first pre-release version of the company’s next big iOS release. iOS 11 is obviously the most hotly anticipated software release from Apple in 2017, but we still have five months to wait before Apple shows off iOS 11 at WWDC 2017 this coming June. In the meantime, iOS 10.3 will likely be the last major iOS 10 update Apple will release in terms of new feature additions. Don't Miss: All the reasons people are ditching Android and switching to iPhones Rumors first surfaced on New Year’s Eve suggesting that Apple had a somewhat big update planned for iOS 10.3 — a new “theater mode” feature that iPhone and iPad users have been waiting for since iOS 10 was first released as a beta all the way back in June last year. Supposedly accessible through the Settings app or through a Control Center shortcut, theater mode was said to be the dark mode feature users have been clamoring for. Whites and other bright colors in the iPhone’s user interfaces would be swapped out for black, grays, and other dark colors that would make the screen more comfortable to look at in low light. Did the new theater mode finally arrive in today’s iOS 10.3 beta? Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like that’s the case. iOS 10.3 does have a new Find My AirPods feature for iPhone users who also own AirPods (obviously), but theater mode is nowhere to be found. Apple’s new iOS 10.3 beta is compatible with the following iOS devices: iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Plus iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 5s iPhone 5c iPhone 5 iPad Pro 12.9-inch iPad Pro 9.7-inch iPad Air 2 iPad Air iPad 4th generation iPad mini 4 iPad mini 3 iPad mini 2 iPod touch 6th generation Here are the full release notes from Apple: Tags: Apple, iOS 10.3, iPhone View Comments Trending 1 Apps & Software Google Docs just got a whole lot more powerful on iOS and Android 2 Mobile Apple’s iPhone 8 might look a lot like this 3 Mobile The iPhone 8 might take a revolutionary approach to sensors 4 Mobile The Honor 8 has the same specs as the Galaxy S7, but it’s on sale for $340 unlocked 5 Mobile The iPhone 7 might be losing a fight with its older brother Picked For You The iPhone 7 might be losing a fight with its older brother By Mike Wehner January 26th at 8:00 PM Amazon sale drops Fire Essentials Bundle to its lowest price ever By Maren Estrada January 26th at 8:20 AM Netflix for Android just got a new feature iPhone owners will never see By Chris Smith January 25th at 7:18 PM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Qualcomm supplies modem chips for the most widely-used smartphones Apple has filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in China seeking 1bn yuan (£115m) in damages, claiming the chip maker has abused its market position. Apple has also filed a second case alleging Qualcomm had broken the terms of a deal covering how Apple could use technologies it had licensed. Qualcomm said it was ready to defend its business practices in court. The lawsuits come soon after US regulators sued Qualcomm, alleging that the firm was guilty of market abuse. In its legal papers, Apple said Qualcomm was using its dominant position as a supplier of communication chips for mobile phones to squeeze more cash from firms that use its technologies. In the second legal case, Apple said that Qualcomm had denied it access to chip technologies it was entitled to under the terms of an agreed licensing deal. In a statement, Qualcomm said it had not yet seen all the details of the two cases. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology," said Don Rosenberg, head lawyer for Qualcomm. He added that Apple was offered terms and conditions that were drawn up in 2015 following a ruling by Chinese trade regulators that dictated how Qualcomm should deal with companies keen to use its modem chips. More than 100 Chinese firms signed up to these terms and conditions, he said, adding that Apple "refused to even consider them". "Qualcomm is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world," said Mr Rosenberg. Legal battles Last week, the US Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm claiming it had abused its dominance in modem chips for mobile phones. The FTC said Qualcomm's use of low licensing fees was helping it to enforce its monopoly. In response, Qualcomm said the FTC complaint was based on a "flawed legal theory" and "significant misconceptions" about the way the mobile industry worked. Soon after the FTC filed its complaint, Apple followed up with its own legal action seeking $1bn (£793m) in rebates and accusing Qualcomm of overcharging it for chips. Qualcomm said it planned to fight both legal cases. The chip-maker has been hit with legal challenges and regulatory action around the world over the last few years. In December 2016, South Korean regulators fined it 1.03trn won (£698m) for breaking competition laws. In 2015, it paid a $975m (£775m) fine in China following an anti-trust probe. The European Commission has also accused it of anti-competitive practices.

 Apple is tipped to join an AI ethics group that includes Google, Facebook, and Amazon Sam Shead Jan. 26, 2017, 5:56 AM 1,356 facebook linkedin twitter email print Apple CEO Tim Cook.AP There was one big name missing from the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (AI) member list when the research consortium was announced last September. Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft all pledged to work together to ensure AI is developed safely and ethically but Apple refused to get involved. Now it looks like the world's largest company and a tech giant renowned for keeping its research efforts a secret may have reconsidered its decision. Citing sources with knowledge of the situation, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Apple is set to join the elite club, going on to say that its admission could be announced as early as this week. Apple has been gradually building up its AI and machine learning capabilities and buying a succession of small AI startups. Last October, it hired Ruslan Salakhutdinov, one of the big guns of AI research. Unlike Google, DeepMind, and Facebook, Apple has traditionally prevented its top researchers from publishing their work in open forums. Last November, Yann LeCun, Facebook's head of AI, said this could make some engineers think twice about working for the iPhone maker. "So, [when] you’re a researcher, you assume that you’re going to publish your work," said LeCun. "It’s very important for a scientist because the currency of the career as a scientist is the intellectual impact. So you can’t tell people 'come work for us but you can’t tell people what you’re doing' because you basically ruin their career. That’s a big element." AI has been tipped to improve many aspects of life, ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing to home automation and transportation. But it's also been described by the likes of renowned scientist Stephen Hawking and tech billionaire Elon Musk as something that could wipe out humans altogether. Partnership on AI, a non-profit organisation, has pledged to work to advance public understanding of AI and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field.

And what tech specs and new features should we expect from Apple's new iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus handsets for 2017? Welcome to our iPhone 7s rumour roundup, in which we gather and analyse the latest clues and speculation about the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, new features and more. If you've come here in search of information about the current iPhone range, allow us to direct you to our iPhone 7 review, iPhone 7 Plus review, iPhone buying guide 2016/2017 and best iPhone deals UK. Apple unveiled the new iPhone 7, alongside its bigger sibling the iPhone 7 Plus, during a special event on 7 September last year. But we're already looking ahead to the next iPhone in 2017. In this article we sift through the clues and evidence pointing to Apple's iPhone 7s launch later this year, and predict the iPhone 7s release date, tech specs, design and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information emerges, so check back regularly for the latest iPhone 7s rumours. Updated, 26 January 2017, with confirmation that one of Apple's hardware partners is ready to make curved screens; on 23 Jan, with a detailed report predicting a more sensitive second-gen 3D Touch in the iPhone 7s; on 20 Jan, with predictions that the late-2017 iPhone update will be rebranded as the 'iPhone X'; on 4 Dec, to add further detail to reports that the iPhone 7s will feature wireless charging, as well as claims (from Donald Trump) that Donald Trump is pressuring Tim Cook to build iPhones in the US; and on 17 Nov, to report on a source's claim that Apple is integrating augmented reality into its next iPhone Read more: iPhone 8 rumours | iPhone 9 rumours | Best cheap iPhone deals UK iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Release date The iPhone 7 was announced on 7 September, and pre-orders began on 9 September; it went on sale on 16 September. (Read our list of the Best cheap iPhone 7 deals.) Which gives us some pretty strong hints about when to expect the iPhone 7s. Ever since the launch of the iPhone 4s, Apple has consistently updated its iPhones once a year, in autumn (with one exception: the smaller iPhone SE was launched in March 2016), so we're expecting the iPhone 7s to appear some time in September 2017. Here are our predictions of upcoming iPhone release dates over the next few years: Mar 2017: iPhone SE 2 Sept 2017: iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus Mar 2018: iPhone SE 3 Sept 2018: iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Mind you, it's possible that Apple might bring the iPhone 8 forward... as we discuss in the next section. iPhone 7s release date rumours: Donald Trump 'pressuring Apple to build iPhone 7s in the US' As part of his recent presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained about Apple's offshore manufacturing operations, and boasted that he would make the company build its iPhones in the US (and employ a bunch of Americans in the process). Now, as president-elect, he's trying to make his promises a reality. Speaking to the New York Times, Trump described a call he had with Tim Cook about the issue, and appeared to think he had been extremely persuasive. "I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.'" Read next: Where are Apple products made? Apple has its reasons for building its smartphones in Asia, where labour costs are lower (and the relevant skills are more plentiful, according to Cook). But Trump thinks he can sweeten the deal with tax cuts and changes to regulations. "I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'" What Trump did not claim is that Cook actually agreed to any of this, even in principle. And Tim Cook doesn't strike us as someone who could easily be cowed into taking a course of action that isn't in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders. More of this sort of vague thing has emerged since then. Trump stated in an interview with Axios that Tim Cook has his "eyes open" to the idea of building iPhones in the US, and that he "really believes [Cook] loves this country and I think he'd like to do something major here", whatever that means.  To be frank, these statements read less like an update on the progress of negotiations and more like a public blackmail campaign, but it might just work. Trump has been underestimated before. Other Apple products made in the US The idea of US manufacture isn't totally alien to Apple, although it is unusual and restricted to far lower-volume products than the iPhone. It has made a lot out of its US Mac Pro assembly, but this is a niche product - a flagship niche product, to be sure, but one that is made in comparatively low numbers. In January 2017 - a couple of weeks ahead of Trump's inauguration - Apple applied to expand the use of a manufacturing facility it owns in Arizona. (The plant was originally going to be used for sapphire screens, but that fell through.) It was understood, rather boringly, that Apple would be building data server cabinets for its own internal use, but the company has since stated that it will merely be receiving, configuring and distributing servers from this hub rather than building any products. Any increase in the company's US manufacturing footprint, no matter how seemingly unrelated to the iPhone, will add to speculation that Donald Trump's very public pressure is beginning to have an effect. (The President is quite canny at taking credit for things that are unrelated to - and sometimes precede - the actions he claims to have caused them, as the US automotive industry is currently discovering.) iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Name Apple habitually follows what is known as a 'tick-tock' release cycle with its iPhones. One year it will release a full-number upgrade, featuring a significant physical redesign (iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPhone 6); then the next year it will release an 'S' upgrade which has the same physical design as its predecessor but adds new features and spec boosts (iPhone 4s, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6s). For this reason many Apple fans choose to upgrade their phones once every two years. Given that the iPhone 7 appeared in 2016, the obvious conclusion is that Apple will unveil an iPhone 7s (and accompanying iPhone 7s Plus) in autumn 2017. But there have been increasingly widespread murmurs that it's about time for Apple to retire its tick-tock cycle, which deprecates the importance of its S releases and discourages regular updates. What's more, 2017 is the iPhone's 10th-anniversary year, and the iPhone 7 had a surprisingly similar physical design to the iPhone 6 and 6s (headphone port aside). For these reasons, quite a few of us suspect that Apple will go all-out with a blockbuster release, branded as the iPhone 8, next year. Indeed, a little extra weight was added to the 'iPhone 8 in 2017' theory in early October 2016. Business Insider reports that an Apple employee in Israel who solders components spoke to them about the next iPhone and referred to it as the iPhone 8 "unprompted in our conversation". iPhone X Timothy Arcuri, an analyst at the research firm Cowen and Company, has sent out a client note predicting among other things that the late-2017 iPhone update will be branded as iPhone X - the letter X in this case evidently signifying the Roman numeral for 10, since the iPhone is celebrating its 10th birthday in 2017. It's rather leftfield, and we'll count it as unlikely until we hear evidence to back it up, but it's actually not the worst idea in the world: those relentlessly rising model numbers draw attention to quite how long Apple has been churning out iPhones, and make each one seem like merely the latest update in a long line of identikit devices. This would be a statement of intent, a declaration that this one is different. We'll talk a bit about Timothy Arcuri's other predictions later in this article. Macworld poll: What will Apple call the next iPhone? iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: Design What physical changes can we expect in the iPhone 7s? Logically, an S upgrade would imply a lack of a physical redesign, but Apple has kept largely the same chassis for three iPhones in a row now and we'd be shocked if the company doesn't pull some kind of major revamp out of the bag. iPhone 7s design: Edge-to-edge screen, with no Home button Some while back Piper Jaffrey analyst Gene Munster suggested the iPhone 7 wouldn't have a Home button, reasoning that the new 3D Touch technology introduced with the iPhone 6s could largely take its place and allow Apple to use the space to make the screen bigger or the device smaller. (A corollary of Munster's theory is that the Touch ID fingerprint scanner would need to move - perhaps being built into the screen itself.) Munster's speculation about the iPhone 7 didn't prove to be true - indeed, Munster has made a few famously misjudged predictions in the past, along with some decent calls - but may yet happen on the iPhone 7s. Technology that could help with this development was recently announced by a biometric R&D company, Sonavation. Its tech would enable Apple to run the screen vertically edge-to-edge, with no cut-out for the Home button. The Home button could occupy the same position but appear only when needed, much like the software keyboard; and the technology for Touch ID would be bonded to the underside of the screen at the appropriate point. Last year Apple filed a patent that seems relevant to this concept. Patent application number 20150036065, for "a fingerprint sensor... incorporated in a display stack in an electronic device", was filed in April 2014 and published recently. Here are some of the illustrations: (The illustration in Fig. 1 above appears to show an iPhone that still has a Home button, and therefore doesn't increase the amount of screen area - what would be the point of that, you might wonder. But remember that this is to illustrate the concept itself, not to show what it would look like in practice or the way other elements of the product would change to adapt to it.) What's more, Apple has been granted another patent that also refers to a fingerprint sensor that can work through a screen. Patent 9,460,332 describes a "Capacitive fingerprint sensor including an electrostatic lens": more pertinently to this discussion, it states that "one or more other device components, such as a display stack and/or a touchscreen may be interposed between the contact surface of dielectric structure 202 and array 206 of capacitive sensing elements". In January 2017 yet another patent was added to the pile of evidence that Apple is plotting the use of an edge-to-edge screen. Patent 9,543,364, granted on 10 January, refers to "Electronic devices having displays with openings", and appears to cover various means by which Apple would be able to hide cameras, sensors and controls behind the screen and still allow the user to access them, thanks to small (and in most cases tiny) holes in the screen. This in turn means Apple can expand the screen outwards to cover the full face of the device, since it doesn't need to leave space around the edge for the various apertures and controls we've grown used to. The holes could be filled in with a material that doesn't block radio signals, for instance, although in many cases they will be so small that the user wouldn't notice them. iPhone 7s design: Larger screen Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri, who we quoted earlier, has also made some predictions about the screen to be included in what he predicted will be called the 'iPhone X'. There will be three models, Arcuri says: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch phones, to match the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and a new 5.8-inch iPhone - the biggest ever iPhone screen. This latter, clearly flagship model, will have an OLED screen and a "wraparound" design with the Touch ID fingerprint sensor integrated under the glass, with no separate Home button. iPhone 7s design: Curved/flexible screen There have been consistent rumours, stretching back years, that Apple is going to make an iPhone with a curved or flexible screen - although flexible might be a misleading word to use here. Very few people imagine that an iPhone in the near future will actually be able to 'flex' in any meaningful way (being folded in half to fit in a pocket, for example); most pundits just mean that it will have curved edges so that the screen continues a little way down the sides, like the Samsung S7 Edge. Some relatively firm evidence was added to this theory in January 2017, when the screen maker Japan Display, which already works with Apple, confirmed [paywall article] that it is ready to start building flexible displays. (Again, this is understood to mean 'curved' rather than 'actively bendable by the user'.) While the company didn't mention Apple by name, it did say it is building the screens for hardware partners, and analysts are understandably putting two and two together. iPhone 7s design: Glass front and back 9to5Mac cites a report, from the generally reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, that predicts - based on the popularity of the (scratch-prone) Jet Black iPhone 7 - that the next iPhone will have a glass front and back that mimic that device's glossy looks but are better able to resist scratch damage. "If Apple does follow through with what KGI suggests," the site predicts, "an all-glass design could extend the glossy finish to all colours of the iPhone lineup depending on how Apple handles the design." iPhone 7s design: Stainless steel chassis DigiTimes (a Chinese-language site which Apple Insider describes as a "hit-or-miss publication", with polite savagery), is predicting that the chassis of the iPhone 7s will be made of stainless steel and supplied by Jabil rather than favoured manufacturing partner Foxconn, citing the usual anonymous sources in the supply chain. This would be a surprise, to be honest, given Apple's overwhelming recent preference for aluminium; the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s were designed with steel bands around a glass body, but it's been all aluminium for the iPhone line ever since. And we're given to understand that the engineering method will be different this time around: whereas the iPhone 4-gen handsets were milled, the iPhone 7 metalwork will be forged, a technique that creates stronger components. iPhone 7s design: Colour options The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in five colour options: silver, gold, Rose Gold (pink), (matt) black and Jet Black. The iPhone 7s will probably be available in the same colours, but it's believed that there will be a sixth red option as well. The (generally pretty reliable) Japanese-language site Macotakara has posted a report that cites a source in the Taiwanese supply chain and says it is highly probably red will be added to the colour line-up. (A slight complication here is that Apple has historically made red products as part of the Product Red HIV/AIDS charity, rather than as a cosmetic preference. Macotakara doesn't comment on whether this will be tied in with that charity.) Mockup illustration courtesy of Macotakara Before the launch of the iPhone 7 there were rumours about a Deep Blue colour option, but we've not heard much about that since then. iPhone 7s release date rumours UK: New features Pundits are increasingly looking ahead to 2017 for a big iPhone launch. Making predictions about the upcoming performance of Apple stock, analysts at Credit Suisse forecast that the 10th-anniversary iPhone released in 2017 (which they predict will be called iPhone 8 in recognition of its major updates, incidentally) will feature "significant innovations" such as a full-glass OLED screen, new and upgraded haptic feedback features, wireless charging and numerous major specs improvements including the camera and processor. Here are some more features we could see in the iPhone 7s. iPhone 7s new features: New 3D Touch AppleInsider is predicting that the late-2017 iPhone will feature second-gen 3D Touch with greater sensitivity and greater gesture versatility than the current version, thanks to changes in the underlying design. According to a research note from the respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo seen by the site, the next iPhone will have 3D Touch based around thin film instead of flexible printed circuit boards. While this would improve the way the technology works, it would create design headaches; for one thing, thin film sensors don't incorporate the metal conductive plate that protects the current screen from deformation, so Apple would have to add a passive metal backplate or risk a repeat of the Bendgate scenario. The development would also add to manufacturing costs, and with UK prices already up to account for the weakness of the pound, Apple hasn't got much room for manoeuvre if it wants to protect its profit margin. Read next: Best 3D Touch shortcuts iPhone 7s new features: Wireless charging Wireless charging didn't arrive with the iPhone 7 as some had predicted (it has also been predicted for previous iPhone models stretching back some years), but was introduced to the Apple Watch in the form of inductive charging... and this is significant. As iMore's Rene Ritchie points out, inductive charging hasn't been practical for the iPhone in previous years because the technology available at the time didn't work through an aluminium backplate - but the Apple Watch can offer wireless charging because it has a ceramic back. In July 2015 Qualcomm announced a wireless charging breakthrough that does work through metal. This came too late for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, but the technology may appear in the 7s generation. Foxconn, a huge iPhone manufacturer, is reported to be testing wireless charging modules that will be included in some or all of the 2017 iPhones. (Apple likes to have at least one major feature that sets the Plus model apart, and so it would makes a certain sense to limit this to the large model only.) The questions at this point relate to yield rate and profitability: Foxconn is exploring the practicality of producing large batches of the component to a satisfactory standard. In November 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted in a report that Apple will indeed bring wireless charging capabilities to the autumn 2017 iPhone handsets, thanks to the all-glass design, but warned that the firm may bundle the wireless charger with more expensive models only. The firm envisions a wireless pad for charging the phones, somewhat like the inductive charger that comes with the various Apple Watch models. Perhaps the iPhone 7s Plus will offer wireless charging out of the box, while iPhone 7s buyers will need to purchase the charging pad separately (in this scenario, obviously the phones would need to be chargeable via conventional means too); or it might be the lower storage capacity units that miss out on the bundled wireless charger. That's another accessory to put on your shopping list, then. Business Insider offers a little more detail from Ming-Chi Kuo's report on wireless charging; one aspect it mentions - which appears to contradict earlier rumours that Foxconn was leading the way in this area - is that Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of this component.  iPhone 7s new features: Augmented reality and VR According to a source cited by Business Insider (described only as "a person familiar with the matter"), Apple is currently working on a new augmented reality feature for the 2017 iPhone update. "By adding AR technology into the iPhone's camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognised," said the site. "Another early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognise and manipulate people's faces." This fits with earlier predictions raised in a far-ranging and fascinating Facebook post by Robert Scoble which discussed the way VR and augmented reality will figure in Apple's upcoming iPhones. "Really amazing VR/AR/mixed reality is coming... and coming by the end of 2017," Scoble writes. "Apple's entrance into this new world is like when IBM came into the personal computing world. It is that important." He discusses the impact that a mixed-reality iPhone could have on the market, and predicts that users will "pop [the new iPhone] into a headset which has eye sensors on it, which enables the next iPhone to have a higher apparent frame rate and polygon count than a PC with a Nvidia 1080 card in it... The clear iPhone will put holograms on top of the real world like Microsoft HoloLens does. "You'll look through the glass in mixed reality modes (think of a new kind of Pokemon game) either in the headset, or in your hand."

Rating:  3 Typical Price:  £580.00 Pros:  Great build quality; Sense 7 is perhaps the best Android overlay of them all; Powerful performance; Decent size and weight; SD-support Cons:  As nice as the design is, we'd like to have seen more –– it feels very 2014 after seeing the Galaxy S6 EDGE; Display lags behind the competition; Camera needs work; Very high price point for what's on offer compared to Galaxy Note 4 and Google Nexus 6. Verdict:  Part of me loves it; the way it looks and feels in the hand and the ease and elegance it runs Android Lollipop. But there is another aspect to the HTC One M9 and it is one that all the gold and silver and metal and software tweaks cannot shine over. It is too incremental, and the improvements that are present (the camera, for instance) are so negligible in the grand scheme of things it’s very difficult to stomach the £580 price tag, which is a good deal more than Google’s Nexus 6 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. facebook twitter google+ UPDATE: The HTC One M9, while not a knock-out success, was still a very solid handset. It was also exceptionally good-looking, as a result of its stunning aluminium unibody design. Part of the reason it was so unaccessible at launch was due to the fact that it was priced way to high to be competitive. Samsung controls the Android space and barely anyone else gets a look in. But once the price of handsets like the HTC One M9 start to come down, which they inevitably do after a 12 months on market, savvy consumers can pick up some exceptional bargains if they know where to look. Below are some of our picks for the HTC One M9, which is now available for under $250 – a price that makes this handset VERY appealing, indeed. ----------------------------------------------------------- Once, in a time which now seems a very long time ago, HTC was one of the few companies which made the successful jump from being a Taiwanese phone maker producing devices on behalf of other brands, to a legitimate device maker in its own right. That alone made it a bit of a darling of the Android space, producing competetive handsets as an alternative to Samsung's offerings. Aside from the ill-fated HTC Flyer tablet, the company could pretty much do no wrong, as it wowed consumers with the likes of the HTC One X and One S. Sure, HTC wasn't shifting devices in the same volume as Apple and Samsung, but it was doing well enough and was quite well regarded; things looked positive. Then the HTC One (M7) came along and things shifted up a gear. HTC was now making premium looking phones that gave Apple’s designers a run for their money. Up next was the HTC One M8, the all-important and infinitely trickier “second album”. HTC made no bones about sticking to the design philosophy it had adapted for the birth of its One range of phones, and most were onboard with this –– if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The CPU was updated, there were some smallish tweaks to the shape and gait of the chassis, and that was about it… but most startlingly HTC, for whatever reason, DIDN’T ditch its grossly underpowered 4MP UltraPixel technology despite a veritable firestorm of criticism. Horror of horrors.  Next came a bunch of redesigned iPhones, in the form of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which sold in frankly incomparable numbers (70+ million in three months, to be exact), who joined already very solid releases from LG, with its awesome G3, and the excellent –– but something of a handful –– Google Nexus 6. But it wasn’t until Q1 2015 that things really began to look a little dicey for HTC, as it appeared mobile’s sleeping dragon (Samsung) had awoken, ditched the hooch and was apparently back, firing on all cylinders with its seriously-well-received Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 EDGE, which completely dominated MWC from start to finish.  Essentially, every man and his dog had come to 2014/15’s market place with a brand new, completely redesigned flagship handset. Even Apple managed it –– and that hardly ever happens. LG too is now building up to its big reveal inside Q2 and all of this could, I fear, put HTC in a potentially vulnerable position. All of the company’s competitors –– Apple, LG, Samsung, Google –– for the first time in as long as I can remember, seem to be really pushing the envelope with their handsets. This hasn’t happened in a good long while, so one could argue it was a bit naive of HTC to think it could wade into this type of environment with a handset so very similar to last year’s model. It was exceedingly ballsy, sure, staring down such fierce competition, but will it pay off? Do consumers “like” the design of the M8 that much? Possibly. But if they don’t –– also a possibility –– the company stands to lose A LOT of ground in Q1/Q2 2015. Perhaps this is why HTC is already prepping a bigger and better model in the form of the HTC One M9+?  And there is much ground to lose in 2015, too. Samsung is looking to increase its 10-quarter single digit margin slump back pre-2013 levels of profitability, and when you take into account the reviews, hype and 20+ million network orders thus far, it is starting to look very likely the Korean manufacturer will do just that. So, yes, HTC has a lot to prove with the M9. The competition is fiercer than ever and more and more folks are beginning to, once again, look to Samsung for innovation, a first for at least the past 18 months.  Does the M8 have the chops to stand out from the crowd of throughly excellent Android handsets now readily available? Reports as of May 22 suggest perhaps not, according to DigiTimes' anonymous sources HTC has reduced its orders for One M9 components by 30% "due to lower-than-expected sales." Said sources also alleged the company had experienced "flat" sales apparently due to consumers being dissatisfied with the overly familiar design; which is very similar to the previous-gen One M8. Meanwhile the competitiveness of the spec has also been brought into question by these sources, as well as the threat posed to HTC's sales by Chinese rivals such as Xiaomi and Oppo. HTC itself has declined to comment. HTC One M9 Review: Design The HTC One M9 is a beautiful looking device, just like its forefathers. Encased in a premium-feeling, two-tone gold and silver chassis, the handset exudes class. It also feels great in the hand with its conservatively-sized 5in display and sleek angular body. And this is all excellent stuff, indeed. Par for the course, when you’re talking about a company like HTC. You do not expect anything less. But the one thing you simply cannot get around, in spite of all this, is just how familiar it is to behold –– the M9 is practically identical to the M8.  HTC One M9 HTC One M9 HTC have made a few tweaks to the chassis and build materials, however, and the most obvious is the new camera unit on the back, which is now square. However, there are a few very notable tweaks. Firstly HTC has re-contoured the back and edges to be more ergonomic, and secondly there's a scratch-resistant coating to the phone's shell. A third change is purely aesthetic; HTC has taken cues from luxury watchmakers by using a two-tone metal design, every handset has its edging picked out in a complimentary colour. HTC also added in microSD support this time around as well, opening the possibility of expanding the handsets storage. Importantly, this is something you can no longer do on the Galaxy S6.  The other BIGGY is the movement of the power/unlock key from the top of the device to the right hand side of the device. At first this seems like a great idea but for some reason HTC decided to place the volume rocker and power/unlock keys really close together AND make them from the same material and more or less the exact same size, which makes finding the unlock key rather tricky without looking first.  You can double-tap the display to wake the M9 mercifully, but in order to do this you must first have the handset in motion (in your hand, for instance) or else it will not work and you’re back to fumbling along its sharp, metallic side for the elusive power/unlock key. Beyond this I cannot fault the industrial engineering and design that has gone into making this handset. HTC talks about it like it’s a piece of jewellery and when you look at the gold trim, sharp, machine-edged accents and the huge price tag, I guess it sort of makes sense.   HTC has paid special attention to the One M9's audio. The front-facing BoomSound speakers with built-in amplifier have made a return together with some added enhancements in the form of Dolby Audio integration - this also extends to the 3.5mm audio jack for headphones and speakers; so you'll be getting high quality sound any way you slice it. HTC One M9 But this isn’t a piece of jewellery, nor is it a Porsche; it’s a phone and its job is to reach out to consumers, old and new, and make them want one. Taken at face value, I do think plenty of people will like the look of the HTC One M9; it is a very desirable looking piece of hardware, but so too was its predecessor the M8, and herein lies the elephant in the room. The hype around the HTC One M7 was justified in every regard; the handset was a game changer, both for HTC and the Android space at large. HTC got it right, bang on the money. The M8 was a refinement of the M7’s design, a more polished but somehow less eye-catching handset. And the M9 looks JUST like the M8, which is odd because anybody that’s being paying attention to HTC’s fortunes over the past couple of years knows it needs something BIG like the M7, not more incrementalism.  Looks are great and, I admit, the M9 has them in spades, but a lot has changed in the past 12 months and a simple rehash of last year’s model with a new CPU and camera and not much else comes across as slightly presumptuous. HTC is better than this. And even if it isn’t couldn’t it just have reduced the cost of the device to something more representative like £400-£450?   There is nothing worse than a technology company resting on its laurels. Samsung was dragged over the coals for years for this very reason and, only very recently, began to redeem itself with the excellent Galaxy Alpha, Galaxy Note 4 and Samsung Galaxy S6/Galaxy S6 EDGE. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the HTC One M9, nothing bad about it really. But it does look and feel very, well, last year when you pick it up and switch it on.  Not enough has been changed or developed.  HTC One M9 Review: Display  Nowhere is this more evident than with the M9’s 5in Super LCD3 1080p display. Full HD panels are fine; really they are. But the quality of the panel itself has to be up to scratch and the one inside the HTC One M9 does not feel like a progression from the LCD panel used in last year’s HTC One M8. And in a world of handsets rocking similar specs at lower costs with better, QHD panels this is not something that plays in the HTC One M9’s favour.  Being Full HD, though, the screen itself is more than adequate in terms of sharpness and resolution for everything you’re going to be doing with it –– videos, texting, web browsing, etc. It just doesn’t look quite as good doing it as the Nexus 6, Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus, LG G3 or Samsung Galaxy S6. Personally this isn’t a deal-breaker for me. This is still a 441ppi panel. Plus the M9 is a great looking, well proportioned handset which is a pretty big USP in and of itself these days. HTC One M9 I don’t have any huge reservations about the M9 not using a QHD panel, either. Quite the contrary in fact; this way HTC can produce a handset with a decent, Full HD quality panel without having to make it phablet simply to accommodate a battery large enough to power said QHD display. What I do have issue with is the small fact that A) the battery life does not appear to be any better than last year’s M8 model and B) the One M9 costs £100 more than the Nexus 6 and £80 more than the Galaxy Note 4 while the one thing you spend most time looking at –– the display –– just feels like a refit from last year’s model.  That doesn’t feel like “progress” to me, if I’m honest. Nor would it persuade me away from Samsung, LG or Apple in 2015. All of whom work ceaselessly on their display technology to ensure absolute parity with current top-of-the-line market standards. For me, the verdict here simple: if you’re asking me to pay the best part of £600 (tier one pricing in mobile) for something, I want the one thing I spend most time looking at to be exceptional, not just good –– this goes for phones just as much as it does for tablets, HDTVs and everything else in between.  HTC One M9 Review: Specs Here's a full breakdown of the HTC One M9's specs. For the purpose of those interested, we've also included specs for the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 EDGE in order to give you an idea of the differences between the two handsets.  Processor HTC One M9 Octacore (quad 2GHz and quad 1.5GHz), Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC Samsung Galaxy S6 Octacore (quad 2.1GHz and quad 1.5GHz), Samsung Exynos SoC Samsung Galaxy S6 EDGE Octacore (quad 2.1GHz and quad 1.5GHz), Samsung Exynos SoC RAM 3GB 3GB LPDDR4 3GB LPDDR4 Screen size 5in 5.1in 5.1in Screen resolution 1,080 x 1,920, 441ppi (Gorilla Glass 4) 1,440 x 2560, 576ppi (Gorilla Glass 4) 1,440 x 2560, 576ppi (Gorilla Glass 4) Screen type Super LCD3 (IPS) Super AMOLED Super AMOLED Front camera 4MP 5MP 5MP Rear camera 20.7MP (f/2.2) 16MP (f/1.9, phase detect autofocus, OIS) 16MP (f/1.9, phase detect autofocus, OIS) Flash Dual LED Dual LED Dual LED GPS Yes Yes Yes Compass Yes Yes Yes Storage 32GB 64/128GB (UFS 2 flash) 32/64/128GB (UFS 2 flash) Memory card slot (supplied) MicroSD No No Wi-Fi 802.11ac 802.11ac (2x2 MIMO) 802.11ac (2x2 MIMO) Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.1, A2DP, apt-X Bluetooth 4.1 LE, A2DP, apt-X, ANT+ Bluetooth 4.1 LE, A2DP, apt-X, ANT+ NFC Yes Yes Yes Wireless data 4G 4G, Cat6 (300Mbits/sec download, 50Mbits/sec upload) 4G, Cat6 (300Mbits/sec download, 50Mbits/sec upload) Size (WDH) 70 x 9.6 x 145mm 71 x 6.8 x 143mm 70 x 7 x 142mm Weight 157g 138g 132g Operating system Android 5 Lollipop with Sense 7 Android 5 Lollipop Battery size 2,840mAh 2,550mAh 2,600mAh HTC One M9 Review: Camera  A lot has been said about HTC’s cameras over the years –– most of it bad. But this year saw the company swallow its pride, admit UltraPixels were just marketing-speak for rubbish camera, and re-introduce proper imaging with proper megapixels inside its 2015 flagship.  The HTC One M9 runs a 20.7MP camera backed up by one of the best camera applications in the business. There’s a ton of features as well as old favourites like Zoe opening up thousands of potential editing options. Images are easily shared and, as we’ve come to expect from HTC, the layout, menus and options with the camera application itself are very straightforward and require essentially no time to master.  So what about image quality? Unfortunately it ain’t great –– and there’s no Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). But it is A LOT better than last year’s model and, when you get it in the right setting, outside with plenty of light, for instance, you can capture some really decent shots. Low-light performance isn’t great; though, again, it is better than last year’s model, which seems to be the only benchmark HTC had in mind when it created this phone.  A lot of the camera’s issues –– colour inconsistency, lack of detail, low-light performance and general inconsistency –– can, I believe, be remedied by software. The only thing that makes me question this is that before I began testing the M9 it was recalled for a software update to fix…. you guessed it, the camera. Still, once the company has more data to work with it will be in a better position to understand what exactly is causing the inconsistent performance of the imaging tech inside the M9.  The camera does show true promise in the right environment and, lack of OIS aside, I do think HTC could make some pretty big improvements to the overall performance of the camera with a few, select software tweaks. Everything is there, it just doesn’t appear to be functioning at 100% efficiency. I don’t want to be too critical of this aspect, however, as we’ve seen handsets released with squiffy cameras in the past only to be remedied by a software patch a few weeks later - this even happened to Sony.  HTC Software Patch Update Incoming To Fix Camera As you've no doubt just read above, the HTC One M9's camera leaves a little to be desired, but we've attributed that to a software-side problem that could be fixed with an update. It seems we were correct in that assessment as HTC has now confirmed it will be issuing a software update to combat the squiffy camera performance. Following complaints from user on Twitter, HTC USA president Jason Mackenzie posted a response on the social network. "Camera to see improvement w/ sw update coming tomorrow or 17th (next Fri) depending on carrier version," he said, in a Tweet on April 9. This of course means that initially the software update may only be rolling out in the US between today (April 10) and April 17, with it arriving sooner or later depending on which network you're with. However, nothing has been said yet about a rollout outside the US. One is sure to be coming, but there's a question mark hanging over precisely when - we would suspect in the next couple of weeks. This update has now landed on a few handsets and the results, according to Phandroid, are pretty damn impressive. Every single image snapped by the HTC One M9 with the new software installed is sharper, more detailed and tighter in every regard. The update has yet to hit our HTC One M9, but we will update this review with new images as soon as it does.  “Regardless of these minor inconsistencies, I think it’s fairly obvious to tell that this M9 camera update boasts huge improvements,” Phandroid writes. “I wouldn’t say that this catapults the M9’s camera from terrible to outrageously awesome, but those who decided against the M9 primarily due to the camera should consider giving it a second look.” HTC Adds Support For RAW Files HTC has now released another software update for the One M9 to improve camera capabilities. This time the updated camera app adds in support for RAW image files. Essentially this is a boon for more fastidious shutterbugs who can really fine tune shots in this format.

A tech industry body established to agree best practice in the use of artificial intelligence had one notable omission in the impressive list of member companies. IBM, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon all signed up, but Apple didn’t. The Partnership on AI was formed in September, with part of its brief to make recommendations in the areas of ethics, fairness, inclusivity, privacy and trustworthiness – all values you might expect Apple to fully endorse. But while the company didn’t sign up at the time, it appears this is about to change … Bloomberg reports that Apple has now agreed to join the non-profit. Apple’s admission into the group could be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives at Apple and the Partnership on AI declined to comment. It’s likely that Apple’s reluctance to join was prompted by secrecy concerns. In addition to its ethics focus, the group has an emphasis on collaboration between researchers working for different companies. To provide a regular, structured platform for AI researchers and key stakeholders to communicate directly and openly with each other about relevant issues. Over the course of the last couple of months, however, Apple seems to be adopting a somewhat more open approach, for the first time allowing its AI researchers to publish papers in peer-reviewed journals. It’s likely this change of heart was driven by the recognition that the best researchers in the field would not want to join a company that isolated them from the wider scientific community. Partnership on AI’s brief also includes helping to ‘advance public understanding and awareness of AI and its potential benefits and potential costs’ – a role likely to prove particularly important at a time as machines start to take on more of the roles currently performed by people and AI becomes a more controversial topic.

Licensed under CC BY 2.0. On Friday, January 20th, Cupertino, CA-based consumer tech firm Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed a lawsuit against San Diego, CA-based semiconductor giant Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) The lawsuit seeks $1 billion in damages which Apple alleges that Qualcomm is withholding from the iPhone developer in violation of an agreement between the two companies, including injunctive and other relief. The suit, which includes breach of contract claims, patent claims and antitrust claims, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (S.D. Cal.). As the official complaint filed by Apple notes, Qualcomm has been under fire recently in multiple countries for predatory business practices involving its licensing activities for tech invented by Qualcomm for the development of cellular phone and data network standards. In late December, Qualcomm was fined $853 million by the South Korean Fair Trade Commission (KTFC) for improper negotiations of patent licenses. In February 2015, Qualcomm announced that it had agreed to a $975 million fine to settle antitrust claims levied by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) involving the company’s patent licensing activities. Apple’s lawsuit also follows closely on the heels of a complaint for equitable relief in a U.S. court filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Filed on Tuesday, January 17th, the official complaint seeks a permanent injunction against Qualcomm, targeting the company’s “unlawful maintenance of a monopoly” over baseband processors and cell phone semiconductor devices. Although Qualcomm has publicly committed to licensing its standard-essential patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) practices as part of its participation in cellular wireless standards, the FTC alleged that Qualcomm engages in exclusionary tactics, like withholding processor products unless the customer accepts a license with elevated royalties. “By using its monopoly power to obtain elevated royalties that apply to baseband processors supplied by its competitors, Qualcomm in effect collects a ‘tax’ on cell phone manufacturers when they use non-Qualcomm processors,” the FTC’s complaint alleges. The FTC’s suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (N.D. Cal.). Between 2006 and 2015, Qualcomm has been the world’s largest supplier of baseband processors complying with code division multiple access (CDMA) standards for wireless communication, although the market share held by Qualcomm during that time is redacted from the FTC’s complaint. Qualcomm’s global share of the long-term evolution (LTE) baseband processor market was also dominant between 2012 and 2015. Although Qualcomm held a high share of standard-essential patents (SEPs) related to second generation CDMA (2G-CDMA), it held a smaller share of SEPs related to third generation CDMA (3G-CDMA) and LTE wireless standards. Despite this smaller share, Qualcomm has pursued licenses for SEPs to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) which the FTC alleges include base royalty rates which are significantly higher than other licensors of cellular SEPs. FTC also alleges that Qualcomm denies OEMs the opportunity to challenge the terms of Qualcomm’s SEP licenses in court through the company’s “no license-no chips” policy which requires OEMs to pay substantial royalties on handsets using baseband processors manufactured by Qualcomm’s competitors. The FTC argues that this “no license-no chips” policy is anomalous among both component suppliers as well as SEP licensors. The FTC’s lawsuit also identifies issues in Qualcomm’s licensing activities specific to Apple, which is not a direct licensee with the company but employs contract manufacturers who do license SEPs with Qualcomm, which passes on the cost of higher royalties to Apple. The FTC cites Apple as one example of an OEM which finds Qualcomm’s SEP licensing activities to be inconsistent with the company’s FRAND obligations for such SEPs. The FTC identified three licensing agreements negotiated by Apple with Qualcomm to reduce the royalty burden, two of which resulted in Qualcomm providing royalty relief to Apple in the form of lump sum payments in return for the exclusive use of Qualcomm processors in new iPhone and iPad models. These licensing agreements are also discussed in Apple’s suit against Qualcomm as proof of price gouging in violation of Qualcomm’s FRAND obligations. Despite Apple’s attempts to negotiate a worldwide FRAND license for a lower royalty rate, Qualcomm has only agreed to the settlement model involving Qualcomm cash payments in exchange for increasing exclusivity in Apple products. “Qualcomm used its anticompetitive leverage to gain even greater anticompetitive leverage and used unreasonable terms to gain even more unreasonable terms,” Apple’s complaint states. Apple alleges that the Qualcomm payments amount to rebates, but Qualcomm will not use the term “rebate” to describe the payments as such a practice doesn’t comply with FRAND obligations. Apple lists a series of nine patents-in-suit in its complaint. These patents are held by Qualcomm and Apple is seeking an S.D. Cal. judge to rule that these patents are not essential to third generation universal mobile telecommunications service (3G/UMTS) and fourth generation LTE (4G/LTE) standards practiced by Apple products, or if they are essential, how to set a FRAND royalty for such SEPs. These patents include: U.S. Patent No. 7246242, titled Integrity Protection Method for Radio Network Signaling. It claims a method for checking integrity of messages transmitted during a connection between two parties in such a way that doesn’t require a large network database to maintain the state information of each party. U.S. Patent No. 6556549, titled Method and Apparatus for Signal Combining in a High Data Rate Communication System. It claims a communication system in which base stations transmit a reverse link busy indicating whether its reverse link capacity has been exhausted, improving wireless communications in a CDMA system. U.S. Patent No. 9137822, titled Efficient Signaling Over Access Channel. It discloses a method of determining an indicator of channel quality in a wireless communication system to more efficiently send acknowledgement messages to access terminals within a given cell. U.S. Patent No. 7289630, which is titled Counter Initialization, Particularly for Radio Frames. It protects a method for protecting traffic in a radio access network supporting multiple radio bearers to and from a mobile station in such a way that improves data security. Apple’s lawsuit lists 25 counts including breach of contract, violations of California state law, monopolization and declarations of noninfringement and FRAND royalties for each of the patents-in-suit. Apple is seeking a jury trial and judgements declaring Qualcomm liable for breach of contract and in breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Apple also wants the court to force $1 billion in payments withheld by Qualcomm, which are due to Apple under terms of the business cooperation and patent agreement between the two companies; Apple alleged that these payments were stopped without warning in September 2016. Qualcomm released an official statement on the case the same day that Apple’s lawsuit was filed: “While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple’s claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” – Don Rosenberg, executive VP and general counsel at Qualcomm The Author Steve Brachmann is a writer located in Buffalo, New York.

Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY LATEST NEWS STORIES MORE CHOICES MUSIC | MUSIC PEOPLE | MUSIC BUSINESS Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY Artist News Business News Legal Apple sued over sample in synced Jamie XX track By Chris Cooke | Published on Thursday 26 January 2017 So, here’s a complicated bit of litigation. If I’m being honest, writing this story gave me a headache. It’ll be interesting to know what effect reading it has. OK, so Jerome Lawson, previously frontman of American a cappella group The Persuasions, has sued Apple over its use of Jamie XX’s ‘I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)’ in a TV ad for the iPhone 6. The Jamie XX track samples the Persuasions record ‘Good Times’. On its release in 2015, there was some chatter to the effect that the band was saying the sample had been used without permission, but it then transpired that it had in fact been cleared by Universal Music. Billboard reported at the time that Jimmy Hayes, a former bandmate of Lawson who is still in the group, admitted that “I was told about it but forgot”. Lawson isn’t suing Apple on copyright grounds though, very possibly because he doesn’t own the copyright in the track. Rather he is citing his publicity rights under Californian law, the argument being that the ‘Good Times’ samples that appeared in the ad were recognisable as his voice, which implies he was endorsing the iPhone. Whether or not a sync implies endorsement of a product by an artist is a not uncommon debate in the music community, though that chatter doesn’t usually centre on legalities. Californian law does recognise a publicity right in an individual’s voice, though arguably legal precedent in the state says that when that voice is contained within a recording protected by copyright, the copyright owner does not infringe a performer’s publicity right by licensing out the work. Though past cases of this type have seemingly centred on post-1972 recordings, and let’s not forget US-wide federal copyright law does not apply to tracks released before that date. You know, like 1971 Persuasions record ‘Good Times’. So the question is: would that principle also apply to recordings protected by state-level rather than federal copyright law? As a very esteemed and acclaimed lawyer once said to me, “fuck knows”. Says Lawson’s lawsuit, filed in the LA courts this week and spotted by The Hollywood Reporter: “Lawson’s voice is prominent and recognisable in the Apple commercial. Lawson is informed and believes and on the basis alleged that plaintiff’s voice was recognised by fans of his who saw the commercial and those fans were deceived into falsely believing that Lawson endorsed Apple and the iPhone and/or that Lawson consented to the use of his voice to advertise Apple’s products”. If you’re not convinced by that, Lawson’s litigation then throws in something else, that the Apple ad is also a “deliberate violation of the collective bargaining agreements with SAG and AFTRA” (that’s the Screen Actors Guild and American Federation Of Television And Radio Artists) that requires separate bargaining with singers for use in commercials. The litigation claims Apple’s ad agency Media Arts Lab offered Lawson the minimum fee provided by that SAG/AFTRA agreement once the iPhone ads was airing. This doesn’t feel like a dispute that’s actually going to get to court, but if it did, it could result in some complicated discussions around the status and rules of sampling and sync, the clash of publicity rights and copyright, and of state and federal law. I’ll stock up on Nurofen just in case.

Business & Technology Business Insider Gizmodo Kotaku Lifehacker Lifestyle & Shopping POPSUGAR Celebrity POPSUGAR Fashion POPSUGAR Beauty POPSUGAR Health & Fitness ShopStyle Toggle navigation Join Log In Tech Insider Money & Markets Briefing Ideas Executive Life Video Tech Insider Apple is tipped to join an AI ethics group that includes Google, Facebook, and Amazon Sam Shead Jan 26, 2017, 9:56 PM facebook twitter reddit linkedin Email There was one big name missing from the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (AI) member list when the research consortium was announced last September. Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft all pledged to work together to ensure AI is developed safely and ethically but Apple refused to get involved. Now it looks like the world’s largest company and a tech giant renowned for keeping its research efforts a secret may have reconsidered its decision. Citing sources with knowledge of the situation, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Apple is set to join the elite club, going on to say that its admission could be announced as early as this week. Apple has been gradually building up its AI and machine learning capabilities and buying a succession of small AI startups. Last October, it hired Ruslan Salakhutdinov, one of the big guns of AI research. Unlike Google, DeepMind, and Facebook, Apple has traditionally prevented its top researchers from publishing their work in open forums. Last November, Yann LeCun, Facebook’s head of AI, said this could make some engineers think twice about working for the iPhone maker. “So, [when] you’re a researcher, you assume that you’re going to publish your work,” said LeCun. “It’s very important for a scientist because the currency of the career as a scientist is the intellectual impact. So you can’t tell people ‘come work for us but you can’t tell people what you’re doing’ because you basically ruin their career. That’s a big element.” AI has been tipped to improve many aspects of life, ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing to home automation and transportation. But it’s also been described by the likes of renowned scientist Stephen Hawking and tech billionaire Elon Musk as something that could wipe out humans altogether. Partnership on AI, a non-profit organisation, has pledged to work to advance public understanding of AI and formulate best practices on the challenges and opportunities within the field. Apple did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « While Qualcomm is Guilty of Gouging Asian Smartphone OEMs, the Chip Maker Believes that Apple is the Problem | Main | Apple's Third Major Folding iPhone Invention has come to Light Illustrating a Dual Fold-Out/Fold-In Form Factor » January 26, 2017 Apple Invents a Multi-Scan X-Ray Robotic System for Inspecting Internal Components of an iDevice   Today the US Patent & Trademark Office published a patent application from Apple that reveals their X-ray scanning system that allows engineers to inspect the internals of an iDevice for defects or problems before heading to production. It's just one of Apple's quality control systems.   Apple's invention relates to a fixture designed to receive an electronic device (or devices) in order to perform a computerized (or computed) tomography ("CT") scan of the electronic device. CT scanning may include a radiation source that emits radiation, such as X-ray radiation, some of which penetrates through the electronic devices as well as the fixture. The radiation passing through the fixture and the electronic device may be received at a detection mechanism to create a two-dimensional image of the electronic device. Further, while receiving the radiation, the fixture and the electronic device may be rotated 360 degrees around a longitudinal axis extending defining a center of rotation (or axis of rotation) of the fixture to produce multiple two-dimensional images. Each two-dimensional image may be an image of the electronic device orientated at an angle, including a fraction of an angle, with respect to the radiation source. These two-dimensional images may combine to define a three-dimensional image of the electronic device.   Apple's patent FIG. 6 noted below illustrates an isometric view of a system used to perform CT scanning operation.     The resultant three-dimensional image of the CT scan can be used to analyze the electronic device. For example, the image can determine whether an internal component of the electronic, such as a button or a camera module, is properly assembled in accordance with a design specification of the electronic device. Further, the image may determine whether the internal component was damaged during assembly.   The fixture may be made from one or more materials that allow the radiation to readily pass through the fixture. For example, the fixture may be formed from a polymeric material such as plastic. In this regard, the fixture may be formed using a three-dimensional printing apparatus ("3D printer") allowing the fixture to include a variety of customizable sizes and shapes to carry a variety of electronic devices.   A "three-dimension printer" refers to a printing apparatus that emits a polymeric material in order to form a three-dimensional structure. However, the fixture may be formed by other methods. For example, the fixture may include a polymeric material injected molded into a mold cavity that defines the size and shape of the fixture. Further, the fixture may be formed from a block of polymeric material that undergoes a material removal process.   Apple's patent FIG. 1 illustrates an isometric view of an embodiment of a fixture suitable for use with a CT scan; FIG. 4 illustrates a front view of the fixture having a first electronic device and a second electronic device secured with the fixture; FIG. 5 illustrates a side view of a fixture showing an electronic device positioned at an angle with respect to a support column.   Apple's patent FIG. 14 noted below illustrates an isometric view of an alternate embodiment of a fixture having several discrete adhesive features disposed throughout a support column of the fixture.     Apple's patent application was filed back in Q3 2015.   Patently Apple presents a detailed summary of patent applications with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each such patent application is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Qualcomm defends its licensing and bottom line Posted on January 26, 2017 by Nick Farrell - Business, Chips, News Chipmaker Qualcomm has reported a lower than expected 3.9 percent rise in quarterly revenue and defended its licensing model. The US Federal Trade Commission and Apple have sued Qualcomm accusing it of resorting to “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain a monopoly over chips used in smartphone. The Apple tactic appears to be designed to force Qualcomm to reduce its already discounted pricing by jumping on the bandwagon of anti-trust actions in the US and Korea. The fruity cargo cult also filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in Beijing, alleging that the chip supplier abused its clout and is seeking $145.32 million in damages. Qualcomm executives firmly defended the company’s licensing model on its quarterly conference call, and said its revenue forecast did not include any impact from the dispute with Apple. Qualcomm president Derek Aberle said that Apple’s attack on Qualcomm’s business model is not only an attack on Qualcomm, but also an attack on the smartphone competition that Qualcomm’s business model enables. Qualcomm said it expects to continue to supply to Apple during the dispute, and that the company’s contracts with the iPhone maker’s suppliers were still valid. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.20 per share and revenue of $5.90 billion so they are slightly disappointed. Revenue rose to $6 billion from $5.78 billion, but missed analysts’ estimate of $6.12 billion. Qualcomm’s shares have risen nearly 20 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 62.1 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia Semiconductor index.

Apple is seeking $1 billion yuan ($145.32 million USD) in damages. In a second lawsuit, Apple focuses on patent agreements and alleged the chip supplier failed to live up to promises made to license "standard essential patents" broadly and inexpensively, Beijing's Intellectual Property Court said, according to Reuters . Qualcomm is a major supplier for Apple and its rival Samsung for modem chips that links devices to wireless networks. Apple and Samsung made up 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. Apple used Qualcomm's chips until its latest iPhone 7 generation in last September, when its exclusivity agreement signed from 2011 until 2016 expired. Qualcomm said in a statement that it had not yet seen the complaints made by Apple. "These filings by Apple’s Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple’s efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology,” said Qualcomm Executive Vice President Don Rosenberg. “Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.” The chip supplier added it “is prepared to defend its business model anywhere in the world.”   Wednesday’s lawsuits followed Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm last Friday, days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm over patent royalty practices and for allegedly engaging in anticompetitive tactics to ensure its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. Apple also accused the company of overcharging for its chips. Qualcomm is also being investigated in Europe, Japan and Taiwan for anticompetitive and monopolistic trade practices.

By Luke Johnson / Published 26th January 2017 JAPAN DISPLAY/GETTY/APPLE FLEXI PHONE: New reports suggest future iPhones could feature flexible screens Apple is planning major changes for future iPhones, with latest reports suggesting the company is working on flexible devices. The reports surfaced after screen manufacturer Japan Display - one of Apple's main supply partners - unveiled new bendable smartphone screens. Dubbed the Full Active Flex, the flexible screens will stop handsets from shattering when dropped, meaning your next iPhone could be unbreakable. Apple iPhone 8 - Leaked photographs, concept images and renders Friday, 6th January 2017 iPhone 8 is shaping up to be one of the most impressive Apple smartphones to date, with glass panels on the front and rear of the device, a curved borderless OLED display and no Home Button 1 / 10 VENIAMIN GESKIN • TWITTER • CONCEPT IMAGES Apple iPhone 8 will debut a brand-new all-glass look, with a curved OLED display and no physical Home Button Flexible smartphone screens have been a coveted and much talked about feature in recent years. Although both Samsung and LG have already launched flexible handsets, the degree of flex has been minor. According to new reports, however, Apple's first flexible phone could feature a far more manipulatable display, allowing users to bend and flex their phones at will. JAPAN DISPLAY More than just a gimmicky party piece, the flexible screen has a number of practical benefits, most notably making phones more robust. By substituting out traditional glass backing to LCD displays, the new panels use plastic either side of the liquid crystal layer. According to Japan Display, this will "prevent cracking from occurring when the display is dropped." Despite adding new flexible smarts, these new panels won't cut corners when it comes to image quality. The panels shown off are 5.5-inches in size and feature a 1080p Full HD resolution. That's the same size and resolution as the current iPhone 7 Plus screen, a display that's one of the nicest on any current smartphone. iPhone at 10 - take a look at every smartphone Apple has created Sunday, 8th January 2017 APPLE'S iconic iPhone turns 10 today and here's every device the US tech giant has made. 1 / 11 If you're hoping to see this flexible form handed to the iPhone 8, sorry but your dreams are set to be dashed. Instead, the panels won't begin production until 2018, meaning an iPhone 9 debut it more likely. Although Japan Display has confirmed it already has launch partners lined up for its flexible display technology, it failed to confirmed whether or not Apple will be one of these. GETTY/APPLE Despite the iPhone 8 not being lined up for a flexible makeover, that doesn't mean it won't feature an impressive new design. Recent reports have suggested the phone could adopt a curved display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge as part of a major redesign. This new finish will reportedly play host to a faster processor, improved cameras and new iOS 11 software when the phone launches in September.

By: Reuters | Updated: January 26, 2017 4:08 pm Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. (Image for representation, Source: AP) Qualcomm Inc reported a lower-than-expected 3.9 percent rise in quarterly revenue, at a time when the chipmaker is facing multiple legal challenges over its alleged “anticompetitive” tactics. The company’s shares were down nearly 3 percent at $55.20 in aftermarket trading on Wednesday. Qualcomm also forecast current-quarter adjusted profit of $1.15-$1.25 per share and revenue of $5.5 billion-$6.3 billion. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.20 per share and revenue of $5.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. The US Federal Trade Commission and Apple Inc have sued Qualcomm accusing the chipmaker of resorting to “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. Read More: Apple’s legal fight with Qualcomm spreads to China Apple also filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in Beijing on Wednesday, alleging that the chip supplier abused its clout in the chip industry and is seeking 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. South Korea’s antitrust regulator, The Korea Fair Trade Commission, fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won in December for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales. The company said on Wednesday the latest quarter included an $868 million charge related to the KFTC investigation. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, with the two accounting for 40 percent of the company’s $23.5 billion in revenue in 2016. The Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) business, which contributed about 85 percent of the company’s earnings before taxes in 2016, generates royalties earned through the licensing of wireless patents to the mobile industry.

Revenue rose to $6 billion from $5.78 billion, but missed analysts’ estimate of $6.12 billion. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned $1.19 per share, just above the average analyst estimate of $1.18. Qualcomm’s shares had risen nearly 20 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 62.1 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia Semiconductor index.

Keeping this smile plastered on was using up all my processing power... 26 Jan 2017 at 10:00, Wireless Watch Analysis Huawei’s upcoming launch of a smartphone incorporating Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant will mark a new phase in one of the most important battles for the modern internet experience. Voice-activated assistants - which use powerful AI engines to deliver detailed, context-aware and personalized answers to users’ questions – are the way in which web giants hope to place themselves at the heart of a user’s whole range of activities, whether they are in their smart home, connected car, at work or on the phone. Apple Siri kicked off the race, though the company seems to have lost its early momentum in voice interfaces – rapidly taking over from touch/text for many uses. Google Now and Microsoft Cortana added new levels of AI to the digital assistant category, but then Amazon launched its Fire Phone, whose defining technology was the retailer’s own AI-driven assistant, Alexa. However, the Fire Phone flopped, and it seemed Alexa might have died with it, until the technology reappeared in Amazon’s Echo home hub, which has unexpectedly seized the initiative back from its rivals, leaving Apple and Google to announce hasty moves into the home hub market last year. Alexa might have given Amazon a boost in controlling the user’s home experience, from content and music choices to housekeeping, but the company was still woefully behind in the mobile space, which is vital if consumers are to interact with cloud and web services in a uniform way, wherever they go. So pushing Alexa into smartphones – third party ones, not Amazon’s own this time – is vital, as is an in-car system. In the car, its initial partner is Ford, which will integrate Alexa into its vehicles from this summer, allowing drivers to start their cars using their Amazon Echo, play Kindle audio books and order items on Amazon while travelling – as well as more generic search and navigation functions. Ford is working on adding Alexa home-to-car integration for vehicles with Sync Connect in the future. Steve Rabuchin, vice president for Amazon Alexa said: “We believe voice is the future, and this is particularly true in cars.” Rubin set to return to smartphone field with AI startup There may soon be a new and disruptive force in the emerging market for mobile devices which are heavily driven by AI, and which address every aspect of life, from home to mobile to work. Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, is reportedly about to announce a new consumer hardware and software startup called Essential, which will include former Apple and Google engineers in its 40-strong team. Two years after leaving Google, Rubin is said to be working on a platform which will tie multiple mobile and smart home devices into an AI engine. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry. "New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years," he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June. "What’s the next platform? It’s about data and people training AI systems to learn." But rather than looking ahead to new, as-yet ill-defined categories of devices, as Amazon’s labs are doing; or working on a ‘post-device world’ in which everything accesses the inter-net, as Google has discussed; Rubin is planning a good old traditional smartphone to be the centrepiece of Essential. Insiders say Rubin discussed the large-screened, bezel-free smartphone, and a suite of other consumer products, with operator executives at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He registered the company Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, registered ‘Essential’ with the US Patent and Trademark Office, listing smartphones, tablets, accessories and "computer operating soft-ware for mobile phones" among its goods and services. According to Bloomberg sources, Essential's engineers are developing a proprietary magnetic connector that doubles as a charging mechanism, and will expand the phone's functionality over time, allowing Essential or partners to create hardware accessories. One that is in the works is a sphere-shaped camera add-on that shoots high-resolution 360-degree photographs, the source said. Among Rubin’s colleagues in Essential are Rebecca Zavin, a former senior Google software manager, who is heading up software; while Jason Keats and Joe Tate are in charge of hardware engineering. Kelly Liang, a former executive with the Google X lab, is managing business development and Brian Wallace, a former Samsung and Magic Leap executive, is leading marketing. Mobile has greater challenges for Amazon than home or car The mobile market is more challenging because the incumbents are so strong. But if Amazon can get big handset makers behind Alexa, it will not matter that its own smartphone did not succeed. After all, while it did turn the ereader into a mainstream category with the Kindle, and upend assumptions about tablet pricing with Kindle Fire, the majority of spending on Kindle content happens via the app running on non-Amazon devices. Its goal is to drive ever-greater content consumption, shopping and other spending through its friendly and addictive interfaces and stores. That means tying as many customer activities as possible into those interfaces, with the Prime subscription system being its chief weapon. Huawei is certainly a smartphone big-hitter these days, so Amazon has scored a coup by persuading the Chinese firm to début Alexa on the Mate 9 next month (initially for US markets only – Amazon’s habitual slowness in bringing new services outside its home country remains a point of weakness in comparison with Google and others). But with Google Now available on most Android devices (including Mate 9), and Siri still considered a differentiator for the iPhone, Alexa will have to offer considerable ad-vantages if it is to draw users away from the more established assistants, or lure assistant virgins, and so repeat its success in the home. This will be a tough challenge – Amazon’s apps and stores are heavily used on mobile devices, but it is not part of the mobile establishment as Apple and Google are. The smart home is a far less developed market, where competitive lines are still fluid, and Prime and Amazon TV make the retail giant a fixture in many households. Alexa will build out from base of home apps To increase its chances on the handset, Amazon is taking a big leaf out of Google’s and Apple’s smartphone books, promising an app store stuffed with services, many of them free, which can be controlled via Alexa’s voice interface. Anyone with Alexa-based hardware – the Echo, Echo Dot or Tap, the upcoming Mate 9, or compliant smart household appliances or lights – can choose from the 7,000 apps and services which can be triggered by a voice command. Partners include ecobee, Nest, Honeywell, Philips Hue, SmartThings, Insteon, Wink, Wemo, Caseta, LIFX, Haiku, TP-Link, Schlage, Leviton – the list goes on, and it is a very expansive list for consumers to exploit. Late last year, Amazon announced that it was integrating Alexa and Echo with both Control4 and LG’s SmartThinQ platforms. This will have to counteract some of the limitations of the Huawei deal. While Google Now and Voice Search will be built into the Mate 9, users will still have to download an app to use Alexa, creating a barrier to adoption, especially for users who do not have Alexa and Echo at home. Nor will the Mate 9 have the enhanced listening technology which makes the Echo highly sensitive to its owner’s voice. However, for those with Alexa in the living room, it will be attractive to be able to use the same technology on mobile devices too, and of course to control the home appliances remotely via the handset. As with Kindle, Amazon’s own hardware will provide an optimised user experience for its services, and probably drive higher levels of usage; but the app version will allow people to use Alexa without having to buy new devices. Remote control of the smart home is Amazon’s big boast for mobile Alexa. As befits a company which failed in smartphones but has been a big hit in living rooms, it is centring its digital assistant assault on the home, looking to build out the end-to-end experience from there. Most of its advantages over its rivals concern home systems. Far more devices, such as Philips Hue lighting, work with Alexa than with Google or Siri and this is driving the kind of apps ecosystem which Google and Apple drove in their early smartphone days. Amazon was smart to open up Alexa to third party developers at an early stage and will now be aiming to become the ‘Google Play’ of smart home apps, and more importantly, of the web services of the future, voice-activated and AI-enabled. Alexa as the open consumer AI platform Essentially, Alexa is being positioned as the more open AI platform. Apple retains an iron grip over Siri, which is only available on its own hardware, with integrations through iOS APIs. Microsoft’s Cortana is in a pretty similar position, but tied to the Windows 10 OS rather than specific products. Android’s Google Now would appear to provide an open alter-native, but developers are then tied to the Android platform and the associated Google licensing terms that come with it. The core components of Android are open source (AOSP), but the Google Mobile Services apps that form the core value offering in the smartphone arena come with a bundled licence, which means the developer can only include one Google app if the rest are also supported as standard on the device. That gives Amazon an opportunity to push Alexa as an AI platform for Android without the Google bloatware. It has expanded its Alexa Voice Services (AVS) developer tools, which were launched towards the end of 2015. The update means that developers have access to a number of new features, which include the ability to use Alexa to adjust play-back volume, media controls, and set alarms. The core function of AVS is to allow those third parties to build hardware that houses the Alexa interface – allowing the device to act as the gateway to Amazon’s cloud and monetization strategy. Amazon also announced the $100m Alexa Fund available to businesses looking to incorporate Alexa into their designs. Early investments have included Petnet (automatic feeder for pets, voice queries), Musaic (smart HiFi system for whole-home audio, aiming for voice control), and Mojio (connected car adapter for smartphone telematics). As a result of this open approach, there are far more remote control capabilities in Alexa than the rival systems offer, especially for users which do not also have Google Home or Apple TV. For instance, Siri can only control HomeKit devices remotely if the user also has Apple TV, and Android handsets can only control the Google-owned Nest thermostats.) The Alexa handset also allows users to use their voice for several functions which are not generally available on Android and iOS – for instance, to call an Uber or Lyft ride to their specific location; to stream songs from Spotify or Pandora, which is only possible with Android on Google’s Pixel and if the user also has Google Home; to vocally launch IFTTT scenarios; to order from Amazon stores; and to launch new skills, such as Twitter, with a voice command and without opening an app first. Alexa will also read Audible audiobooks, news headlines or weather reports on request. Amazon entered the market "completely sideways" by bringing Alexa to a whole range of connected products, says Tuong Nguyen, principal research analyst at Gartner. Instead of making the smartphone into a mobile hub to manage all tasks, Amazon takes “universal behaviour” and enables it in different products, according to Nguyen, using natural conversational interaction. Gaps in Amazon’s armoury There are missing elements though -there is no GPS, so Alexa has to be told the user’s lo-cation rather than knowing it; and it cannot set a timer or alarm, though Huawei says this will come in future. Licensing issues also prevent the system being used to play Amazon Prime Music or TuneIn Radio (these issues are also being worked on). And once the user wants to control all their devices and home applications wherever they are, the smartphone remains the most natural way to do that, and Amazon’s disadvantage in handsets starts to glare again. Amazon’s strengths lie in the way it has surged ahead in the voice-activated smart home and in an open AI apps platform, but its weaknesses lie in the fact that it remains a laggard in the smartphone world. The fact that Alexa is not tied into phone services is the most serious example. That means that, unlike Siri and Now, it does not know where it is, with no GPS integration, and it is not always-on. Jan Dawson, founder of Jackdaw Research, told NetworkWorld: "The challenge for Amazon in circumventing the operating systems is that it's basically impossible to supplant Siri as the default assistant on iOS, and it will be hard to gain much traction on Android devices too. So although Alexa can be an assistant on smartphones, it's unlikely to be the assistant on the vast majority of those devices. And an assistant is only really useful over the long term if you can use it everywhere.” These issues need to be addressed, and of course more smartphones signed up, preferably with Alexa inbuilt – a Samsung flagship would be a good boost, though an iPhone Alexa app is likely to prove a step too far. And Amazon certainly needs to accelerate the extension of Alexa to other markets besides the US, as developer ecosystems go increasingly global.

ByCharlie Osborne for Between the Lines | January 26, 2017 -- 09:58 GMT (01:58 PST) | Topic: Apple Wikimedia Commons Apple has announced a joint venture with NV Energy to build a 200-megawattt solar plant in Nevada, furthering the firm's goals to utilize only renewable energy sources in the future. The companies revealed the venture on Wednesday, which aims to provide enough power to cater for Apple's energy needs in its Reno Technology Park data center. In the coming weeks, NV energy will file an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) to build the new solar farm, which will bring NV Energy's solar power plans and resources in the region -- either in construction stages or under review for approval -- to over 529MW. As part of the deal, Apple will dedicate up to 5MW of solar power to NV Energy's solar subscription program which provies energy resources to other businesses and consumers. The solar farm is expected to begin operations in 2019. Several years ago, the technology giant pledged to abandon fossil fuels and only use renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, in not only data centers but through the manufacturing process. Apple claims to have already reached this goal for data centers in the US, China, and 21 other countries -- while this may be a little more complicated than Apple lets on -- and says that in 2015, 93 percent of all Apple operations were powered with renewables. Last year, the company completed construction of a 50MW solar farm in Arizona, joining other schemes in China and a wide array of solar plants across the United States in counties including California and North Carolina. "We are proud to play a role in helping Apple meet their energy needs with Nevada's abundant solar resource," said Paul Caudill, president and CEO of NV Energy. "In partnership with our customers, we continue to develop a more balanced fuel mix in a way that benefits the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs for Nevadans, particularly those in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 357 and 396, and advances the state's policy goals." In 2016, Apple joined RE100, a consortium of companies that have pledged to shift their operations to operate on only renewable energy sources in the future. Last week, Apple filed a suit against US chip maker Qualcomm, accusing the firm of withholding almost $1 billion in contractual payments it allegedly owes to the iPad and iPhone maker. Qualcomm has also been accused of "attempting to extort" Apple into obstructing an investigation into Qualcomm's business practices. Apple claims Qualcomm's payments have been withheld to punish the company for working with South Korean regulatory investigators.

Wide selection of features. Flexible advanced options. Works with Netflix (for now)! Cons Limited, overly simple app. No automatic server selector. Confusing server information. Bottom Line The TorGuard VPN service is among the most comprehensive available, and it actually improved Internet speeds on the iPhone in testing. Its user interface needs an update, however. By Max Eddy Your first line of defense against online data snooping, even on an iPhone, should be a virtual private network, or VPN, like TorGuard. The TorGuard service is first-rate, offering numerous servers across the globe and plenty of flexible, advanced options. But although its iPhone app actually improved speeds in testing, the app itself is not the best choice for beginners. TorGuard, as a service, gets a high score, but my Editors' Choice for iPhone VPN apps remains NordVPN, which offers a better user experience. //Compare Similar Products Compare NordVPN (for iPhone)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it KeepSolid VPN Unlimited   %displayPrice%%seller% see it PureVPN   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Private Internet Access VPN   %displayPrice%%seller% see it NordVPN   %displayPrice%%seller% see it What Is a VPN? Your home network is (probably) safe, but what about when you're out and about with your iPhone? The public Wi-Fi at the coffee shop is just that—public. Anyone else on the network could be snooping on your traffic. Worse, your phone may automatically connect to what it thinks is a safe and familiar network, but is actually a specially configured, malicious device. If that happens, an attacker can play man-in-the-middle with your data without your even knowing it. To protect against these threats and more, you need a VPN. When active, the VPN routes your traffic through an encrypted tunnel. This means that no one on the same network can sneak peeks at your data, even if they own the network. Your data then travels through the encrypted tunnel and exits on to the public Internet from a server operated by the VPN. This has the benefit of disguising your IP address and actual location, since any spies or advertisers out on the Web will only see the IP address of the VPN server. Journalists and political activists use VPNs every day to access the public Internet when operating out of places with repressive Internet policies. On the lighter side, you can use VPNs to unlock region-locked content, like free streams of BBC TV shows or MLB games. Note that Apple requires that apps wishing to use the open-source OpenVPN protocol undergo additional vetting. As a result, most VPN companies opt not to include OpenVPN as an option in their iPhone apps, even if the service supports it elsewhere. That's too bad, as I prefer OpenVPN for its speed and security. If you'd like to use OpenVPN, you can download the official OpenVPN app and configure it to work with the service of your choice. TorGuard has a handy step-by-step guide on how to do this on the company's website. My reviews of iPhone VPN apps test the services as they operate out of the box, however. Unlike Wi-Fi, your cellular signals are harder to intercept. But it's not impossible. A dedicated attacker can jam the LTE and 3G bands, and trick your phone into connecting to a portable cell tower (called a femtocell) over 2G, which uses weak encryption. For maximum security, consider using your VPN even when you're connecting to a cellular network rather than Wi-Fi. Pricing and Features TorGuard's app is available for free through the Apple App Store. I had no trouble installing it. You can purchase a subscription via Apple Pay on your phone, or you can pay on the TorGuard website, which accepts credit cards and PayPal as well as anonymous options including Bitcoin and prepaid gift cards. A one-month subscription with TorGuard costs $9.99, with discounts for longer subscriptions, which is common for the industry. A three-month subscription is $19.99 and a six-month subscription is $29.99. An entire year of coverage is $59.99. Note, however, that nearly every VPN offers lots of discounts and promotions, so you can likely purchase a plan for even less. The only difference between the tiers is duration, so even the most affordable level offers all the features of the most expensive. That's great. That said, a TorGuard subscription is on the more expensive end of the VPN spectrum. A subscription with the Private Internet Access iPhone VPN app, for example, costs only $6.99 a month, and KeepSolid VPN Unlimited a mere $4.99. TorGuard is more affordable than NordVPN, which costs $11.95 a month, but that service has other advantages, as I'll explain. That subscription lets you connect up to five devices simultaneously to the TorGuard network, which is average for the industry. TorGuard boasts over 1,600 servers across some 51 countries. Note that these numbers change often, usually in an upward direction. TorGuard offers server locations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, India, and the Middle East, as well as Central, North, and South America. Many VPNs don't have much coverage in Africa or the Middle East, so I'm glad to see TorGuard's presence in these regions. TorGuard notably offers servers in China and Russia, too. That's a great showing, and second only to Private Internet Access, which claims over 3,000 servers in more locations. A large number of diversely distributed servers is important for two reasons: First, it gives you lots of options to choose an exit point for your Internet traffic. Second, and more importantly, the availability of many servers means you're more likely to find a server nearby if you are traveling. The closer the server, the better the performance. If you're traveling in Africa and the closest server is in England, you can imagine that forcing your traffic to travel thousands of additional miles would degrade your Internet experience. The NordVPN iPhone app offers specific servers for specific activities, which is a feature I like. If you want to stream video, use the high-speed video server. If you want to use P2P or BitTorrent, use the appropriate server for the best results. TorGuard doesn't provide this clarity from its iPhone app. If you want to see how crowded a server is, or whether or not it allows P2P, you have to go to TorGuard's website. That's sure to be confusing for beginning users, and it's not the best experience even for seasoned VPN experts. Unlike Android, iOS allows developers to dabble with ad-blocking apps. These only limit ads appearing in the Safari browser, so even Editors' Choice winner 1Blocker won't filter ads while you're browsing with the Firefox app. TorGuard and Private Internet Access are among the few VPN services that can filter out unwanted advertisements at the network level. One of the most remarkable things about TorGuard is the level of customization it offers for a subscription. A shared, static IP address is included, but you can opt for a dedicated IP address in the region of your choice for an additional fee. Other perks include additional licenses, allowing more devices to use TorGuard simultaneously, and access to a 10Gbps premium network. I'll spare you the details of these options, since it's handled outside the iPhone app. Be sure to look at my review of TorGuard on Windows for a more complete look at everything TorGuard has to offer in this regard. Interestingly, you cannot access the Tor anonymization network through TorGuard. If you're looking for that feature, you're better off with NordVPN. Instead, the "Tor" in "TorGuard" refers to BitTorrent, as the company operates many servers that allow torrenting. Hands On With TorGuard The TorGuard iPhone app is mostly confined to a single screen. Here, you can select the server of your choice from the drop-down menu. It's a lengthy list, organized by country, with little information about the actual servers. To see the server's status or whether BitTorrent is allowed, you have to log in to the TorGuard website. The app also doesn't help with server selection, which is disappointing. NordVPN and Private Internet Access do a good job of finding the nearest available server. NordVPN also breaks down its server listing down by purpose, making it more accessible for new users. Tapping the Connect button prompts you to log in to the TorGuard service. You can save your login credentials, but even then, you still have to tap again to actually activate the VPN. It's not a big deal, but NordVPN and other services have more elegant interfaces. Settings are few and far between in the simple TorGuard VPN app, but it does let you choose between IPSec and IKEv2 VPN protocols. The TorGuard service also supports L2TP, OpenVPN, PPTP, and SSTP, but those protocols are not included in the app. As mentioned earlier, if you want to use OpenVPN, you can download the OpenVPN app and configure it with TorGuard's information. I can always appreciate a minimalist app, but I think TorGuard's is so minimal as to actually be confusing. NordVPN is far more user-friendly and more like other mainstream apps, which I think helps new users grasp how to use VPN services. TorGuard would do well to freshen up its iPhone offering's interface. Speed Test Using a VPN service, generally speaking, degrades the quality of your Internet connection. Adding miles (sometimes, thousands of miles) of cable and at least one extra server to the path your Web traffic must travel usually slows downloads and uploads, and increases latency. There are vanishingly rare exceptions to this, however, and TorGuard appears to be one of them. To test VPN performance, I run several speed tests with the Ookla speed test app. (Ookla is owned by PCMag's parent company, Ziff Davis.) I then compare the average of the tests performed without the VPN active with the average of tests performed with the VPN active, and calculate a percentage change. Networks are very finicky things, so your mileage may vary. TorGuard on iPhone turned out to be full of surprises. In my latency tests, it actually reduced latency by 25 percent. It's almost a mirror image of NordVPN, which increased latency by 28.6 percent. That said, a 25 percent improvement works out to be a difference of about 2 milliseconds, so don't get too excited. That said, download and upload speeds on the iPhone also saw a similar slight improvement with TorGuard VPN. I found that TorGuard improved download speeds by 7.9 percent and upload speeds by 8.82 percent. Again, these are tiny changes (just 2-3Mbps, on average) but it's remarkable to find a VPN that has no negative impact. NordVPN had the next best results among iPhone VPN apps, slowing downloads by 13.4 percent and uploads by 19.9 percent. The Private Internet Access iPhone app brought up the rear, slowing download speeds by 86.7 percent and upload speeds by 78.1 percent. In my testing, browsing the Web with TorGuard active didn't seem noticeably faster than without, but it certainly wasn't worse, and that's important. Even pages with numerous media elements loaded as quickly as I would expect. What's truly remarkable is that I was able to access Netflix while using TorGuard VPN. Over the past year, I've seen Netflix become remarkably adept at blocking access to VPN and proxy users. And yet TorGuard seems to have slipped past Netflix's nets. That alone is incredibly valuable, although I wonder how long it will last. It's worth reemphasizing that the gains I saw with TorGuard were very slight. I saw a much larger performance improvement when I tested PureVPN on the desktop using one of the service's international VPN servers. That service boosted download speeds by over 160 percent. Still, it's the first time I've seen a performance boost with an iPhone app. Your Guardian Like Private Internet Access, TorGuard doesn't place a premium on user experience or elegant design. The TorGuard app is spare to the point of being Spartan, and the act of simply turning a VPN connection on takes more steps than it should. But, also like Private Internet Access, it has a robust infrastructure, with over 1,600 servers across the globe and a laundry list of advanced features. Best of all, the service racked up excellent speed test scores and was not blocked by Netflix in my testing. It's a highly functional app, one that's just a facelift away from being an Editors' Choice.

At launch, it will only be available to those in select domains: messaging, payments, ride booking, workouts, calling and searching photos. "watchOS 3.2 includes SiriKit. Users can ask Siri on their Apple Watch to book a ride, send a message, make a payment, or make other requests that your app can handle," Apple advises developers in its official notes. "Apps that provide services in specific domains can use SiriKit to make those services available through Siri on watchOS. Making your services available requires creating one or more app extensions using the Intents and Intents UI frameworks.  Apple's incoming watchOS update will also include a new feature called Theatre Mode that will stop a users' Apple Watch from lighting up or making noise when in the cinema, for example. "Theatre Mode lets users quickly mute the sound on their Apple Watch and avoid waking the screen on wrist raise. Users still receive notifications (including haptics) while in Theater Mode, which they can view by tapping the screen or pressing the Digital Crown," Apple explains. Apple is reportedly planning to bring Theater Mode to the iPhone, too, but the feature failed to show up in the firm's newly-released iOS 10.3 beta.  watchOS 3.2 hasn't yet been released to developers, so it's unclear when Apple plans to roll it out to the public. µ Tweet   Facebook   Google plus       Send to   Topics Gadgets Apple Wearable tech cloud computing INQ Latest Google Updates: Back from holidays in time for new Chromebooks and Allo bot Plus there's a lot of people using G Suite, and some shiny new Chromebooks Software 27 January 2017 Ex-GTA producer Leslie Benzies announces first game, and it is Everywhere And it's is nowhere near Liberty City Games 27 January 2017 Google Pixel 2 could pack an Intel processor, according to shady leak But Google might opt for its own custom-built chip instead Phones 27 January 2017 Security is now 'number one priority' in app development F5 says devs must stand up to the increasing sophistication of attacks Security 27 January 2017 Add a comment Add a comment Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Back to Top Most read Nokia D1C and P1 price, release date and specs 5 reasons why the Xbox One S is worse than the original Best smartphones 2017: Nokia P1, BlackBerry DTEK70, Galaxy Note 8 and more Galaxy Note 8 specs, release date and price 7 Nintendo products better than the Switch Contact Marketing solutions Enterprise IT Events About Incisive Media Terms & conditions Privacy policy RSS Twitter LinkedIn Newsletters Facebook Google+ YouTube © Incisive Media Investments Limited 2015 © Incisive Business Media (IP) Limited, Published by Incisive Business Media Limited, Haymarket House, 28-29 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4RX, are companies registered in England and Wales with company registration numbers 9177174 & 9178013 Digital publisher of the year 2010, 2013 & 2016 Digital publisher of the year 2010, 2013 & 2016

Image: Kobby Dagan/Shutterstock Qualcomm president Derek Aberle is not holding back when it comes to the company’s ongoing legal dispute with Apple, as he accuses the iPhone maker of “withholding information” in regulatory disputes. These statements were made during a call with Qualcomm investors following its Q1 earnings report that showed it did not meet analysts’ expectations of $6.12bn. It actually made $5.99bn, which has resulted in a 4pc decline in its stock. During the follow-up call, investors appeared anxious to talk about the ongoing dispute between the chipmaker and Apple, one of its biggest clients, who has filed a $1bn lawsuit against the former. Apple making a lot of assertions Apple said it believes Qualcomm has “unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with”. Now, according to Forbes, its top executives used the conference call to defend the company’s policy to charge royalties for its chips in products like the iPhone, taking a swipe at Apple in the meantime. Qualcomm’s CEO Steve Mollenkopf said Apple’s claim has “a lot of assertions”. “In the end, this is a commercial dispute over the price of intellectual property,” he said. “They want to pay less than the fair value that Qualcomm has established in the marketplace for our technology, even though Apple has generated billions in profits from using that technology.” An attack on smartphone competition Qualcomm also accused Apple of using its influence to sway increased legal actions against the chipmaker in various jurisdictions across the globe, in addition to using false information to further its own aims. “Apple has been actively driving regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in jurisdictions around the world, and misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” claimed Qualcomm’s president, Derek Aberle. One of the biggest issues Qualcomm has with the lawsuit, Aberle continued, was that Apple has not only benefited greatly from using its technology, but this latest action is attempting to force a monopoly. “Apple’s attack on Qualcomm’s business model is not only an attack on Qualcomm, but also an attack on the smartphone competition that Qualcomm’s business model enables.” This dispute does not mean that the two will not conduct any further business however, as CEO Mollenkopf has said it will remain a “good supplier” to Apple.

Apple is seeking 1 billion yuan (US$145 million) in damages from Qualcomm, according to Beijing’s intellectual property court, which announced Wednesday it would hear the lawsuits.   The legal action centers on Qualcomm’s standards-essential patents for its cellular technology. Allegedly, the company refused to negotiate a fair licensing fee for the patents and even declined to license some of them to Apple.  This "restricted" the iPhone maker from offering certain products or services, one of the lawsuits claim, according to the Beijing court. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. But last week, it filed a separate $1 billion lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S., which also charges the chipmaker with demanding "exorbitant" licensing fees for its cellular technology.   “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,” Apple said at the time. Earlier this month, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission also accused the chipmaker of engaging in anticompetitive practices over its royalty fees.  However, Qualcomm said it is prepared to defend itself in court. "These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology," the company said Wednesday. The chipmaker said it offered Apple licensing fees that are "consistent" with what more than 100 Chinese companies have agreed to pay. Qualcomm has also revised its business practices in the country ever since Chinese regulators fined the company $975 million back in February 2015 over monopolistic practices.  As part of that settlement, Qualcomm agreed to overhaul its patent licensing system in China.
