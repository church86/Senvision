"Google confirmed it had removed support from Google Maps but suggested that move might be temporary," technology website cnet.com reported on Tuesday. The removal was not mentioned in the release notes, and Google has not indicated whether it will reinstate support for watchOS. Amazon and eBay, both of which previously included Apple Watch support in their iOS apps have also removed their apps. Both were last updated in April. "It's unclear why the companies decided to remove support for their apps on the Apple Watch, or whether Apple had a role in their decision," the report noted. Apple launched its smartwatch two years ago, but the early software version was limited and apps initially were extensions of their iPhone apps. Apple released watchOS 3 software in 2016 that allowed app developers to make standalone apps for the Apple Watch.  TAGS Apple WatchGoogle MapsAmazoneBay O P E N Professional Courses Sponsored link Technology Courses Sponsored link Latest BJP MP Patel honey-trap: Woman arrested Two killed as tractor overturns in Bihar Canada defence minister sorry for exaggerating military role EC cancels Anantnag Lok Sabha bypoll Infosys plans to hire 10,000 American workers Hyderabad NGO rescues child labour victim Chinese Communist Party officials funding Dalai Lama: China's Global Times Aadhaar: SC to hear plea against govt decision Gallery May Day in pics: Protesters worldwide demand better work conditions, higher wages Deadly storms leave a trail of destruction in Texas arrow Videos How to make Prawns 65 Fuel prices to be revised daily from today arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express.2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Samakalika Malayalam | Malayalam Vaarika | Indulgexpress | Edex Live Contact Us | About Us | Careers | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard

A new malware program targeting Mac systems by using a program signed with an Apple-validated digital certificate can steal communications over Gmail and banking websites. Security firm Check Point discovered a new strain of Mac malware that online criminals are spreading via mass email. According to its researchers, this is the “first major scale malware to target OSX users via a coordinated email phishing campaign.” Mac malware, though less common than its Windows counterpart, isn’t new, however it’s typically distributed on websites rather than email. There are numerous instances of bogus Adobe Flash Player updates on the web carrying malware for Mac systems; sometimes they’re also signed with a real Apple Developer ID certificate to avoid triggering Apple’s security alerts for unsigned applications. In the Windows world, malware delivered by spam email is common and sometimes exploit new Windows vulnerabilities, such as a recent batch of messages that targeted Australian organizations. Malware laden email specifically for Mac systems isn't so common and Mac malware discovered by Check Point gives the attackers “complete access to all victim communication”. This includes communication on HTTPS pages which would, on a non-infected Mac, be protected by encryption. Google, for example, ensures that communications between a browser and its Gmail servers are protected with encryption over an HTTPS connection. This security can be undone if malware is installed on the user's computer. HTTPS can be broken a number of ways, including by antivirus that are designed to inspect encrypted traffic for malware. The attackers behind the new Mac malware, which Check Point labels OSX/Dok, undermines encryption between the user and web server by installing a new root certificate on the infected Mac, allowing them to sit between the end-user and the server. “By abusing the victim’s new-found trust in this bogus certificate, the attacker can impersonate any website, and the victim will be none the wiser,” said Ofer Caspi, a member of Check Point’s malware research team. Read more Google blocks Unicode phishing URLs that could spoof Apple.com in Chrome While Mac users can in general trust Apple’s policy of trusting signed software, attackers can exploit the fact Apple permits macOS users to install software from the web, even though it discourages this in dialogue box warnings. This malware locks victims into a series of dialogue boxes that convincingly impersonate legitimate macOS system dialogue boxes in order to trick the victim into entering the device’s password, which will allow the malware to complete installation. The malware then changes the Mac’s network settings to allow outgoing connections of the attacker’s choosing, and then installs a new root certificate to allow the attacker to snoop on the computer’s messages. “By abusing the victim’s new-found trust in this bogus certificate, the attacker can impersonate any website, and the victim will be none the wiser,” notes Caspi. Read more ​Endpoint Security is Just One Piece of the Puzzle Once this is set, the malware launches two routines that ensure the infected Mac channels all online connections through the attacker’s server, allowing the attacker to control what the user sees when they attempt to connect to a site they believe they know, such as a banking site or other site that uses HTTPS. The lesson here for Mac users is to view email from unknown senders with a cautious eye. Numerous instances of malware designed macOS (or Mac OS X) do exist, disproving the argument that it doesn’t. But while Mac malware is less common, it doesn’t hurt to be aware of those that do.

By Asha McLean | May 2, 2017 -- 02:59 GMT (19:59 PDT) | Topic: Banking Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has released its results for the first half of the 2017 financial year, recording AU$2.9 billion in after tax profit, an increase of 6 percent year on year. For the half year ended March 31, 2017, ANZ reported total revenue of AU$10.6 billion, with its Australian operations accounting for AU$4.7 billion of the sum. Latest Australian news Telstra enables voice services across small cells ​Google Australia to fight ATO tax bill AFP 'mistakenly' accessed journalist call records, breaching metadata laws 136 complaints arise from ATO's string of HPE hardware outages NBN should increase FttP and FttDP connections: SA government During the half, ANZ chief executive officer Shayne Elliott said his bank has been focused on improving the customer experience, noting that 60 percent of customers in Australia and 64 percent in New Zealand are currently "digitally active". From mid-2017, ANZ customers transferring more than AU$1,000 through the bank's mobile apps will be able to use their voice to automatically authorise high value payments, and bypass usual security measures such as visiting a branch in person. The voice biometrics initiative will kick off with a pilot running with ANZ staff and select customers in May using the "Grow by ANZ" mobile app. The service will then be rolled out to ANZ goMoney and other digital services progressively. ANZ touted voice biometrics as the next step in making banking more convenient for customers while also strengthening security, and partnered with natural language company Nuance to take the platform to market. During the half, ANZ also launched BladePay, a mobile payments solution for Australian businesses, in partnership with South African-based payments startup ThumbzUp, and introduced card replacement for lost or stolen cards within 15 minutes via the bank's digital wallet. In delivering ANZ's first quarter market update in February, Elliott said initiatives including Apple Pay and Android Pay drove ongoing net customer acquisition gains in the bank's Australian Retail Transaction Banking segment. ANZ was the first bank in both Australia and New Zealand to launch Apple Pay, in April last year. ANZ was the only member of Australia's big four to embrace Apple Pay, having left the group of banks requesting collective bargaining rights with Apple and demanding open access to iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) technology. ANZ is currently the only bank in New Zealand offering the service. Elliott told shareholders on Tuesday that his bank is focused on expanding its customer-facing innovations, after again pointing to the success of Apple and Android Pay. "In 2016 we refreshed ANZ's strategy to ensure we were on a path to rapidly adapt to the changing environment and deliver materially better outcomes for our customers, the community, and shareholders," he explained. The bank's strategy involves a significant reshaping of its business, which includes changes to its operating model for technology, operations, and shared services in a bid to accelerate the delivery of its technology and digital roadmap, bring operations closer to its customers, and continue operational efficiency gains. As a result, divisional operations from Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre have been realigned to divisions, the bank explained on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, ANZ announced it was moving to a Scaled Agile approach to organising and delivering work, aligning itself with the likes of Google and Spotify which use the approach within their respective organisations. "We are moving quickly to meet customer expectations by delivering more of our services through digital channels, with digital sales in Australia up 24 percent," Elliott added. "These results show we are creating a very different bank, one that is consistently producing better outcomes for customers and for shareholders. These are still early days and I am pleased with the significant momentum we have now established in the business. "Our intention is now to accelerate our transformation through wider implementation of Scaled Agile throughout ANZ." In its 2016 full-year results, ANZ posted AU$5.7 billion in statutory net profit, representing a 24 percent tumble year on year. At the time, the bank attributed the profit dive to, amongst other things, its focus on competing in the "digital age". "The environment for banking remains constrained with intense competition and pressure on margins, subdued lending growth, rapidly changing customer expectations, and increasing regulation," Elliott added on Tuesday. "The outlook for the second half remains broadly neutral. We are responding decisively to these continuing pressures through a financial, digital, and cultural transformation of ANZ."

In most cases it works the first or second try, but there are still some iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak problems both with the jailbreak process and with using your iPhone after the jailbreak. Here is a look at the most common iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak problems from Apple ID issues, a failed jailbreak, Cydia crashing, FaceTime not working after you jailbreak and more. We’ll also show you how to fix location services after you install the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak. Keep in mind the iPad Pro 9.7-inch and the iPod Touch 6th generation don’t work with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak yet and 32 bit devices don’t work with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak at all. How to fix common iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak problems. The Pangu team is working on fixes for some of the common iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak problems, so you may simply need to wait. You don’t need to wipe your phone and start over, and importantly you don’t need to take it anywhere for help. With the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak it is possible to do a complete restore and jailbreak to start from scratch if you do run into multiple problems, but that’s final option. Pangu Jailbreak Tool Won’t Open Make sure you are trying to use the Pangu iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak tool on Windows. It will not work on a Mac. If you are on Windows and you opened the tool, and had an issue or it closed you cannot re-open it until you completely restart the computer. Make sure that you allow access and allow firewall access to the tool. If you have issues with those steps, use this guide to jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 without a computer. Pangu Tool Won’t Accept Your Apple ID Part of using the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak on a PC is entering your Apple ID. We recommend using a second Apple ID that does not have all your personal information connected to it. Fix Apple ID problems with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak tool. If the tool shows you a crying computer it is having issues with your Apple ID. You may need to turn off two-factor authentication in your iCloud settings to use this. We recommend using a second ID that doesn’t need this or to use the no computer needed jailbreak that doesn’t ask for an Apple ID. Cannot Jailbreak Without a Computer We saw a brief period where you could jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 without a computer. This option downloaded the jailbreak tool directly to your iPhone, using an enterprise certificate. We’ve learned that Apple is now revoking some of these certificates, which may lead to an unable to download app error message. If you run into this you need to use this guide to jailbreak using a computer. How to Fix Activator Bootloop on iOS 9.3.3 If you install the new version of Activator and your iPhone enters a boot loop you can fix it with a few easy to follow steps. You will need to follow the guide on Reddit from DodongBastos using iFunbox to remove the Activator tweak. iOS 9.3.3 Jailbreak Fails If you cannot complete the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak and you see some type of error message in Chinese you should do the following. Restart your iPhone and your computer. Confirm that Find My iPhone is off and that you are on iOS 9.3.3. You may also want to make sure that a passcode is off. If that doesn’t fix this problem you may need to restore so that you don’t have any over the air updates on your iPhone. An OTA update can mess with the jailbreak process. Fix Location Services After iOS 9.3.3 Jailbreak Some users report that the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak breaks Location Services. This is annoying, but there are several simple fixes if you run into this problem. The easiest is to go to Settings -> General -> Reset -> Reset Network Settings. This will wipe all your network information like WiFi connections but won’t erase your data. When the phone reboots try to turn on Location Services. If that fails you may need to restart the iPhone, launch the PP Jailbreak app again and re-jailbreak. Once this completes try turning Location Services back on. If that fails you may be able to fix it by downloading libLocation from Cydia and installing it on your iPhone or iPad. Fix FaceTime After iOS 9.3.3 Jailbreak If you cannot use FaceTime after you use the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak you need to restart your iPhone or iPad and then try the jailbreak app on your phone again. This should fix FaceTime jailbreak issues for most users. Use the PP app to jailbreak iOS 9.3.3 again on your iPhone if apps crash or FaceTime doesn’t work. Apps Crash on iOS 9.3.3 Jailbreak If you start to experience issues with apps on your iPhone or iPad after installing the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak you should first make sure that your iPhone didn’t restart. If it did you may need to re-jailbreak using the app on your iPhone. Another issues is that not all Cydia apps and tweaks work with the iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak yet. Use this list of iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak compatible Cydia apps and tweaks to see if the app you are using works for other people. How to Fix Annoying iOS 9.3.3 Jailbreak Problems If you run into iOS 9.3.3 jailbreak problems that you cannot fix using the help above you should seriously consider restoring your iPhone and then re-jailbreaking without restoring from backup. Users who need to go this route will want to connect the iPhone to a computer and use the Restore option in iTunes. This will download the right version of iOS 9.3.3 and then will install it so that the iPhone is set up fresh. When this is complete you can jailbreak the iPhone on iOS 9.3.3 and likely experience fewer issues than you had before.

The Scaled Agile approach to organising and delivering work has been touted by ANZ as a proven approach for running businesses based on small, autonomous, multi-disciplinary teams.

"In the digital age, customer expectations are being redefined by their experiences with businesses like Amazon and Apple. We need to break with some of the traditional 20th century approaches to organising and working to ensure we are more responsive to 21st century customer expectations," ANZ CEO Shayne Elliott said in a statement on Tuesday. "The use of agile will mean a much less hierarchical ANZ, one built around small, collaborative, self-directed teams focused on delivering continuous improvement in the customer experience." The announcement comes on the same day as ANZ released its results for the first half of the 2017 financial year. For the six-months ended March 31, 2017, ANZ recorded a 6 percent year on year increase in after-tax profit to AU$2.9 billion. "These results show we are creating a very different bank, one that is consistently producing better outcomes for customers and for shareholders. These are still early days and I am pleased with the significant momentum we have now established in the business," the CEO added. "Our intention is now to accelerate our transformation through wider implementation of Scaled Agile throughout ANZ. "This is a completely different approach to running our business based on a proven model that will allow us to respond much faster to changing customer expectations, engage our staff and attract new talent, and reduce waste and bureaucracy." According to Elliott, ANZ has already been heading in this direction, with around 20 percent of technology and digital projects currently delivered using the Agile approach within the bank. The bank's agile-based transformation will initially be focused on the Australia division for its pilot projects, with plans to launch it at scale within the business in early 2018. Kath Bray, currently the managing director for products who was responsible for the delivery of Apple Pay at ANZ, has been appointed to oversee the "agile transformation". As the bank focuses on competing in the digital age, ANZ general manager of data Darren Abbruzzese revealed in February ANZ was embarking on a project to create an enterprise-wide data lake in a bid to capitalise on the most strategic asset the bank believes it has. According to Abbruzzese, as the bank realised the value of its data, it captured everything it could. However, as a result, little "ponds" of data popped up in different departments throughout the organisation, and the information inside remained valuable and accessible only to those working on a particular project. As a result, ANZ is aggregating its data into a single Hadoop-based data lake, which will also see the bank move away from the concept of data warehouses. Abbruzzese expects the process to take a number of years, and the bank will start with transitioning over its high-priority data assets and work backwards from there. In addition, Abbruzzese wants to see the lake top up in real time. "It is a challenge, as we've got a lot of legacy technology. We've still got some mainframes running, got huge batch processes -- but it's something we're really keen to prosecute because we think improving the flow of data through our organisation will really help drive an advantage for us," he explained.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo Business May 01, 2017 11:49 PM Asian shares mostly higher despite soft China factory data By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

For a period of 15 years all the components that Apple imports, they want them to be free of duty. We have a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) because we want more and more value addition to come to the country. We want them to understand how this PMP will work and how they can dove tail into that,” Ministry of Electronics and IT Secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters. She was speaking on the sidelines of the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has approved PMP and the government set to notify it. “Right now the value addition is minimal. We want to take it up. For that purpose we have just announced phased manufacturing programme for mobile phones,” Sundararajan said. According to Indian Cellular Association, the PMP is expected to increase local value addition in mobile phone manufacturing to increase to 39-50 per cent in next 3 years. Under PMP, the government has already imposed additional duty on import of mobile charger, battery pack and wired headset in 2016-17. In 2017-18, key components like mobile microphone and receiver, USB Cable, key pads will attract duty benefits. Components like camera module, mobile antenna etc will be given incentives or duty benefit in 2018-19 if procured locally by handset makers. Mobile phone makers will get benefit of tax or incentives on the touch panels, mobile screen, vibrator motor or ringer from 2019-20 onwards under the program. The phased manufacturing programme was proposed by a joint panel of the industry and the government – Fast Track Task Force. The panel set up under the MeitY has set target of 500 million handset production by 2019 and export target of 120 million mobile phones by 2019-20, taking annual manufacturing output in the range of Rs 1.5-3 lakh crore. In 2016-17, total value of mobile phone to be produced in India is likely to reach Rs 90,000 crore from Rs 54,000 crore in 2015-16.

Now, in an interesting twist news has broken courtesy of Apple Insider that major apps from a variety of tech giants have been quietly dropped from Apple’s watchOS operating system. For example, Google Maps, Amazon and eBay have disappeared from the Apple Watch App Store without an explanation. In fact, it looks like Google pulled support for Maps on watchOS a few weeks ago and very few users noticed. Amazon and eBay on the other hand, no longer include support for the Apple Watch in either app’s description and integration seems to have been removed. Another notable app that seem to have abandoned Apple’s wearable is TripAdvisor. It’s possible that while the Apple Watch version of these app’s had a small number of users, the amount was likely so tiny that it wasn’t worth maintaining them. With the exception being Google Maps, in some ways it also makes sense for these apps to disappear given that they aren’t exactly ideal for the Apple Watch’s tiny display or watchOS. It’s also possible that Google could be preparing to release an upgraded version of Google Maps for the inevitable release of watchOS 4, but nothing has been revealed yet. While I’m an avid Apple Watch user (yes, I actually wear an Apple Watch almost everyday), I find myself utilizing the wearable’s apps far less than I used to, instead opting to use the wearable primarily for notifications. With the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, even Apple has slowly been pivoting the wearable towards being a fitness tracking and companion device. MobileSyrup will have more news on the Apple Watch’s future coming out of the Cupertino, California-based company’s annual World Wide Developer’s Conference (WWDC) this June in San Jose.

Earlier this month, Apple was granted a permit to test a self-driving car all around California. A few weeks after that, a supposed Apple self-driving test vehicle was spotted by local pedestrians. Now, new reports suggest that Samsung is also jumping onto the self-driving bandwagon, so to speak. According to The Korea Herald, the government of South Korea has granted Samsung the permit to test its self-driving car on public roads. This is the first time that Samsung has been reported with regards to autonomous vehicles. The report also mentioned that Samsung will be focusing much of its efforts on the development of sensors for self-driving cars. Furthermore, the company will also dig deeper into machine learning or artificial intelligence. It aims to produce sensors and computer modules that feature deep-learning. These systems will also be used on rough terrains and more challenging road conditions. Uber’s self-driving car (via businessinsider.com) Apart from these information, nothing much is said about the supposed self-driving car from Samsung. Also, it is uncertain if the said technology will make its way into the mass market especially outside of South Korea. For now, all that can be said is that Samsung, much like Apple, is diversifying its portfolio by investing in self-driving cars. Perhaps, the company has seen the financial benefits of specializing in systems pertaining to vehicle autonomy. Unfortunately, the report did not mention any timeframe as to when Samsung is planning on doing the actual tests. Nevertheless, this will be a new avenue for Samsung to explore and become a main player of. To date, South Korea’s Land Ministry has issued a total of 20 permits for tests of self-driving cars in the country. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

According to the said claim, this new device will be a direct competition to Amazon’s Echo device that uses the Alexa app. Now, renowned market analyst from KGI Securities, Ming-Chi Kuo, published a report saying Apple is indeed working on the said device. He also speculated that the Siri hardware will be unveiled during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The said device will be sold at a much higher price thanks to its premium specs and superb audio quality. Kuo also added that the device in question will have a total of eight speakers, seven tweeters and a subwoofer. While Kuo did not give any specific detail on how the device would look like, Dickson somehow had an idea on how it might turn out to be. According to Dickson, the Siri hardware will have similar design features as the Mac Pro or the UE Megaboom speaker. Amazon Echo (via amazon.com) On the subject of performance, Kuo stated that the upcoming device will sport the same processor that is current being used on an iPhone 6s. This means that the Siri device will probably be equipped with an Apple A9 chip. If not that, an A8X chip is also a possible candidate. For now, Kuo did not mention anything about the supposed release of the device other than it will be more expensive than the Amazon Echo. However, there is a strong chance that consumers might be able to get their hands on the Siri speaker before the end of the year. Finally, Kuo also claims that Apple is also considering another smaller device that will compete directly to the Amazon Echo Dot. This device, as he predicts, will be powered by the W1 chip; the same chip on the Apple AirPods wireless earbuds. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Boris Mizhen – Welcomes Influence and Inspiration from Steve Jobs NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / May 1, 2017 / Though the name of Steve Jobs will forever be linked to computing, many would argue it was his creative entrepreneurship that played the biggest part in his meteoric rise. Incredible success and ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, it is these traits that Boris Mizhen, online entrepreneur and marketing guru, drew his greatest inspiration. The Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs inspired him to eventually achieve his own technology-related success. „Perhaps what inspired me most about Steve Jobs was his strategic expertise,” Mizhen shared. This is a fact that cannot be disputed, as Jobs’ greatest strength is widely unknown by the public. At the time of Apple’s formation, Jobs was helping facilitate the development and sale of the Apple I computer. While the industry did take notice, it was the Apple II, which Jobs helped develop, that skyrocketed the company to fame and fortune. Boris Mizhen admires the earlier stories about Jobs’ enthusiasm and integrity and applies it to his own work ethic when building his business. Mizhen reveals „It is through Jobs’ lessons, that I learned technical ability alone won’t ensure success in the technology field. The trick is to anticipate what the public wants and know how to provide it.” Another trait of Jobs’ that Boris Mizhen has adopted is his unique business judgment. „History has shown that although his business decisions would not always result in immediate profits, his willingness to take risks due to a long-term vision resulted in great successes,” he notes. Apple’s haste to change direction and part ways with Jobs saw the company hit an all time low. However, his return to the company was the catalyst for Apple’s accession to the very top of the technology world. „His decision to branch out into developing or improving on software outside the company’s original focus not doubt terrified investors and shareholders,” Mizhen said. „But we all know the result of that bold business move!” Boris Mizhen has established himself as an authority in marketing strategy, online advertising, digital media, social media and a host of related fields due to the lessons learned from pioneers like Jobs. Mizhen is sure to add that mirroring Jobs’ ability to turn dreams into great successes was also reliant on one more trait: forward thinking. „A favorite quote I share with Jobs is by hockey great Wayne Gretzky: ‚I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.’ I always look ahead to see where the technology and the marketing world will head next and ensure I’ll already be there when it arrives!” Boris Mizhen is a New York City-based real estate developer and entrepreneur, whose career launched when he developed a number of online advertising and marketing websites. Born with a strong business instinct, Mizhen learnt at a young age how to use every opportunity to his advantage. In addition to his online companies, Mr. Mizhen also manages numerous real estate properties across the North-East of the United States providing stable housing to families in different regions. He enjoys spending his extra time and energy by contributing to charities and organizations that offer help to those who need it most. By pursuing his passion in philanthropic causes, Boris Mizhen remains passionately involved with social activism across the world.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Apple, tech lift Wall Street as Nasdaq sets record Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet May 2, 2017:   Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq Composite to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2 per cent and set a record high, supporting the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, gained 0.9 per cent, with big tech names including Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook hitting records. Investors braced for another heavy week of quarterly corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 per cent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 per cent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. “This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. “That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well. The S&P 500 gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.00 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 6,091.60, a record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points or 0.13 per cent to 20,913.46, after notching its best weekly performance of 2017 last week. The CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since February 2007. Financials rose 0.6 per cent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 per cent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid US economic reports. US factory activity slowed in April, consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Fed meet Investors girded for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day US Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 55 new lows. About 6 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, below the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 2, 2017 9:36 am Apple’s upcoming smart speaker could be priced above Amazon Echo which retails for 9. Apple’s answer to Amazon Echo and Google Home might be days away from the launch. Now, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Apple will announce its Siri-powered smart speaker at the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Apple’s smart speaker will apparently cost more than the likes of Amazon Echo and Google Home. Kuo’s note says that the speaker will have multiple tweeters, a woofer and computing power comparable to an “iPhone 6 or 6s”, according to Business Insider. The analyst further believes that Apple’s upcoming smart speaker could be priced above Amazon Echo which retails for $189 (or approx Rs. 12,121) in the US market. The speaker reportedly will have similar features  to its competitors, allowing users to stream music and control Internet of Things (IoT) around their homes. While Kuo predicted that the device will be launched at Apple’s annual developer conference, the smart speaker could be potentially pushed back to later this year. This is the not the first time we’re hearing that Apple plans to release the smart speaker in June. Last week, a prominent tipster  Sonny Dickson said that Apple could debut the smart speaker at this year’s WWDC. He said the device’s design will be inspired by the Mac Pro, and the UE Boom’s mesh styling. Dickson also said that the smart speaker will run a variation of iOS. Apparently, it’s being speculated that Apple might also add Beat’s audio tech into the upcoming smart speaker system. Apple’s plans to reveal a Siri-powered smart speaker was first revealed in May 2016,  when The Information reported that Apple could potentially launch an “Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone built-in”. Later, Bloomberg reported that the device had entered the prototyping stage in September. During the same year, CNET reported that Apple’s Siri-powered speaker would be able to detect the people who are in close proximity to the device using “on-board” cameras equipped with some sort of facial recognition software. In February 2017, however, Times reported that Apple was no longer interested in developing a smart speaker.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Site Archive Bright Futures' certification suspended Monday May 1, 2017 at 8:11 PM May 1, 2017 at 10:26 PM Charity Lindsey Staff Writer @DP_CharityMatthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — Citing conduct “harmful” to students with exceptional needs, the California Department of Education suspended the certification of a private school here following an influx of crime first reported by the Daily Press. The CDE suspended Bright Futures Academy’s certification days after launching an investigation at its Apple Valley site, a letter states. Seven weeks ago, CDE handed down the same decision in a separate letter for the school’s main site in Riverside. “The suspension means Bright Futures of Apple Valley cannot accept any additional students,” CDE spokesperson Bill Ainsworth told the Daily Press on Monday. “In the meantime, CDE is continuing its investigation to see if further action is warranted.” According to the letter, CDE based the suspension on an interview with San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials and a Daily Press report that detailed the Town of Apple Valley’s intent to revoke the school’s business license. Bright Futures officials declined to comment Monday. The letters — addressed to Bright Futures President Betti Colucci — cite a California Education Code violation related to “conduct in the operation or maintenance of the nonpublic, nonsectarian school (NPS) or agency that is harmful to the health, welfare, or safety of an individual with exceptional needs.” Between Dec. 28, 2015, and March 11, 2017, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies responded to 132 calls for service at Bright Futures, according to Apple Valley Station Capt. Frank Bell. The calls were for incidents involving a riot, gang activity, assaults, sexual batteries and thefts, among others. Twenty-two criminal reports were filed and eight arrests made as a result, spurring the CDE’s investigation. About half of the 78 students at the Apple Valley site have autism and intellectual disabilities, according to school officials. The rest have emotional disturbance or learning disabilities. As an NPS, Bright Futures serves its students at three Southern California campuses through authorized state and federal funds, according to California Education Code. The local Bright Futures operates on the former site of St. Timothy’s Preparatory School, which closed in 2015 after 48 years. On Monday, Clerk of the Vestry Jeanne Bryson said St. Timothy’s Episcopal Church officials will hold a special meeting this week to discuss the situation. “We’re disappointed we weren’t aware of what has gone on at other campuses,” Bryson said. “We’re concerned for where the students are going to go.” According to the letters, CDE will complete a follow-up review by Dec. 30 "to ensure all corrective actions have been successfully implemented by NPS staff." Bright Futures has the option of appealing the suspension, but school officials have not yet stated any plans to do so. The school's appeal hearing before the Town Council to keep its business license is scheduled for June 13. Charity Lindsey may be contacted at CLindsey@VVDailyPress.com or 760-951-6245.

Apple and Facebook will in the coming days add evidence that tech behemoths command an ever widening share of consumer time and spending. Amazon's revenue soared as shoppers favoured it over brick-and-mortar stores, while Google parent Alphabet reported surging quarterly profit that highlighted the ubiquity of its search advertising business – especially on smartphones. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The states are fighting over where Amazon's Australian operations will be headquartered. Photo: Reed Saxon "Each has built unique moats that allow them to continue to dominate," said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie. "For Google, no one can catch them on search because of the technology and intellectual property. For Amazon, scale is their friend and no one can compete on selection, price and fulfillment capabilities." The companies have vast networks of complementary products that feed off one another to generate more sales, making it ever harder for competitors to keep up. "Given the strength of Google and Amazon, we think Facebook is likely to look similar," Schachter said. On Wednesday, Facebook is expected to report first-quarter profit of US$2.57 billion, up 70 per cent from a year earlier, while revenue climbs 45 per cent to $7.82 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Advertisement When Apple reports fiscal second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, sales are expected to climb 5 per cent to US$53 billion. Revenue from the App Store and other services such as Apple Music will likely jump 20 per cent to $7.2 billion, according to UBS analyst Steven Milunovich. "The general theme that the big are getting bigger" applies to Apple's self-feeding ecosystem, Schachter said. Every time Apple sells an iPhone, the customer buys apps and other services, feeding data such as photos and contacts into the device, making it harder to swap for a competitor's device. Higher margin service revenue then feeds back into Apple's development budget, helping it build more advanced products to sell to the same consumer. Google's advertising business is very different, but has similar self-feeding qualities. The company got 97 per cent of mobile paid search clicks in the US in the first quarter of 2017, according to client data from digital marketing firm Merkle. That was up from 82 per cent in the same period in 2014. With more searches, Google gets more ad dollars to reinvest to keep its search engine ahead of the competition – mostly represented by Microsoft's Bing. Google also gets more data on what results people click on, which can be used to improve its software even more, and keep people coming back to find information. "There are clear benefits to that scale," Mark Ballard, senior director of research at Merkle, said. "There's that feedback loop." No one can catch Google on search Ben Schachter, analyst at Macquarie For advertisers, Google's large online audience makes it one of the first places to go to run online marketing campaigns. The other is Facebook. Merkle client spending on Facebook ads was up 71 per cent in the first quarter, from a year earlier. These advertisers get about 70 per cent of their online traffic from Facebook and that hasn't changed in recent years despite the rise of competitors like Snap, Ballard noted. Facebook and Google captured 77 per cent of US digital ad spending last year, up from 72 per cent in 2015, according to a recent analysis of data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau by Pivotal Research Group. For advertisers it's "easier to concentrate budgets with a smaller number of players. It's easier to manage," said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal. Marketers have long griped about the "duopoly" atop digital advertising. But they keep giving Google and Facebook money. That's largely because few other places offer wide reach, channels for targeting consumers and better returns. Those advantages only multiply as the tech companies expand. Verizon's new Oath ad business "may figure out a special sauce, but they will never be the first port of call," Wieser said. When Google and Facebook get those calls first, they see what advertisers plan to spend elsewhere and can sell them other services and tools, according to the analyst. Advertisers disagree about what company could offer a viable third alternative. Some suggest another internet titan: Amazon. The largest online retailer isn't a leading digital advertising destination yet, but on its earnings call last week, Chief Financial Officer Brian Oslavsky reported "consistent growth" from that business. Research firm EMarketer expects the company to generate more display ad revenue than Twitter Inc. by next year. Even so, most of Amazon's first-quarter revenue gains came from grabbing retail market share as more people shop online, rather than in stores. That shift is fuelling a record pace of retailer bankruptcies this year, despite a growing US economy and solid consumer spending. What began with bookstores, movie rental outlets and electronics retailers like Borders, Blockbuster and Circuit City, is spreading to apparel and sporting goods chains like Aeropostale and Sports Authority. Once online spending in a category passes 20 per cent, it's tough for brick-and-mortar retailers to survive and easy for Amazon to gobble up market share, said Guru Hariharan, chief executive officer of Boomerang Commerce, which designs software for large retailers. Amazon has been disciplined about only pursuing retail categories that are already shifting online, giving it momentum against competitors playing defense, he said, adding that more apparel bankruptcies will come in the next two years. Like Google, which has introduced the Pixel smartphone to help secure its direct relationship with consumers, Amazon has introduced the Echo smart speaker to encourage customers to buy services and products from its website. The software makers are expanding into hardware to feed their money machines. Bloomberg Advertisement HuffPost Australia An Artificial Womb Has Successfully ...

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Apple Apple highlights iPhone 7 Plus Portrait mode again in an adorable new ad Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 1st, 2017 at 10:02 PM Share Tweet Apple fans have understandably been preoccupied with iPhone 8 rumors and leaks over the past few months, but Apple doesn’t want you to forget that it released a couple of new phones last September as well. To that end, the smartphone maker shared a new commercial on its YouTube channel on Monday in which Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 Plus takes center stage yet again. Don't Miss: Boaters stranded 4 miles from land were saved by Siri on an iPhone 7 Titled ‘The City,’ the new ad focuses on a couple meeting in the crowded streets of Shanghai. They’re surrounded by thousands of other people until the man flips to Portrait mode on the camera of his iPhone 7 Plus. Suddenly, the crowd vanishes and the two can explore the empty city effortlessly: Following the insufferable Sticker Fight commercial (I don’t know why, but it just drives me up the wall) and the bizarre iPad Pro ads that featured tweets from dissatisfied users of other devices (some of these landed; others did not), The City feels like something of a return to form — beautifully shot, has a clear message and features a great song called “Sing to Me” by Walter Martin. As excited as we all are to see what Apple has in store for this fall (and whether or not it will top the stunningly designed Galaxy S8), Apple is currently focused on promoting the products that are actually available. Portrait mode has been one of the major selling points for the iPhone 7 Plus from day one, so it’s not surprising to see the company follow up on its ‘Take Mine’ ad from January.

Events Other Industry Events Jobs More About Mumbrella Freelance Directory Business Directory Advertise Subscribe to newsletter Opinion Quitting Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News: unravelling a Faustian pact Two years ago, publishers fell into Faustian pacts with Facebook and Apple, with the promises of better traffic and ad dollars through off-platform distribution such as Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. Now as publishers are starting to retreat, Mumbrella’s Miranda Ward asks what have they learnt from jumping in with the tech giants? May 2, 2017 11:19 by Miranda Ward 3 Social media was once thought to be the key to distributing online content, but the missing piece of the puzzle has always been how to actually monetise it. So when Facebook launched its Instant Articles and Apple provided Apple News, it looked like a solution. But clearly it has not. Last week the industry saw The Guardian pull out of both while this week News Corp’s The Australian has called it quits on Apple News (it has never tried Facebook Instant Articles). Both publishing companies blamed the poor revenue generated from the platforms. Entering into a deal with Facebook to share content, and Apple to do the same, was the signing of a Faustian pact for publishers: handing complete control of their content to an external party in the desperate hopes for some sort of return through traffic numbers and ad dollars. The decision to jump on board with Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News echoed the excitement and lack of foresight that accompanied the dotcom boom – when publishers threw up websites without any real long-term plans around how the internet might impact their business models. Of course, all of that is said with the benefit of hindsight – but publishers should have learnt from the ongoing problems stemming from giving away news for free online and started thinking more long-term when it comes to distribution strategies. When publishers handed over their content to an external player, Facebook especially, they lost control over who got to see that content. They accepted without a fight that users would no longer come directly to them for news. For Facebook, news is just more content to feed its ever-hungry algorithm. It doesn’t necessarily value it any more than it does that baby video posted by someone you went to high school with, or a cat video your colleague shared. It’s all just content to be consumed, liked and shared. Who sees that content is decided by Facebook and its ever-changing algorithm – once a publisher has posted content to the platform using Instant Articles, Facebook will determine who will see it and when, based on that secret sauce recipe. All publishers can do is hope their content will gain traction and deliver audience figures (and ad clicks). Two years ago this is exactly what Australian futurist Ross Dawson warned publishers about. Ross Dawson: You are essentially giving them your future Delivering the opening keynote at International News Media Association (INMA) World Congress in New York, Dawson said of Facebook Instant Articles: “It is an individual decision but it is a critical decision. So in this case the platform strategy is central to the organisation strategy. If they do this, the upside is you have an extraordinary boost – in some cases they are offering 100% of revenue – but for how long we don’t know. But in this case, you are essentially giving them your future.” Two years ago the warning might have seemed a little extreme – but now it feels like a premonition, as it’s almost exactly how it has played out. For while The Guardian has pulled out of Facebook Instant Articles, and The Australian has quit Apple News – that doesn’t mean the reader is instantly going to return to the news site or start using a new app in order to continue consuming that content. Just like when publishers threw up websites and didn’t think about charging for content, there was no apparent long-term plan in place for how utilising these platforms might change or impact reader habits. And readers most surely have formed habits, or expectations at the very least. When it comes to Facebook, publishers can still share content on the platform that links back to their own site, however, loading speeds may irk audiences used to the faster times of Instant Articles. It doesn’t feel surprising that this tryst with Facebook and Apple has burnt publishers. The sting will continue to be felt as publishers attempt to unwind the Faustian pact they entered around two years ago. It’s going to be hard to convince audiences to start accessing a new app or waiting while web pages, loaded up with ad inventory, slowly load. Audiences want fast-loading content, they want to be able to access it directly out of their social network feeds, they want to be able to read a variety of content uninhibited by advertising (I’m looking at you, pop-ups) and ultimately, a lot of them, want it to be free. Two years ago, publishers were warned about handing their future over to the tech giants like Facebook, Apple and Google. If two years ago publishers had started to invest in building their own platforms or means of delivering content to audiences in a fast, reliable way in the environments they are inhabiting online (yes, Facebook is one of them), then perhaps we’d be further along this path. Handing all control over to the likes of Facebook and Apple and even Google in the hopes they’ll solve the problems plaguing the news industry was ridiculously optimistic but reflective of this industry’s habit of quickly pouncing on the new shiny thing that will supposedly fix everything. I’m not saying I have all the answers to the continuing problem of distribution and monetisation. But I am arguing for the need to think long-term, and even to think negative – what will happen to our brand and our audience if this isn’t the answer? Publishers should not act surprised that it’s not as simple as quitting Instant Articles or Apple News. Audiences will do as they have always done – whatever they want – and you can’t expect them to shift to old habits because it didn’t work for you, the company. Facebook and Apple don’t care about publishers backing away for a reason – because they now have captured your audience and can start giving them what they want in their own environment. They don’t need the publisher now they’ve trained the audience to come to them for content Publishers are going to have to work hard to get those audiences back on their own platforms. This is what they should have been thinking about before rushing in desperately to sign a deal blinded by the potential dollar signs. Deal with the Devil? Faustus offered to burn his books when his final hour fell upon him and Lucifer came. What will publishers offer Facebook and Apple when it arrives for them in the years to come?

Reply Glen 2 May 17 I think this is unfairly critical of publishers. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with new distribution channels and for some this has no doubt tapped into new audiences and generated brand awareness. I also don’t think it’s fair to assume that publishers were not investing in building their own platforms while at the same time seeing if the offerings from FB and Apple could provide audience growth and new revenue streams. Reply minnie 2 May 17 I agree @Glen –with some exceptions, most publishers have experimented quite cautiously and sensibly with Facebook IA and Google News, by publishing a subset of their content on these platforms to understand the impact on audience and revenues. The fact that numerous publishers (including some of their original launch partners, such as New York Times) are now pulling out simply reflects that for them, the experiment didn’t work. But the only way for them to know this was to try it. IMO publishers can and should keep experimenting — some of them will work, some won’t. But doing nothing is not an option.

Now users will get a notification when the program is trying to install. However, be cautious as Gatekeeper is not infallible. From a security standpoint, Apple computers are relatively safe from viruses and other malware. However, they are not immune. Researchers at the IT security company Check Point Software Technologies have discovered a new malware that targets Mac OS. The malware called OSX/Dok can infect all versions of Mac OS and is new enough that no virus definitions exist for it at the time of this writing. It is particularly sneaky because it uses a valid developer certificate to get around Gatekeeper, Mac’s internal security measure that will prevent an unsigned app from running without permission. Dok’s only real weakness is its vector into a system. The malware relies on users falling for a phishing scam. An example provided by Check Point showed an email to a German user notifying him of an error on his tax returns. The email contains a document that reportedly has a series of questions and the telephone number of the tax professional, but the file is actually the malware. "The lesson here is one that is taught over and over by many IT professionals: Do not open attachments from anyone unless you are already expecting that attachment and know what is in it." “The malware bundle is contained in a .zip archive named Dokument.zip. It was signed on April 21th, 2017 by a “Seven Muller” and the bundle name is Truesteer.AppStore,” states the IT security firm. Once in the malware takes several steps culminating in a popup that forces the user to enter their password and thus granting the app root privileges. The popup cannot be closed, and no other windows are accessible until the password is entered. Once the malware has root access, it takes several more steps autonomously in the background and ultimately gains access to all of the victim's communication including traffic encrypted by SSL. The software redirects traffic through a malicious proxy server so the hackers can use a “Man in The Middle” attack to impersonate any website without the victim knowing. It is a very damaging and dangerous trojan if it gets in, but again, one must fall for the phishing scheme first. Fortunately, iMore has published steps for removing Dok should one become infected. The lesson here is one that is taught over and over by many IT professionals: Do not open attachments from anyone unless you are already expecting that attachment and know what is in it.

The conference, however, came and went without the Siri-powered device making an appearance. With this year’s WWDC just around the bend, we’re again hearing rumors on the subject – this time painting an even more vivid image of what we may see next month. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note to investors on Monday that he believes the Siri speaker will be a high-end affair with a subwoofer and seven tweeters. The analyst also thinks it’ll be powered by a custom ARM processor that’s at least as powerful as Apple’s A8 CPU from the iPhone 6. The W1 Bluetooth chip (the one that powers Apple's wireless AirPods) will be prominently featured in the home assistant as well, Kuo indicated, as will its AirPlay streaming technology. Apple may also top Amazon in the hardware design category. Kuo believes there’s a better than 50 percent chance that Apple will announce the device at WWDC ahead of a launch in the second half of this year. No word yet on how much the speaker might retail for but just for reference, Amazon’s Echo goes for $179.99, the smaller Echo Dot is $49.99 and Google Home currently commands $114.

Is Apple Watch A Dead Platform Walking? Anthony Caruana May 2, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  apple apple watch Australian Stories enterprise software video feature Share When the Apple Watch was released a couple of years ago, it signalled a further step Apple was taking to ingratiate themselves into every aspect of our increasingly digital lifestyle and workplace. The closest parallel I can think of is the iPad. When it was released many, including me, questioned Apple's strategy as it looked a lot like a solution looking for a problem to solve. But it spawned a massive market that was followed by Android devices and, ultimately, the Microsoft Surface and a new way to think about mobile computing. The Apple Watch seemed to be a similar play but it's not working out the same way. I'm an Apple Watch owner. I purchased mine at full price from a Nike store in Las Vegas - it's not a corporate freebie or "long-term review unit". It's not a perfect device but it serves the purposes I bought it for. I can easily check my calendar, get alerts for things that are important for me (once I tuned the notifications to how I like them and not the defaults of everything sending alerts), and when I'm exercising (I use RunKeeper and FitList for running and strength training). But business apps, that are useful, are thin on the ground and getting even skinnier. Slashgear reports that a number of large companies have been quietly dropping watchOS support from their apps. Google, Amazon, Target and eBay have done that. So, while the number of health and fitness apps seems to be growing - the inclusion of an integrated GPS/GLONASS receiver and waterproofing gave that sector a massive boost - enterprise and other business apps seem to be waning. What's in the Apple Watch for business users? Once you get past calendar apps and notifications the number of business functions you can actually execute on the Apple Watch are quite limited. Messaging is useful - I like being able to quickly reply to texts and IMs from Messenger, HipChat and Slack either using canned responses or by using the "Scribble" function to quickly write a response on the screen. And being able to check my schedule is really handy. Some apps, such as Xero, let you do business stuff on the Apple Watch so the potential is there. Similarly, when IBM announced their partnership with Apple a couple of years ago, one of the things they focussed on was watch apps. But when I talk to businesses, they just don't see the Apple Watch, or other smartwatch platforms, as particularly valuable. When the iPhone and iPad were introduced, they changed the way people interacted with computers. And while iOS, and indeed all mobile platforms, require compromises in terms of what we can do the Apple Watch is very limited. It's a competent data display device, within the constraints of its small display, but you can't really do anything that will change how you conduct business with it. Where will the Apple Watch be in 2020? Apple is playing the long game with the Apple Watch. With about $250B sloshing around in their various bank accounts around the world, they can be patient. And they can invest in developing the platform to give more to business users. When the iPhone was introduced it was a very limited device. But six months or so after its release, the App Store followed and it gained massive consumer appeal. Then it infiltrated businesses, quickly usurping the market leaders of the time, Microsoft with Windows Mobile and BlackBerry. My suspicion is Apple is planning a similar strategy. Start by building the consumer market - partnerships with Nike and Hermes help with that - and then enter the enterprise by stealth. Once there's a critical mass of business users wanting access to corporate data and systems on the Apple Watch, they expect enterprise developers to follow suit. For that reason, I expect the Apple Watch to slowly grow as a business device. Unlike the iPhone which solved a bunch of usability problems (who remembers having to manually fiddle with connection settlings when you moved from home to work to cellular connections?), the Apple Watch doesn't solve any problems. But for developers, it's a platform that gives them an opportunity to try new things. What do you think? Is the Apple Watch a waste of time and money? Or will it, slowly, evolve into a viable platform for business users? Also on Lifehacker Is It Cheaper To Buy A Samsung Galaxy S8 On A Plan Than An iPhone 7?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Stealthy Mac malware spies on encrypted browser traffic Lucian Constantin 2 May, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments Security A new malware program that targets macOS users is capable of spying on encrypted browser traffic to steal sensitive information. The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point SoftwareTechnologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. What makes OSX/Dok interesting is that it was digitally signed with a valid Apple developer certificate. These certificates are issued by Apple to members of its developer program and are needed to publish applications in the official Mac App Store. Applications signed with an Apple-issued developer certificate can also be installed on the latest versions of macOS without triggering security errors or requiring manual overrides, so it’s not hard to see why this would be valuable to a malware program. It’s not clear if Dok’s creators paid to obtain a developer certificate by joining Apple’s developer program with a fake identity or if they stole the certificate from a legitimate developer. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system’s network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers and located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that’s started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user’s browser now encrypted, it’s not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targeting macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies. “We have been and still are in direct contact with Apple [employees] who are very helpful and responsive,” Yaniv Balmas, Check Point’s malware research team leader, said via email. “With Apple’s cooperation, we believe this specific campaign is now futile and does no longer pose any threat to Mac users.” Check Point is looking for related attack campaigns and other possible variants of this malware that might have remained undiscovered until now. “The best way to avoid being infected with this and similar type of malware is to stay alert while opening emails and files from untrusted or unknown sources,” Balmas said.

Purchased in June, 2007, at a time when most of the suburb still relied on bore and tank water, the property, much like the family itself, has grown into a solid family oasis and part-time chicken and goat hobby farm. With the owners running a successful restaurant in the city and Mr Birbeck’s knee injury hindering the upkeep of the land, the spacious five-acre (about 2ha) property is back on the market with offers invited over $550,000. 16 Apple Flat Road, Alligator Creek “We absolutely loved living there and raising our kids, but with us running a restaurant in town and my husband having undergone a knee operation last year, we just don’t have the time to maintain the property,” Mrs Birbeck said. “The reason we bought the property is because my husband is a police officer and likes the peace and quiet and the fact you don’t have any neighbours. “My son also rides motorbikes and having a ­ 13- year-old riding through suburbia is not really what you want so being out here allowed us to have a real lifestyle. “Personally I always loved the drive home. With the sun behind you it’s a really relaxing drive, yet you’re only 10 to 15 minutes from Fairfield and the CBD.” 16 Apple Flat Road, Alligator Creek While the family loved spending time outside, Mrs Birbeck said the heart of the property was the modern family home. Designed for a growing family, the home offers all the privacy, quiet and seclusion with extras you have been searching for and can’t find. There’s abundant space in three bedrooms and a master with ensuite, a kitchen with butler’s pantry, open-plan living plus extra rumpus room and outdoor entertainment patio. As you would expect from a property this size, there’s plenty of room to store the toys in a six-bay shed and four-car accommodation. If Townsville’s water security plays heavily on your mind, you will love the fact the property will never have to rely on town water. 16 Apple Flat Road, Alligator Creek “When we first moved here, all we had was bore and tank water,” Mrs Birbeck said. “Town water was only connected to properties in Alligator Creek the following March we moved here so now we have it all. “So I guess you could say we’re water secure.” But the sustainable features of this home don’t stop there, with a 6kW solar system installed on site. There’s also a 6.5kW generator with connecting power to the house as well as chicken and goat enclosures should buyers wish to start their own little hobby farm. 16 Apple Flat Road, Alligator Creek “Both of our kids learned to drive out there and getting log book hours up was extremely simple,” Mrs Birbeck said. “If it wasn’t for work and Simon’s knee, we probably wouldn’t move as we did buy the property for the lifestyle it offered.” Follow us on Twitter for more news, tips and inspiration.

Skip to main content Toggle navigation Dowser Windows Errors Fixes and Guides DLLs Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” Removal May 1, 2017 DanielS Virus Removals Scan your PC for free with SpyHunter to detect all parasite related files. Click here to download. Welcome to our Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” removal guide. The following instructions will aid you in removing the unwanted software from your PC. Browser hijackers certainly aren’t among the most desirable pieces of software out there. In fact, their presence can sometimes startle users and cause panic, because most times – it’s never expected. Today we’ll be describing the behavioral patterns of a certain representative of this particular software category – Apple-kungfu.com “Virus”. We’re guess that you’ve found your way to our page due to an infection with this exact program. And we can’t blame you if its appearance startled you, as well. All the typical changes that your Chrome, Firefox, Edge or other browser undergoes as a result of Apple-kungfu.com “Virus”’s integration with it can certainly come as a surprise. Just like many other users, you probably opened your browser to find that the familiar homepage has been replaced with a new one and your search requests are now being redirected by a new default search engine to various ads and sponsored pages. Well, not to worry, because here we will show you just the thing to fix this situation and remove all the undesired changes. Our detailed removal guide will provide all the necessary instructions, but do finish reading this article before you head down to the guide. What is a browser hijacker and what does it want from me? Well, let’s start with the second part of the question: frankly, it’s after your clicks. Nothing more, nothing less. You see, programs of this type serve the purposes of the online marketing industry and by that we mean that their primary objective is advertising and promoting various products and services. You’ve no doubt noticed the numerous popups, banners and box messages that constantly accompany your web surfing, no matter the pages you’re on. In a sense, this is the result of a very popular business model known as Pay Per Click, which ensures that the developers of programs like Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” get paid based on the number of times the respective ads get clicked on by users such as yourself. And with this model comes certain behavioral traits that are often the reason why browser hijackers are commonly seen as potentially unwanted programs or PUPs. By that we first mean the sheer aggression, with which the said ads tend to be displayed. You may have yourself sometimes found it difficult to avoid all the annoying popups and banners. But there’s also a more sinister side to this. Programs like Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” have a reputation for prying into your browser history records and extract information related to your latest search requests and the kind of websites you visit. All of this is done so the program in question may try and determine where your interests lie and therefore what products and services are more likely to attract your attention. Thus, the ad flow is typically tailored to each separate user’s preferences with the intention of increasing the number of potential clicks. Is Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” a virus? Can it cause any damage? Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” is most certainly not a virus, despite the rather negative impression that it can make. In that sense, it’s also incapable of inflicting any actual harm to either you or your machine. Nevertheless, as we already mentioned, these programs are often considered PUPs, and that’s not the type of software you’d want to let your guard down with. That much said, we think it’s important to be aware of the potential risks that browser hijackers may pose. Firstly, it’s very possible that a program like this may very soon have a negative impact on your PC’s productivity. As a result, your system may start running slower, you might start experiencing various malfunctions, such as browser and even system crashes. Surely an unwanted effect, wouldn’t you agree? What’s more, the numerous ads that you are exposed to on a daily basis could potentially hide very serious danger. With the rise of viruses like ransomware, online ads have become the distribution method of choice among hackers and cyber criminals. They are usually referred to as malvertisements, once they have been injected with the harmful script of some malware. After this, one click is typically enough for the infection to take place. What’s scary is that you may not even realize what’s happened until it’s already far too late. With this in mind, it’s our duty to warn users against interacting with any kind of online ads and as a step towards better protection, it’s simply best to remove the source of most of them. In this case that would be Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” and below is a very effective guide that will show you how to do that. Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” Removal I – Safe mode and revealing hidden files Boot your PC into Safe Mode /link/ Reveal hidden files and folders /link/ II – Uninstallation For maximum efficiency, we firmly advise you to download SpyHunter. Use its scanner together with our removal guide to quickly find parasite. Click here to download Use the Winkey+R keyboard combination, write Control Panel in the search field and hit enter. Go to Uninstall a program under Programs. Seek the unwanted software, select it and then click on Uninstall If you are unable to spot Apple-kungfu.com “Virus”, search for any unrecognized programs that you do not remember installing on your PC – the unwanted software might disguise itself by going under a different name. III – Cleaning all your browsers Go to your browser’s icon, right-click on it and select Properties. Go to the Shortcut tab and in the Target make sure to delete anything written after “.exe”. Now, open your browser and follow the instructions below depending on whether you are using Chrome, Mozilla or IE. Chrome users: Go to your browser’s main menu located in the top-right corner of the screen and select Settings. Scroll down, click on Show Advanced Settings and then select Clear browsing data. Just to be sure, tick everything and clear the data. Now, in the left pane, go to Extensions and look through all extensions that are integrated within your browser. If you notice any suspicious add-on, disable it and then remove it. Firefox users: Similarly to Chrome, go to the main menu and select Add-ons and then Extensions. Remove any suspicious browser extensions that you may have even if they do not have the name Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” on them. IE users: Go to Tools and select Manage add-ons. Click on all add-on types from the left pane and check if there is anything suspicious in the right panel. In case you find anything shade, make sure to remove it. IV – Removing Shady processes Avoid ever falling in this situation again by downloading SpyHunter– a certified malware removal program that can protect you from threats like parasite. Go to your start menu, type Task Manager in the search field and from the results open View running processes with Task Manager. Thoroughly look through all processes. The name Apple-kungfu.com “Virus” might not be there, but if you notice any shady looking process that consumes high amounts of memory it might be ran by the unwanted program.

The store at Knightsbridge mall in Orchard Road, which reportedly spans five storefronts and will occupy four storeys, has been cloaked in Apple's usual veil of secrecy. According to an April 28 report in CNBC, however, there is finally hope for Apple fans. The report, citing sources, said the project had been plagued by construction-related problems, including a conflict with a neighbouring hotel - the Grand Park Orchard - over "logistical and infrastructure issues". A hotel spokesman told CNBC she could not comment on the matter. There was also a stop work order issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to a contractor, interior fit-out specialist Legend Interiors, at the store's worksite (270 Orchard Road) on Oct 24 last year.   13_40557150_-_15_11_2016_-_lhapple.jpg Related Story Singapore Apple Store opening likely delayed till early 2017, missing Christmas season   st_20151116_vnitapple_1840399.jpg Related Story Apple plugs into solar power in Singapore The order was lifted on Nov 16, with MOM saying in a statement to CNBC that it was issued "for unsafe conditions relating to work at height, traffic management, scaffolding, electrical installation and lifting operations that were observed during an inspection at the worksite". When approached for comment, Apple's head of corporate communications for South-east Asia and India Katrina Tan told CNBC that there were no delays or friction with the project, and that it was "proceeding as planned". She also noted that Apple had never given a date for the store's opening. CNBC visited the site last Thursday (April 27) and spoke to a worker there, who claimed that the store would open on May 22. News of the store first broke in October 2015, after a former tenant of the mall, fitness club Pure Fitness, sent a letter to its members informing them of its closure to make room. Construction work began in May the following year (2016), with an information board displayed outside first showing an expected completion date of Oct 31. The date was subsequently changed to Jan 30 this year before it was removed completely.

Casey | May 1, 2017 11:04 am MORE OSX/Dok is the latest sophisticated piece of spyware to target MacBooks and other macOS machines, and it hit systems quite quickly by exploiting a security flaw in the desktop operating system. That flaw? The fact that a legitimate Apple developer's certificate, which you can get for $99 straight from Apple, will bypass Gatekeeper, the operating system's first line of defense. Image: Jeremy Lips/Laptop OSX/Dok's distributors used the age-old tactic of targeting victims with a email attachment, which in this case contained malware that was signed with a legitimate Apple Developer Certificate. With that certificate, OSX/Dok could casually walk past macOS's Gatekeeper security like it owned the place, trick the user into giving it admin rights, then proceed to spy on the user's encrypted communications, including Gmail and online financial transactions. MORE: Best Antivirus Protection for PC, Mac and Android The malware, according to a blog post late last week by the Israeli security firm Check Point, comes bundled into an email attachment dubbed "Dokument.zip" attached to German-language emails claiming to be from Swiss government agencies inquiring about tax-return inconsistencies. Once a user opens said ZIP file, the malware copies itself to the Users/Shared directory, then deletes the original copy in the Downloads directory. It then alerts the user with a fake error message claiming that the system can't open the Dokument file, and nags the user to enter his or her administrative credentials to install a system update. It won't let the user close the nag window until he or she relents. Of course, providing OSX/Dok with admin credentials simply supercharges its abilities and allows the malware to execute high-level processes in the background, essentially owning your system. Once it does so, OSX/Dok installs a Tor client and re-routes your web traffic through a proxy server, It even uses a (presumably stolen) web-security certificate to decrypt secure communications, then re-encrypt them on route so that the HTTPS padlock icon stays in place and the user is none the wiser. By performing that man-in-the-middle attack, OSX/Dok might be able to read your Gmail and Facebook postings, or even steal information about online purchases or online bank accounts. MacWorld's Glenn Fleishman reported today (May 1) that Apple has revoked the developer certificate used by OSX/Dok. Gatekeeper should now block the malware if you leave it on its default settings, but it wouldn't take much of an update to OSX/Dok to try to trick the user into temporarily disabling Gatekeeper. So, what can you do? First off, just because you have a Mac doesn't mean you don't need antivirus software. Here are our favorite picks for macOS machines. As always, we advise users to never open up email attachments they are not 100 percent certain about.

You also failed to mention NEVER EVER enter admin credentials unless you are performing an install or update from a known developer or Apple and NEVER from a web site or email enclosure. You also give no evidence any anti-virus software would have stopped this before Apple did. More FUD! BTW users! Neither Apple, nor a legitimate software vendor, will force you to enter admin privileges. If that happens simply press your power button down until your machine restarts...something else the author could have pointed out. doug p.

Whatever the reason, here's how to get your entire digital life from Android to iOS with as little head-scratching as possible. Image: Gizmodo For simplicity's sake, we'll assume you're set up on Android with your data plugged into Google's services (Gmail, Google Calendar and so on). If you're using something else, like a Microsoft or Yahoo email address, the process will be similar, and often just involves installing the relevant Android-analogous app on your new iPhone. We should also point out that a future Field Guide will talk about moving in the opposite direction, so watch this space for that. Apple's Move to iOS app Move to iOS has its merits... if you can get it to work. (Image: Screenshot) You can automate much of what we're about to talk about with Apple's official Move to iOS app for Android: it handles email, calendars, contacts, photos, videos (taken with the device), and even text message history. There are a couple of caveats to consider. One, you need to be setting up your iPhone from scratch, so it needs to be brand new or freshly reset, and two, it doesn't give you all that much control over the way everything gets switched. It also misses out some of the files and data we're going to cover below, and as you'll note in reviews of the app, it can be hit and miss on actually transferring texts. Moving texts SMS Backup+ can send your texts to Gmail. (Image: Screenshot) Moving SMSes is tricky — Move to iOS is in theory one of the cleanest options, as we've mentioned, but you need to be setting your iPhone up from scratch, and users report mixed results in transferring SMS history right into iOS Messages. We tried several times to get the app to work on our devices and had to give up as it refused to make a wireless connection, but your mileage may vary. Backing up an archive of your Android texts isn't too difficult: SMS Backup+ will send them all to Gmail for you, and SMS Backup & Restore can back them up to Google Drive or Dropbox too. A variety of third-party Windows and macOS apps promise to do the job for you as well, but we'd be wary of installing anything unofficial unless it's been around for a long time, is regular updated, and has a long list of positive user reviews. We can't vouch for the security or reliability of any of them, except for SMS Backup+, which we've been using without any problems for years, and SMS Backup & Restore, which comes from a very reputable software developer. Unless you can get Move to iOS to work better than we did, replicating an exact copy of your Android SMS history in Messages looks almost impossible — at best you can get some kind of archive exported for future reference. It's a different story with other instant messaging apps, which we'll come on to later. Moving emails If you want to keep your Google accounts active, they integrate neatly with iOS. (Image: Screenshot) If you want to take your Gmail account with you over to iOS, you've got two options: install the Gmail app for Apple devices, or add your Gmail account to the default Mail app on iOS. The first one is easier but the second helps you cut ties with Google more quickly. First, you need to prepare your Gmail account for the great export. Open the Settings tab on the web (click the cog icon then Settings), switch to the Forwarding and POP/IMAP section, and enable either POP for all emails or IMAP. Are you going to carry on using your Gmail account? Then use IMAP, which gives you two-way access to your Gmail inbox from Apple's Mail app. Do you just want to download your old Google messages and never look back? Go for POP, which will download all your emails. With that done, open up Settings in iOS, choose Mail, then tap Accounts and Add Account. Choose Google if you're taking the IMAP approach, then follow the instructions on screen to sign into your Gmail; choose Other if you're using POP, in which case you'll need these details to configure access. Moving contacts and calendars  iCloud can accept contacts but not calendars. (Image: Screenshot) You can move your Google (Android) contacts and calendars over to iOS very easily: open Settings on your iPhone, tap Contacts (or Calendar), then choose Accounts. Choose Add Account and Google, or pick the existing Google entry from the list, then log in with your Google credentials to get everything synced over. That then keeps your Google Contacts and Google Calendars in sync with the native Contacts and Calendar apps on iOS (and macOS) — but perhaps that's not what you want. If you'd rather forget the syncing aspect and just move your Google data over in a one-time operation, it's a bit more involved and needs a manual export and import: it's messier, but it does mean you can get everything natively inside Apple's apps and leave Google behind. First you export your Google contacts to a .vcf file from the Contacts app on Android (in Settings on the app menu) or via Google Contacts on the web. Select all your contacts then pick More to find the Export link. That .vcf file can then be imported through iCloud on the web or emailed to your iPhone — once you tap on the attachment, you'll be asked if you want to import the contacts. It's a similar process with Google Calendar. Here you need to visit the web interface, then export your schedules by clicking the cog icon, Settings, Calendars and Export Calendars. The files you've created can't be imported into iCloud though — you need to add them in the Calendar app in macOS to sync them to an iPhone via iCloud. If you don't have a macOS machine on hand, you're pretty much stuck with entering your birthdays and appointments all over again, unless you're happy with just using Google Calendar for iOS or trying Move to iOS for Android with the caveats we mentioned earlier. Moving photos and videos Google Photos is the most obvious option for photos and videos. (Image: Screenshot) This can be incredibly straightforward or rather messy depending on how you want to do it and where your photos and videos are stored. Assuming you're taking advantage of Google Photos, the native photo manager for (stock) Android, you can simply install the iOS version to get at your whole library pictures and movies (and to upload anything you take on your new iPhone). You go to Settings then Back up & sync and Back up device folders to make sure you've got absolutely everything copied off your phone and up to the cloud. Even if you're abandoning Google services completely, this option will show you all the different folders on your Android device where pictures are stored. If you want to get everything moved, pixel-by-pixel, from Google Photos to Apple's iCloud Photo Library, more effort is required: we've actually done a complete guide to this in the past. Refer to that article for full details, but in summary you need to use Google Drive or Google Takeout to get hard copies of your photos and videos downloaded to a macOS or Windows machine. From there you can import them into Photos for macOS, iTunes on Windows, or iCloud on the web, and from there over to an iPhone. If you don't use Google Photos, you need some other method for getting all your Android photos and videos to a computer, and from there to Apple Photos and iCloud. Dropbox will do it, for example, or you can use the tried and trusted USB cable method. Just be sure that you've harvested all the files from all your apps — apps like Twitter and WhatsApp save photos in a different location to the main gallery, for example. Moving music and movies Importing files to iTunes is one way to get them on iOS. Image: Screenshot Android being Android, you might have your music and movies on your phone in all kinds of ways: Netflix, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV, and so on. Just about any video or music app you have installed on Android will be on iOS as well, including those we just mentioned — a lot of the time there are no files to transfer, just logins to manage. Any local files you've got queued up on Android should work just fine on iOS too. You don't have to use Apple's own music and video apps if you don't want, but if you do then you need to get your local files off your Android device and into iTunes with the help of a macOS or Windows machine. Presumably a lot of the files on your Android device were synced from a computer in the first place, but if not they can be transferred via USB or an app like Dropbox, as with your personal photos and videos. Then from iTunes, choose File and Add to Library (macOS) or Add File to Library (Windows) to import the media. If you run into file format problems we'd recommend using Handbrake to solve them. If you're heavily invested in purchases from Google Play Movies & TV, there is an iOS version. Image: Screenshot iOS is more restrictive when it comes to syncing music and movies to your phone, and if you don't want to go through iTunes, you need to use an app that can pull files straight from the cloud or over a Wi-Fi network rather than relying on local storage: the likes of Plex, Spotify and VLC will all do the job. If you aren't cutting the Google cord completely, Google Drive is another good option for watching video on iOS without having to actually transfer any files, because you can stream files straight from the cloud. It's when you're switching between mobile OSes that these device-agnostic apps and platforms really come into their own. In short, you've got plenty of choices for apps that will play your local, unrestricted, DRM-free music and movie files on iOS, while any digital library app you've been using on Android will have an equivalent on iOS, so there's no real problem there either. Moving apps and games You can't easily transfer WhatsApp chats, though you can email them to yourself. (Image: Screenshot) There's no way around the fact that you need to get all your Android apps installed again on iOS, and pay twice in some cases. Though subscription services like Netflix and Spotify just switch straight over (moving between devices is another good reason to live your digital life in the cloud). Most social media and messaging apps will take everything from Android to iOS for you, though there are exceptions, with WhatsApp being one of the big ones. Unfortunately, WhatsApp's own backup and restore function only works when you're going from Android-to-Android or iPhone-to-iPhone. As with text messages, various third-party options are available, but we can't vouch for any in particular. If you're happy just having a record of your WhatsApp chats and are ready to start afresh on iPhone, you can email them to yourself. From the WhatsApp Settings screen, tap Chats, then Chat history, and Email chat: you can then pick your conversations one by one and email yourself a copy, with or without attached media. Boom Beach is one game where you can link devices. (Image: Screenshot) We can't go through every messaging app in detail here but obviously your switch is going to be easier with those apps that store everything in the cloud (hello Google Hangouts). Virtually every instant messenger on Android has an iOS equivalent so it's a question of exploring the import and export options — you may just have to start again with a blank message history on iOS. Another area where you might have trouble is with your saved games and high scores: not only will you need to pay for all your games again, you're probably going to lose your progress too. Some apps, like Subway Surfers (with Facebook) and Boom Beach (with a code), will let you transfer progress and scores between devices, but again you'll have to do the research every game you own to be sure. If you can't find the answers you're looking for out on the web then contact the developer directly and see if there's any way for getting your saved games from one platform to the other. The same goes for other types of app if you can't see an obvious way of moving data between Android and iOS installs. Moving yet more files and data Use a file explorer to look for data you've missed. Image: Screenshot We're not quite done yet! You might want to be as comprehensive as possible in your data switchover — think about any documents or spreadsheets you've got stored on your Android device. Most productivity apps will store these in the cloud, so getting at them from iOS should be simple, but it's wise to double-check. The vast majority of Android apps can be found on iOS, with the only exceptions being advanced customisation tools such as Tasker or the Android launchers, which you're just going to have to live without in iPhone-land. Other apps should have iPhone equivalents and some kind of mechanism for switching files over — if you're worried about something getting left behind, use a file manager like Solid Explorer for a deeper look. One of the folders to check is the Downloads folder, which brings us to our final section. Web Browsing If you've got Chrome on Android syncing everything like passwords and bookmarks back to the cloud, you can simply install Chrome on iOS and get on with your life, but if you're determined to use Safari on your new iPhone then you need to jump through a few more hoops. Chrome for iOS will take all your passwords and browsing history with you. Image: Screenshot The aforementioned Move to iOS is one option for your web bookmarks, or you can set up synced versions of Chrome and Safari on macOS and use the respective export and import tools to get everything moved over (and from there to your iPhone). If neither of those options appeal, you're going to have to start from scratch, and the same goes for stored passwords and browsing history (you can at least access your saved Chrome passwords from this page on the web to ease the process of switching over). These elements are just too deeply integrated into Chrome to get them easily over to Safari, so embrace the chance to start afresh. It may not be possible, but ideally you want to keep your Android and iOS devices running alongside each other for a while: it makes it easier to check up on gaps in your transferred data, like browsing history, and helps you spot anything you might have missed (such as a PDF file that's fallen through the cracks). Comments Dr_Stef Guest May 2, 2017, 10:30am What about the other way round? I love the look of that new S8, plus Apple isn't really doing it for me anymore Reply 4 Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja May 2, 2017, 11:38am just google it. as far as i know, when you set up newer samsung phones now there is software built in to tell it you are transferring over from ios. dont quote me on that, but its definitely easier to go from apple to android then it is to go from android over to apple (only God knows why you would do that) Reply 3 soldant @soldant May 2, 2017, 2:12pm They've done loads of articles on this before. Reply 0 Almost Guest May 2, 2017, 12:37pm Given the progress in mobile phones means that the differences between them in functionality these days is more or less moot I tend towards ownership and control of my own data. Which is why I'm using Android. I wonder if it'll mimic the PC history where Apple was clearly better and then everyone else caught up and then charged 75% less. Reply 1 On the other hand . . . Guest May 2, 2017, 1:32pm "I tend towards ownership and control of my own data. Which is why I'm using Android."

Seriously though, unless you actually own all apple devices and have that interconnectivity between them, you really have no idea what you're talking about. Reply 0 boxhead72 Guest May 2, 2017, 3:42pm Actually he does. iOS does have malware, what are self installing coin slot icons, never heard of that, no spam messages etc. If you are stupid enough to download from unknown untrusted sources then you are to blame. Unless you are open to using your own brain and not being a sheep then you really have no idea what you are talking about. Reply 0 domainman Guest May 2, 2017, 4:07pm That first point is a lie that Apple keeps pushing with their propaganda machine. Their marketing is just that good. Every OS has malware. Windows, Apple, Linux... they all do. It's just a matter of how it gets executed on your device. A lot of things these days are through social engineering, so it doesn't matter which platform you're on. Yes, there is a lower chance of you installing something suspect through iTunes store compared to the Play Store, but in no way is iOS malware-free. Reply 0 hamish77 @hamish77 May 2, 2017, 4:32pm lower chance? lol. Never had a single issue, not one, on any of my multiple apple devices or 2 imacs and none of it has any virus protection whatsoever for five years now. So whilst I know it's not impossible, it's VERY unlikely. Can't say the same for my GS5 (work phone) or 2 PC's at home. Reply 0 Zeugma Guest May 2, 2017, 4:06pm Why.. Why would you! Why would you want to move from a proper operating system that lets you do what YOU want, and do actual real work, to a child's operation system in which nanny Apple tell you what you can or can't do.

Apple’s Services segment currently generates less than one third of the amount of revenue produced by iPhone sales. But analysts quoted by The Street online news service say the business could serve as a means for Apple to diversify its revenue away from being solely hardware-driven and toward subscription-based sales. The Street quotes Loup Venture analyst Gene Munster, who has observed Apple for many years, as saying the company’s iCloud and Apple Music services could help pave the way. “[Services is] their future wheelhouse,” Munster said. “It’s twice as profitable as their hardware business and it’s predictable, unlike hardware.”  Other Apple Services operations include App Store, iTunes and Apple Pay. Sales from the division jumped 18pc to $7.2 billion in Q1, and are expected to grow even more rapidly in the next four years, according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Online retailer Amazon.com stood out among consumer-focused companies as it picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

Because of competition from domestic brands the demand for Apple's new products in China is expected to wane. Ten years after Steve Jobs held up the original iPhone to a gushing San Francisco crowd, Apple is planning its most extensive iPhone lineup to date. For the redesigned phone, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials, and more advanced cameras, the sources said. Those anxiously awaiting the redesigned iPhone, however, may have to wait because supply constraints could mean the device isn’t readily available until one or two months after the typical autumn introduction. The iPhone is Apple’s most important product, representing about two-thirds of sales. It also leads customers to buy other Apple devices like the iPad and Apple Watch, and serves as a home for lucrative services like the App Store. This year’s new iPhone lineup comes at a critical time. Last year, Apple broke its typical upgrade cycle by retaining the same iPhone shape for a third year in a row and endured a rare sales slide. Samsung Electronics’ new S8 lineup has also been thus far well received after last year’s Note 7 battery debacle. For the premium model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device, according to people familiar with the matter. That results in a display slightly larger than that of the iPhone 7 Plus but an overall size closer to the iPhone 7, the sources said. Apple is also aiming to reduce the overall size of the handset by integrating the home button into the screen itself via software in a similar manner to Samsung’s S8, the sources said. The overhauled iPhone will use an organic light-emitting diode display that more accurately shows colours, while the other two phones will continue to use liquid crystal display technology and come in the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes as last year’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to people familiar with the matter. Apple’s iPhone feature and design plans are still in flux and can change, they added. The sources asked not to be identified discussing Apple’s private testing and design plans. For its redesigned phone, Apple has tested multiple prototypes with manufacturing partners in Asia, including versions that use curved glass and stainless steel. One of the latest prototype designs includes symmetrical, slightly curved glass on the front and the back. The curves are similar in shape to those on the front of the iPhone 7. The new OLED screen itself is flat, while the cover glass curves into a steel frame. The design is similar conceptually to the iPhone 4 from 2010. An earlier prototype design had a thinner steel band, leaving more noticeable curved glass on the sides. Apple also tested a more ambitious prototype with the same slightly curved front and steel frame, but a glass back with more dramatic curves on the top and bottom like the original iPhone design from 2007, one of the sources said. Apple suppliers have so far struggled to reliably produce heavily curved glass in mass quantities, so the company is more likely to ship the version with more subdued curves, the source added. The company is also testing a simpler design that has an aluminium back, rather than a glass one, and slightly larger dimensions, one of the sources said. Because of its early lead in the mobile OLED display space, Samsung will enjoy a rare upper hand in this year’s high-end smartphone contest. At launch, Apple will exclusively use Samsung Display OLED panels for the redesigned iPhone, as other suppliers won’t be ready to supply mass quantities until later, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple has ordered around 100m panels from Samsung, the sources said. “This fall, it would be three years since we had a remarkable shift in iPhone hardware. This raises expectations for this year’s phone having a material change in functionality and look,” said Gene Munster, co-founder of Loup Ventures and a veteran Apple analyst. “The Samsung Galaxy S8 raises the bar for Apple to hit a home run.” Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone’s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version, which would be technically challenging, the sources said. It’s currently unclear if that feature will make it into the final product. Samsung also tried this approach for the S8, but ended up installing a more standard fingerprint reader on the back of its phone due to the challenges, another source said. Significant camera changes are also in testing for Apple’s overhauled iPhone. For the back of the phone, Apple is testing versions of the phone with the dual-camera system positioned vertically, instead of horizontally like on the iPhone 7 Plus, which could result in improved photos, according to people familiar with the matter. Some prototypes in testing continue to include the slight camera bump found on current iPhones, rather than having them flush with the back surface, the sources said. For the front-camera, Apple is testing dual-lenses, one of the sources said. The current iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have single front cameras. As it has done in the past, Apple is using camera components from Sony, the source added. Apple has explored adding augmented reality-based features and depth-of-field enhancements to its iPhone camera system, Bloomberg News reported earlier this year. Company engineers in the past have also experimented with integrating cameras into screens, another source said. All the new iPhones will run iOS 11, a mobile operating system that will include a refreshed user-interface and will be announced in June at the company’s annual conference for developers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple has been testing using faster processors based on a smaller 10-nanometer production process for all three new models, a person familiar with Apple’s chip plans said. That’s down from 16 nanometers for existing iPhones. The smaller processors are more efficient, allowing Apple to retain its battery life standards while adding more advanced features.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Apple introduced its Swift programming language a couple of years ago, and while we guess it is aimed more at developers, Apple has also explored the idea of targeting future potential developers through Swift Playgrounds, an app that teaches kids how to code. Now it looks like Apple is furthering their efforts through a partnership with Tynker. Tynker, for those unfamiliar, is a STEM education platform based in San Francisco. Both companies have come together and have released two game-based programming apps that are aimed towards children in a bid to make learning coding a fun experience. Coming in the form of Space Cadet and Dragon Spells, both apps are free to download. According to the description, “Space Cadet and Dragon Spells are introductory courses that teach programming fundamentals in a fun, engaging, and intuitive way, through 115 levels of coding puzzles and do-it-yourself projects. In Space Cadet, students in kindergarten through second grade solve puzzles and complete programming challenges set in space. In Dragon Spells, third through fifth grade students learn programming fundamentals as they train their dragon and collect treasures. In both courses, students learn through creative play as they solve puzzles, build projects, and animate characters.” While it is aimed at children, we suppose if you’re an adult with no background or experience in coding, these apps could also come in handy to grasp the basics of working through an algorithm to arrive at the desired result. The games are available via the Tynker app which you can grab from the iTunes App Store. Filed in Apple >General. Read more about Apps, education and iOS.

Mac users beware as researchers have found yet another reason to rattle the false sense of security some may have concerning Macs and viruses.   Checkpoint researchers spotted a Mac OSX malware, dubbed OSX/Dok that has been signed with an Apple signature and reads HTTPS traffic, Check Point lead researcher Ofer Caspi said in a 27 April blog post. It is unclear how the Apple signature got into the hands of the malware's developers and that the signature is the reason why the malware has been able to bypass some native Apple protections and malware could allow an attacker to intercept a victim's web communications and worse. The malware primarily targets European users, mainly in Germany and in Austria, and could allow an attacker to redirect victims to a remote proxy server controlled by its operator, where the attacker could steal banking credentials, hijack online accounts and leak sensitive information. The malware was spread via phishing campaigns and at the time the malware was detected and analysed, it was still floating under the radar of Apple and by other third party security products leading researchers said. The malware is bundled in a .zip file and upon execution copies itself onto the /Users/Shared/ folder, and will then proceed to execute itself from the new location by running shell commands, the post said. The malware then posts a fake message claiming the package is damaged and can't execute. The malware will then flash a series of false security screens until it displays a window on top of all the other screens that claims the users must enter their password to “update” the operating system. The users is barred from doing anything else until they enter the password and subsequently grant the malware administrative privileges. One of the contributing factors contributing to the campaign's success was users having a false sense of security, trusting the fact that Malware are the sole domain of Windows users, and that Apple native malware protections are bulletproof, Caspi told SC Media. “As with any other platform, whether it's Windows, Android or Linux, security always starts with the person using it,” he said. “The new cyber reality does not leave room for complacence, users should always use better judgment while they are using any platform and any operating system.” This article originally appeared at scmagazineuk.com Related Articles Hajime malware now has 300,000 strong botnet at disposal say researchers Two million Android devices 'hit by Google Play malware' Infiltrating air-gapped systems by transmitting light to a flatbed scanner IObit Malware Fighter 5 adds anti-ransomware engine, webcam protection Android Devices pre-loaded with malware signal fault in supply chain Source: Copyright © SC Magazine, UK edition See more about:  malware  |  osx   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   More in Operating Systems (1 of 10 articles) NEWS OSX malware uses stolen certs and reads HTTPS traffic << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (2 of 10 articles) NEWS Microsoft tells users - don't manually download the Creators Update << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (3 of 10 articles) FEATURE How to: Uninstall Windows 10 << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (4 of 10 articles) NEWS 10% of Windows 10 devices now run the Creators Update << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (5 of 10 articles) FEATURE How to: 21 tips top make the most of the Windows 10 Creators Update << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (6 of 10 articles) NEWS Windows 10 on ARM devices will arrive at the end of the year << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (7 of 10 articles) NEWS Power Throttling makes a return to Windows 10 << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (8 of 10 articles) NEWS Linux Commands: The most useful ones you'll need << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (9 of 10 articles) NEWS Apple fixes iOS 10 beta problems, but could kill support << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> More in Operating Systems (10 of 10 articles) NEWS Vista: Finally, the end is nigh << Prev Next >> View all Operating Systems articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest in Operating Systems News OSX malware uses stolen certs and reads HTTPS traffic Review Review: Android Wear 2.0 Feature How to: Uninstall Windows 10 Gallery First look: Acer's C7 Chromebook From our Partners     See more offers from the PC & Tech Authority Software Store     Sponsored Links Most popular tech stories 7 accounting packages for Australian small businesses compared: including MYOB, QuickBooks Online, Reckon, Xero Xero: 2017 review How long will a UPS keep your computers on if the lights go out?

Warranty repairs for the battery issue have been extended out to three years. Apple honoring 1st gen Apple Watch warranty for 3 years to replace swelling batteries The battery swelling issue doesn’t seem to be wide spread, but it’s obvious if you do have the problem because the display glass pushes up and away from the watch body. There’s a discussion on Apple’s online forums about the Apple Watch battery issue where owners say the company has been replacing their watches. Now Apple has made that an official policy and some first gen Apple Watch owners are getting notifications telling them about the warranty extension. Since the issue isn’t wide spread it’s likely certain battery batches are susceptible to the swelling issue. It’s also likely Apple is alerting watch owners with batteries from those batches considering mass emails aren’t going out to all first gen Apple Watch owners. If you’re dealing with first generation Apple Watch battery swelling issues make a Genius Bar appointment. If you think you may have a problem, but aren’t sure, that’s worth an appointment, too.

But Apple remains a great company, and one shouldn’t fall for the logical fallacy that because some things are going wrong that everything is going wrong. The spaceship building at Apple Park. And yet that very fallacy is used to treat everything that Apple does as an opportunity for criticism. After all, if we only wrote about the modest number of real problems Apple has, there wouldn’t be enough material to keep journalists busy five days a week. Every so often, I’ve found, it helps to stabilize one’s perceptions of Apple. There’s no better way to do that than to read the works of Daniel Eran Dilger at Apple Insider.  In this three part series. author Dilger examines the false narratives that have been building up around Apple. I highly recommend this body of work. A very false narrative: Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Apple’s iPhone A very false narrative: Microsoft Surface vs Apple iPad, Mac A very false narrative: Apple Watch and the future of wearables Autor Dilger has an incredible grasp of historical facts that he uses to great effect. And when he’s not reminding us of the historical record, he bursts the balloons of pompous, self-serving observers. Like this: Apple releases sales data to transparently inform its investors, not to impress tech columnists. It’s incredible that some of the same people perpetuating these false narratives are also insisting that it’s “time for Apple to release Watch [sales] data,” as if Apple were a representative democracy run by the popular whimsy blowing from the least competent and intelligent members of society. If you read nothing else I point you to this week, read this trio above. More Debris 4K/UHD TV technology is amazing. The introduction of High Dynamic Range (HDR) has just about eliminated the excuse that HD is good enough. Often, however, the technical discussion elicits a response from readers that there’s “no content.” While it’s true that 4K content, let alone 4K content with HDR, is still limited, it’s helpful to monitor the content situation. There always comes a tipping poing when even the most conservative viewer is ready to embrace what’s available. To help with that, here’s a nice summary from hdreport . “4K UHD Movies & TV Shows.” It’s nicely organized. For the cord cutters, Glenn Fleishman has posted a nifty tutorial. “How to turn your Mac into a digital video recorder for over-the-air TV.” The distinguished Tim Berners-Lee is considered the father of the World Wide Web and even wrote the first browser for the Mac in the early 1990s—even before Mosaic. Here are his recent thoughts at The Guardian. “Tim Berners-Lee: selling private citizens’ browsing data is ‘disgusting’.” It’s a good interview. And along those lines, Re/code brings us down to earth in a discussion about the attempt to purchase the browsing history of individuals, namely U.S. lawmakers. It turns out to be more difficult than a GoFundMe campaign thought it would be. “GoFundMe campaigns to buy lawmakers’ web histories raised hundreds of thousands of dollars — then failed to deliver.” Related: Previously, I didn’t have space for this gem by Mike Wehner at BGR, one that seems to have been overlooked, especially by that GoFundMe campaign. “Sorry, but nobody actually cares about your web browsing history.” Author Wehner writes: “Gerard Lewis, Comcast’s chief privacy officer, told Reuters:” We do not sell our broadband customers’ individual web browsing history. We did not do it before the FCC’s rules were adopted, and we have no plans to do so. Wait. Ski season is over. Time for tennis. Sun. Exercise. Perspective. ______________________ Particle Debris is a generally a mix of John Martellaro’s observations and opinions about a standout event or article of the week (preamble on page one) followed on page two by a discussion of articles that didn’t make the tmo headlines, the technical news debris.

He is very good with his analysis. Anything is better to do than time spent in Facebook. April 28, 2017 at 5:10 EDT PM geoduck April 28, 2017 Facebook and the other platforms that allow live streaming are going to re educate people on why editors are a good thing. April 28, 2017 at 7:03 EDT PM geoduck April 28, 2017 Thank you as well for the links to Dilger’s articles. They put things into perspective very nicely. I loved the bit where Samsung makes more off of the components they sell to Apple than they do from their own smartphones. That’s priceless. The bit about the Apple Watch and integration was interesting too. Since its introduction it has gone from a device I was actively annoyed by to something that’s interesting but just doesn’t do anything to make it a must have for me. However if they are successful in adding blood glucose monitoring, we will be in line the first day. April 28, 2017 at 7:12 EDT PM Lee Dronick April 28, 2017 It seems to me there are only two approaches. Three, a replacement for Facebook that is run by responsible people that respects the users and the advertisers. Easy to understand settings, filters, reporting, and privacy. April 28, 2017 at 7:41 EDT PM Lee Dronick April 28, 2017 Two Apple Stores in San Diego were robbed today. The thieves took display items by cutting the security cables, MacBooks and iPhones. http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/SD-Thieves-Steal-Displays-From-Fashion-Valley-Apple-Store–420756213.html April 28, 2017 at 10:03 EDT PM wab95 April 29, 2017 John: Leave it to Dilger to destroy a perfectly beautiful narrative with an ugly set of facts about Apple’s products and their market performance relative to their competitors’. Is no nestled narrative safe from the purgative light of truth and evidence? Such wanton and data driven disregard for alternative facts runs afoul of today’s political and social climate, is a slur against siloed sanctums of secure echo chambers, islets of inbred pseudo-intellectualism, and smacks of pointy-headed, double-domed elitism. I’ll bet that the man actually reads books. Lest someone take that sarcasm literally, or better still, levels the charge of hypocrisy for failing to acknowledge Apple-centric sites as ‘echo chambers’, let me hasten to add that among these, TMO stands out as a fact-based forum for thought and discussion that never hesitates to criticise Apple whenever its writers feel that Apple deserves it. Indeed so fast and thick have come some unsparingly critical pieces from TMO of late that one could be forgiven for thinking it an Apple-sceptic site. Articles lambasting iTunes, software missteps, the Mac Pro, and Apple’s level of productivity, to name but a few, suffice to make the point. These fact-based, thoughtful discussions are among the principal reasons that yours truly continues to visit this site. Apple, like most thriving enterprises, is adapting to an evolving dynamic interplay of society, technology and culture (hence the company’s emphasis on expanding the diversity of its workforce, but that’s a topic for another time). As such, and specifically because Apple play the long game, the company must evolve on an arc commensurate with that of the wider society. Because that arc far exceeds the minute span of a human lifetime, it can appear to us as linear, flat or unremarkable. Moreover, this can lead us to a curiously contradictory set of reactions to Apple’s transformation from a boutique computer house to a global platform behemoth, and to a grossly incorrect assessments of reality. On the one hand, we perceive the evolution of Apple’s platform as flat, with little to no change relative to the episodic, oftentimes frenetic or marginally successful experiments of Apple’s competitors. This leads us to ask why didn’t Apple do that if they’re so ‘innovative’, or at least why aren’t they following suit. Herein lies all the difference between the organic evolution of an integral whole and the accidental growth spasms of a discontinuous and inharmonious amalgam of parts. I suggest that Apple’s arc appears flat to our individual time – bound perspective in much the same way that the physical horizon appears flat to our earthbound visual observation. To appreciate Apple’s growth arc and projected course requires both observation and, sadly for those in search of a simplistic world view, thoughtful organisation of those observations into a harmonious narrative that both explains what we have seen and reasonably, perhaps accurately, anticipates what we have yet to see. In science, we call this a working theory, which is distinct from either an opinion or a baseless and fact-free assertion. Indeed, this is precisely analogous to our reasoning out the true shape and size of our planet in ancient times. (Most physical phenomena have their analogues in our intellectual and spiritual life, but I digress). On the other hand, when we pick out isolated features of that expansive arc, such as a new product that our static world view failed to anticipate, we are discomfited, quibble about its value, meaning and relevance, and swear by all the gods and goddesses of tech and the idols of our desires that the company has lost its true north and needs new direction and leadership. We are correct in asserting that this is not our father’s Apple, nor could it be and have the technological and cultural footprint that it currently enjoys, let alone the market cap. Regarding what we have yet to see, this is, in my opinion, not about specific products per se, but about directionality and relevance to our present unmet and emerging needs. This requires that we look at Apple’s skill set, specifically Apple’s capacity to integrate hardware and software, its trajectory of leveraging those to products of increasingly greater complexity and capability into an integrated platform of products and services, and project forward to logical next steps of function and need. And while this may seldom lead us to predict Apple’s next product or service, it may, more often than not, lead less to dismay and despair when we are greeted with the unexpected, than to a recognition of new options and opportunities.

The Amazon Echo ignited a smart speaker craze, with even Google jumping on board with its own Google Home. So, of course it didn't take long for reports to emerge about Apple making its own device powered by Siri. Now, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via 9to5Mac), Apple will announce this Siri smart speaker at its annual developer conference this June. Apple will likely market it as a high-end speaker with built-in Siri and superior sound quality and computing power when compared to Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Siri speaker should go on sale by Christmastime, even if it's not announced announced at WWDC 2017. We think it makes sense for Apple to unveil it this summer, giving developers the chance to build apps for the device. Curved OLED iPhone 8 confirmed by Samsung?

Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are on fire. The world's most valuable consumer tech company's stock hit a new all-time high on Monday. Momentum is clearly in its corner. Apple stock has soared 53% over the past year, trading 24% higher so far in 2017. One would think that expectations would be high given the stock's heady gains, but analysts don't necessarily see it that way. Wall Street pros see $52.97 billion in revenue, just 5% higher than the prior year's fiscal second quarter. Those same analysts see earnings per share rising 6% to $2.02. This isn't the kind of growth on both ends of the income statement that one typically bargains for when a stock has popped 53% over the past 12 months. A silver lining to single-digit growth could be that profits are growing faster than sales, but that's not necessarily the case here. Analysts see earnings per share growing slightly faster than revenue, but that's on a per-share basis. Apple has been a voracious eater of its own stock through aggressive buybacks. It has lowered its share count by nearly 5% over the past four quarters, so net income itself will be relatively flat -- and net margin lower -- if analysts are on target this time.  There's a lot at stake The bullish case for Apple -- and it's a strong one -- is that investors have been bidding up the shares ahead of the next iPhone. Apple introduced the original iPhone in the summer of 2007, and all of the buzz finds the class act of Cupertino pulling out all of the stops in making the next smartphone upgrade revolutionary instead of merely evolutionary. From curved OLED screens to wireless charging, the rumor mill is churning out thick chatter that could stir the masses into trading in their old iPhone and even Android smartphones.  Looking back may not be pretty, and even bulls concede that. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich has a buy rating on the stock, but on Monday he put out an analyst note pointing out that iPhone demand remains soft. He leans on a survey showing that iPhone-buying intent is at a nine-year low, and that the number of potential buyers uncertain about which phone they would be buy next is on the rise. That's a scary suggestion just a day before Apple reports given how it lives and dies on the iPhone these days, but he's also sticking to his forecast for double-digit growth in Apple's fiscal 2018 on the strength of the iPhone 8 -- or whatever it will be called -- when it rolls out later this calendar year. The weak demand now could be folks just waiting for the evolutionary next model, something that would be great for Apple's long-term potential but problematic in the near term. The timing of the next release is a front-and-center topic if folks are holding back on upgrades or even first-time purchases. The last few models have rolled out in the fall, but the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone actually takes place at the end of next month. No one expects Apple to introduce the next iPhone during the current quarter, but if guidance and growth prospects will be weak until that happens, any hints on a release date will be what could drive the stock after Tuesday's market close.

By Thomas Heath, The Washington Post So much cash is raining on some U.S.-based corporations that they are at a loss on what to do with all the money. With the $250 billion sitting in its bank account, Apple could comfortably go out and buy Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, at today’s market price without borrowing a penny. The technology giant would still have $50 billion left to buy more than 700,000 Tesla model S electric cars or about four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. Then there’s Microsoft. The Seattle-based software maker has the second-largest stash, at $126 billion, enough to buy a $100,000 home for 1.2 million Americans. And the blizzards of green are not limited to the tech sector. Legendary investor Warren Buffett will preside over his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting this weekend in Omaha – known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” – while his company sits on $86 billion in cash. That’s enough to pay for New York City’s government operations for a year. The cash hoards are coming to the forefront as earnings season is heating up. U.S. companies are reporting mostly robust profits, and the stock market, especially technology shares, are ballooning. Some investors have cautioned that equities are frothy in light of the geopolitical risks such as North Korea and the political divide in the country. A big part of the reason behind the rich corporate caches is taxes – or unpaid taxes. Apple, Microsoft and many other U.S.-based international companies are sitting on well more than $2 trillion in cash from untaxed overseas profits, which could be brought back to the United States to be used for investment and dividends if lawmakers lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35 percent is one of the highest in the world. “Apple is one of the best companies in the world, and a third of their value is sitting in vaults in Switzerland and Luxembourg and Dublin,” said Timothy Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “Isn’t that pathetic?” The Trump administration has promised to lower the corporate tax rate significantly. Economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle have said a lower corporate tax rate or a tax holiday that repatriates money from overseas will unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, in dividends and business investments in the United States. “Companies have been accumulating cash over many years,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Smith School of Business. “The perverse disincentives of our current corporate tax system are discouraging corporations from bringing back international profits to invest in the U.S.” Apple chief executive Tim Cook, in an interview with The Washington Post last year, said federal and state taxes on Apple’s cash reserves, the vast majority of which is overseas, is about 40 percent. Many U.S.-based companies leave their earnings overseas rather than pay the U.S. rate. “We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate,” Cook said, adding that his company is the largest U.S. taxpayer. “There’s no debate about it. It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. “We think it’s fine for us to pay more, because right now we’re paying nothing on that and we leave it over there,” he said. “But we – like many, many other companies do – wait for the money to come back.” If the corporate rate is reduced or a holiday is granted, Apple, Microsoft and others could pay a special dividend, buy back shares or both. They could also make acquisitions, although Apple has preferred to grow organically by inventing new products such as the iPhone and iPad and investing in itself. Apple earned $45.6 billion in profit in 2016 on revenue of $215 billion. It paid a handsome dividend of $2.18, although the rise in share price has cut its yield to about 1.7 percent and made the shares much less of a bargain than they once were. If Apple chose a special dividend, its $250 billion would cover a $48 payment on each of its 5.2 billion shares. That is highly unlikely, although some lump sum dividend is possible, and it could touch nearly every American who has a retirement plan or owns taxable mutual funds. “What is going to happen when Apple has $1 trillion in cash?” said Loughran, pointing out that the iPhone 10 is due out this year. “It won’t be that long. What are we going to do then? The way I think about it is the treasure of America sitting in a vault in Switzerland. We created $250 billion from profits and we are not using it. This is an obvious reform that is needed.” Kass said he expects a major return by Apple to shareholders through several vehicles, including an increase in the Apple dividend, stock buybacks and a big one-time dividend.He said it is less likely that Apple would make acquisitions, given the company’s historic aversion to them. Berkshire Hathaway has little in overseas exposure because most of its profits are made in the United States. And Buffett has been reluctant for Berkshire Hathaway to pay dividends, arguing that he can make better use of the money by finding smart investments. “His companies are sufficiently profitable, and he is very patient, that his cash has accumulated over several years,” Kass said. “But if the corporate rate is lowered from 35 percent to 15, 20, 25, it will result in additional profits for Berkshire and just about every other American-based corporation. “If that takes place, then Warren Buffett’s pile of cash will increase much further,” he said.   Most Read Suppliers say Boeing plans to accelerate 737 MAX production RENTON — In the next two years, the Boeing Co. plans to… May 1st, 2017 by Dan Catchpole No foul play suspected in largest fire in Lynnwood’s history LYNNWOOD — Plans have started to rebuild The Reserve senior apartments that… Apr 30th, 2017 by Rikki King The Chat Arlington man podcasts about his mountain wanderings Rudy Giecek practices what he podcasts.

Apple AirPods Set Record 98% Customer Satisfaction Level [Chart] LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 7 hours ago by iClarified · 1655 views · Translate 98% of customers are satisfied with their Apple AirPods, according to a recent Experian and Creative Strategies survey. The overall customer satisfaction level of 98% sets the record for the highest level of satisfaction for a new product from Apple. When the iPhone came out in 2007, it held a 92% customer satisfaction level, iPad in 2010 had 92%, and Apple Watch in 2015 had 97%. Apple's AirPods also achieved an impressive Net Promoter Score of 75. The score ranks a customers willingness to recommend a product to others. The iPhone's NPS is 72. Anything above 50 is considered excellent and anything above 70 is world class. The average product NPS across 105,000 organizations is 39. The top six AirPods features in order of customer satisfaction are: time to charge, design of case, pairing process, battery life, comfort, and fit. Here's a couple other observations: ● 84% of respondents strongly or somewhat agree that using just one AirPod at a time makes sense in certain situations. ● 88.97% of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods consistently pair to their iPhone as soon as they put one in their ear. ● 82.5% of consumers would like more control over their content by tapping the AirPods to do things like turn volume up or down or skip to next song. ● 82% of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods are their favorite Apple products launched in recent memory. ● 62% of respondents strongly or somewhat agree AirPods are causing them to consume more audio content (music, books, podcast, etc) than before they owned AirPods. ● 64% of consumers somewhat disagree or strongly disagree they keep wired headphones handy just in case AirPods don’t work. The popularity of Apple's AirPods is obvious. There's still a six week shipping delay when purchasing from Apple.com despite launching last December. If you want a pair now, try visiting your local Apple Store or pay a premium on Amazon.

In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 percent Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, as well as China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation—fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It’s expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong,” Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he’s actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. “I’m looking at that right now,” Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” (BusinessDesk) ends © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

Apple Watch buyers guide By Rene Ritchie Monday, May 1, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 1 Comment Rene Ritchie has been covering the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Which Apple Watch size, material, color, and series should you buy? Here's how to make the perfect pick! The Apple Watch may be future-feeling technology, but it has long established roots both in time-keeping and computing. That makes choosing which one you're going to get — 38mm or 42mm; aluminum Sport, stainless steel, or ceramic; and which band, buckle, or loop you're going to get with it — both simple and complicated. See at Apple Should you get an Apple Watch? These days, you need a computer that fits in your pocket. That's what makes iPhone so popular. You probably also still need a computer for your lap or your desk. But a computer for your wrist? That feels more like an accessory at best, and extravagance at worst. Yet Apple Watch has a few features that can make it indispensable. Here's how to figure out which it is for you. For timekeeping For notifications For health and fitness For Apple Pay For communication For remote control Who should get an Apple Watch? Who shouldn't get an Apple Watch? Should you get Apple Watch Series 1 or Series 2? Apple Watch Series 1 has all the same features as the original but with the newer, faster dual-core Apple S1P chipset on board. That makes for a faster experience. Apple Watch Series 2 adds GPS, a brighter screen, and true swim-proofing to the mix. Is the difference worth the savings — or the cost? Models and styles Speed, speed, speed Battery life Water resistance Brightness Weight and materials Pricing Who should get the Apple Watch Series 1? Who should get the Apple Watch Series 2? Should you get the 38mm or 42mm Apple Watch? Apple has provided two sizing options for the Apple Watch: 38mm and 42mm. Whether you're getting aluminum, steel, or ceramic, Series 1 or Series 2, Nike+ or Hermès, they all come in those two sizes. Some might consider their personal choice obvious, whether that's based on wrist size, gender, or some other factor. If you're not finding it quite so obvious, however, here are some things to consider when picking the perfect Apple Watch size for you! Height vs. width Display size Depth perception Hers and his Band bias Price points Battery life Who should get the 38mm Apple Watch? Who should get the 42mm Apple Watch? Which Apple Watch should you buy: aluminum, stainless steel, or ceramic? Apple Watch Series 2 comes in your choice of three different materials with distinct properties and price points all their own. There's anodized aluminum, the same material Apple uses for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. There's stainless steel, which is heavier but stronger and a favorite of many watch-wearers. And there's ceramic, which replaces last year's 18K gold on the high end with something even more scratch-proof — and expensive — than steel. So, which should you choose? Price points Heavy materials Scratch and damage resistance Color matches Who should get the aluminum Apple Watch? Who should get the stainless steel Apple Watch? Who should get the ceramic Apple Watch? Which Apple Watch color should you get: Silver, gold, rose gold, gray, black, or white? Band lines Discoloration doubts Withstanding wear Coolness concerns Who should get silver? Who should get gold or rose gold? Who should get space gray or space black? Who should get ceramic white? Should you get AppleCare+ for your Apple Watch? Every Apple Watch comes with standard AppleCare but also provides the option to upgrade to AppleCare+. The free level of AppleCare includes a one-year limited warranty on hardware repairs, and 90 days of free technical support. AppleCare+ extends that hardware warranty and technical support to two years and adds coverage for up to two incidents of accidental damage — though there's an additional service fee for those. So, is it worth it? AppleCare vs. AppleCare+ AppleCare+ extensions AppleCare+ service fee Who shouldn't get AppleCare+? Who should get AppleCare+? Need more help?

(Tony Gutierrez / AP) By Thomas Heath Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS So much cash is raining on some U.S.-based corporations that they are at a loss on what to do with all the money. With the $250 billion sitting in its bank account, Apple could comfortably go out and buy Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, at today’s market price without borrowing a penny. The technology giant would still have $50 billion left to buy more than 700,000 Tesla model S electric cars or about four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. Then there’s Microsoft. The Seattle-based software maker has the second-largest stash, at $126 billion, enough to buy a $100,000 home for 1.2 million Americans. And the blizzards of green are not limited to the tech sector. Legendary investor Warren Buffett will preside over his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting this weekend in Omaha – known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” – while his company sits on $86 billion in cash. That’s enough to pay for New York City’s government operations for a year. The cash hoards are coming to the forefront as earnings season is heating up. U.S. companies are reporting mostly robust profits, and the stock market, especially technology shares, is ballooning. Some investors have cautioned that equities are frothy in light of the geopolitical risks such as North Korea and the political divide in the country. A big part of the reason behind the rich corporate caches is taxes – or unpaid taxes. Apple, Microsoft and many other U.S.-based international companies are sitting on well more than $2 trillion in cash from untaxed overseas profits, which could be brought back to the United States to be used for investment and dividends if lawmakers lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35 percent is one of the highest in the world. “Apple is one of the best companies in the world, and a third of their value is sitting in vaults in Switzerland and Luxembourg and Dublin,” said Timothy Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “Isn’t that pathetic?” The Trump administration has promised to lower the corporate tax rate significantly. Economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle have said a lower corporate tax rate or a tax holiday that repatriates money from overseas will unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, in dividends and business investments in the United States. “Companies have been accumulating cash over many years,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Smith School of Business. “The perverse disincentives of our current corporate tax system are discouraging corporations from bringing back international profits to invest in the U.S.” Apple chief executive Tim Cook, in an interview with The Washington Post last year, said federal and state taxes on Apple’s cash reserves, the vast majority of which is overseas, are about 40 percent. Many U.S.-based companies leave their earnings overseas rather than pay the U.S. rate. “We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate,” Cook said, adding that his company is the largest U.S. taxpayer. “There’s no debate about it. It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. ”We think it’s fine for us to pay more, because right now we’re paying nothing on that and we leave it over there,“ he said. ”But we – like many, many other companies do – wait for the money to come back.“ If the corporate rate is reduced or a holiday is granted, Apple, Microsoft and others could pay a special dividend, buy back shares or both. They could also make acquisitions, although Apple has preferred to grow organically by inventing new products such as the iPhone and iPad and investing in itself. Apple earned $45.6 billion in profit in 2016 on revenue of $215 billion. It paid a handsome dividend of $2.18, although the rise in share price has cut its yield to about 1.7 percent and made the shares much less of a bargain than they once were. If Apple chose a special dividend, its $250 billion would cover a $48 payment on each of its 5.2 billion shares. That is highly unlikely, although some lump sum dividend is possible, and it could touch nearly every American who has a retirement plan or owns taxable mutual funds. ”What is going to happen when Apple has $1 trillion in cash?“ said Loughran, pointing out that the iPhone 10 is due out this year. ”It won’t be that long. What are we going to do then? The way I think about it is the treasure of America sitting in a vault in Switzerland. We created $250 billion from profits and we are not using it. This is an obvious reform that is needed.“ Kass said he expects a major return by Apple to shareholders through several vehicles, including an increase in the Apple dividend, stock buybacks and a big one-time dividend.He said it is less likely that Apple would make acquisitions, given the company’s historic aversion to them. Berkshire Hathaway has little in overseas exposure because most of its profits are made in the United States. And Buffett has been reluctant for Berkshire Hathaway to pay dividends, arguing that he can make better use of the money by finding smart investments. ”His companies are sufficiently profitable, and he is very patient, that his cash has accumulated over several years,“ Kass said. ”But if the corporate rate is lowered from 35 percent to 15, 20, 25, it will result in additional profits for Berkshire and just about every other American-based corporation. “If that takes place, then Warren Buffett’s pile of cash will increase much further,” he said.

Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. “Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we’re also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe,” he said. “All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Consumer-focused companies also rose, as online retailer Amazon.com picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. Before dawn on Monday, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Investors also sold high-dividend stocks including utilities, phone companies and makers of household goods.

Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Tribune Media rose after the Financial Times reported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Blackstone may make a joint takeover bid for the company. Tribune Media has stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network and owns TV stations. Tribune stock gained $2.19, or 6 percent, to $38.75. The companies declined to comment. Sinclair Broadcast Group is also reported to be interested in buying Tribune. Investment management company AllianceBernstein fell after it replaced Peter Kraus as chairman and CEO and removed most of the directors of its board. Kraus has led the company since 2008. The company named a new non-executive chairman and separate CEO, and removed nine of the 11 members of the board. It named six new directors. The stock gave up 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.15.

Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

They also mocked how expensive they were, and how much it would suck to lose one earpiece. However it seems that despite the initial mocking, those that went ahead and bought a pair seem to love them. According to a survey conducted by Experian and Creative Strategies (via AppleInsider), it turns out that customer satisfaction levels for Apple’s AirPods are at a whopping 98%! This means that almost every customer who bought a pair are either “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their purchase. It seems that these satisfaction levels are the highest as far as Apple products are concerned. Ben Bajarin who is the principal analyst at Creative Strategies writes, “The overall customer satisfaction level of 98% sets the record for the highest level of satisfaction for a new product from Apple. When the iPhone came out in 2007, it held a 92 percent customer satisfaction level, iPad in 2010 had 92 percent, and Apple Watch in 2015 had 97 percent.” The customers who were surveyed gain high scores for the earphone’s ability to charge in a short amount of time, the charging case design, and also the pairing process which is accomplished through the new W1 chipset inside of the earphones.

Apple has extended its battery-related warranty for the first-generation Apple Watch for an additional year, 9to5Mac reported. The extension comes after various reports on social media and user forums of the watch’s internal battery beginning to swell in size and causing the display to physically pop out or suffer other damage on certain models. In these situations, the Apple Watch will be unusable. Read: Apple Watch 3 With Display-Embedded Touch ID In The Works? 9to5Mac reported an email was sent to authorized support centers: "Apple has extended service coverage for eligible Apple Watch [1st gen] models with an expanded/swollen battery to three years after the original date of purchase,” Apple said. “Eligible devices will be covered for two years beyond the original one-year Limited Warranty." Apple Watch BandMore The Apple Watch Series 2 is on display at an Apple media event in San Francisco, Sept. 7, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach While Apple has traditionally offered a base one-year limited warranty for the Apple Watch, the company has provided an additional two-year warranty for damage specifically caused by swollen batteries. With the extension, it essentially provides three years of coverage for the Apple Watch against battery issues without needing Apple’s premium AppleCare warranty coverage. On MacRumors’ forums, user Rosepod5 expressed her dismay in an April 2 post about her Apple Watch experiencing damage from a swollen battery and showed a photo of her deformed Apple Watch. Absolutely gutted to take my Apple Watch series 1 off the charger this morning and find the screen has popped off! No damage, no scratches, never been dropped and I only wear it at weekends/workouts so it is immaculate. AppleSupport informed me that due to being out of warranty I needed to pay a £206 service charge ... considering a new series 1 watch cost £269 it's safe to say I was not willing to proceed with that. Disgusted that the screen on my watch can just pop off. If your Apple Watch has experienced problems with a swollen battery, you can take it to an Apple Store or contact Apple’s support team. Read: How To Install Apple Watch Software Update The first-generation Apple Watch was originally introduced in April 2015 and was Apple’s first significant entry into the wearables market. The Apple Watch can be paired with an iPhone and provide functionality like notifications and fitness tracking. The first-generation Watch was succeeded by the Series 2, which was released in September. The market has also seen competing options from companies ranging from Google to Samsung. While Apple hasn’t revealed anything specific about the Apple Watch 3 like its release date or specifications, some leaks and rumors have hinted about what the successor might feature. Past iterations have relied on Wi-Fi connectivity or pairing with a nearby iPhone to draw content and updates, but the Apple Watch 3 potentially could feature cellular connectivity. Elsewhere, the new smartwatch also potentially could limit notifications from other users while you’re driving. Related Articles What Are Sheeple?

They call on other companies to match this commitment. Apple’s goal is at odds with the excitement generated in some circles over proposals to mine the deep sea, and in particular by the world’s first deep sea mine (DSM) to be granted an operating licence in Papua New Guinea[2]. The announcement by Apple recognises the strong groundswell building for a circular economy that has eco-design, re-use, repairing, and recycling at its core. This will require other companies to also develop innovative business models and in particular mining companies to move beyond the current crude approach to sourcing minerals. Professor Richard Steiner of Oasis Earth stated: ” One of the default arguments of DSM proponents is that the world economy will need the Rare Earth Elements and other minerals from the deep ocean for a growing demand for communications technologies. Apple’s announcement shows this is will not be the case. The days of digging holes for raw materials, using them once or twice, discarding them into landfills, and then digging more holes for more raw materials to waste – are clearly numbered!” Christina Tony, from the Bismarck Ramu Group in Papua New Guinea, said, “Our coastal communities in the Bismarck Sea are subject to the world’s first deep sea mining experiment – driven by Nautilus Inc. and investors such as Anglo American. Why are these companies happy to sacrifice our people’s heath, livelihoods, culture, and marine environment. This primitive and violent approach to mining belongs with the dinosaurs. Apple is showing us a sophisticated vision of a sustainable future.” Dr. Helen Rosenbaum, Deep Sea Mining campaign stated, “Deep Sea Mining is risky business as both the environmental impacts and the returns are complete unknowns. Nautilus’ Annual Information Form, lodged with Canadian securities,emphasises the experimental nature of the Solwara 1 project. In addition, report after report[3] demonstrates the world’s oceans are already on the brink of peril. With our Pacific partners, we call for a complete ban on Deep Sea Mining and for mining companies and electronics manufacturers to instead turn their mind to developing closed loop economies.” Dr. Catherine Coumans of MiningWatch Canada says “Some mining for virgin mineralson land may still be required in the short term to meet demand not satisfied by recycling, urban mining and reducing consumption[4]. But these alternatives provide win-win solutions for society, the environment and the economy. The right choice is really a “no-brainer” and we welcome Apple’s foresight in leading the way. There is absolutely no need for deep sea mining [5].” NOTES [1] No Mining Required; No more mining says Apple; and Apple will stop relying on mining for minerals ‘one day’. [2] See reports: Out of our Depth: Mining the Ocean Floor in Papua New Guinea (November 2011)http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/wp-content/uploads/Out-Of-Our-Depth-low-res.pdf ; Physical Oceanographic Assessment of the Nautilus Environmental Impact Statement for the Solwara 1 Project - An Independent Review (November 2012) http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/wp-content/uploads/EIS-Review-FINAL-low-res.pdf ; Accountability Zero: A Critique of Nautilus Minerals Environmental and Social Benchmarking Analysis of the Solwara 1 project (September 2015) http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/wp-content/uploads/accountabilityZERO_web.pdf [3] Reports include: World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Reviving the Ocean Economy (2015) ; The Living Planet(2016); International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) State of the Ocean (2013) ; Explaining Ocean Warming (2016); and the United Nation’s World Ocean Assessment 2016 which is a global inventory of the state of the marine environment and problems threatening to degrade the oceans. Recent research from the MIDAS consortium indicates a concrete risk that deep sea mining would lead to serious irreversible harm. [4] For example, California based Blue Oak Resources estimates that every year mining companies spend roughly $12 billion for virgin ore deposits. While tons of cell phones and other electronics are thrown out every year, each ton contains 70 times the amount of gold and silver found in virgin ore. For copper the number is even higher, with the equivalent of roughly one-third of global mining production thrown out in e-waste globally every year; 'Urban mining': UBC engineers say e-waste richer than ore pulled from the ground; Can ‘urban mining’ solve the world’s e-waste problem?

A bunch of details have already leaked though, so we know some details that Apple’s would have preferred to keep secret. For example, reports have said that Apple will add wireless charging to the iPhone 8, so it’ll be the first iPhone ever to support plug-free charging. Well, that’s not exactly true. There certainly haven’t been any iPhones with wireless charging support out of the box, but you can add wireless charging support to any iPhone with the various cases and kits out there. One of our favorites is the Nillkin Magic Case, which is available for the iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 6/6s, and iPhone 6/6s Plus.

Here are some key details from the product page: Nillkin Magic Case Series Wireless Charging Receiver Back Cover for iPhone Wireless Charging: Although iPhone still doesn’t support wireless charge, our Magic Case can enable your iPhone 7 to be wireless charging compatible.

We're also due for some new iMacs, which Apple says will include some features that will make less-demanding pro users happy. But we don't know when they're coming, and the Mac Pro in particular is going to take at least a year to get here. Apple's reassurances are nice, but it's a small comfort to anyone who wants high-end processing power in a Mac right now. Apple hasn't put out a new desktop since it refreshed the iMacs in October of 2015, and the older, slower components in these computers keeps Apple out of new high-end fields like VR. This is a problem for people who prefer or need macOS, since Apple's operating system is only really designed to work on Apple’s hardware. But for the truly adventurous and desperate, there's another place to turn: fake Macs built with standard PC components, popularly known as "Hackintoshes". They've been around for a long time, but the state of Apple's desktop lineup is making them feel newly relevant these days. So we spoke with people who currently rely on Hackintoshes to see how the computers are being used - and what they'd like to see from Apple. My 2009 article on building a hackintosh is still one of the most popular articles on OSNews. This movement is anything but new, and has always been far more popular than people seem to think - it's only been brought to the forefront again lately due to Apple's abysmal Mac product line-up.

The iPad made tablets modern, effortless to use and a must-have household item. The iPad Pro was a category defining device even if it didn’t arrive before the Surface Pro 4 became the best productivity tablet ever. Therefore, it is no surprise that iPad Pro alternatives with Android are slowly growing in number. The iPad Pro has two incarnations, both of which are the best in their class. The larger, 12.9-inch iPad Pro was the first to launch. It is dominated by a 2732 x 2048 resolution display and a TouchID fingerprint reader. The 9.7-inch model has a 2048 x 1536 resolution display on its front. A fast Apple A9X chip keeps both devices speedy when opening apps or multitasking in Apple’s iOS. Ports along their edge allow them to effortlessly pair with a keyboard cover that is a lot like the Surface Pro 4 keyboards that Microsoft and its partners offer. There’s also the completely optional Apple Pencil, which gives users a natural way to write notes and create digital drawings. The best iPad Pro alternatives could also help you replace a laptop. Read: iPad Pro Review: Why I Returned the new iPad The best iPad Pro alternatives with Android offer many of these features. What’s more, these tablets have some unique ideas on what being a Surface Pro 4 alternative is all about. Why We Need iPad Pro Alternatives with Android We need good iPad Pro alternatives with Android for two reasons, mainly. Chief among these reasons is price. Apple isn’t exactly known for offering its hardware at reasonable prices. The cheapest iPad Pro 12.9 costs $799.99. The lowest priced iPad Pro 9.7-inch costs $599.99. That’s without the Apple Pencil or the tablet’s add-on keyboard. That’s also with as little storage as possible. Android hardware makers have a knack for making devices that have a similar fit and finish to Apple’s products while not costing nearly as much. Read: Apple Smart Keyboard Review: an iPad Pro Necessity? There’s also consistency to consider. Apple dominates smartphone profits, but devices running Android collectively outsell the iPhone quarter after quarter. iPad Pro alternatives make a lot of sense for users who already own an Android phone. One operating system across all your devices makes managing accounts and digital purchases a lot easier. What Makes Good iPad Pro Alternatives with Android Great iPad Pro alternatives with Android give you all the basics of the iPad Pro, sometimes without the lofty price tag. They each offer access to the latest versions of Android. Staying relatively current with the latest version of Android is key. Apple upgrades its devices in lockstep with new hardware at the end of every year. Read: Android Tablets vs Windows 10 Tablets: What to Buy Pen or keyboard support are important too since those are two things that were key to the Surface Pro 4 and iPad Pro’s appeal. At the very least, good iPad Pro alternatives offer keyboard support so that users don’t have to worry about tapping on their touchscreens when they need to write an email or create a document. Here are the 4 best iPad Pro alternatives with Android. 4 Best iPad Pro Alternatives with Android.

Read: Google Pixel C: 5 Things I Learned the First Day The Pixel C runs Google’s Android 7.1 operating system, giving you access to all the apps and games that you use on your smartphone. It’s dominated by a 10.2-inch 2560 x 1800 resolution display. There are two cameras, one 8-megapixel rear-facing camera for taking pictures of everyone else and a 2-megapixel front-facing camera for taking pictures of yourself. There’s 3GB of RAM, a gyroscope and a USB Type-C port for charging and connecting accessories. Read: Google Pixel C vs Surface 3 $599 gets shoppers the Google Pixel C with 64GB of internal storage.

Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at US Bank's Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the US are improving. "Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we're also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe," he said. "All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains." The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2%, to 2388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1%, to 20913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7%, to 6091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5%, to 1407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19% from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed 2.95 US dollars (£2.29), or 2.1%, to 146.60 dollars (£113.77) and Facebook added 2.21 dollars (£1.72), or 1.5%, to 152.46 dollars (£118.31). Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents (£0.74), or 1.4%, to 69.41 dollars (£53.86). Consumer-focused companies also rose, as online retailer Amazon.com picked up 23.44 dollars (£18.19), or 2.5%, to 948.43 dollars (£736.02). Before dawn on Monday, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill on Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programmes. Benchmark US crude fell 49 cents (£0.38), or 1%, to 48.84 dollars (£37.90) a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents (£0.41), or 1%, to 51.52 dollars (£39.98) a barrel in London. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to 1.0906 dollars from 1.0895 dollars. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6%. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

Soon, though, a familiar voice could be looking to dominate our living rooms. There is a good chance that Apple debuts a speaker using its Siri technology at the company’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, via MacRumors. Furthermore, not only is a device expected to be revealed soon, but it might not be long before it arrives in stores. “We believe there is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June and start selling in the second half of 2017 in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models to be launched,” Kuo said in a note obtained by MacRumors. He went on to say he expects the device to have “excellent acoustics” and to be priced higher than the Echo. There isn’t much known about the device, but given the reported release window, it wouldn’t surprise us if it featured a built-in camera similar to the one found in Amazon’s recently revealed Echo Look. Also, considering Siri was the first AI voice most people heard, it was only a matter of time before she found her way back into the spotlight.

In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 percent Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, as well as China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation—fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It’s expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. “While we’re starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong,” Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he’s actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. “I’m looking at that right now,” Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” (BusinessDesk) ends Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Trackback-URL  Print This Post comments feed for this post Tweet   No comments yet.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK NEW YORK Apple shares hit a record high on Monday, lifting U.S. stocks and a gauge of key world equity indexes, while data on U.S. drilling and output kept downward pressure on oil prices. Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong." Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 10.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 20,950.63, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 7.62 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,391.82 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 48.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,096.05. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.25 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.16 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.31 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.59 percent. Stocks briefly pared gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg he is actively considering breaking up the largest U.S. banks. Oil slipped more than 1 percent as rising output in Libya and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts. "With four months of the cutting in effect we haven't seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories," said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. "It's not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016." U.S. crude CLcv1 fell 1.28 percent to $48.70 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $51.39, down 1.27 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.03 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.08 percent to $1.0904. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback to 111.86 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2908, down 0.29 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.327 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. Spot gold XAU= dropped 1.0 percent to $1,255.18 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 fell 0.97 percent to $1,256.00 an ounce. Copper CMCU3 rose 0.76 percent to $5,735.50 a tonne.

The apps disappeared as watchOS was updated. Read: Apple Watch Battery Problems: Warranty Extended Following Swollen Battery Damage Reports The most recent update for Google Maps on iOS eliminated its Apple Watch support. On the iTunes store, the removal of the app on the wearable device was not mentioned and only said the app was updated for a turn-by-turn navigation feature, the iMessage app feature and bug fixes. On its compatibility description, Google Maps was listed as requiring “iOS 8.0 or later” and “compatible with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch,” but said nothing about the Apple Watch or watchOS. For the eBay app, the iTunes store also doesn’t list the Apple Watch in the compatibility description and says the new update includes “bug fixes and performance improvements.” The eBay Apple Watch app allowed users to track bid status. The Amazon update also ditched the Apple Watch and mentioned nothing of the change in the description of its new app version. The Amazon and eBay apps were updated late last month and Monday. There are other Apple Watch apps that have been removed, including that of retailer Target, although watchOS integration is still available with its Cartwheel app.   That removal of the apps may have gone unnoticed could be a sign they were not used often, the report said, whereas the taking down of apps on the iPad definitely would have been more noticeable. Read: Apple Watch 3 Release Date: Faster Smartwatch With Cellular Connectivity Launching In Q3 Major companies ditching the Apple Watch comes on the heels of the device’s second anniversary. Apple doesn't give out figures for the Apple Watch in its quarterly earning reports. However, research firm Canalys estimated Apple sold about 6 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 12 percent year-over-year growth from 2015’s fourth quarter. Apple Watch Series 3 Rumors Apple is expected to launch the Apple Watch 3 later this year although the official release date has yet to be announced. A recent report said Apple is planning to use the new power-efficient display technology called micro-LED for its Apple Watch Series 3. It was also rumored the Apple Watch this year will come with an embedded Touch ID, similar to the iPhone 8 rumors, and cellular connectivity. However, a recent survey suggests there is not much enthusiasm among consumers for the Apple Watch Series 3. The survey, conducted by performance-based marketing platform Fluent, said only current Apple Watch owners understand the benefits of the device. The survey found nearly half of current Apple Watch owners, 49 percent, plan to upgrade to the next edition, down from last year’s 62 percent. Those who don’t own an Apple Watch view the gadget as an extra expense and probably won’t get one. Only 5 percent of them say they “definitely will purchase” an Apple Watch in the next year. More than 1,000 respondents were included in the survey, which was conducted in March.

Investors are buying up its shares ahead of the company's earnings on Tuesday. Ben Lau of Apriem Advisors: (SOUNDBITE VIA SKYPE) BEN LAU, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, APRIEM ADVISORS (ENGLISH) SAYING: "There's been talk about how cheap Apple is. They're trading at discount, relative to the S&P 500. But, really, I think the story for Apple is gonna be what's gonna happen later this year when they release the new iPhone. Is it going to be a big seller? Can they make enough? Right? Can they make enough the various versions of iPhones that they're gonna have? They're gonna have a high-end iPhone and a low-end iPhone. And can they actually ramp up production of those? " Tribune Media jumped after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox wants to team up with Blackstone to buy it.

By Jake Swearingen Share Facebook iconShare Twitter iconTweet LinkedIn iconShare Google Plus iconShare Email iconEmail Comment iconComment Print icon Print Siri, imitate Alexa. If rumors are true, you’ll soon be able to have Siri as a smart speaker in your home. Per KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most reliable sources when it comes to forecasting what Cupertino will do, says Apple will likely unveil its own version of the Amazon Echo at WWDC, scheduled for June 5–9 this year. Apple is betting that people are willing to pay a premium for a better-sounding speaker, cramming in seven tweeters and a subwoofer, and taking its design cues from the “trashcan” look of the Mac Pro tower. Per KGI, Apple’s Siri speaker will use an A8 or A9 chip, either of which would would make it significantly more powerful than either an Echo or a Google Home — though, since the Echo and Home mainly work via connecting to remote servers to handle voice recognition and requests, it’s not entirely clear what this extra processing power would do. It’s also not clear when the product would actually arrive. Apple may simply announce that the Siri speaker is coming at WWDC, but not release it until the end of the year. WWDC is aimed at developers much more than to the general public, and an early announcement would give them time to build apps and services made explicitly for voice interaction. Regardless, the move would make sense. It’s really a matter of when, not if, Apple puts out its own AI speaker device. The main reason: Apple’s HomeKit has quietly integrated itself with nearly every smart-home-product manufacturer out there, which is no small feat: HomeKit requires that manufacturers include Apple-certified chips and firmware, which requires deep integration between Apple and partners. But for all that work and time spent with other companies, HomeKit itself remains relatively unknown. At CES this year, every smart-home product was centered squarely on the Echo and Alexa. HomeKit felt like an afterthought. One thing holding HomeKit back? The only real choice for a hub (required to get all of your smart-home gadgetry working in concert) has been the Apple TV, which has seen a troubled development cycle and would be very few people’s media streamer of choice. More importantly, to activate the HomeKit still requires you to pick up your smartphone or Apple TV remote. Amazon’s Echo, thanks to being always on, just requires you to say the words for your lights to turn off, or to find out what the weather is going to be like tomorrow. It’s a bit less friction, which, in the current tech ecosystem, means everything. Meanwhile, there are rumors that Amazon is working on an Echo that would include a touchscreen of some sort, allowing for visual feedback when needed. Google Home, while off to a slow start, has been slowly building the number of smart-home products it can work with, and its skill base. And Microsoft has quietly been working on bringing Cortana into the home as well. Smart-home speakers are a market that Amazon clearly owns right now — Amazon doesn’t provide numbers, but analysts believe tens of millions of Echos have been sold, and KGI predicts that the Echo will soon start outselling the iPad. But while Apple may be entering the game late, that hasn’t hampered the company in the past. Apple didn’t produce the first MP3 player, or the first tablet, or the first smartphone. It just created the best-selling versions of them. We’ll see if Siri can pull off the same trick when it comes time to take on Alexa. 9to5Mac Tags: apple amazon echo Will Apple Unveil Its Version of Amazon’s Echo in June?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Niels Epting Apple has $250 billion in cash just lying around Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 1st, 2017 at 5:54 PM Share Tweet The iPhone, in addition to turning the entire smartphone industry on its head, helped transform Apple into one of the most valuable companies on the planet. With a market cap bordering on $770 billion at the time of writing, not to mention a stock price trading at an all-time high, Apple investors are sitting pretty right about now. Tomorrow, Apple will release its earnings report for the quarter gone-by, and if iPhone sales check in higher than anticipated, Apple shares may skyrocket even higher. Don't Miss: Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up Ahead of Apple’s earnings report, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Apple tomorrow will relay that it now has more than $250 million in the bank. Last we heard, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in cash. “Apple is expected to report Tuesday that its stockpile of cash has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars,” the Journal notes, “an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined.” Of course, the rub is that the vast majority of Apple’s cash resides in bank accounts overseas. Consequently, Apple has shied away from bringing that cash back to the U.S. as to avoid a 35% corporate income tax rate. The following chart via Statista illustrates Apple’s current cash situation. Stowing away cash overseas is hardly an efficient way to take advantage of  years worth of iPhone-fueled profits, but that may all change now that Donald Trump is President. During the course of the 2016 Presidential election, Trump’s tax plan listed on its website indicated that it will provide businesses with the opportunity to repatriate profits “held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.” Suffice it to say, if Trump follows through on his promise, Apple stands to enjoy a staggering amount of tax savings. In a hypothetical scenario where Apple opts to repatriate $75 billion, it would save approximately $18.7 billion under Trump’s proposed tax holiday. In the meantime, Apple is in no rush to do anything drastic with its vast cash reserves overseas. Speaking to this point, Tim Cook relayed the following during a 2013 interview with the Washington Post: “If you look at it today, to repatriate cash to the US, you need to pay 35 percent of that cash. And that is a very high number. We are not proposing that it be zero. I know many of our peers believe that. But I don’t view that. But I think it has to be reasonable.” Tags: Apple View Comments Trending 1 Tech Nintendo can’t keep up with Switch demand, even using airplanes 2 Tech Even more Galaxy S8 problems are beginning to pop up 3 Tech The Galaxy Note 8 might fix everything that’s ‘wrong’ with the Galaxy S8 4 Tech The OnePlus 5’s camera will be fantastic if these leaked photos are real 5 Deals Amazon’s 15 best daily deals: Amazon Echo sale, Fitbits, Alexa smart plugs, Roku Ultra, and more Picked For You Asus C302 review: A $500 MacBook for everyone By Chris Mills May 1st at 4:42 PM Don’t worry, we’ll help you ditch your iPhone and switch to the Galaxy S8 By Zach Epstein May 1st at 11:51 AM You can actually get a 4K TV for half the price of an iPhone By Maren Estrada April 30th at 10:30 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad Post to Cancel
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman While you were sleeping: Nasdaq climbs to fresh high Tuesday, 2 May 2017, 10:00 am Article: BusinessDesk Tuesday 02 May 2017 06:58 AM While you were sleeping: Nasdaq climbs to fresh high By Margreet Dietz May 2 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street climbed, sending the Nasdaq to a fresh record high, amid optimism about corporate earnings such as from Apple, while US Treasuries declined. In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 percent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 percent Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, as well as China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 percent and 1.3 percent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation—fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It’s expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 percent, from 4.5 percent. „The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. „While we’re starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong,” Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he’s actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. “I’m looking at that right now,” Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. “There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” (BusinessDesk) ends © Scoop Media Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

Abhijit Ahaskar The IDC report points that the discounts and deals on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge allowed Samsung to clear out the inventory. Photo: AP Chinese smartphone makers continue to be the key drivers of growth in the smartphone market. According to International Data Corporation’s (IDC) Worldwide quarterly mobile phone tracker report for the first quarter of 2017, global smartphone market registered a growth of 4.3%, and the biggest drivers of this growth are Chinese brands such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. Samsung retains number one position Samsung has replaced Apple as the number one smartphone brand of 1Q 2017 in terms of market share and shipments, globally. Apple was the leading phone company in fourth quarter of 2016 with market share of 18.3%, while Samsung came a close second with market share of 18.1%. In 1Q 2017, Samsung shipped 79.2 million units and holds 22.8% market share. Their total shipment in 1Q 2016 was 79.2 million and market share was 23.8%. In 1Q 2017, Apple shipped 51.6 million units, up from 51.2 million units in the same quarter last year, but the market share has gone down from 15.4% to 14.9% during the same period. The IDC report points that the discounts and deals on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge allowed Samsung to clear out the inventory. While budget and mid-range smartphones in the J series and A series helped drive volumes in both emerging and developing markets. Click here for enlarge The dragon onslaught The three Chinese smartphone makers, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, registered better year-on-year growth in terms of global smartphone market share compared to more established rivals such as Samsung and Apple. Huawei, which also sells smartphones under the Honor sub-brand, shipped 34.2 million units and reported a market share of 9.8 %, up from 28 million shipments and a market share of 8.4% in 1Q 2016. The company registered a year-on-year growth of 21% and is currently the third-biggest smartphone seller after Samsung and Apple. Oppo and Vivo, which occupy the fourth and fifth slot, reported an even better year-on-year growth of 29.8% and 23.6%, respectively. Oppo shipped 25.6 million units and has a market share of 7.4%, up from 19.7 million units and 5.9% market share in 1Q 2016. Vivo shipped 18.1 million units and has a market share of 5.2%, up from 14.6 million units and 4.4% market share in 1Q 2016. The IDC report attributes Oppo and Vivo’s success to their camera-focused smartphones and expansion outside of China. Almost a quarter of all Oppo shipments were made outside China. Vivo’s emphasis on marketing efforts, especially in India, has improved its brand presence. Despite its failure to make a mark in the US market, Huawei has done well in both premium and affordable segments in China. Strong demand for smartphones Despite the concerns about stagnation in the smartphone market last year, 1Q 2017 saw a steady growth. A total of 347.4 million units were shipped worldwide in 1Q 2017, marking an increase of 4.3% from the 332.2 million units shipped in 1Q 2016. “The first quarter smartphone results further prove that the smartphone industry is not dead and that growth still exists,” said Ryan Reith, program vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Device Trackers.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Some big names quietly called time on their Apple Watch apps Chris Davies - May 1, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit High profile mobile apps have been quietly dropping support for Apple Watch, reigniting questions about just what the main point of wearable tech is. The smartwatch most recently spawned a new, NikeLab version, with an updated strap and a focus on fitness. Indeed, Apple billed most of its improvements in the Apple Watch Series 2 as being around health. Question is, are people using their Apple Watch for anything else? Judging by some of the high-profile third-party applications that have discreetly ditched the watchOS side of their software, the answer might not be what Apple was hoping to hear. Google, Amazon, and eBay have all removed their Apple Watch functionality in recent updates over the past few weeks, AppleInsider spotted. They’re not alone, either, with Target among others. In each case, no specific notification of the feature removal was given in the app release notes. Indeed, there’s been little chatter at all about third-party software for the smartwatch. That begs the question of just how many users actually missed the features when they were removed. The sales success of Apple’s wearable has always been a controversial topic. Since the Cupertino firm doesn’t break out Apple Watch figures individually, as it does for, say, iPhone and iPad, there’s no official way to tell quite how many have been sold. The party line has always been that Apple is happy with how demand is playing out, but it’s not hard to imagine that Apple Watch sales are only a small fraction of iPhone sales. Similarly, it’s difficult to tell exactly what most people actually wearing the smartwatch rely on it for. The best guess – going by Apple’s focus at the Series 2 launch, at least – is that it’s primarily for glanceable notifications and fitness tracking. Indeed, the Apple Watch Series 2 added features specifically to improve that, including standalone GPS for fitness tracking when you don’t have your iPhone on you. That given, more advanced apps like eBay, Amazon, and Google Maps not finding traction may not be too surprising. After all, it’s questionable just how much people want to do from their wrists, when their smartphone is usually just a short distance away. Nonetheless it’s a further sign that the software ecosystem for wearable technologies is still in a state of flux, and that if big developers like Google and Amazon are struggling to figure out how to successfully capitalize on it, it’s likely to be even tougher for smaller teams.

Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. ENERGY North Dakota asks Trump for federal aid North Dakota's governor is asking President Donald Trump for federal reimbursement of $38 million in state law enforcement costs related to months of protests over construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Gov. Doug Burgum e-mailed Trump Saturday seeking a presidential disaster declaration to pave the way for federal aid. Burgum spokesman Mike Nowatzki confirmed the request to the Associated Press on Monday. White House officials didn't immediately comment on the likelihood of Trump declaring a disaster. PHARMACEUTICALS FDA OKs advanced bladder cancer drug U.S. regulators have approved a new drug that harnesses the immune system to treat advanced bladder cancer. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Imfinzi along with a companion diagnostic test for identifying which patients are most likely to benefit from it. Imfinzi, also known as durvalumab, is part of a new generation of drugs which stimulate the immune system to help fight cancer. AstraZeneca, Imfinzi's developer, says the average monthly list price for the drug is roughly $15,000, but varies with the patient's weight. It's given by IV every two weeks.

The uniforms are easily copied so that fake employees can blend in with the real ones. Also, the open display of products makes them easily susceptible to, say, a steel ball crushing each and every one of them. And in some cases, it doesn’t help that the work culture inside a particular Apple Store ends up preying on co-workers and customers. So, it might not be surprising that two Apple Store locations around the San Diego area were robbed in broad daylight on Friday. KGTV reports that the first one took place at Westfield UTC mall just before 11am local time. The other took place half an hour later, 10 miles away at the Fashion Valley mall location. San Diego police say they’re looking for three male suspects in their 20s and a load of computers and iPhones worth about $10,000. Surveillance footage shows that the men didn’t even have to use their knives or make threats to employees — the devices were simply ripped from their cords on the display tables. That reduces potential charges from armed robbery to grand theft. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

Can the mobile-chip maker navigate through the fierce headwinds without sinking? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 1, 2017 at 4:47PM Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) declined nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, because of ongoing concerns about its core chipmaking and patent licensing businesses. Let's examine the bearish and bullish takes on this stock to see if it will sink or swim this year. Why Qualcomm could sink Qualcomm generates most of its revenue through its lower-margin chipmaking business, and most of its profits through its higher-margin patent licensing business. Image source: Qualcomm. The Qualcomm CDMA technologies (QCT) business, which makes Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon processors, is ceding market share to cheaper chipmakers such as MediaTek and first-party chips from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi. The QCT unit also recently lost its exclusive spot producing baseband modems for iPhones to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which won a portion of the design wins for the iPhone 7. The Qualcomm technology licensing (QTL) business, which owns a massive portfolio of 3G and 4G patents, collects royalties on every smartphone sold worldwide. That business model is being challenged by defiant OEMs and government regulators, which claim that Qualcomm's cut -- 3.5% to 5% of the entire device's price -- is too high. There are also persistent allegations that Qualcomm leveraged its dominance of wireless patents to push former chipmaking rivals such as Texas Instruments out of the application processor market. As a result, Qualcomm was fined in China and South Korea, had to negotiate new licensing terms with Chinese OEMs, was charged by the FTC for using anti-competitive tactics, lost a royalty dispute with BlackBerry, and was sued by Apple. Apple even recently stopped paying all licensing revenues to contract manufacturers of the iPhone, which forced Qualcomm to slash its third-quarter forecasts sales forecast by $500 million. That bleak warning indicates that Wall Street's current estimates for flat sales growth and 5% earnings growth this year might be far too optimistic. Why Qualcomm could swim Qualcomm's near-term headwinds look brutal, but the company remains the best in breed producer of mobile systems on chips, which bundle together application processors, GPUs, and baseband modems. Samsung's use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 in U.S. versions of the new Galaxy S8 indicate that the chip will probably keep powering top-tier flagship devices for the foreseeable future. Qualcomm is also diversifying its QCT business away from mobile devices, with new Snapdragon chipsets for wearables, drones, connected cars, other Internet of Things gadgets, PCs, and even data centers -- which should all reduce the weight of smartphone chips on Qualcomm's top line. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm claims that its Snapdragon Wear chips already power over 80% of Android Wear smartwatches worldwide. It also recently partnered with Microsoft to develop Snapdragon processors, which were fully compatible with Windows 10, and launched high-end chips for ARM-based servers. Both moves clearly target Intel's PC and data center strongholds. Qualcomm's planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which was recently approved by U.S. regulators, will also make it the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world and boost its estimated revenues for 2018 by nearly 40%. This move, which complements the launch of its Snapdragon Automotive chips in 2015, will help it challenge companies like NVIDIA in the connected and driverless car markets over the next few years. As for licensing fees, Qualcomm's patent portfolio still gives it plenty of legal clout against defiant companies like Apple. Qualcomm might eventually be forced to reduce its cut -- for example, basing its cut on the price of wireless components instead of the entire device -- but fines and lawsuits won't likely kill the entire business. Lastly, Qualcomm is a cheap stock with a high dividend -- which is increasingly rare in today's frothy market. The stock trades at 18 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 28; and it pays a forward dividend yield of 4.3%, which is supported by a comfortable payout ratio of 71%. Those figures should limit Qualcomm's downside potential for the foreseeable future. My verdict: Qualcomm will tread water It will be tough for Qualcomm to rally meaningfully this year, because of all the challenges it faces from rival chipmakers, irate regulators, and defiant licensees. But I also doubt that it will sink, since its expansion into adjacent markets and the NXP deal should greatly improve its long-term prospects. Instead, I believe that it will tread water, since its low valuation and high dividend should attract income investors and set a floor under the stock.    Teresa Kersten is an employee of LinkedIn and is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong." Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 10.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 20,950.63, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 7.62 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,391.82 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 48.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,096.05. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.25 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.16 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 0.31 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.59 percent. Stocks briefly pared gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg he is actively considering breaking up the largest U.S. banks. Oil slipped more than 1 percent as rising output in Libya and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts. "With four months of the cutting in effect we haven't seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories," said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. "It's not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016." U.S. crude fell 1.28 percent to $48.70 per barrel and Brent was last at $51.39, down 1.27 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.03 percent, with the euro up 0.08 percent to $1.0904. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback to 111.86 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2908, down 0.29 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.327 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. Spot gold dropped 1.0 percent to $1,255.18 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.97 percent to $1,256.00 an ounce. Copper rose 0.76 percent to $5,735.50 a tonne.

Reuters Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Stocks boosted by Apple in light May Day trading; oil slips By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple shares hit a record high on Monday, lifting U.S. stocks and a gauge of key world equity indexes, while data on U.S. drilling and output kept downward pressure on oil prices. Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong." Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 10.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 20,950.63, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 7.62 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,391.82 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 48.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,096.05.

Apple shares jumped 2 percent and set a record high, supporting the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday.

Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs.

Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year."

The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high.

The S&P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

Major apps like Google Maps, Amazon, and eBay appear to have quietly abandoned the Apple Watch App Store, without giving a heads-up or providing any explanation to users. AI reports that Google pulled support for its Maps app on watchOS a few weeks ago, while recent updates to the Amazon and eBay apps no longer reference support for the Apple Watch. Other affected apps include Target (the main one, not its coupon app Cartwheel) and TripAdvisor. A TripAdvisor thread dating back to February questioned the changes, but users said they emailed technical support and received no response. The lack of a response or explanation from these companies seem peculiar — AI speculates it’s likely that users were simply not using the apps which is why the change went mostly unnoticed for weeks. This would theoretically explain why developers may have thought it was best to discontinue support. After all, shopping on apps like Target, eBay, and Amazon on your wrist is probably not ideal. For Google Maps users on the Apple Watch, however, it’s back to Apple Maps for now. Maybe something will come out of watchOS 4? We’ve reached out to the above companies for comment and will update if we hear back.

Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday.So far, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston."While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong."

By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it CEO Tim Cook holds up the billionth iPhone sold in front of employees at Apple headquarters in July 2016. Apple’s success with the iPhone has helped the company build a record $250 billion in cash reserves. (Apple) By Thomas Heath By Thomas Heath May 1 at 5:04 PM Follow @addedvalueth So much cash is raining on some U.S.-based corporations that they are at a loss on what to do with all the money. With the $250 billion sitting in its bank account, Apple could comfortably go out and buy Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, at today’s market price without borrowing a penny. The technology giant would still have $50 billion left to buy more than 700,000 Tesla model S electric cars or about four Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. Then there’s Microsoft. The Seattle-based software maker has the second-largest stash, at $126 billion, enough to buy a $100,000 home for 1.2 million Americans. And the blizzards of green are not limited to the tech sector. Legendary investor Warren Buffett will preside over his annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting this weekend in Omaha — known as “Woodstock for Capitalists” — while his company sits on $86 billion in cash. That’s enough to pay for New York City’s government operations for a year. The cash hoards are coming to the forefront as earnings season is heating up. U.S. companies are reporting mostly robust profits, and the stock market, especially technology shares, are ballooning. Some investors have cautioned that equities are frothy in light of the geopolitical risks such as North Korea and the political divide in the country. [Tim Cook, the interview: Running Apple ‘is sort of a lonely job’] A big part of the reason behind the rich corporate caches is taxes — or unpaid taxes. Apple, Microsoft and many other U.S.-based international companies are sitting on well more than $2 trillion in cash from untaxed overseas profits, which could be brought back to the United States to be used for investment and dividends if lawmakers lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35 percent is one of the highest in the world. “Apple is one of the best companies in the world, and a third of their value is sitting in vaults in Switzerland and Luxembourg and Dublin,” said Timothy Loughran, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “Isn’t that pathetic?” The Trump administration has promised to lower the corporate tax rate significantly. Economists and politicians on both sides of the aisle have said a lower corporate tax rate or a tax holiday that repatriates money from overseas will unleash hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, in dividends and business investments in the United States. “Companies have been accumulating cash over many years,” said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland’s Smith School of Business. “The perverse disincentives of our current corporate tax system are discouraging corporations from bringing back international profits to invest in the U.S.” Apple chief executive Tim Cook, in an interview with The Washington Post last year, said federal and state taxes on Apple’s cash reserves, the vast majority of which is overseas, is about 40 percent. Many U.S.-based companies leave their earnings overseas rather than pay the U.S. rate. [Republicans’ plan to cut corporate taxes would lead to massive revenue losses] “We’ve said at 40 percent, we’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate,” Cook said, adding that his company is the largest U.S. taxpayer. “There’s no debate about it. It is the current tax law. It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. “We think it’s fine for us to pay more, because right now we’re paying nothing on that and we leave it over there,” he said. “But we — like many, many other companies do — wait for the money to come back.” If the corporate rate is reduced or a holiday is granted, Apple, Microsoft and others could pay a special dividend, buy back shares or both. They could also make acquisitions, although Apple has preferred to grow organically by inventing new products such as the iPhone and iPad and investing in itself. Apple earned $45.6 billion in profit in 2016 on revenue of $215 billion. It paid a handsome dividend of $2.18, although the rise in share price has cut its yield to about 1.7 percent and made the shares much less of a bargain than they once were. If Apple chose a special dividend, its $250 billion would cover a $48 payment on each of its 5.2 billion shares. That is highly unlikely, although some lump sum dividend is possible, and it could touch nearly every American who has a retirement plan or owns taxable mutual funds. [A boring business that Warren Buffett would love ] “What is going to happen when Apple has $1 trillion in cash?” said Loughran, pointing out that the iPhone 10 is due out this year. “It won’t be that long. What are we going to do then? The way I think about it is the treasure of America sitting in a vault in Switzerland. We created $250 billion from profits and we are not using it. This is an obvious reform that is needed.” Kass said he expects a major return by Apple to shareholders through several vehicles, including an increase in the Apple dividend, stock buybacks and a big one-time dividend. He said it is less likely that Apple would make acquisitions, given the company’s historic aversion to them. Berkshire Hathaway has little in overseas exposure because most of its profits are made in the United States. And Buffett has been reluctant for Berkshire Hathaway to pay dividends, arguing that he can make better use of the money by finding smart investments. “His companies are sufficiently profitable, and he is very patient, that his cash has accumulated over several years,” Kass said. “But if the corporate rate is lowered from 35 percent to 15, 20, 25, it will result in additional profits for Berkshire and just about every other American-based corporation. “If that takes place, then Warren Buffett’s pile of cash will increase much further,” he said.

Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far in this earnings season, reported and expected profits at S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well." Shares of the largest five U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft , Amazon and Facebook hit intraday or closing highs - or both - on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 20,913.46, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.00 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,091.60. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.32 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.59 percent. Stocks briefly pared gains midway through the U.S. session after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg he is actively considering breaking up the largest U.S. banks, but the losses were quickly reversed. Oil slipped 1.2 percent as rising output in Libya and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts. "With four months of the cutting in effect we haven't seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories," said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. "It's not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016." U.S. crude fell 1.22 percent to $48.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $51.43, down 1.19 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro up 0.03 percent to $1.0898. The Japanese yen weakened 0.27 percent versus the greenback to 111.86 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2884, down 0.48 percent on the day. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell in thin volume, pressured by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying the government is looking into the issuance of ultralong-term bonds, or those with maturities beyond 30 years. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.3216 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 1-1/32 in price to yield 3.0038 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent to $1,256.66 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.84 percent to $1,257.60 an ounce. Copper rose 0.76 percent to $5,735.50 a tonne.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple 5 Expected Features Of Apple's Rumored Siri Speaker Rishabh Jain International Business Times April 30, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share The abrupt end to Apple's relationship with Imagination Technologies led to a huge fall in its share price Tuesday.More Apple is rumored to be making a smart speaker on the lines of the Google Home and Amazon Echo. Phone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted Thursday that the device, which would run using the company’s voice assistant Siri and its AirPlay functionality, would use the Siri voice assistant and AirPlay functionality.  Read: Apple smart speaker in the works? He further said that the device would use the company’s Beats Audio technology and will run on iOS. While Apple is still mum on the device’s existence, let alone its features, there are chances that the company could launch the device at the World Wide Developers Conference in June in San Francisco. Here are five expected specs of the device: Facial recognition tech: According to CNET, the device might have a built-in camera like the Amazon Echo Look to detect multiple users. Voice-based smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home have a problem doing so and sometimes get confused between voices. A built-in camera would help the speakers respond to both visual and audio input, which means differentiating between users will be much easier.    Beats Audio: Apple’s devices have generally received good feedback for their audio and the company has its own wireless earphones, AirPods, which it sells separately for $159. So, its eventual move towards speakers is not unexpected. The company is expected to employ Beats Audio technology in the speaker, which could have a concave Mac Pro-like design with audio and other controls at the concave top. Beats Audio is the name for signature noise-cancelling technology that Apple uses in its devices to provide its users with clear audio. For the speaker, it might involve the use of components such as high-grade plastic and insulated wires to ensure clear audio. Touchscreen: Unlike Google and Amazon’s devices, Apple is not just making a smart speaker that responds to your voice, but one that is iOS-based. This means that the device will have a touchscreen, which would give you access to multiple apps at once. Say, for example you use the Nike+ running app. You might be able to get the speaker to simply put out your running targets and tell you how far you are from your goal by connecting to the app. Improved Siri: Apple has been expected to have an improved version of Siri for some time to match up with the evolving functionality of the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, apart from other artificial intelligence based voice assistants such as Cortana. The company could probably unveil an improved version of Siri, which would be designed to support the smart speaker. Read: Apple’s Self Driving Car In The Works? Smart home functionality: The essential reason behind Apple designing a smart speaker is its goal of creating a smart Home, something CEO Tim Cook has indicated many times in the past. The Apple smart speaker is expected to be compatible with its HomeKit framework for communicating and controlling connected devices.        Related Articles What Are Sheeple?

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 172/3 (69) - WI 312/10 (98.5) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Technology News GLOBAL MARKETS-Wall St gains buoy stocks in light May Day trading; oil falls Shares1 Tue, 2 May 2017-02:45am , Reuters Shares of the largest U.S. companies hit record highs on Monday, lifting Wall Street and a gauge of key world equity indexes, while data on U.S. drilling and output kept downward pressure on oil prices. Global trading was light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. So far in this earnings season, reported and expected profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well." Shares of the largest five U.S. companies by market capitalization, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft , Amazon and Facebook hit intraday or closing highs - or both - on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 20,913.46, the S&P 500 gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.00 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,091.60. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.18 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.32 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.59 percent. Stocks briefly pared gains midway through the U.S. session after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg he is actively considering breaking up the largest U.S. banks, but the losses were quickly reversed. Oil slipped 1.2 percent as rising output in Libya and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts. "With four months of the cutting in effect we haven't seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories," said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. "It's not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016." U.S. crude fell 1.22 percent to $48.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $51.43, down 1.19 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro up 0.03 percent to $1.0898. The Japanese yen weakened 0.27 percent versus the greenback to 111.86 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2884, down 0.48 percent on the day. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell in thin volume, pressured by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying the government is looking into the issuance of ultralong-term bonds, or those with maturities beyond 30 years. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.3216 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 1-1/32 in price to yield 3.0038 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent to $1,256.66 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.84 percent to $1,257.60 an ounce. Copper rose 0.76 percent to $5,735.50 a tonne. ) (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Featuresby Dane O'Leary10 hours ago 41 412 19 The fact that smartphones are essentially pocket-sized computers has never been more apparent than it is today. Take the latest iPhone or Galaxy out of your pocket and try to think of something that the device can’t do: Web browsing? That’s old news. Mobile applications? Got those in spades. Cameras of such a high quality that standalone point-and-shoots are all but obsolete? You betcha. High-definition portable media consumption? Check. Wireless printing? Assuming anybody ever needs to print anything on actual paper these days, yes, that’s here, too. And the list goes on and on. With such accouterments now a standard part of the smartphone experience, it’s easy to forget that it wasn’t very long ago that the smartphone was just coming into its own. Mobile web-browsing was a standout feature and a smartphone display’s pixel-per-inch count could barely even conceive of crossing into the triple digits. But the smartphone has grown, evolved, matured. The current lineup of smartphones have biometric security with fingerprint- and iris-scanning. Plus, we’ve seen that mobile phones could conceivably double as a replacement for your desktop computer (re: Samsung’s DeX and projects like the Superbook). Although I’ve made no contribution to the advancement of smartphones or mobile technology, the tech-lover in me is quite proud to see that the smartphone has become a burgeoning industry. To honor the prominent place that this technology now holds, for better or worse, in our hearts and daily lives, let’s take a moment to look back on the Android phones that predicted the future, one feature at a time. What’s interesting is many of the most lasting features actually debuted in phones that were less than runaway hits at the time. Dell Streak and big screens Dell was never a big name in the Android world, and today doesn’t even offer smartphones. Despite this, Dell actually was among the first to truly embrace big screens with the Dell Streak 5. At the time, the 5-inch display was considered absolutely massive. Of course, back then, bezels were much thicker than they are on today’s devices. Dell never hit it big with the Streak 5, but it seemingly inspired plenty of other smartphone makers to aim for bigger screens, including Samsung with its original Galaxy Note.  The Galaxy Note is essentially credited for making bigger phones more popular, but it was Dell that truly dived in first. It’s interesting to think just how much screen size has changed, with a large chunk of mainstream phones these days easily hitting 5.5-inches or larger. LeTV Le 1 and USB Type-C Wired interfacing with smartphones has always been done via USB OTG (which stands for “on the go”). In the Android world, wired interfacing with smartphones was almost always done via the micro-USB connector, which is still seen on phones today (albeit less and less frequently). While some might say it was limitations in data and power transmission, arguably the biggest issue with micro-USB was that it had to be inserted in a specific orientation; if you tried to insert a upsidedown micro-USB connector into the corresponding micro-USB port of an Android smartphone, it was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. No dice. In the late summer of 2014, USB Type C was unveiled. This next-generation USB OTG connector was both reversible (hallelujah!) and could transfer data much faster than previous generations. Both Apple and Google quickly began to adopt the technology with Apple’s MacBook and Google’s Pixel tablet line donning USB Type-C ports. However, the designation of “first smartphone to ever have USB Type-C” goes to the LeTV Le 1, released in the spring of 2015. Of course, there would be numerous others to follow soon thereafter, including the Huawei-made Google Nexus 6P and 5X. Fast-forward to 2017 and USB Type-C is very nearly the universal standard among smartphones. HTC One M8 and dual rear cameras Mainstream consumers who are less dialed-in when it comes to tech may not be familiar with the Honor brand, but a number of us might reflexively attribute the first dual-camera setup on a smartphone to the Honor 6 Plus; however, that’s not exactly true. Before the Honor 6 Plus was released at the tail end of 2014, HTC released the One M8 with its dual rear-facing cameras in March. Although the HTC renaissance hadn’t yet started with the HTC 10, the One M8 was a very well-received device. It was a strong performer in terms of processing power, had an admirable display, and the ever-popular front-facing BoomSound speakers were present. Ironically, it was the device’s camera performance that many found lacking. The purpose of the extra sensor was to feed additional depth data to the primary camera, which would, in theory, result in a better and more crisp photo. Unfortunately, the primary camera wasn’t all that great to begin with; dynamic range was poor and all but the best-lit conditions were difficult environments in which to shoot. Fortunately, the fate of the dual cameras didn’t actually rest on the performance of the One M8 in the photography department as we’re beginning to see dual-camera smartphones released regularly from many of the industry’s biggest players. Vivo Xplay 3S and QHD display   Remember when HD (720p) was the pinnacle of smartphone display technology? Nowadays, it’s 1440p QHD that is all but standard when it comes to mobile displays, resulting in more and more consumers scoffing at 1080p FHD. However, it wasn’t all that long ago when 1080p was as good at is got. We owe the genesis of our obsession with pixel count to the Vivo Xplay 3S. First unveiled in late 2013, the Vivo Xplay 3S featured a six-inch display with 2560×1440 resolution; in other words, it was a 2K display. At the time, it had been just a year since 1080p display technology began appearing on smartphones, but Vivo was keen on giving us another big push into the future. In hindsight, display quality was the perfect smartphone feature with which to innovate, especially since many of us use our smartphones quite extensively for mobile media consumption. Today, flagship-level smartphones almost always feature 1440p QHD displays, which have even begun to appear on mid-range, “budget flagships”. HTC Droid DNA and wireless charging Even though we take them for granted today, smartphones still feel a lot like a futuristic, Jetsons-like form of technology, and they continue to get more and more advanced. At this stage in the game, many of us are dreaming of a world where our pocket-sized computers are can interface with the internet and other devices while never being tethered by any wires. We’re nowhere near that world yet, but we’ve taken some steps in that direction with things like Bluetooth and wireless charging. The first Android smartphone to sport wireless charging was the HTC Droid DNA; coincidentally, it was also the first Verizon smartphone with a 1080p display, but that’s beside the point. Released in December of 2012, the Droid DNA featured a non-removable 2020 mAh battery, which is puny by today’s standards, and built-in Qi wireless inductive charging. It goes without saying that wireless charging has quite taken off in the same way that 1440p displays and USB Type-C have, but there is a growing roster of smartphones that support Qi charging, whether built-in or via an add-on accessory. The main issues with wireless charging is that it’s slower and it basically means being unable to use your phone while it charges since the phone has to be making contact with the charging pad to receive power; however, as Samsung’s wireless fast-charging pods have proven, this technology is still improving and will only continue to grow as we move forward. LG G6 and 18:9+ aspect ratio You’ve probably noticed a major trend in smartphones, which is that they’re getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Back in the flip-phone days, we wanted small and slim, but with video streaming and media consumption being a top function of today’s smartphones, we need all the screen real estate we can get. It’s getting to the point where we don’t really hear the term “phablet” anymore because virtually all smartphones feature 5.5-inch displays or larger. The problem with smartphones continuing to grow in size is that they’re becoming unwieldy, and that’s where the new aspect ratio comes in. Until the LG G6, the aspect ratio of virtually all smartphones was 16:9, which is the same aspect ratio of computer monitors, most laptop displays, and even our high-definition televisions. Basically, the 16:9 aspect ratio means that the rectangular display is 16 units across and 9 units high. The G6 was notable because it launched with an aspect ratio of 18:9 (or 2:1), meaning that it’s twice as long as it is wide. In short, this aspect ratio allows you to put a bigger display on a smartphone while either maintaining its width or possible even decreasing it. Since it’s a smartphone’s width that determines whether it can be used single-handedly, the 18:9 aspect ratio means we can have a smartphone with a larger display without it feeling like a larger phone. Seeing the 18:9 aspect ratio on the LG G6 was odd at first, but Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus have just launched with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio; in other words, the S8 devices’ displays are slightly more than twice as long than they are wide. With two of the biggest smartphone manufacturers in the world making smartphones with an 18+:9 aspect ratio, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing this on many more to come. But now I want to hear from you. What do you think were the smartphone features that predicted the future? Did you personally own one of the phones I mentioned above? What kinds of features do you think we’ll be seeing from smartphones in the months and years to come? Sound off in the comments below.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) TOKYO (AP) — Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. “The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings,” said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine — AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Apple —which has had a difficult time gaining approval to open retail locations in the country because of India’s rules that require at least 30 percent of its product materials locally — recently opted to move forward with plans to produce the iPhone SE in India without waiting for the concessions it had been requesting from the Indian government. Producing the iPhone SE in India means it can also be sold there “since the government allows companies to directly sell online models manufactured locally.” The company reportedly plans to start assembling the devices in Bengaluru by June and offer “value-added services such as laser engraving to personalize the handset, sell models or variants which are exclusive such as a dedicated model, color option or storage space” once the devices go on sale online, one source said.

The American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. Tech stocks lifted a Wall Street rally today. ASSOCIATED PRESS BLADE Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rose today as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year. Technology companies have set the pace all year and are up more than twice as much as the rest of the market. Apple and Facebook, which will report their first-quarter results in the next few days, helped lead the way. BLADE Enlarge RELATED: Searchable stock index Investors were relieved that the threat of a government shutdown appears to have been averted, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. Technology companies and banks have stood out in the first quarter, said David Schiegoleit, the head of investments at U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. He said many different types of technology companies are doing well, especially ones that cater to consumers. A key reason is that after years of trouble, economies outside the U.S. are improving. “Emerging market economies are starting to get better momentum and we’re also starting to see some pretty decent activity out of Europe,” he said. “All the different major components of the technology sector are posting double-digit (earnings) gains.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Thanks to the gains for technology companies, the Nasdaq composite rose 44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,091.60, and set another record high. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks gained 6.93 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,407.36. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for technology companies and banks to rise 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. While most banks have already released their results, there are dozens of technology companies remaining to report. Apple climbed $2.95, or 2.1 percent, to $146.60 and Facebook added $2.21, or 1.5 percent, to $152.46. Microsoft, which disclosed its earnings last week, rose 95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.41. Consumer-focused companies also rose, as online retailer Amazon.com picked up $23.44, or 2.5 percent, to $948.43. Before dawn today, Congress unveiled a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The House is currently scheduled to vote on the bill Wednesday. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. With investors reassured, they sold bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.32 percent from 2.29 percent. That sent interest rates higher, which allows banks to charge higher interest rates on loans. Capital One Financial advanced $1.19, or 1.5 percent, at $81.57 and Citizens Financial rose 56 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $37.13. Investors also sold high-dividend stocks including utilities, phone companies and makers of household goods. Aerospace companies struggled after aircraft parts distributor Wesco Aircraft Holdings gave a weak second-quarter forecast. The company also said its president and CEO retired, and its stock tumbled $2.20, or 18.1 percent, to $9.95. Boeing fell $2.44, or 1.3 percent, to $182.39 and aircraft and helicopter maker Textron gave up 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.13. Industrial companies lagged the rest of the market following a report that output by U.S. factories didn’t grow as much as analysts expected. The Institute for Supply Management said new orders and hiring grew more slowly in April. Tribune Media rose after the Financial Times reported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Blackstone may make a joint takeover bid for the company. Tribune Media has stakes in Food Network, WGN cable network and owns TV stations. Tribune stock gained $2.19, or 6 percent, to $38.75. The companies declined to comment. Sinclair Broadcast Group is also reported to be interested in buying Tribune. Investment management company AllianceBernstein fell after it replaced Peter Kraus as chairman and CEO and removed most of the directors of its board. Kraus has led the company since 2008. The company named a new non-executive chairman and separate CEO, and removed nine of the 11 members of the board. It named six new directors. The stock gave up 75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $22.15. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline lost 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 6 cents to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver fell 42 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.84 an ounce. Copper rose 5 cents, or 2 percent, to $2.66 a pound. The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111.44 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0906 from $1.0895. Many markets in Asia and Europe were closed for May Day. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 was an exception and it gained 0.6 percent. Stocks in Japan were helped by a weaker yen and strong readings in a manufacturing survey.

Some high-profile iPhone apps still have outdated Apple Watch versions or no version at all. Now a few big name companies are quietly pulling their existing Apple Watch apps altogether. Sony A6500 I briefly mentioned this situation in my watchOS 4 wishlist last month: I would also love to see Apple push developers to revisit their Apple Watch apps now that watchOS has matured and improved greatly since day one. A lot of Apple Watch apps from big name companies like Twitter and Instagram haven’t changed since launch but could benefit from using new watchOS features. More evangelizing or incentivizing developers could be a benefit for consumers. Both the Twitter and Instagram apps I mentioned are examples of the first round of Apple Watch apps that heavily rely on the iPhone. These apps run slower because of it and don’t work at all when the iPhone isn’t connected. Native Apple Watch apps that run faster are more independent and can still work on Wi-Fi when an iPhone is not nearby. Potential performance improvements aside, Instagram could also benefit from updating the Apple Watch app with features that weren’t possible when the original version was created like video playback support. It may be that usage just doesn’t justify the work, but it’s also possible that usage just isn’t there because the app hasn’t been maintained. Instagram’s parent company Facebook launched a modern Apple Watch app for its Messenger platform, but there’s never been a Facebook Apple Watch app. In theory, Facebook could create an Apple Watch app that’s centered around notifications, check-ins, and even photos and videos. High profile app makers ignoring Apple Watch apps is one thing, but Apple Insider points to at least three big name companies completely removing Apple Watch apps through recent iOS app updates. Amazon, eBay, and now Google Maps have each released new versions of their iPhone app that also remove the Apple Watch versions. Amazon offered a basic Apple Watch app that featured one big button for dictating a search entry then tapping an item to purchase with one-click enabled. It was a clever concept but not very practical for most users. eBay’s Apple Watch app focused more on actionable notifications for new activity when auctioning items or bidding on an auction. eBay’s Apple Watch app was even featured in an Apple Watch ad as a demonstration of how actionable alerts are convenient and useful. Google Maps is the latest app to remove Apple Watch support without offering an explanation. You can guess that lack of engagement is to blame, and in Google’s defense it is understandably difficult to make a decent Apple Watch app for something as complex as a map. Google Maps for Apple Watch instead focused on quick access to certain places like home and work that Apple Maps later adopted. Three examples of apps disappearing from the Apple Watch is concerning (especially if automatic updates are enabled and release notes don’t mention app removals), but it doesn’t mean there’s no place for apps to be successful on the Apple Watch.  You can browse the Apple Watch App Store and see that the catalog alone has quantity, but some of the apps I mentioned before are featured (and likely not because of their quality). Overcast and Pokémon Go are a couple of my favorite new Apple Watch apps (although Niantic has a lot of work to do to make Pokémon Go work well). As someone who is enthusiastic about the Apple Watch, it’s disappointing to see apps disappear from the platform without much mention. There are tools to make better apps for Apple Watch that some high-profile app makers haven’t used yet, and there are possibilities for new apps to exist that haven’t been created yet. As I suggested in my piece last month, I hope there are even more tools on the way for watch app developers coming at WWDC in a few weeks and a behind-the-scenes effort taking place to encourage developers to use those tools when possible.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 172/3 (69) - WI 312/10 (98.5) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Narendra Modi Donald Trump Bahubali 2 Exam results 2017 IPL 2017 News Business News US STOCKS-Apple, tech lift Wall St as Nasdaq sets record Shares1 Tue, 2 May 2017-02:04am , Reuters Wall Street climbed on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq Composite to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2 percent and set a record high, supporting the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, gained 0.9 percent, with big tech names including Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook hitting records. Investors braced for another heavy week of quarterly corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well." The S&P 500 gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.00 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,091.60, a record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 20,913.46, after notching its best weekly performance of 2017 last week. The CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since Feb 2007. Financials rose 0.6 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April, consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors girded for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 55 new lows. About 6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

After prominent leaker Sonny Dickson suggested it may be ready for an unveiling at WWDC, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has now tipped an announcement at the firm's annual developer's conference. In a note to investors published on Monday, KGI analyst says ‘Apple’s first home AI product’ will go on sale in the second half of 2017. He predicts a more premium, high-end approach with ‘excellent sound’ provided by seven tweeters and a subwoofer. Naturally, it’ll have a higher price tag than the Echo, Kuo says (via 9to5Mac). Related: Amazon Echo vs Google Home Late last week, Dickson claimed the speaker would boast a cylindrical design inspired by the Mac Pro, with a mesh speaker grille akin to the UE Boom range. Apple has traditionally kept WWDC a software-only affair, but it would make sense to announce this product at the developer conference. Presumably there’ll be plenty of involvement from third-party developers, while any improvements in Siri and HomeKit within iOS 11 will have knock-on effects for the home speaker. Apple is also playing catch up with Google and Amazon both surging ahead with product already on the market. An announcement at WWDC would enable the company to start making inroads into its rivals’ lead in the space. Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference begins on June 5. Would a high-priced Apple solution be as popular as the Amazon Echo? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Now investors hope for a pretty picture when new iPhones are an nounced. Photo: Michael Nagle, Bloomberg Apple’s stock races ahead as investors bet on new iPhones 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A year ago, many investors had given up on Apple, whose stock price had fallen more than 30 percent from its 2015 peak. Apple’s once-unstoppable growth had come to a crashing halt: The number of iPhones sold was down 13 percent, and the company posted its first revenue decline in 13 years. Today, Apple’s business remains sluggish, but that has not stopped investors, including the famously tech-averse Warren Buffett, from falling in love with it again. Shares of the Cupertino company — which has the highest market value of any U.S. stock — have repeatedly set records this year. On Monday, they closed at $146.58, over 60 percent above last May’s trough. Latest business videos What’s driving the stock, skeptics and fans alike say, is hope — hope that the new iPhones due in September, on the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone’s introduction, will be dazzling enough to inspire existing iPhone users to upgrade and prompt others to switch from Androids made by Samsung, Huawei and other manufacturers. “Everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,” said Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, who has managed tech-focused mutual funds through many ups and downs. Investors will get more data about Apple’s performance, and perhaps some clues about its future, on Tuesday, when the company reports its results for the financial quarter that ended in March. Analysts expect the company to report a slight increase in iPhone sales and overall revenue. Apple declined to comment before its earnings report. Landis sold most of Firsthand’s Apple position near last year’s bottom, but he said he had no regrets despite the recent gains. He expects Apple to continue churning out incremental improvements rather than shake up the industry. The biggest change in last fall’s iPhone 7, he noted, was the elimination of the headphone jack. Apple is expected to make more exciting updates in its next high-end iPhone, including a high-resolution screen that covers the phone’s entire face. But the company has also suggested that much of its future growth will come from services like Apple Music, Apple Pay and the cut that Apple takes from application sales and subscriptions in the app store. Apple executives, who are fond of using the word “revolutionary” to describe their products, have also acknowledged some missteps. After watching iPad unit sales spiral downward for 12 quarters in a row, the company introduced a cheaper model in March to win over schools that were flocking to Chromebooks. Apple is also likely to update its Pro tablets for businesses this year. Apple also admitted that the striking cylindrical design of the Mac Pro, a personal computer that is important to its most demanding customers, turned out to be a mistake that limited its upgrade potential. A completely redesigned Mac Pro will be released next year, Apple executives said in early April during an unusual meeting with tech journalists to discuss the computer’s shortcomings. “We made something bold that we thought would be great for the majority of our Mac Pro users. And what we discovered was that it was great for some and not others,” Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president for marketing, said at the meeting. “We’re sorry for that, what happened with the Mac Pro, and we’re going to come out with something great to replace it.” Investors appear to be relieved that Apple sales have stabilized after last year’s drop, said Neil Cybart, an independent analyst who writes about Apple at the website Above Avalon. “There is at least increased confidence in what Apple can do in the future,” he said. Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management who loaded up on Apple shares near last year’s lows, is one of those confident investors. “Apple is turning into the big Caddy that’s going to cruise down the freeway, and there’s a certain class of investors that are really comfortable with that. And we’re that kind of investor,” he said. Heavy buying of Apple shares by Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, and by Apple itself has also helped support the stock price, accounting for one month’s trading volume in the shares, according to Cybart’s calculations. Berkshire is now Apple’s fifth-largest shareholder, owning 2.61 percent of the company as of Feb. 27. In recent years, as U.S. phone carriers have stopped subsidizing the purchase of new phones, consumers have been holding on to their old smartphones longer than the typical two-year upgrade cycle. The last time Apple made big changes to its phone lineup was in 2014, when it introduced models with larger screens. Expectations are high that the new iPhones coming out this year will have enough improvements to prompt a big wave of new purchases. “People are excited about a feature-rich launch,” said Timothy Arcuri, a technology analyst at Cowen & Co. But as Apple pushes the innovation envelope, there are risks. The company has been having difficulty with the new type of fingerprint reader needed for its most advanced iPhone, which is expected to have a screen that runs edge to edge, with no physical home button, Arcuri said. He said Apple had just a few more weeks to work out the kinks if it hoped to meet its traditional September release date. Otherwise, it will have to delay the new phones or put the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone — a clunky solution adopted by Samsung for its Galaxy S8 phone that has been panned by reviewers. “They’re wringing their hands,” Arcuri said of Apple. Even if the iPhones fail to deliver a large sales increase, investors are also hoping for changes in tax law that will benefit Apple. Last week, the Trump administration proposed a broad-based cut in the corporate tax rate and hinted at a possible tax break for profits held overseas that could prompt Apple to bring back tens of billions of dollars in foreign profits and distribute them to shareholders. Potential breakthroughs are also in the works. The company is developing augmented reality technology, including eyeglasses, that will overlay real objects with digital ones. Some expect a rudimentary form of augmented reality to show up in the next iPhone. And two weeks ago, Apple received a permit from California regulators to begin testing self-driving cars on public roads. Technological leaps like those would win back skeptics like Landis. “History says that Apple does great but they never shake up the world,” he said. “I need them to surprise me.” Vindu Goel is a New York Times writer.

The Cupertino-based company is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the closing the bell Tuesday, but is it too late to bite into AAPL stock? Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 146.58 +2.93 +2.04% With Apple shares now trading at all-time highs and ranking as the best-performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, driven by its 17% rise over the past three months, there’s tons of optimism built in. AAPL has soared 24% year-to-date, crushing not only all the major indices, but also performing in line with the “Fang” stocks: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOG). All told, Apple has been on a winning streak over the past year, and in the process AAPL stock has made investors tons of money with almost 30% returns. And following Tuesday’s results, these shares should head higher, on their way toward $160 to $165 per share in the next 12 to 18 months, delivering 15% returns. And that’s on the conservative side. Expectations for the Quarter For the quarter that ended March, Apple is expected to earn $2.02 per share on revenue of $52.97 billion, translating to year-over-year growth of 6.3% and 4.8%, respectively. For the full year, ending December, earnings are projected to rise 7.7% year over year to $8.95 per share, while full year revenue of $228.57 billion would rise 6% year over year. 7 Tech Stocks That Will Bruise Your Portfolio The quarterly and full-year projections aren’t breathtaking, but Apple is on the verge of its super-cycle, including the upcoming launch of its iPhone 8. The tenth-anniversary iPhone, which will feature a new OLED display, could sell for more than $1,000 per device. Considering that Apple, which sold more than 78 million phones in 2016’s holiday quarter, has surpassed Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) in market share, according to data just released research firm Gartner, Apple’s profits should head higher. On Tuesday, analysts will also focus on the Apple’s transition to beyond the iPhone — the company’s Services revenue, which includes Apple Music, the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare and Apple Pay, is its next growth frontier. Services revenue grew 17.5% to $7.17 billion in the first quarter, topping forecasts of $6.91 billion. With Services quickly becoming Apple’s second-largest business segment, while producing higher margins, this makes AAPL stock less risky, despite its all-time high status. Bottom Line on AAPL Stock When factoring Apple’s massive cash stockpile of more than $250 billion, AAPL stock — despite trading at all-time highs — still looks like a bargain. Based on fiscal 2018 consensus estimates of $10.28 per share, Apple stock is priced at forward price-earnings ratio of just 14, which is about four points below the S&P 500 Index. Assuming AAPL was priced on par with the rest of the market, shares would trade today at around $165 to $170 — excellent value when combined with a 1.60% annual yield. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images In the 25 years or so since I've been working on voice recognition projects, the technology has evolved a great deal. Today, all the major tech companies, from Apple to Google and beyond, are combining voice recognition with artificial intelligence software to create new platforms and interfaces for their users (think of Siri, Alexa or Cortana.) This kind of voice-activated innovation will continue to be important. But I believe a different technology will be even more significant: Augmented reality, or AR. Simply put, AR technology integrates virtual images and information with a user's real-world surroundings. Many people got their first taste of modern AR with Pokémon Go, a mobile game that made it seem like digital creatures had infiltrated our planet. But AR's potential utility goes far beyond that kind of triviality, with applications in the professional, medical and accessibility spaces. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 146.58 +2.93 +2.04% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 69.41 +0.95 +1.39% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 948.23 +23.24 +2.51% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF = 1,850.00 0.00 0.00% For AR to become truly useful, somebody will have to make a platform for it that could host a variety of apps and services. It's most likely this platform will exist first on smartphones, then, years later, extend to some type of glasses or goggles, like a more fully realized Google Glass. Which company will be the first to create an AR platform with mass appeal? My best guess is Apple, given the way it attacks markets with new software platforms that it then uses to sell hardware. Of course, Apple is rarely first to market with emerging technologies, and rivals like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon won't be far behind. Being the first mover has plenty of advantages, after all. Apple might pull this off via a one-two punch. First, I would expect it to introduce a next-generation iPhone with AR-specific features, like a 360-degree camera, new sensors and an improved touchscreen. Second, Apple would create a dedicated AR software layer that sits on top of the iPhone's existing operating system, tied to the aforementioned new hardware. That would be followed with a software development kit for programmers to create new iPhone apps to take advantage of all this new AR horsepower. If Apple indeed adds AR to the iPhones expected to be released later this year, I suspect it would grant five or six outside companies the power to create AR apps ahead of launch. That, combined with Apple's own AR apps, would result in a nice variety of software to show off to the public when it comes time for launch. This is pretty much the roadmap Apple follows with any major new device or feature. (However, I doubt that Apple will mention anything substantial about AR at the company's WWDC event in June). Were Apple to enter the AR market in a big way this year, it could help introduce the technology to the mainstream - and serve as a major challenge to rivals like Google and Samsung. AR could be the next great tech race, driving innovation and growth over the next several years. Of course, there's another household name that could bring AR to the masses: Facebook. At its recent F8 developer's conference, the social network showed off a new camera that could add virtual objects to its app. Google, meanwhile, has an AR platform called Tango, and Microsoft has HoloLens, AR platforms in their own right. Snapchat's "lenses," meanwhile, are also a form of AR. Voice control will assuredly be an important part of our computing future. But the real promise lies in AR, a potential goldmine of technological innovation over the next several years.

Apple shares jumped 2 percent and set a record high, supporting the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, gained 0.9 percent, with big tech names including Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook hitting records. Investors braced for another heavy week of quarterly corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&amp;P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "This is shaping up to be the strongest earnings season in several years," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. "That has kind of got people gravitating back to equities and gravitating to the equities that are doing well." The S&amp;P 500 gained 4.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,388.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 44.00 points, or 0.73 percent, to 6,091.60, a record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points, or 0.13 percent, to 20,913.46, after notching its best weekly performance of 2017 last week. The CBOE Volatility Index, a barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, closed at its lowest level since Feb 2007. Financials rose 0.6 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April, consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors girded for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&amp;P 500 posted 42 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 145 new highs and 55 new lows. About 6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

So says KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who calls it “Apple’s first home AI product.” According to Mr. Kuo, odds are better than 50% that Apple will make a Siri-box announcement at WWDC. He says Apple’s device will integrate with our Macs, iPhones, iPads, and AirPlay. Apple may be ready to unveil its Siri-based Amazon Echo competitor at WWDC He added Apple’s device will be presented as a premium product compared to Amazon’s Echo, and it’ll cost more, too. That higher price tag will get users processing power in line with the iPhone 6s, along with a higher quality audio system sporting seven tweeters and subwoofer in a mini Mac Pro-like body. That fits with a report from late last week where Sonny Dickson said Apple may launch its Siri-based Echo competitor at this year’s WWDC event. Dickson has a strong track record with Apple product leaks, and has been Johnny-on-the-spot with photos of iPads and iPhones ahead of everyone else. With Sonny Dickson and Ming-Chi Kuo both targeting this year’s WWDC, there’s a better than average chance we’ll at least see the rumored device even if it isn’t shipping right away. So far, everyone seems to think Apple’s device will perform the same functions as Amazon’s Echo: information lookups, weather and news updates, smarthome device control, music streaming, and online product ordering. That’s all plausible, but considering Apple’s push for personal privacy, we may not see features that tie into more intimate data such as access to Calendar events and To-Do tasks. Amazon’s Echo, as well as Google’s Home device, can tap into our schedules to remind us of upcoming events. That’s convenient, but a privacy threat since anyone within earshot of the devices can access your schedule—something that doesn’t fit with Apple’s push to keep our personal info out of everyone else’s hands (or ears). Apple’s focus on personal instead of shared devices seems at odds with the rumored Siri appliance, too. Assuming Apple designs the device so anyone can talk to it, including access to a single person’s data seems like an odd move for the company. Limiting it to just one person’s voice print, however, feels too restrictive. It’s possible Apple could use some sort of voice identification to tailor the device’s functions for specific users. The primary user, for example, could access their schedule and all HomeKit functions. Everyone else gets a subset with audio streaming and HomeKit control limited to less security-focused devices like thermostats and lights. Assuming Apple really is planning on unveiling an Amazon Echo competitor at WWDC in June, it’ll be interesting to see how the company balances the all users approach we’re seeing on other voice control appliances with the Siri’s one-to-one nature.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software macOS 10.12.5 Beta 5 is Now Available for Developers By Uzair Ghani 13 hours ago 7Shares Share Tweet Submit Apple has released macOS 10.12.5 Beta 5 and developers can download it onto their Macs right away. Fifth Beta of macOS 10.12.5 Arrives for Developers – Update Now Slowly and steadily, Apple is progressing towards the big release of macOS 10.12.5, alongside other software as well that currently sits in the Apple Developer Program website. For now though, we have to deal with developer-oriented betas, that crawl out of Apple’s gates on a weekly basis and straight onto the hands of developers. Today is no special day, as the Cupertino giant has released a brand new update for its desktop platform, dubbed macOS 10.12.5 Beta 5. Related Beta 4 Download Released: iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, tvOS 10.2.1 Being the fifth beta of macOS 10.12.5, one should expect nothing more than bug fixes and performance related enhancements in this build. So if you were expecting that this release will give your Mac a plethora of new features, then you would be mistaken to think that. Nonetheless, if you are a developer, it’s highly recommended that you go ahead and install the update onto your Mac straight away, given you have a previous build of the software installed on it already. Advertisement In order to update to the latest release over the air, launch the Mac App Store, click on the Updates tab and wait for the new update to arrive. When it does, just click on the Update button and the download will commence immediately. The overall download and installation may take a while depending on the speed of your Internet connection as well as the hardware which your Mac is packing under the hood. But don’t worry, you’ll be over with it soon. You will require an Apple Developer Program membership if you are looking to try out the beta on your Mac right away. But mind you, it will cost you $99 on a yearly basis, which might seem a bit too steep. Thankfully, via Apple’s Beta Software Program, you can download the software absolutely free, that too over the air. Head over to beta.apple.com to get started. Related iOS 10.3.2 & macOS 10.12.5 Public Beta 2 Released – Download Today If Apple really has slipped a new feature into this release, we will highlight it right here, so stay tuned for more.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Apple’s New Ad Focuses On The Portrait Mode Feature Of iPhone 7 Plus By Ali Salman 13 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and its bigger ‘Plus’ variant was released back in September of last year. While it’s been quite a while, the duo has been one of the best smartphones that you can buy right now. With that said, Apple has not stopped advertising its products as it has released a new ad for the the iPhone 7 Plus. The new ad shared by the Cupertino giant highlights one of the revolutionary features of the smartphone that sets it apart from others. So let’s dive in to see what feature is the company emphasizing on. Apple’s New Ad Highlights The Portrait Mode Feature Of The iPhone 7 Plus On it’s YouTube channel, Apple has shared a new ad that focuses on the Portrait Mode feature of the iPhone 7 Plus. The ad basically highlights the photographic capabilities of the iPhone 7 Plus. The bigger 5.5-inch iPhone of last year was introduced with a pair of cameras at the back. This gave room for the company to enhance the functionality of its phone’s photo taking abilities. Related Research Shows Apple AirPods Received A Whopping 98 Percent Customer Satisfaction Rating The video is entitled “The City” and is just over a minute in length. The ad focuses on a pair of people walking in the city of China and the song “Sing to Me” is being played in the background. The ad’s description reads “With Portrait mode on iPhone 7 Plus, you can focus on what you love and leave everything else behind.” To emphasize on the Portrait Mode, we see as the two characters are the only ones left in the city to walk around while taking pictures through the Portrait Mode. Courtesy of Apple, we also see the “Practically Magic” tag at the very end of the video. For more details, do check out the video embedded below. Advertisement While the camera on the iPhone were exquisite to begin with, last year’s model added an extra feature that takes it a step forward. With the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, the new feature rolled out in the form of a beta. Since then, the company has been promoting the new feature. Related Merriam-Webster Adds the Definition of ‘Sheeple’ and Lists iPhone Users in an Example Sentence This is not the first time that Apple is focusing on the dual-lens cameras of the iPhone 7 Plus. However, without a doubt, the Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 is a joy to use as it tends to focus on the main subject and blurs everything at the back, something we’re all used to experience in DSLR cameras. This is it for now, folks. What are your thoughts on the Portrait Mode of iPhone 7 Plus? Share your thoughts with us in the comments.

Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 01 May, 2017 22:08 - - - - print email Comments IDG The Samsung Galaxy S8 has redefined smartphones -- it's all curves, no bezels and truly one of a kind. Samsung needed to create a device that would make everyone forget about the Note 7's exploding batteries and it accomplished that. The S8 and S8+ are two of the best smartphones on the market. They aren't perfect, but Samsung came close. What might be most exciting about the latest Galaxy flagships is that Samsung has made smartphones fun again. Smartphone design has grown tired, with every device featuring some version of a flat, bezeled display. Samsung was the first to get to the table with a innovative bezel-free design, and you can expect smartphone design to follow. The Galaxy S8 is an Android device that finally values form just as much as function, something Apple figured out over a decade ago. The Galaxy S8 is a sleek, high-end device, and it's predicted that it will gain more traction in the enterprise than past Android devices. Galaxy S8 design The Galaxy S8 is beautifully designed with smooth, curved edges that complement the tapered OLED Infinity Display. It feels just as premium as it looks -- no plastic in sight with a body coated in Gorilla Glass 5. The design looks like it could be fragile, but I've dropped my own S8 more than once, with a slim case, and it's held up. I remember thinking the same about the iPhone 4 -- every new smartphone feels fragile until you're used it for a few months. The display took over the physical home button, and instead Samsung included a pressure sensitive button beneath the display. I like the haptic feedback. It's not like the Apple iPhone 7, where it feels like you're pushing the actual display in. But it's better than your standard vibrating feedback, you feel like you can give it a decent push even when the display is asleep. Of course, one of the biggest complaints about the home button is that Samsung didn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the display. Instead, the fingerprint button is on the back of the device, next to the camera. This results in smudging the camera as you awkwardly reach around to find the scanner. I went in with low expectations of the fingerprint reader, and I've mostly relied on other authentication methods. But after more than a week of use, I've gotten used to it. I always keep a case on my devices, and the cut out for the camera makes it easier to blindly feel for the reader. Overall, I don't think it's a deal breaker, but it will ultimately be your personal preference. Sometimes a new phone also means building new muscle memory, and after two weeks with the S8, I have no problem reaching my pointer finger up to the fingerprint scanner. Just like past devices, the Galaxy S8 is IP68 water and dust resistant, with wireless charging and a 3.5mm headphone jack -- Samsung also included a USB Type-C charging port. The rear-facing dual-pixel camera is 12-megapixels -- same as the Galaxy Note 7 -- but the front-facing camera has been upgraded to a wide-angled lens with 8-megapixels. Although the rear-facing camera is the same as last year's, Samsung has boosted software performance for higher-quality images. The camera works fantastic in low lighting and, as with all Samsung cameras, images feature a slight boost in contrast. Whether you like the boost in contrast and saturation is personal preference, but I found images sharp, clear and vibrant. [ Related story: Enterprise showdown: 5 ways the iPhone beats the Galaxy S8 ] Galaxy S8 Bixby button This is technically part of the design, but the Bixby button deserves a section all to itself because it's also the worst part of the design. It was a bold move for Samsung to include a dedicated button for its new voice assistant, Bixby. It's especially bold when you consider Bixby is brand new, no one has ever used it before and most Android users are loyal to Google's voice assistant. Initially, Samsung said the button would be remappable to another assistant or app -- which I was happy about. I use Siri and Google Assistant to do one thing -- set timers. A dedicated Bixby button felt excessive when I'm only going to use it to avoid forgetting laundry in my apartment's shared washers. Samsung decided to remove the ability to remap the Bixby button. Not only is that change disheartening, the physical location of the Bixby button is frustrating -- it's exactly where you'd expect to find your volume down button. The app is useless in its current state. I couldn't even ask it to set a timer if I wanted to. There's one silver lining to the Bixby button, depending on how much of an optimist you are. After my husband received his pre-order, he discovered at least one use for the Bixby button. If you delete every card and app from the Bixby screen, it becomes so glaringly bright white that you can use it as a flashlight. If Samsung wants users to be loyal to Bixby, it needs to make the app so good that no one will want to remap the button. Customers don't spend over $700 on a smartphone just to be pushed into using any feature. This one feels like a clumsy nod to Apple's strategy, with Samsung slowly trying to entrench people into its ecosystem -- the exact thing most Android users are trying to avoid. [ Related story: Samsung targets the enterprise with Galaxy S8 and S8+ ] Galaxy S8 display The 5.8-inch OLED display on the Galaxy S8 speaks for itself -- it's gorgeous, with a stunning resolution of 570 ppi. Not only is it unique, but the rounded edges of the Infinity Display create an immersive experience. Whether you're reading an article, watching a YouTube video or playing a mobile game, the edges of the device just melt away. The curved edges are also practical.Tthe S8 looks large, but it doesn't feel that way when you hold it. I've found the iPhone 7 Plus, Pixel XL and past Galaxy flagship devices too wide for my hand, but the Galaxy S8 is the perfect size, even with a case. The 18.5:9 aspect ratio is a little odd at first, but apps that aren't already optimized for the new ratio can be "cropped to fit," including YouTube videos. And with the growing trend of bezel-free displays, it's easy to imagine the S8's odd ratio will soon be common-place. Another advantage to the tall display -- especially for business users -- is how effective it is for multitasking. You can float apps on the display in bubbles, quickly opening them to use a fully-functional, but scaled down version of one app without leaving another. On smaller displays, multi-window features always felt gimmicky rather than practical. But the S8's tall display makes Android's multi-window function useful. I never had to switch out of another app to answer a text or browse my playlists like I did on my iPhone. Galaxy S8 performance If you purchase the device in the U.S., you'll get a Galaxy S8 with a Samsung Exynos processor. Outside of the U.S., the device features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor. It comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and I found the combination of Samsung's processor and RAM perfect for regular use. The device ships with 64GB of on-board storage, and it's expandable up to 256GB with a MicroSD card. It's tempting to compare performance of the Galaxy S8 to the iPhone 7 Plus -- and for good reason. They're two of the best devices you can currently buy. I think the iPhone will always come out on top when pushed to the limit -- for example, uploading or downloading large files. Apple has fine-tuned its lightweight mobile OS to run seamlessly on its own hardware using a proprietary processing chip. Alternatively, Android has a lot more manufacturers and devices to please. That is, it needs to work across multiple devices, run widgets, allow for multi-window mode, support launchers and ROMs and offer users high-level customization. When you consider all the things an Android device asks of its OS compared to an iPhone with iOS, the performance of the S8 is extra impressive. Coming from an iPhone 6, I expected a choppier performance on Android. But with the S8, it's been a seamless experience. I haven't experienced any lag or poor animations; performance has been smooth and snappy. Galaxy S8 battery life It's no surprise that Samsung played it safe with the S8's battery. The S8's 3,000mAh battery is smaller than the battery in the Galaxy S7 edge, but Samsung claims it has a longer lifespan, losing only 5 percent of its capacity over two years. I can't test this claim without a time machine, but if it holds true, that's exciting news. In daily, average use, the battery is enough -- it's not great, but it's enough. Of course, it's going to depend on your settings, apps and general habits, and I find that in my first month with a new device I use it more often than I normally would. Over the past two weeks, I've pushed the S8 to the limits. I've loaded the device up with well-known battery drainers like Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. I kept Bluetooth on all day and used the S8 as my main streaming device for YouTube and Spotify. With heavy use, the battery got me through an entire workday, with a recharge in the evening. On days with lighter, more typical use -- days when I went out and reached for my smartphone less -- the battery got me through the day, well into the evening. The device charges insanely fast with Samsung's fast charge technology. It will display the amount of time you have until a full charge, which is useful if you're trying to get out the door. The fast charging made up for the average battery performance since I could quickly top the battery off. I expect that once the honeymoon phase wears off I'll have no problem stretching the battery life further. But if battery life is truly important to you, you might want to look at the S8+, which has a 3,500mAh battery. Bloatware While Bixby's execution was a misstep, one area where Samsung finally got it right is with its proprietary preloaded software. My Verizon pre-order arrived with a handful of annoying Verizon apps and games pre-loaded onto the device, but I uninstalled most of them. My T-Mobile review unit had far less bloatware than the Verizon device, and again, most of it was from T-Mobile, not Samsung, and I could uninstall the apps. Samsung no longer tries to force you into using its native apps. They come tucked away in a tidy folder on the app tray and most of them can be uninstalled -- not just hidden. With other apps, like reminders and the weather app, Samsung doesn't even include a home screen or app tray icon unless you enable the feature in the app's settings. Galaxy S8 enterprise potential If any Android device has the potential to edge out the iPhone in the enterprise, it's the Galaxy S8. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have more to offer businesses, but the Galaxy S8 presents a legitimate alternative for IT. Enterprise adoption will also be pushed by BYOD -- the growing trend of employees using a personal device for work. The Galaxy S8 is primed for BYOD; Samsung Knox not only helps with EMM, it makes it easy for users to keep personal and business data separate. And with the Samsung Dex -- a docking station that lets you use the S8 or S8+ as a full desktop -- businesses will be more motivated than ever to embrace the S8. Samsung has built a smartphone that sets a new standard for other manufacturers, it's a hit with consumers and its appeal could sway the enterprise. With more display real-estate, a high-end design and impressive performance, employees can truly be productive on this device. And with the potential of docking stations like DeX -- full review coming later -- Samsung might be on the cutting edge of consumer technology and business mobility.

The tech sector touched its highest level since September 2000, and the Nasdaq Composite hit another record on Monday as names like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple surged to new highs. The five stocks, which represent more than $2.8 trillion in market cap, have been leading the market this year — up a respective 27, 17, 12, 32 and 27 percent in 2017. As Apple and Facebook prepare to report earnings this week, top technician Carter Worth is eyeing Facebook for even more gains. "If I had to pick between Apple and Facebook, I'm going Facebook," Worth said Friday on CNBC's "Options Action." "[Facebook] has lived in this precise channel … I think we have a little bit more to go." The stock has been in a precipitous uptrend for the last five years, gaining nearly 300 percent. As far as Apple is concerned, the Cornerstone Macro technician said, "What I'm thinking at this point is that Apple has some check back risk, which is often what we see when a stock moves to an all-time high and moves back … Apple has some downside risk going into its [earnings]." Worth noted that the stock has broken above support at around $132 per share, and could fall back to that level. "Stick with the bullish bet on Facebook," he added. Apple is set to report earnings after the bell on Tuesday, and Facebook reports after the bell on Wednesday — both stocks are implying a 4 percent move in either direction, which represents a $45 billion shift in market cap.

(Apple) Share Written by Mike Murphy May 01, 2017 Last quarter, Apple sold more iPhones than it had ever sold before, and brought in more revenue than it had in any quarter in its 41-year history. What does it have in store this time around? Probably not as much. Apple will report its second-quarter earnings tomorrow, May 2 (its fiscal year ends in September), after the US markets close. Apple’s stock surged to new heights in the months after its last record-breaking earnings report in January. But its second quarter is traditionally the company’s slowest of the year. Here’s what to look out for after the blockbuster holiday quarter: How Apple handled the slow quarter after a record-breaker Apple recently managed to halt a multi-quarter slide, recovering from its first drop in annual sales since 2001. We’ll find out whether Apple’s blockbuster quarter and consumer enthusiasm for the iPhone 7 continued into the second quarter, or if things have cooled off once again. A lot of Wall Street’s continued optimism for Apple after its last earnings call is more about what the company potentially has in store for the future—self-driving cars, augmented reality glasses, and a completely new smartphone have all been rumored—rather than what Apple is likely to report May 2. Look for comments on Apple’s earnings call about new technologies that CEO Tim Cook and others have mentioned before, such as machine learning and augmented reality, for hints at where Apple is likely heading. Whether services can keep Apple plugging along But in the near term, Apple is trying to keep loyal customers spending when they’ve already bought a new iPhone, iPad or computer. The way it does that is its services business—sales of apps, movies, music, and AppleCare insurance. These have become the company’s second-largest business segment in recent quarters, although it was pipped to the title by Apple’s resurgent computer business. Look for whether Apple has managed to lock customers in to paying for content on their Apple devices, whether that’s more Apple Music subscribers (of which there are now more than 20 million, at $120 per year in the US) paying monthly fees for access to exclusive music (and in the future, TV shows), more people downloading games and apps for their devices, or more people getting insurance for their rather breakable purchases. How Apple’s new products are faring Apple’s Mac business has been growing for the last few quarters, despite few new models and the global contraction of the computer industry. The company’s revamped MacBook Pro line was unveiled at the end of October, and was generally available in the middle of November, so this will be the first full quarter in which the computers will have been on sale. Streams of loyal users were underwhelmed with the new laptops’ under-powered processors, lack of ports, and fiddly “Touch Bar” that replaced the function keys; some even suggested switching to Windows computers. This quarter’s numbers will help investors judge how widely those gripes are shared. One of Apple’s newest products, the wireless earphones called AirPods, also went on sale at the end of December, so look to Apple’s “Other products” bucket—where it lumps together its smaller businesses, such as the Apple Watch, accessories, headphones, and the iPod—to see if the Tic-Tac shaped pods had any impact on the company’s revenue. Apple also released a slew of updates in late March, including a new version of its standard iPad, a red iPhone 7, and a new iPhone SE, but it’s very likely that these were all released too late to affect the company’s second-quarter figures. Whether Apple can find success in Asia Just as Apple has striven (with limited success) to create other gadgets as popular as the iPhone so it doesn’t depend too much on one product, it’s likely looking to Asia, where hundreds of millions of people are entering China and India’s burgeoning middle classes, so it doesn’t depend too much on one market (the Americas, its largest by far). Last quarter, CFO Luca Maestri touted on the company’s earnings call that Apple had posted double-digit growth in mainland China and India. That was against the previous quarter, though, and the sales there as elsewhere in the world are highly cyclical; year-on-year, sales in China were slightly down. So this call will reveal whether China has once again pipped Europe to be Apple’s second-largest market, and whether its “Rest of Asia” market (which includes India) has overtaken Japan.

 The reality of the US economic slowdown is starting to set in Chris Versace and Lenore Hawkins, Tematica Research May 1, 2017, 2:54 PM 2,861 facebook linkedin twitter email print Last week was a busy one for investors, as we faced a plethora of earnings, economic data and the latest happenings in Washington that arguably brought some uncertainty back into the stock market. All that as we closed the books on the month of April, which saw stocks return 1.0 to 2.5 percent depending on which of indices you examined. Temetica Research For much of the month, it was looking like the stock market would end April flat or a bit down, but then came these last five days, which saw a strong move higher early in the week following the initial round of the French elections. That outcome calmed concerns over a potential Frexit that would have likely led to more talk of unwinding of the eurozone. We viewed the market’s reaction last Monday and Tuesday as more of a sigh of relief than one tied to an accelerating economy. As the week wore on we received a mixed back on the earnings front — some better-than-expected and also some that were not — par for the course over the last few years. Contained in those reports, however, we are seeing a growing trend of companies trimming their expectations for the current quarter, 2Q 2017. This is hardly a surprise, given the slowing pace of the domestic economy and dollar-related headwinds that we are hearing companies like Amazon (AMZN) once again call out. Thus far roughly 60 percent of the S&P 500 companies have reported their 1Q 2017 quarterly results and that means we still have just over 200 to go. Over the next five days, we’ll get results from another 118 of those companies, which means by the end of the week we’ll have heard from just over 80 percent of the S&P and that should give us a very solid look at where expectations for 2Q and 3Q 2017 are headed. Even as we make those adjustments, the S&P 500 is closing April at more than 18x 2017 earnings expectations. As we discussed on last week’s Cocktail Investing podcast , we find the market’s year to date move has really been led by just five stocks — Amazon, Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) . Those moves help explain the out-performance of the Nasdaq Composite Index both in April, where it was up 2.5 percent vs. 1.0 percent for the S&P 500, and year to date, where it is up 12 percent compared to 6.5 percent for the S&P 500. Temetica Research While we continue to  see  additional upside in our Tematica Investing positions inAMZN, GOOGL and FB shares, given strong moves in these five stocks over the last several quarters, we have to recognize that some  investors  may opt to take some profits when eyeing not only the market’s valuation but also a slowing economy and renewed uncertainty in Washington. That possibility is heightened by the recent pops in these stocks that have once again pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index into overbought territory. With Apple and Facebook reporting this week, we could see that index climb even further. Of course, keep in mind, that continued climb would serve to push it even further into overbought territory. The Reality of a Slowing Domestic Economy Is Crystal Clear Now We’ve been talking about the slowing domestic economy here at Tematica for what seems like some time now, and if there was any doubt in our sentiment, Friday’s underwhelming initial 0.7 percent GDP reading for 1Q 2017 should have erased it. Not only did that initial GDP reading miss expectations of 1.3 percent, simply put it was a downward vector and velocity compared to 4Q 2016’s 2.1 percent and 3.5 percent in the back half of 2016. Temetica Research Taking a somewhat longer view, 1Q 2017 turned in one of the weakest performances in the last three years. Moreover, the first looks at how the domestic economy performed suggest it’s off to a rather slow start in the second quarter, with not only the Markit Flash US PMI for April hitting a seven month low, but also month over month declines at several regional Fed economic activity indices for the month. Here’s the thing, as of Friday, economists surveyed by MarketWatch saw growth rebounding to a 2.8 percent rate in the second quarter. While we’ll start to get a slew of April data over this upcoming week, even if we adjust for the winter storms in March, it’s looking like that 2.8 percent forecast is going to be a stretch, given slower rates of output and new order growth reported thus far in the April data and the continued drop in backlogs of work found in Markit’s Flash US PMI report. Temetica Research Does Yellen know when to “Fold ‘Em” on the remaining rate hikes? As signs that the US economy was once again slowing emerged over the last several weeks — was reflected in the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast for 1Q 2017 GDP falling from 3.4 percent in early February to all of 0.5 percent early last week — expectations for the two remaining Fed rate hikes in 2017 per the CBOE’s FedWatch also fell. Odds are Friday’s 1Q 2017 GDP report, along with signs in the Commodity Research Bureau Spot Commodity Price Index that inflation is starting to roll over compared to last year will push out Fed rate hike timing expectations even further. The Fed’s next policy meeting will be held this week, May 2 and 3, and while the growing consensus is that the Fed is likely to push potential rate hikes to June or later in 2017, historically speaking, the Fed has done a great job of hiking interest rates at exactly the wrong time — heading right into a slowing economy and more often than not a recession. While we don’t see signs of a recession, we continue to see the Fed in a hard place given the length of the current recovery and the need to put some arrows in its monetary policy quiver for the next eventual recession and the once again slowing economy that is seeing delinquencies climb and loan growth fall. If you’re thinking we’re glad we don’t have Janet Yellen’s job, you would be rather correct. This does mean that ahead of the Fed’s next few monetary policy meetings in May and June, every key economic data point will be closely scrutinized. In other words, it will be economic Groundhog Day on cable television once again. Rather than succumb to the talking heads, we’ll continue to let the data be our guide, which has served us and our subscribers quite well thus far. Trump’s Tax “Plan” isn’t really a plan, is it? As far as that renewed sense of uncertainty coming out of Washington, the latest GOP effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is scrounging for votes. And while a federal government shutdown was averted this week, it was done only with a one-week extension, so that will certainly add to this week’s April data and Fed policy meeting fireworks. As if that wasn’t enough, the Washington drama has begun on tax reform following President Trump’s “plan”, which amounted to a one-page outline on corporate and individual tax rates as well as cash repatriation. Retail and apparel stocks cheered the lack of a border adjustment tax in the outline, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the border adjustment tax doesn’t work. As Washington gets ready to haggle over the president’s plan it could mean this tax gets rethought as well. Given Trump’s pledge to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, the border adjustment tax might be one way to fund that spending, so we suspect we haven’t heard the last on this just yet. We discuss all of that and what it likely means for investors on last week’s Cocktail Investing podcast — click here to listen . Turning to the Week Ahead Over the coming days, we get the usual start-of- the-month data combined with another 1,000 corporate earnings reports and, as we mentioned earlier, the next Fed policy meeting. For those of you who thought last week was busy, this first week of May is going to be a doozy — March personal income & spending, the April data for auto and truck sales, ISM manufacturing and services, and the usual montage of employment data. During the week, be sure to visit TematicaResearch.com for all our latest thoughts and thematic insights, as well as past episodes of the Cocktail Investing podcast . Finally, we end this week with Cinco de Mayo, so whether it’s a regular or virgin margarita, be sure to have some fun as we put this busy week behind us on Friday In examining the 1,000 companies reporting this week, including 118 S&P 500 companies, here’s what we’ll be watching from a thematic perspective: Affordable Luxury: Malibu Boats (MBUU), Hilton Grand Vacations (HGB), Ruth’s Hospitality Group (RUTH), Callaway Golf (ELY) Aging of the Population: Cardinal Health (CAH), CVS Health (CVS), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Waddell & Reed (WDR), Almost Family (AFAM), Care.com (CRCM), Physicians Realty Trust (DOC), Senior Housing (SNH), AMN Healthcare (AMN) Asset Lite Business Models: Shopify (SHOP), GoDaddy (GDDY), Quad/Graphics (QUAD), Criteo SA (CRTO), Avis Budget (CAR), Cardtronics (CATM), LogMeIn (LOGM) Cashless Consumption: Mastercard (MA), Western Union (WU), Square (SQ), Moneygram (MGI), Global Payments (GPN) Cash-strapped Consumer: Rent-A-Center (FCII), Tanger Factory (SKT), RetailMeNot (SALE), Hanesbrands (HBI), Groupon (GRPN) Connected Society: Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Charter Communications (CHTR), Akamai Tech (AKAM), Match Group (MTCH), Telenav (TNAV), Twilio (TWLO), Century Link (CTL) Content is King: Dish Network (DISH), Cinemark (CNK), Glu Mobile (GLUU), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Madison Square Garden (MSG) Disruptive Business Models and Technology: IIVI (IIVI), Tesla (TSLA), Immersion (IMMR), Universal Display (OLED) Economic Acceleration/Deceleration: Flowserve (FLS), Cummins (CMI), Eaton (ETN), Granite Construction (GVA), STAG Industrial (STAG), Freightcar America (RAIL), General Cable (BGC), US Concrete (USCR) Fattening of the Population: DineEquity (DIN), Bravio Brio (BBRG), Denny’s (DENN), Mondelez International (MDLZ), Papa John’s (PAPA), Potbelly (PBPB), Weight Watchers (WTW), Yum!

By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer TOKYO (AP) - Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Stock Has a Lot to Prove on Tuesday The world's most valuable consumer electronics company reports quarterly results on after the market close on Tuesday. A lot is riding on the numbers. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) May 1, 2017 at 2:25PM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are on fire. The world's most valuable consumer tech company's stock hit a new all-time high on Monday. Momentum is clearly in its corner. Apple stock has soared 53% over the past year, trading 24% higher so far in 2017. One would think that expectations would be high given the stock's heady gains, but analysts don't necessarily see it that way. Wall Street pros see $52.97 billion in revenue, just 5% higher than the prior year's fiscal second quarter. Those same analysts see earnings per share rising 6% to $2.02. This isn't the kind of growth on both ends of the income statement that one typically bargains for when a stock has popped 53% over the past 12 months. A silver lining to single-digit growth could be that profits are growing faster than sales, but that's not necessarily the case here. Analysts see earnings per share growing slightly faster than revenue, but that's on a per-share basis. Apple has been a voracious eater of its own stock through aggressive buybacks. It has lowered its share count by nearly 5% over the past four quarters, so net income itself will be relatively flat -- and net margin lower -- if analysts are on target this time.   Image source: Apple. There's a lot at stake The bullish case for Apple -- and it's a strong one -- is that investors have been bidding up the shares ahead of the next iPhone. Apple introduced the original iPhone in the summer of 2007, and all of the buzz finds the class act of Cupertino pulling out all of the stops in making the next smartphone upgrade revolutionary instead of merely evolutionary. From curved OLED screens to wireless charging, the rumor mill is churning out thick chatter that could stir the masses into trading in their old iPhone and even Android smartphones.  Looking back may not be pretty, and even bulls concede that. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich has a buy rating on the stock, but on Monday he put out an analyst note pointing out that iPhone demand remains soft. He leans on a survey showing that iPhone-buying intent is at a nine-year low, and that the number of potential buyers uncertain about which phone they would be buy next is on the rise. That's a scary suggestion just a day before Apple reports given how it lives and dies on the iPhone these days, but he's also sticking to his forecast for double-digit growth in Apple's fiscal 2018 on the strength of the iPhone 8 -- or whatever it will be called -- when it rolls out later this calendar year. The weak demand now could be folks just waiting for the evolutionary next model, something that would be great for Apple's long-term potential but problematic in the near term. The timing of the next release is a front-and-center topic if folks are holding back on upgrades or even first-time purchases. The last few models have rolled out in the fall, but the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone actually takes place at the end of next month.  No one expects Apple to introduce the next iPhone during the current quarter, but if guidance and growth prospects will be weak until that happens, any hints on a release date will be what could drive the stock after Tuesday's market close.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Apple.

Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia.

"The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33.

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street climbed, sending the Nasdaq to a fresh record high, amid optimism about corporate earnings such as from Apple, while US Treasuries declined. In 2.01pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9 per cent. In 1.46pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.3 per cent. The Nasdaq climbed to a record high 6,100.73. US Treasuries slid, pushing the yield on the 10-year note five basis points higher to 2.33 per cent. Financial markets were closed in most of Europe, China and India. The Dow moved higher, led by gains in shares of Apple and those of Microsoft, recently up 2.1 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. Bucking the trend were shares of Boeing and those of IBM, down 1.1 per cent and 0.9 per cent respectively. Apple is set to report its latest quarterly earnings on Tuesday after the market close. The latest data on the US economy were tepid. An Institute for Supply Management report showed its index of national factory activity fell to 54.8 in April, the lowest level in four months and down from a reading of 57.2 in March. Separately, a Commerce Department report showed consumer spending was unchanged in March, steady for a second straight month. The personal consumption expenditures index-the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation-fell 0.2 per cent in March, the first drop in more than a year. The reports arrived a day before Fed policy makers gather for a two-day meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to announce an interest rate increase on Wednesday, though it has signalled plans to lift rates two more times this year. Investors will scrutinise the government's monthly nonfarm payrolls report, due Friday. It's expected to show US employers added 193,000 new jobs in April, while the unemployment rate inched higher to 4.6 per cent, from 4.5 per cent. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston, told Reuters. "While we're starting the week of on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong," Miskin noted. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he's actively considering a break up of giant Wall Street banks, giving a push to efforts to revive a Depression-era law separating consumer and investment banking, Bloomberg reported. "I'm looking at that right now," Trump said of breaking up banks in a 30-minute Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News. "There's some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we're going to look at that." - BusinessDesk Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Yet all those dollars and cents consumers pay for iTunes, Apple Music and Cloud storage are adding up to big numbers. When Apple announces its fiscal second quarter results late Tuesday, Apple Services will once again be a major story line. It is turning into a $7 billion sales machine for Apple and in three years could account for nearly one-third of the company's sales. This should spice up what is typically Apple's quietest quarter — the proverbial intermission between its blockbuster holiday season and the latest, greatest iPhone announcement in the fall. Financial analysts predict a bump in revenue and sales primarily because of growth in Apple Services. It's part of an evolving strategy at Apple that started 16 years ago with then-CEO Steve Jobs, who determined enhanced services integrated into hardware not only improved sales but was crucial in keeping customers within Apple's ecosystem, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies who covers Apple. "(Apple's) investment in services will only increase and will drive how they design future hardware to maximize these new services and more closely tie them to their hardware designs," Bajarin says. For people with an Apple device in their pocket or on their desk, this means more reason to spend time, and money, on their device — viewing content, listening to music, using apps, making online purchases. Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research who has a "strong buy" on Apple shares, forecasts an 18% jump in Service-related revenue to $7.07 billion.  For the quarter ending in March,  analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence estimate earnings of $2.02 per share on revenue of $53 billion, compared with $1.90 and $50.6 billion, respectively, in the same quarter a year ago. Zino forecasts iPhone shipments will rise slightly to 51.5 million, accounting for about 67% of all quarterly revenue.  The real growth will come from Services, which will contribute 13% to sales, continuing a recent surge. Company CEO Tim Cook has compared the division to a Fortune 100-like company. "We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of the services business in the next four years," Cook said in a conference call announcing Apple’s first-quarter earnings in January. Apple reported $7.17 billion in Services sales for that quarter, up 18%. Indeed, the Services juggernaut — which includes the App Store, Apple Music, iTunes, AppleCare and iCloud — could reach $52 billion annually from $26 billion today, estimates Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at investment bank Credit Suisse. What's next? Maybe money transfer. Apple is in talks to launch a service that would rival Venmo, popular with Millennials, and the more established Paypal, reports Recode, and could be exploring enhanced video services. Video offers another tantalizing possibility for the fledgling division, Garcha and other analysts contend. They say Apple could expand video-related revenue by offering a multiple-system operator pay-TV service; building a subscription video-on-demand service; or acquiring Netflix or Disney. (Apple has plenty of cash, nearly $250 billion, to make mega-purchases.) Apple had no comment on the Recode report or its video plans. For now, however, Apple's cash cow is and remains iPhone,. Despite the recent sales success of Samsung's new Galaxy S8 smartphone, and hints that Google may be introducing a new Pixel phone soon, Apple is likely to maintain market share as its fervent customers await the latest iPhone, Zino says. The new iPhone, reportedly due in September or October, marks the 10th anniversary of the market-redefining product introduced to the world by Jobs in San Francisco. The latest version could come with an OLED screen offering crisper images, a curved screen, wireless charging and an integrated home button/fingerprint sensor inside the display, according to published reports in Bloomberg and elsewhere. There have also been hints of some element of augmented reality in the phone. Apple's new phone is likely to help it regain its hold as the world's biggest-seller of smartphone. Apple edged Samsung for the top spot in smartphones shipped during the last three months of 2016, ending Samsung's eight-quarter grip, according to market researcher Gartner. Apple shipped 77.03 million units (17.9% market share); Samsung was a close second, with 76.78 million (17.8%). But Samsung is expected to wrest back the top spot the next few quarters because of the S8, says Annette Zimmermann, research vice president at Gartner.

Apple first introduced the unibody polycarbonate MacBook, the third design iteration of the MacBook line, in late 2009, offering it in black and white. The MacBook was sold for only a short time, having been discontinued in mid-2011 after the introduction of the MacBook Air. The MacBook, along with the MacBook Pro models, have been added to Apple's list of Mac products that are considered "vintage" in the United States and Turkey and "obsolete" in the rest of the world. A full list of the Mac models that have been obsoleted is below: - MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010) - MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) - MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2.53GHz, Mid 2009) - MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009) Apple has also added all models of the iPhone 3G to the "iPhone products obsolete worldwide" list, but it also continues to be listed under "iPhone products vintage in the United States and obsolete in the rest of the world" so its official status is unclear. Under Apple's classification system, vintage products are those that have not been manufactured for more than 5 years and less than 7 years ago, while obsolete products are those that are discontinued more than 7 years ago. The vintage classification means that Apple is no longer offering hardware service for the devices except in Turkey and California, where local statutes require that Apple continue to provide service and parts for a longer period of time. The obsolete classification means Apple has discontinued all hardware service with no exceptions. Apple retail stores, and the Canadian, European, Latin American, and Asia-Pacific operating regions follow Apple's United States product list, but do not distinguish between vintage and obsolete.

The Cupertino company is likely to reveal it has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars – an amount that is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago. The firm has been able to avoid US corporate taxes by keeping nearly 93 percent of its $246.09 billion total cash, cash equivalents and securities off shore – a route many major companies have taken.

Firm is said to have topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, which is double its cash pile from just four and a half years ago Not only will Appel's results show a total of cash that is greater than two countries, but it is also said to exceed the market values of Wal-Mart Stores In and Procter & Gamble Co., Tripp Mickle reported with The Wall Street Journal, who also noted that the results exclude any and all Apple's debt. Apple cash and cash equivalents are dispersed throughout both' short- and long-term securities, including corporate securities, U.S. Treasury securities and money-market funds,' Mickle explained.

Share this article Share 313 shares Apple, among many other major corporations, keep a majority of their funds in other countries in order to avoid paying the 35 percent US corporate-income-tax rate. However, last week the Trump administration unveiled plans to dramatically cut taxes for US businesses and individuals, slashing the corporate rate to 15 percent, but the once-in-a-generation overhaul is headed for a tough fight in Congress. And The Wall Street Journal noted that if the plan were to go through, it would allow Apple to use their money wisely 'through acquisitions or by sending more to shareholders'. Apple CEO Tim Cook (pictured) is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns' Apple CEO Tim Cook is not opposed to bringing more cash to the US if the changes allow it and CFO, Luca Maestri, also explained that the changes 'would give Apple flexibility to do more capital returns'. 'What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is, but as I've said before we are always looking at acquisitions,' Cook told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call in January.  Last year, the tech giant was named as the biggest corporate tax avoider in the United States after booking $218.55 billion (£171.6 billion) of profit offshore last year. TRUMP'S MAJOR TAX CUTS  Slashing taxes on income and business was a key part of Trump's election platform. Under Trump's proposals, American companies would move from being the most highly taxed among the Group of 20 countries to among the lowest.  Tax rates would fall below those of neighboring Mexico and Canada, which Trump has accused of shortchanging the United States in trade deals. The plan's signature reform would be a dramatic reduction of the corporate tax rate, from the current 35 percent to 15 percent. Tax brackets for individuals would be compressed from seven to just three -- 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent, lower than the current top rate of 39.6 percent. Studies of the results of past tax holidays found that most of the offshore cash brought home by U.S. companies was used to buy back shares or make acquisitions, not to fund investments in production capacity or jobs.  The tech giant was able to save $65.08 billion (£51.1 billion) that it should have paid in tax thanks to its convoluted arrangements. The report revealed that last year three quarters of the Fortune 500 companies use subsidiaries in offshore tax havens where they sent a total of $2.42 trillion (£1.9 trillion) of income. In the US alone this amounted to $715.62 billion (£561.9 billion) in tax which they avoided paying. The report said many of the biggest companies in the world use a foreign office to 'disguise' their profits as coming from another country even if they are not.    Read more: Apple’s Cash Hoard Set to Top $250 Billion - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 313 shares Most watched News videos Shocking footage shows aftermath of severe turbulence on Bangkok flight Incredible rescue of baby from capsized truck captured on video Awkward moment woman rejects marriage proposal at Fenway Moment car accident causes gas tanker to explode in Ohio Woman pops cyst with 16 gauge screwdriver and pushes out fluid Theresa May's embarrassingly quiet day of door-knocking in Scotland Excitable toddler performs his own version of the Haka dance Moment shooter opens fire at black pool party guests Baby elephant tossed around after getting in the way of a bull Kelly Ripa reveals Ryan Seacrest as her new co-host Canadian crowd sing entire Star-Spangled Banner when mic fails Terrifying moment tyre explodes into air and destroys car The flight from Hell: Horrific turbulence leaves 27...

Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Why are Google, Amazon and eBay ditching support for the Apple Watch? by Chris Smith 11 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments A growing number of major internet companies are dropping support for the Apple Watch. AppleInsider reports Google Maps, Amazon and eBay are among the top tier apps that are no longer supporting a watchOS extension within their iOS apps. Google removed support a few weeks back, while newly-updated eBay and Amazon iOS apps contain no reference to Apple’s wearable. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review Although none of the companies concerned have explained their reasoning for withdrawing support, it can be assumed the Apple Watch extensions are not being used widely enough to justify the upkeep. The highly-regarded eBay app had appeared to be particularly useful, altering bidders when their offer had been topped. The use-case for Google Maps is pretty evident for those who prefer it to Apple’s own solution, while there’s nothing particularly pressing about shopping from Amazon that it needs to be done on the wrist. The exodus of three top apps (AppleInsider also reports US retailer Target has dropped support) raises questions about whether others will follow suit. None of the firms have commented on their reasons or whether support for the Apple Watch will be reinstated at some stage. Is this the sign of things to come for Apple Watch users?

However, new rumours indicate that Apple could be preparing to unveil its own Siri Speaker at WWDC this June. Reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo made this prediction via 9to5Mac, stating that the still unannounced device will be a high-end speaker that features built-in Siri functionality. The superior audio quality aspect of the device, which would give it a clear advantage over its competitors, is expected to be its main selling point. Kuo says that the device will go on sale before the end of the year, though it’s possible it may not be announced at WWDC, with Kuo stating that there’s a 50 percent chance this could occur. Given WWDC is a developer focused conference, it would make sense for the tech giant to reveal a new product category at the event, giving developers adequate time to begin experimenting with the product before its official commercial release. This isn’t the first time rumours Apple is working on a dedicated voice-activated assistant have appeared, especially since Apple opened Siri integration up to third-party developers last year. It’s also worth noting that the Cupertino, California-based company recently made Siri available to macOS users, in addition to iOS users. If a dedicated Siri device does get announced at WWDC, it will be interesting to see if Apple opts for a simultaneous U.S. and Canada launch like it has with most of its products for the past few years. It’s also unclear if Apple plans to use this still unannounced device as the centre of its Home IoT device platform, similar to the strategy Amazon has taken with its Echo voice-activated assistant.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 01 May 2017 09:40PM (Updated: 02 May 2017 03:10AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Wall Street rose on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index , the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

There is $105,058,800 That Short Sellers Still Need To Cover. Disclosure NewswireTM iCrowdNewswire – May 1, 2017 May 1, 2017 / M2 PRESSWIRE / BUYINS.NET / www.buyins.net is monitoring Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE:APLE) in real time and just received an alert that APLE is crossing above its primary SqueezeTrigger Price, the price that a short squeeze can start in any stock. There are 5544000 shares that have been shorted at the volume weighted average SqueezeTrigger Price of $18.88. To access SqueezeTrigger Prices ahead of potential short squeezes beginning, visit http://www.buyins.net . From August 2009 to March 2017, an aggregate amount of 249400163 shares of APLE have been shorted for a total dollar value of $4489202934. The APLE SqueezeTrigger price of $18.88 is the volume weighted average price that all shorts are short in shares of APLE. There is still approximately $105,058,800 of potential short covering in shares of APLE. Buyins.net has built a massive database that collects, analyzes and publishes a proprietary SqueezeTrigger Price for each stock that has been shorted. The data has then been integrated into an automated trading platform which can be used to connect to a live online broker and automate your trading of short squeeze events. It is extremely powerful with lightening fast execution at a very low price. Both the trading software and SqueezeTrigger data feed are available at http://www.buyins.net . Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. (NYSE:APLE) – Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. is a publicly owned real estate investment trust. It invests in the real estate markets of United States. The firm invests primarily in the lodging industry. It is focused on the acquisition and ownership of income-producing real estate. The firm was formerly known as Apple REIT Nine, Inc. Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. was founded on November 9, 2007 and is based in Richmond, Virginia. Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. operates as a subsidiary of Apple REIT Companies. The SqueezeTrigger database of billions of short sale transactions goes back to January 1, 2005 and calculates the exact price at which the Total Short Interest is short in each stock. This data was never before available prior to January 1, 2005 because the Self Regulatory Organizations (primary exchanges) guarded it aggressively.

Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&amp;P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&amp;P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&amp;P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index, the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates.

"With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman What to Expect From Cirrus Logic’s Q4 Results Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ: CRUS) were beaten down badly in February because of weak guidance for the quarter ending in March, but the stock has staged a remarkable comeback in recent weeks. The chipmaker has risen close to 10% in the past month, thanks to optimism about the number of iPhones Apple will need this year. But will Cirrus Logic live up to the hype when it reports its fourth-quarter results on May 3? Here’s what investors can expect from its upcoming report. What to expect Wall Street expects Cirrus’ revenue to rise 38% from the prior-year period to $321 million, which matches the midpoint of its own guidance. Analysts were initially more bullish and expected $334 million in revenue, but expected iPhone production cuts forced the chipmaker to dial down its guidance. Image source: Cirrus Logic. Supply chain checks by Nikkei Asian Review point toward a 10% cut in iPhone production during the first quarter of 2017. Still, Cirrus is on track to report terrific year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter as the iPhone cut is estimated to be less severe than the cut in Q1 2016. What’s more, Cirrus’ earnings per share are estimated by analysts to jump 84% year over year thanks to the consistent growth in its gross margin. However, investors will be more concerned about Cirrus’ outlook. Gauging the outlook Analysts are looking for $320 million in first-quarter revenue (April to June) from Cirrus Logic, putting its year-over-year growth at 23%.  Apple is going to play the decisive role in the outlook, as it accounted for 85% of the semiconductor specialist’s top line in the last reported quarter. The iPhone maker could be betting big on its next device. Pacific Crest Securities expects Apple to produce 50 million iPhone units in the July-September quarter, followed by a stronger production run of 80 million units during the final quarter of the year. This would be significantly higher than the 89 million units of the iPhone 7 and 7s built last year. What’s more, Apple’s supply chain might get into action as early as April, according to rumors. India is another factor that could drive iPhone production in the ongoing quarter. Officials of the Indian government recently confirmed that Apple will start making the iPhone 6 and 6s in India soon, followed by the iPhone SE. India is a fast-growing iPhone market, where Apple is aggressively building its retail presence , so it could contribute to higher iPhone production this quarter, which would benefit Cirrus. Potentially strong iPhone production during the April-June quarter could help Cirrus Logic issue a stronger-than-expected outlook. 10 stocks we like better than Cirrus Logic When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Kuo said there is an "over 50 percent chance” the speaker will be revealed at WWDC, which will be held June 5-9. Read: Apple Siri Speaker: 5 Expected Features Including Improved Beats Audio, Touchscreen “We believe there is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI [artificial intelligence] product at WWDC in June and start selling in the [second half of 2017] in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models to be launched,” Kuo said in the note. The analyst also revealed the Siri speaker will cost more than the Amazon Echo. Apple’s rumored speaker will supposedly support AirPlay, which had been rumored before, and will have “excellent” acoustics performance. Kuo also said the speaker, which will compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home, will have a performance similar to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S. “We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance [one woofer and seven tweeters] and computing power [similar to iPhone 6/6S AP],” Kuo wrote. “Therefore the product is likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market, (ii) better entertainment experience and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo.” Kuo also said Invetec, a Taiwan company, will be the exclusive speaker supplier. Apple’s Siri Speaker Rumored Features iPhone leaker Sonny Dickson tweeted last week Apple was “finalizing designs for their Alexa competitor” and was “expected to be marketed as a Siri/AirPlay device.” He also said the Siri speaker would “carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run a variant iOS.” Read: Amazon Echo Look: An Alexa Powered Camera Device That Works As Your 'Style Assistant' Meanwhile, a CNET report last year said Apple had explored putting a camera into a smart speaker gadget. The report suggests the Siri speaker could come with a built-in camera, similar to the recently released Amazon Echo Look. The camera would work to detect multiple users since gadgets like the Google Home and Echo have trouble distinguishing voices. A Bloomberg report published September 2016 said Apple had started working on a device similar to the Amazon Echo two years prior and was in prototype testing last fall. The gadget will be able to control home appliances, such as lights, curtains and door locks through voice activation, the report said. Sources told Bloomberg Apple was trying to differentiate its device from the Amazon Echo and Google Home with a more advanced microphone and speaker technology. The report also backed up CNET’s claims that the Siri speaker will come with face recognition, pointing out Apple had acquired facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient. Earlier this year, a DigiTimes report said Apple was working on boosting Siri’s capabilities to compete with smart assistants after the Amazon Echo and Google Home gained popularity. To improve Siri, Apple acquired Australian start-up Turi last August for $200 million.

People don't buy iPhones by the tens of millions just because they like the hardware, though that's a huge part of it, but because they're tied into an ever-growing, sprawling ecosystem of software and services that allow you to do more with the products if you continue to invest in that ecosystem. Let me explain. When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, iPod users who were already using iTunes saw something familiar and much more consumer-friendly than BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Palm devices offered at the time. iTunes was the seed of an ecosystem that, in the past ten years, has grown into a towering elm. The App Store launched in 2008. After that, when people bought apps and games they were also continuing to buy into Apple. As they shelled out $0.99 here and $1.99 there for new software that only ran on their Apple devices, they were digging deeper into Apple's offering and further away from BlackBerry and a new operating system that was on the horizon: Android. Apple continued to build out this ecosystem by changing the way its products interacted with one another. Apple added the ability to use iMessage and FaceTime from an iPad, for example, allowing you to carry on your iPhone conversations on a tablet. Then it introduced a similar feature to Macs, also adding in support for full phone calls. The more Apple devices you used, the better they worked together. Siri launched on iPhone and iPad and eventually on Mac and Apple TV and even the Apple Watch. It became a familiar voice to answer your questions, no matter where you were. Apple TV grew from what Apple CEO Tim Cook once referred to as a "hobby" to a real home streaming device with its own app store. And if you have an iPhone or iPad, all of your pictures through Apple's Photos app are available across devices, even on the TV in your living room. Home, an app in iOS, lets you control light bulbs, window shades, door locks and more, so long as they're build using Apple's HomeKit set of developer tools. As consumers buy these products, they're making a decision to stick with Apple. Customers are more likely to know about them, too, because Apple has a huge retail presence. Walk into an Apple Store and trained employees will show you exactly how to use any of the Apple products you own. Or browse the shelves and purchase any number of products that'll work seamlessly with your iPhone or iPad. The Apple Store is also the company's support hub, where you can go in with any questions, damaged products and more for assistance. If you have AppleCare+, the company's premium warranty plan, it often costs very little to repair your expensive Apple products, sometimes in the same day. Competitors aren't as good at ecosystems Apple's competitors are trying to do something similar. But they're going about it in a much more chaotic way that will confuse most consumers, who don't spend their lives following the ins and outs of the tech industry. Google is making parallel moves to integrate products like the Google Home, the Pixel smartphone, the Chromecast smart TV and more, and that's a step in the right direction. But Google relies mostly on partners to build and maintain its ecosystem of products, and that can be incredibly confusing. How does the owner of an LG Android smartphone know what smart home products it works with? If that same customer buys an Android TV box built by NVIDIA and a smartwatch made by Huawei, who do they go to for support? (Answer: NVIDIA and Huawei, not Google.) Samsung is getting better at creating an ecosystem like Apple's. It sells smartphones, tablets, TVs, wearables, and laptops in the U.S., and it has apps such as SideSync that allow you to interact with your smartphone from a Samsung tablet or laptop. It has services like Samsung Pay, which is arguably better than Apple Pay because it's accepted in more locations. Samsung also owns SmartThings, a smart home technology company that it acquired in 2014 for $200 million. SmartThings is more open than Apple HomeKit, allowing it to support Android and iOS smartphones and a large variety of smart home products ranging from power outlets to door locks and cameras. The difference between SmartThings and Apple Home is that people have heard of Apple Home — you can hardly miss the yellow icon staring at your from your new iPhone — and can manage it easily through a single app on their smartphone. But SmartThings can be controlled by any number of apps and gadgets, including Google Assistant and the Amazon Echo. While it's versatile, it's also a lot more for a consumer to digest, and a lot harder for a consumer to get started. There's no glaring yellow app begging you to dive in on your new smartphone. Todd Haselton | CNBC Samsung doesn't have an big app store. Samsung doesn't have a place to buy music, movies and TV shows. And Samsung doesn't provide as seamless an experience across all of its products (though it's becoming better at it with apps like Samsung Connect, which provide a one-stop destination for viewing and interacting with your Samsung gadgets.) Nor do Samsung or Google have hundreds of high-profile stores around the world. Instead, they rely on small flagship viewing-only locations, pop-up events or dedicated corners in Best Buy, as places to better understand the products. This doesn't help. As product ecosystems become more powerful, consumers need a single easy place to go to learn more about how they can be used. Consumers also need a place to go for support. If you break your Samsung smartphone, you're going to be on the phone with your smartphone insurance provider -- if you bought insurance at all. If you have an iPhone, just walk into an Apple Store. Apple may charge you a premium depending on your warranty status, but you'll have some sort of solution from the company you bought your phone from. That's a big deal. Competitors may be able to build a better smartphone, or better laptop, or better augmented reality device than Apple. But Apple has a years-long head start in building an ecosystem of products that leverage each other's strengths. That's why its services business now is almost the size of a Fortune 100 company alone. That will take a long time for any competitor to equal. And that's why people will keep buying Apple products.

The last month before February that Apple was without a single "sell" rating in FactSet was August 2012. Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan 12 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Analyst: Apple shares should continue to work higher    13 Hours Ago | 03:16 By some measures, owning Apple stock will give investors less return than other big tech stocks. Yet the iPhone maker remains the "gold standard" on Wall Street. Apple's stock is expected to grow less in the next year than Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and even Microsoft, according to analysts' 12-month price forecasts. And that's after a slew of analysts have already inched their targets higher for Apple. Of the big five tech stocks, Apple's implied return — that is, the average difference between analysts' target prices and the stock's current price — is lowest. At $146 apiece, shares of Apple's stock now have a higher price tag than ever, adjusted for a 2014 stock split. Yet Wall Street recommends that investors continue to shell out ever-higher prices for the stock. Seventy-seven percent of analysts in FactSet recommend buying Apple shares, even as the price per share gets within 5 percent of their May target of $153.86 a share. Twenty-three percent recommend holding the stock — and not a single analyst recommends cashing out and selling the stock, even at its all-time high. show chapters Walter Isaacson: Apple needs to innovate with a big new product    15 Hours Ago | 03:52 Apple has had all "hold" and "buy" ratings consistently since February, when the stock began hitting all-time highs, according to FactSet. Other technology companies, such as Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, have also been near all-time highs this year. But of those companies, Amazon is the only other company without a single "sell" rating in FactSet — and all four have higher implied return than Apple. Indeed, between Apple's all-time highs in mid-February and the end of its March quarter, analysts listed in FactSet have upped Apple's stock price 25 times — more than twice as often as other big tech names. (Since Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon reported earnings last week, and Facebook had a developer event in April, they've seen a slew of new ratings.) Implied return over the next 12 months Amazon: 13.4 percent Alphabet: 11.5 percent Microsoft: 6.6 percent Facebook: 6.0 percent Apple: 5.2 percent Source: FactSet Price target increases between mid-February and the end of March Amazon: 5 Alphabet: 10 Microsoft: 5 Facebook: 11 Apple: 25 Source: FactSet "It can almost do no wrong" Apple's earnings report on Tuesday isn't expected to be especially stellar — Apple analyst-turned-venture capitalist Gene Munster called the earnings a "non-event." Yet the stock has gotten lots of love in financial markets — highlighting the "disjointed" relationship between how consumers and analysts view the stock. "It can almost do no wrong. 2016 wasn't great for Apple earnings, but you rarely see it get punished," said Christine Short, director of media and public relations at Estimize. "It certainly doesn't get treated like Facebook, if they miss their [monthly active user estimates]. Analysts are hesitant to put a cap on Apple's growth. ...There has been so much made out of the iPhone 8, no one is really willing to go out on a limb." Estimize is a crowdsourced financial data platform that aggregates fundamental estimates from independent industry watchers, academics, and buy-side and sell-side analysts. Short said that on Estimize's platform, non-professionals — especially business students — tend to give the most accurate estimates for Apple earnings. "Even as Apple approaches its target prices, analysts are willing to shift it higher. We all know that there's not an equal amount of buys and sells out there — the system is kind of disjointed," Short said. Short attributes the track record of nonprofessionals to the fact that younger students know the iPhone intimately — and that sell-side analysts face pressure from the companies themselves to keep the relationships open. The nonprofessional half of estimators also tend to give fewer estimates, she said. "Sell-side analysts, they cover 30 to 50 stocks," Short said. "They can't intimately know 30 to 50 names. [Nonprofessionals] are only picking the ones they feel good on." Dan Ives, formerly a top Apple analyst, said Apple is indeed a special stock at the moment, thanks to building anticipation for the next iPhone, to be released later this year. "If you look at the industry, this has been one of the most anticipated product releases in years," said Ives, who is now a senior vice president at mobile technology firm Synchronoss. "I think when you look at Apple and the ecosystem, going into the iPhone 8 potential supercycle, there's obviously a lot of positive thoughts across the board going into this release." Ives said that Apple has earned its reputation as the "gold standard" tech stock, noting that the iPhone "helped change modern society." "They have a consumer ecosystem and a following that's really unique to any technology company," Ives said. "You've seen it go from parabolic growth to more mature growth, but you're going to continue to have innovation. There's more competition, but Apple continues to up the game, which has really been their trait." Short also noted that analysts also view stock values using metrics other than price, such as price-to-earnings ratio. By some of those measures, Apple's earnings or share price aren't as crucial, Short said. She also noted that by far the best estimate on Estimize for Apple earnings combines both Wall Street pros and average consumers. "It's pretty remarkable. This is a name, regardless of how they report, they tend to trend upwards if you hold [the stock]," Short said. "There's a feeling of, 'Get in quick before you miss the upside.' It's hard to spin a bad Apple report. They only have more cash than any other public company. I think they are going to offset last year with a great 2017."

Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 1, 2017 1:00 PM EDT APPLE INC +2.93 At Closing, May 1st 146.58 USD Among Donald Trump's accomplishments in his first 100 days, even critics may have a hard time quibbling with this one: He's made most investors better off. Companies in the S&P 500 index have added nearly $984 billion in market cap since Inauguration Day. Since Election Day, it's just more than $2 trillion. The Trump 100-day stock rally, a jump of 5.8 percent, ranks him fifth best among modern day presidents in percentage terms, two behind Obama's first term. Based on market cap, Trump is even better, edging out the Bush '88 and Obama  '08 terms. Factoring in inflation, Kennedy and Roosevelt still have Trump beat. Trump's 100-Day Market Rally 5.8% But while stocks have certainly risen under Trump, in many ways the rise has not looked all that in line with Trumponomics. Put another way, it does not appear that Trump, or his policies, are influencing the market in areas many might expect. Tech Drives a Rally Performance of the S&P 500 and component sectors since Donald Trump took office Source: Bloomberg Consider Apple. As a candidate, Trump threatened to punish the iPhone maker if it didn't "start building their damn computers and things" in the U.S. In the wake of the San Bernardino shooting, Trump called for a boycott of Apple if it didn't unlock the shooter's phone. And yet, Apple is the No. 1 performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since Trump took office, adding nearly $122 billion in market cap. In fact, technology stocks in general turned out to be the best performers in Trump's first 100 days. Silicon Valley was far from pro-Trump, and the president's anti-immigration stance was seen as a negative for tech recruiting. Some have said that Trump's actual policies have been less unfriendly to the tech sector than feared, but being less of a negative is hardly delivering on a campaign promise. Nonetheless, the tech stocks in the S&P 500 have risen nearly $469 billion in market value since Trump was elected, or nearly 50 percent of the index's overall gains. What's more, many of the sectors that Trump championed and said he would revitalize have been lackluster in his first 100 days. Shares of the big automakers have lost $8 billion in market cap. Industrial stocks are up, but by just $66 billion, making up only 6.7 percent of the Trump 100-day rally. Coal company stocks have mostly fallen. Shares of Arch Coal, for instance, have dropped 4.4 percent since Trump's inauguration. Winners and Losers Increase in market cap of major sectors of the S&P 500 Source: Bloomberg As for the banks, after attacking them as a candidate, Trump as a president has said that he would roll back regulations on Wall Street, which would bolster its profits. But banks, too, haven't been stellar performers in Trump's 100-day rally. The S&P 500 Financials Index is up $47 billion, and most of that gain came in the first 50 days. Bank shares were basically flat in the second half of Trump's first 100 days. And that's the pattern for most of the  market as well. The powerful Trump rally was more like a peep in the second act. What's more, when it comes to the market, Trump is not even putting putting America first again. While the U.S. stock market did well in his first 100 days, foreign stock markets, particularly of countries that Trump's has singled out, have done even better. Major indexes in Hong Kong, Germany, Mexico and Taiwan are all up more than the U.S. stock market. America Not First Performance of global stock indexes since Inauguration Day Source: Bloomberg Trump, on more than one occasion, has trumpeted the market rise since his election as proof that investors are reacting positively to his policies. But while stocks certainly have risen, how much credit he deserves is less clear. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Will Apple's Siri-powered smart speaker be unveiled next month? By Michelle Fitzsimmons Digital home   Better sound and a higher price tag than Amazon Echo Shares Noise about an Apple smart speaker is growing louder, and today a new report suggests the tech giant’s first Siri-powered smart home/audio device could be announced at WWDC 2017.    WWDC, by the way, is Apple’s annual developer conference, where it details the next iteration of its mobile operating system, iOS (in 2017's case, it'll be iOS 11), macOS, watchOS, tvOS and other innovations.    Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities who regularly makes predictions on Apple's next moves, some of them accurate, said in an industry report (via 9to5Mac) that Apple will probably unveil its "first home AI product" at the June event. The device, which 9to5Mac has dubbed the Siri Speaker, will compete with Amazon Echo, the Alexa-backed speaker from the online retail powerhouse. Apple's product, however, will occupy the higher end of the smart speaker spectrum, Kuo notes, and therefore cost more than the $179/£150 (about AU$230) Echo. Watch out, Amazon Echo? We suggest taking Kuo's prediction with a hearty grain of salt, but it would make sense for Apple to announce its Siri-backed smart home device at its major developer conference.  Smart speakers like Echo and Google Home utilize third-party extensions to bring more capabilities to their arsenals. And if Apple hopes to create an open ecosystem for the speaker, allowing it to connect to the App Store like the Apple TV does, the iPhone maker will need developer support. Sound off Though Kuo didn't offer an exact release date for Apple's speaker, he predicts it will launch in the second half of the year, which would put it right on time for the holiday shopping season.  We'll venture to guess the speaker's retail launch will fall on or near the iPhone 8 release date as there will probably be an accompanying app to go along with the speaker. According to leaker Sonny Dickson, Apple's "Alexa competitor" is in the final stages of design. Apple's speaker won't skimp on sound, Kuo suggests, offering "excellent" audio, seven tweeters and a subwoofer. A knock against Amazon Echo is that its audio prowess leaves much to be desired. Google Home's sound isn't strong, either. But despite some glaring weaknesses, Echo has spawned other speakers, namely the Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Look, a newly announced device that houses a camera and will judge your outfits before you step out the door.  Depending on how well Apple's smart speaker, also said to have computing powers in its pocket, is received, we could see a whole family of iSpeaker devices, offered in different sizes, styles and price ranges, come to market in the next few years.  Of course, Apple has to get started, and we may only have to wait until next month to see what its first smart speaker step looks like.

Over 50% Chance That Apple Will Unveil Siri Smart Speaker at WWDC [Report] LIKE   TWEET   SHARE   PIN   SHARE   POST MAIL MORE Posted 15 hours ago by iClarified · 1456 views · Translate There's over a 50% chance that Apple will unveil a Siri smart speaker to rival the Amazon Echo at WWDC this year, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. We believe there is an over 50% chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June and start selling in the ]second half of 2017] in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models to be launched […] We expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP). Therefore the product is likely to be positioned for: (i) the high-end market; (ii) better entertainment experience; and (iii) higher price than Amazon Echo. We've been hearing rumors about an Amazon Echo competitor from Apple since last year. Just recently, Sonny Dickson, another well known leaker, claimed that Apple was finalizing the design of the device and that it featured a Mac Pro style. Dickson described a device that has a concave top with controls and is fat with the speaker mesh portion covering it all. WWDC 2017 takes place June 5-9 in San Jose, California.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Apple has how much cash? By Levi Sumagaysay / May 1, 2017 at 10:33 AM It’s been a whole six months since Apple reported a record cash hoard. Now the company is expected to report Tuesday that the pile has grown even larger — to more than $250 billion. That’s higher than the market value of humongous companies such as Wal-Mart, and nearly equivalent to that of General Electric. That would also mean the iPhone maker would have doubled its cash pile in about 4 1/2 years, the Wall Street Journal reports. Apple is scheduled to report second-quarter results Tuesday, and to give an update about the company’s massive cash hoard. Talk about how much cash Apple has usually fuels speculation about possible acquisition targets. The names thrown around have included Disney and Twitter; now some analysts are mentioning Tesla and Netflix. Also, how much money Apple holds overseas always makes for interesting water-cooler talk: In October, CFO Luca Maestri said 91 percent of the company’s $237.6 billion hoard was parked outside the United States. That number is likely to be more closely watched than ever after President Donald Trump’s promise to entice companies to repatriate their cash with a lower tax rate and CEO Tim Cook’s plans — which he mentioned in the fall — to bring “billions” back to the United States this year. Analysts expect Apple to report earnings of $2.02 a share, up 6.3 percent from the year-ago quarter. Their estimates about how many iPhones the company sold are all over the place, with the most optimistic pegging the sales to have grown about 4 percent. Apple shares are up about 2 percent today to $146.51 and are trading at a record high. They are up more than 50 percent since last May as investors seem to be feeling optimistic about what the company has up its sleeve for the iPhone’s 10th anniversary in September. (Bloomberg has reported that Apple will unveil upgraded versions of the current models, as well as an iPhone with a redesigned look.) That’s different from the sentiment about Apple a year ago, when iPhone sales were slowing. In fact, in the newly published Mercury News’ special report on Silicon Valley’s top 150 public companies by revenue, Apple actually dragged the SV150 down because its 2016 sales and profit fell from the year before. But now, “everyone expects Apple to cure cancer with their next product launch,” Kevin Landis, chief executive of Firsthand Funds, told the New York Times.   Photo: An Apple store in Hangzhou, in the Zhejiang Province of China, in 2016.

Although everyone seems to focus on the electric power plant, that is really a small part of the Tesla revolution, and I'm convinced that if Musk were to launch an almost-identical company but with gas engines, it would cut through the market like a hot knife through butter. In terms of volume, the electric part isn't as much a sales accelerant as it is an impediment. I'll share some thoughts on the Tesla revolution, focusing on what people who drive the cars often take for granted and those who don't own Teslas often don't realize. I'll close with my product of the week: the HP PageWide Pro MFP. Recalling the iPhone Failure Tesla has been holding a valuation that exceeds GM and Ford at times. Even so, old-time car company executives like Bob Lutz have expressed their conviction that the car company will fail. This reminds me a lot of Apple's early iPhone years, when very powerful executives constantly shared their views that the iPhone would be a failure -- and most of those who did that are now out of jobs. Everyone seemed to focus on the fact that Apple was using a largely failed central design element, but what folks seemed to miss when it took off was that the way the iPhone handled apps -- and particularly, entertainment -- was what really made it different. Coupled with a marketing budget that was more than 10 times what anyone else was spending, that resulted in a breakout win, even though the major smartphone firms at the time seemed to refuse to see it coming. The "iPhone failure" was the failure to see it as a threat soon enough to come up with a strong counter. What was particularly ironic was that Palm actually had an iPhone-like project before Apple did, but the then-CEO killed it, arguing that smartphones were business-only devices. Hope he is enjoying retirement. Tesla's Failure Much like those smartphone firms looked at the iPhone and saw a failed design concept, car companies look at the Tesla and see an electric car. In fact, their counter efforts -- like the Ford Electric Focus or the Chevy Bolt -- are reminiscent of the initial efforts to counter the iPhone. This reminds me of a case I read about years ago -- how Ford and GM first tried to counter the Japanese car threat with the problematic Ford Pinto and Chevy Vega. They basically did a great job of analyzing Japanese cars that existed in the market in the mid-60s and then used what they learned, but the effort took more than five years. Japanese cars advanced significantly during that time. Looking back, it's clear that the Vega and Pinto would have been competitive with cars five years earlier, but they weren't competitive with the cars in market when they arrived. When auto makers look at the Tesla, they see an electric car and figure they can make one cheaper. What they don't get is that what makes the Tesla desirable is its exclusivity, ease of use, and customer experience. If Musk ever figured out that all he'd need to do was create a gas-powered line of cars that went from sportscar to SUV, he'd own the automotive market. If he learned to market the Tesla S' near-universal capability, he'd likely do to the car market what Jobs did to the smartphone market, and there would be a lot fewer car companies as a result. What Makes Tesla So Different Tesla offers a storefront sale. You go to a shop in a mall, pick what you want, and the sales people order the car for you. They don't pressure you, the experience is nearly painless, and the car you get is uniquely yours even though your choices are far more limited than you'd typically get. You see, in retail, we've learned that too much choice can be worse than too little, because it leads to mistakes and gets in the way of the sale. Negotiating a price is painful, and it can lead to dissatisfaction if we find out that someone else got a better deal. Tesla's support is at your convenience. The car is pretty much an appliance, so a lot of the service elements in a regular car, like oil and spark plug changes, don't apply. Updating is done wirelessly for software, not flashed at the dealership, and if your car is needed for a physical update, Tesla comes to you and leaves you a loaner, which you can keep for a fee if you want to upgrade. The car is connected all the time and supported much like an enterprise computer company supports its most loyal customers -- remotely and automatically. This does suggest that if Amazon were to go into cars, it likely could become the strongest alternative to a Tesla experience. That's largely because Amazon already has the back end for this in AWS, and it might be able to go from stores to an online buying experience, advancing the Car as a Service model even further. Teslas typically are leased, and once you are in the program, you basically have the car as a service. For an incremental fee you can swap out the car -- kind of like you do with smartphones -- and you often can pay for modular updates that bring the car to current specifications. Tesla is much like Apple, in that once you're in a Tesla program, it's doubtful that you'll ever leave. Inside the Tesla, the infotainment and driver information components are easily the best in the world. Only Volvo comes close, and it isn't that close. This will become far more important once autonomous driving fully matures, but moving between a traditional car and a Tesla often feels like moving between a current Ford or Chevy and one that was built in the 1960s. The Tesla is very close to what you might think Apple would do, were it to wrap a car around the iPad. It is really pretty pathetic how little the traditional car companies have advanced over the last decade, given the changes we've experienced in personal technology. Wrapping Up What pushed me to this topic was folks starting to pile on again in an old thread in the Jaguar forum, where I compared the then Tesla S to the Jaguar F-Type that I eventually bought. (I turned it into a column here.) Folks on the forum were divided into those who admired the Tesla and those who compared it unfavorably to a Toyota Prius -- but most had never driven or ridden in the Tesla. Those who hated the Tesla argued that it lacked the engine sound and would suck as a track car (it would), and that it really wasn't a performance car -- even though in its most performance-oriented configuration it would outpace a million-dollar hyper car to 60 (and dust it to 30). All were clearly missing a few things: It had more capacity than an SUV, was a full-sized sedan, and had unmatched reliability and customer loyalty while still providing supercar-like straight line performance. It is the closest thing to a universal car currently in market. Granted, the electrical part does speak to the performance angle -- but like my Jaguar buddies, if you really want a performance car you are far more likely to buy something else. If Tesla made a car that didn't require a charger, I doubt the GMs or Fords of the world could hold it off. I think what is saving the car firms and limiting Tesla is that Musk won't do an internal combustion version of this car (others have pointed this out) and he is having trouble executing line diversity, having basically two cars (and the Model X is a bit of a pig). Also, everyone clearly will be at risk if flying cars (or human-carrying drones) should take off. So, we are far from done. Still, the next time you look at a Tesla, remember what folks got wrong about the iPhone: The part that most folks focus on isn't the part that drives the success of the effort. It's the experience that makes the difference. Printers are so last decade, right? At least, that is what I thought I'd be saying by now if you'd asked me last decade whether I'd need a new printer. I still print labels. I print boarding passes -- I'm not going to be "that guy" that hold up the entire boarding line because I can't find the boarding pass on the phone or the scanner, or our phones won't talk to each other. I also need to print and sign contracts, because not everyone uses digital signatures. It's been a while since I bought a printer, but I'd heard of the PageWide from HP. Unlike typical ink jet printers that have a moving head, it has a fixed page-wide head that it feeds the paper under. So, I picked up the MFP 477dw to replace my aging Inkjet printer. HP PageWide Pro 477dw Multifunction Printer This thing is impressively fast (40-55 pages a minute). Once it heats up, it spits out the printed page like a baby spits up its formula, but with far less drama. The other nice thing is that it is set up so that both the paper path for the page feed scanner and the printer go in the same direction. My last printer moved the paper left to right for the scanner but front to back for the printer. Since the printer sits next to me, that meant the printed pages were shooting out toward my lap. If you want a smaller paper size for pictures, boarding passes or labels, it has a second paper bay for that (granted, getting label paper is a tad more difficult than I thought it would be). Now switching between a UPS or FedEx label, boarding pass or regular printing is just a change of a setting. It is a little thing, but damned if I don't find it really useful. The ink is expensive but you get a ton of it, so if you don't do a lot of printing, the ink could last you months if not years. The PageWide Pro MFP 477dw is likely a little bit of an overkill for my small office (but I'm OK with that), and it costs around US$550 so it's no cheap date. There is a smaller model, the 452dn, which prices out at a far more reasonable $340. It has a nice color display and connects via ethernet or WiFi. I'm surprisingly happy with this new printer, so the HP PageWide Pro MFP 477dw is my product of the week. Rob Enderle has been an ECT News Network columnist since 2003.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: What to Expect From Cirrus Logic's Q4 Results iPhone sales could help the company. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) May 1, 2017 at 12:23PM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) were beaten down badly in February because of weak guidance for the quarter ending in March, but the stock has staged a remarkable comeback in recent weeks. The chipmaker has risen close to 10% in the past month, thanks to optimism about the number of iPhones Apple will need this year.  But will Cirrus Logic live up to the hype when it reports its fourth-quarter results on May 3? Here's what investors can expect from its upcoming report. What to expect Wall Street expects Cirrus' revenue to rise 38% from the prior-year period to $321 million, which matches the midpoint of its own guidance. Analysts were initially more bullish and expected $334 million in revenue, but expected iPhone production cuts forced the chipmaker to dial down its guidance. Image source: Cirrus Logic.  Supply chain checks by Nikkei Asian Review point toward a 10% cut in iPhone production during the first quarter of 2017. Still, Cirrus is on track to report terrific year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter as the iPhone cut is estimated to be less severe than the cut in Q1 2016. What's more, Cirrus' earnings per share are estimated by analysts to jump 84% year over year thanks to the consistent growth in its gross margin. However, investors will be more concerned about Cirrus' outlook. Gauging the outlook Analysts are looking for $320 million in first-quarter revenue (April to June) from Cirrus Logic, putting its year-over-year growth at 23%.  Apple is going to play the decisive role in the outlook, as it accounted for 85% of the semiconductor specialist's top line in the last reported quarter. The iPhone maker could be betting big on its next device. Pacific Crest Securities expects Apple to produce 50 million iPhone units in the July-September quarter, followed by a stronger production run of 80 million units during the final quarter of the year. This would be significantly higher than the 89 million units of the iPhone 7 and 7s built last year. What's more, Apple's supply chain might get into action as early as April, according to rumors. India is another factor that could drive iPhone production in the ongoing quarter. Officials of the Indian government recently confirmed that Apple will start making the iPhone 6 and 6s in India soon, followed by the iPhone SE. India is a fast-growing iPhone market, where Apple is aggressively building its retail presence, so it could contribute to higher iPhone production this quarter, which would benefit Cirrus. Potentially strong iPhone production during the April-June quarter could help Cirrus Logic issue a stronger-than-expected outlook.    Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Merriam-Webster has thrown some shade at tech giant Apple by using consumers of its products as an example when defining the term “sheeple.” Last week, the American dictionary announced it had added “sheeple” to its library of words. The dictionary defines “sheeple” as “people who are docile, compliant, or easily influenced: people likened to sheep.” Wake up! Story continues below 'Sheeple' is in the dictionary now. https://t.co/pbXVADEoBm — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) April 27, 2017 Merriam-Webster provided two examples of how the derogatory term could be used in a sentence. “James Nichols, who ran the family farm here, stamped dollar bills with red ink in protest against currency and told his neighbors that they were ‘sheeple’ for obeying authority like livestock,” reads the sentence which was attributed to Sara Rimer and James Bennet. The second sentence, which was snagged from a 2015 CNN article by Doug Criss, reads: “Apple debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone—an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for.” READ MORE: Merriam-Webster reminds United Airlines what ‘volunteer’ means Apple did not respond to Global News’ request for comment. Though the word “sheeple” can be viewed as derogatory, according to Toronto Richard Powers, associate professor at Rotman School of Business at the University of Toronto, it isn’t necessarily a bad thing, saying the example the dictionary used was “accurate.” “I think it’s a good example to use the word, let’s face it,” Powers explained to Global News. “Apple had a great ad campaign where it was the Apple guy versus the PC guy … it was excellent as it divided the population, you’re either Apple or you’re PC. They created the, I guess, the cult around Apple. It really took off.” Powers noted the word is derogatory but it’s a good term. 📈'Volunteer' means “someone who does something without being forced to do it.” https://t.co/qNAcMyplhZ — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) April 11, 2017 “It pokes fun at them but it also, you can say it’s derogatory, but it also builds the Apple brand again,” Powers said. “In this particular case, non-Apple users would look at it as derogatory, I’m not sure. I think Apple users would look at it as sort of a place of well, you’d like to be here but you can’t or you’re not. We are a special group. “It’s almost cult-like,” Powers said. As for Merriam-Webster’s apparent jab at the tech company, Powers said the dictionary-maker is just trying to be “edgy.” “The use of a dictionary today, who pulls out a dictionary, you go right to Google,” Powers quipped. Good morning! The #WordOfTheDay is…not 'unpresidented'. We don't enter that word. That's a new one. https://t.co/BJ45AtMNu4 — Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) December 17, 2016 This isn’t the first time Merriam-Webster has taken a pot shot at a major company. In April, the dictionary took aim at United Airlines following the public backlash after a video surfaced showing passenger David Dao being forcibly removed from an overbooked flight in Chicago after he refused to voluntarily to give up his seat. “’Volunteer’ means “someone who does something without being forced to do it,” Merriam-Webster tweeted on April 10. The dictionary-maker said searches for the word “volunteer” shot up by 1,900 per cent after the video of the United Airlines incident circulated online. Merriam-Webster has also thrown shade at Donald Trump in the past. In December 2016, then president-elect Trump misspelled “unprecedented” in a now-deleted tweet. “China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters – rips it out of water and takes it to China in unpresidented act,” the tweet read. Merriam-Webster took an apparent shot at Trump, tweeting: “Good morning! The #WordOfTheDay is…not ‘unpresidented’. We don’t enter that word. That’s a new one.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Now a new report claims Apple will start selling the iPhone directly in India later this year, but only certain models and only online. Sony A6500 The Economic Times in India reports that Apple plans to sell the iPhone SE directly in India later this year through the Apple Online Store. These handsets would be manufactured in India to meet government requirements. Given the potential for new business in India, Apple has negotiated with the local government in the country for the rights to sell the iPhone directly in India. Back in March, the WSJ reported that iPhone production would likely begin in 4-6 weeks. Following initial direct sales through Apple’s online channel, the company eventually plans to open four to five flagship retail stores over the next five to ten years, according to the report. Apple is expected to start by manufacturing 400,000 iPhone SE handsets in India to hit a lower price for customers. Today’s report claims Apple is planning to begin online sales for the iPhone SE in India around Diwali, which takes place in late October. The report also mentions the possibility of customization including engraving that we’ve seen on iPads but not iPhones thus far: Instead, Apple plans to differentiate its online store in India from marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart by offering value-added services such as laser engraving to personalise the handset, sell models or variants which are exclusive such as a dedicated model, colour option or storage space, the executive said. Most recently in India, Apple officially opened its first-ever App Accelerator location for local developers. As part of the announcement, Apple CEO Tim Cook had this to say about the country: “India is home to one of the most vibrant and entrepreneurial iOS development communities in the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “With the opening of this new facility in Bengaluru, we’re giving developers access to tools which will help them create innovative apps for customers around the world.” Zac Hall @apollozac Zac covers Apple news and product reviews for 9to5Mac, contributes to 9to5Google, and hosts the weekly 9to5Mac Happy Hour podcast.

Sony A6500 macOS Sierra 10.12.5 beta is currently only available to developers. Public beta versions usually come a few days after developer versions if not the same day. The upcoming update follows macOS 10.12.4 which brought Apple’s color shifting Night Shift feature to the Mac for the first time. Apple is also running developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1. The version number and lack of release notes so far suggests this will be a minor update focused on bug fixes and security improvements ahead of macOS 10.13 later this year. We’ll update with any new features found in macOS 10.12.5 (no notes and known issues). Apple will likely unveil the next major update, macOS 10.13, at WWDC 2017 on June 5th.

Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street, Monday, May 1, 2017, led by gains in technology companies and banks. Mark Lennihan, File AP Photo National May 01, 2017 11:49 PM Asian shares mostly higher despite soft China factory data By ELAINE KURTENBACH AP Business Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story TOKYO Shares were mostly higher in Asia early Tuesday after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact. KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.7 percent, helped by a weaker yen which boosts profits for manufacturers. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent to 24,678.44 and South Korea's Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent to 5,922.20 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.4 percent to 3,143.51. Shares were higher in Taiwan and mixed in Southeast Asia. CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed the same trend. "The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating," Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market's anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high. U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs. ANALYST VIEWPOINT: "After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings," said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 8 cents to $48.76 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 5 cents to $51.47 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London. GOLD: The price of gold fell $12.80, or 1 percent, to $1,255.50 an ounce, reflecting greater appetite for risk and less for safe havens. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.87 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0911 from $1.0898. ___ Follow Elaine Kurtenbach: http://twitter.com/ekurtenbach Her work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/kurtenbach%20elaine -- AP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed.

Printable Format E-Mail this page Tech Trends Apple, Samsung Flat as Mobile Market Grows Beyond Expectations By David Nagel 05/01/17 Despite gloomier predictions, the mobile phone market grew 4.3 percent worldwide in the first quarter of 2017, with No. 1 Samsung and No. 2 Apple declining slightly in their overall share of the market as Chinese manufacturers surged upward. According to a new report from market research firm IDC, Samsung saw no year over year growth from Q1 2016 to Q1 2017. It shipped 79.2 million units in each of those two quarters and lost a point of market share — from a 23.8 percent share of the worldwide market in Q1 2016 to 22.8 percent in Q1 2017. According to IDC: "Substantial discounts on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge helped move last year's flagships as they make way for the new S8 and S8+. Outside of the high end, the product mix continues to shift toward more affordable models. The J-Series and A-Series drove significant volumes in both emerging and developed markets thanks to flagship-like design at more affordable price points. A refreshed A7, A5, and A3 earlier this quarter, along with a recently updated J-Series, and new flagship S8/S8+ should give Samsung a well-balanced portfolio across all regions in the second quarter. An early positive response to the recently launched S8 and S8+ looks promising as it may have finally put Samsung's Note 7 fiasco to bed." Apple, meanwhile, grew 0.8 percent year over year in the worldwide market, which is essentially flat. Apple shipped 51.6 million units in Q1 2017 versus 51.2 million in Q1 2016. Its market share declined half a point to 14.9 percent. The remainder of the top 5 is made up of companies with little to no presence in the United States. iCharts Huawei is known in the United States for manufacturing the Nexus 6P, which launched last year, and the Hero 6X, a mid-range phone with high-end camera features that launched at this year's CES. The Chinese maker also launched the P10, a range of higher-end smart phones, in the first quarter of this year. Huawei is currently sitting in third place and saw 21.7 percent year over year growth, shipping 34.2 million units in Q1 2017. Its overall market share increased to 9.8 percent, up from 8.4 percent in Q1 2016. China's OPPO shipped 25.6 million units, a 29.8 percent increase over Q1 2016. Its market share was 7.4 percent (putting it in fourth place), up from 5.9 percent in Q1 2016. OPPO is popular throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. No. 5 vivo, also from China, shipped 18.1 million units, up 23.6 percent from last year. Its market share was 5.2 percent, up from 4.4 percent the previous year. Vivo is popular in China, Southeast Asia and India. Shipments from all other vendors combined totaled 138.7 million units, down 1 percent from last year.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 01, 2017 1:44pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Earnings Preview: AAPL Follows Last Week's Big Tech Results Qualcomm's Future With Apple Remains Unclear Apple Supplier Tests Key Benchmark, Earns Ratings Upgrade (Investor's Business Daily) Investors expecting Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) to post strong iPhone sales metrics when the company reports its fiscal second-quarter results on Tuesday might be disappointed — but they shouldn't be. CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted during Monday's "Stop Trading" segment findings from a UBS survey, which suggested an all-time low level of iPhone sales in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. But Cramer thinks investors not only "don't care" but should think this is a very encouraging sign. Cramer added iPhone sales should now be at a low given high expectations for the soon-to-be-released iPhone 8. "If there really is a supercycle for the [iPhone] 8 things should be pausing here," Cramer said. "I'm not concerned about it." What Does Matter Acknowledging the "right attitude" is not to care about iPhone sales, Cramer very much cares about Apple's performance in its Services, and this is where the stock can move higher. Specifically, any talk of the Services revenue stream being greater than a Fortune 100 company would imply investors are willing to "pay more for the earnings." Moving on to Apple's large cash hoard, Cramer isn't expecting Apple's CEO Tim Cook to offer any substantial plans given the ongoing uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tax plans and its impact on overseas capital.

Apple shares jumped as much as 2.1 percent to a record high of $146.68, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. Apple is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index was up 0.66 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Including the tech sector, five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher. The other sectors were kept in check by weak construction spending and manufacturing data that came on the heels of weak first-quarter GDP data on Friday and ahead of the monthly jobs data at the end of this week. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said it could take up to two years to have economic growth reach three percent and that tax cuts and regulatory relief would help get there. Construction spending unexpectedly fell in March amid a pause in private construction investment after five straight months of increases. Other data showed the ISM manufacturing activity index fell to its lowest level since December, while consumer spending was unchanged for a second straight month in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. The industrials and materials indexes were little changed. “The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. “While we’re starting the week off on a bit of weak economic news, the markets may turn back to corporate fundamentals as corporate earnings are still coming in strong.” At 12:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.35 points, or 0.07 percent, at 20,954.86, dragged down by a one percent fall in Boeing. The S&P 500 was up 6.5 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,390.7 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.71 points, or 0.62 percent, at 6,085.32. Trading volume is expected to be light, with many markets in Asia and Europe closed for Labor Day, but will pick up through the week as major earnings reports and economic data pour in. Overall, profit at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tribune Media jumped 5.2 percent to $38.40 after Reuters reported Twenty-First Century Fox is in talks with Blackstone to buy the television station operator. Fox shares were down 0.7 percent at $30.33. Diamond Offshore Drilling fell 2.9 percent to $14 after reporting a lower quarterly profit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,535 to 1,255. On the Nasdaq, 1,545 issues rose and 1,204 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 38 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 43 new lows Filed under: Markets, Stocks Print Email Gmail Related Stocks Flat as Tech Gains Offset Weakness in Banks Stocks Slightly Lower as Weak GDP Data Weighs Economic Data on US, China Boost Stocks Stocks Post Mild Gains Following Economic Data Asian Stocks Gain After Wall Street Rally on Economic Data More in Business Business Briefs – May 1, 2017 Technology Companies and Banks Take Stocks Higher Twitter Shares Rise After Report on Deal With Bloomberg U.S. Maple Syrup Producers Contend With Weather Fluctuations Fed Likely to Leave Rates Alone But Signal More Hikes Coming OP-ED A Nationwide Chessed The Past 100 Days Have Been a Disaster — for Democrats The Risks of Businesses Learning How Consumers Think A Persistent Insanity Infects a Local Election The Good Tidings Let ‘So-Called Judges’ Work in Peace Trump Is Skillfully Navigating Washington’s Budget Realities Salted Bagels With Lox and Cream Cheese The Real Zachor The Shabbos Crisis Homicide Prevention Reestablishing Religious Liberty With North Korea, We do Have Cards to Play A Wall Too High Features This Day In History 6 Iyar/May 2 The Odd Side – May 2, 2017 Artsy World of Wonder – May 2, 2017 Sudoku – May 2, 2017 Editorial Cartoon – May 2, 2017 Nichum Aveilim 6 Iyar/May 2 This Day In History 5 Iyar/May 1 Nichum Aveilim 5 Iyar/May 1 Don’t Do Me Favors!

Advertisement Sometimes, those new features and those phones really are revolutionary, but more often than not, history has shown us that for every Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone, there are a dozen more products with amazing-sounding features that never took off. Here are some of the most significant phone flops of all time. The Nokia N-Gage (2003) Back in 2003, Nokia was still riding high as one of the most successful cell phone makers around. But the world was slowly starting to move to a more connected space. Devices such as Danger’s SideKick and the Palm Treo were starting to show off the possibility of internet-connected mobile phones (i.e. the smartphone). At the same time, portable gaming was becoming more powerful wit Nintendo’s GameBoy Advance, and thanks to the iPod, everyone wanted an MP3 player. So Nokia had an idea: What if there was a device that put all of those things together? And that’s how we got the Nokia N-Gage. First launched in October 2003, this was supposed to be a smartphone, a media player, and a portable gaming machine. Unfortunately for Nokia, it failed at all three. Advertisement We’ve already covered why it sucked as a console, so let’s start with the shape. The N-Gage was shaped like a fucking taco (hence its nickname as “the taco phone”), which might work fine for playing games, but made actually using it as a phone difficult. To talk on the first version of the phone sans headset, users literally had to put the awkwardly-shaped device sideways against their head. Memes were born out of how ridiculous it looked. And the media player features were limited, with no ability to fast-forward or rewind tracks, the inability to put a song on a loop, and no support for playlists. An iPod killer this was not. Try as we might, it was impossible to find a reviewer who liked this gadget. Virtually everyone agreed that this was just a bad idea. But Nokia, God bless them, kept trying with the N-Gage, first with updated hardware, and then with a gaming platform no one used. Finally, in 2009, Nokia finally euthanized the brand. Gizmodo’s then Editor-in-Chief Brian Lam was absolutely brutal in his eulogy for the device, writing, “hope we never have to see you again.” The BlackBerry Storm (2008) If I’m being honest, I could almost write an entire article about all of BlackBerry’s failures at “revolutionary” phones. From the Z10 with its gesture-driven OS that no one made apps for, to the bizarrely-designed Passport that was weird on every level, to the Android-based Priv that I wouldn’t give to my worst enemy, BlackBerry has had a lot of duds over the years. But its biggest disaster is still the BlackBerry Storm. Advertisement Sponsored In 2008, BlackBerry was still one of the world’s leaders, thanks to its trademark keyboarded smartphones like the Curve, the Pearl, and the Bold, which were adored by millions. But the iPhone—then exclusively on AT&T’s network in the US—was rising fast. It had apps and games BlackBerry could only dream of, and its fancy glass touchscreen was a hit. So BlackBerry, largely at Verizon’s behest, decided to create its own touchscreen “iPhone killer.” The Storm was born. It was launched in the US in the fall of 2008 as a Verizon exclusive (it was available on other carriers in other parts of the world). The brilliant minds in Waterloo, Canada weren’t content with just making a touch screen BlackBerry—they decided to help retain the keyboard millions of BlackBerry users loved by making the screen something you could press into to get a clicky feel. None of it really worked right. The old BBOS operating system was never truly optimized for touch, and the mechanical mechanism on the bottom of the screen that accomplished that “clicky” feature was a total dud. Oh, and the phone was designed so quickly, the software was insanely buggy from the get-go. But none of that deterred the BlackBerry faithful—at first. When respected gadget columnist David Pogue, then of The New York Times, gave the phone a blisteringly negative review, he got hate mail from BlackBerry fanbois. The backlash was so intense, it necessitated Pogue write a follow-up column, which included some of the more virulent remarks from BlackBerry defenders “I have serious doubts about your ability to evaluate tech. And your friends, for that matter. Yes, the Storm has a different emphasis than past BlackBerries, but it will continue to sell like pancakes.” History ended up proving Pogue right. The Storm was a flop (and returns were reportedly very high), and it helped set the company down a shame spiral from which it would never really recover. Amazon Fire phone (2014) Before the Fire Phone, Amazon had a lot of success in hardware. Its Kindle e-readers are in a class by themselves, the Fire line of small tablets have always been a good, cheap iPad alternative, and the Fire TV ecosystem is truly excellent. Given that track record, people were really excited about the advent of an Amazon phone. Advertisement In 2014, after months of hype and a reported five years of effort, Amazon finally unveiled its take on a mobile device, the Fire Phone. On paper, the phone came loaded with fancy specs, including five cameras, a 3D display, and a hardware/software feature called Firefly that could identify objects so that you could easily add them to your shopping cart. Although reviews were generally mixed, plenty of tech publications were willing to buy into the hype. Check out what my old colleagues at Mashable had to say about the phone after its release: Advertisement With that philosophy behind it, the Fire pushes Amazon further on the path of becoming the next Apple. ... For the Amazon faithful, Fire completes the platform with the most powerful and intimate of devices — the one that’s carried at all times. For the uninitiated, it’s the most powerful gateway drug the company could have built. Except it ended up not really being a gateway drug, because no one wanted the phone. For all the hype from tech blogs, consumers just didn’t care about the gimmicky features. Even worse, because of politics between Google and Amazon, the FireOS didn’t have access to the Google Play Store, which meant the phone couldn’t easily get Google Maps, Gmail, or Google Docs. Amazon and AT&T cut the on-contract price of the phone from $200 to $0.99 after just six weeks on the market. Amazon’s mobile phone strategy ended up being a gross miscalculation, which cost the company more than $170 million. In the fall of 2015, just over a year after the phone was released, Amazon finally extinguished the Fire Phone for good. Amazon has said it has no plans to re-enter the mobile phone space. That’s probably a good thing. HTC First aka the Facebook Phone (2013) Starting in 2010 and then for the better part of three years, there were rumors and speculation that Facebook was planning its own mobile phone. With every new rumor and speculation, journalists and pundits (including me) were paraded on CNN and CNBC and the like to talk about all the reasons why it made sense for Facebook to have its own mobile phone. Even before it bought Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook was the most powerful—and most popular—app on iOS and Android. What better way to assume world domination than to make your own “iPhone killer”? Advertisement And so in the spring of 2013, Facebook finally did it. It released its own phone in partnership with HTC, the HTC First. Except, bizarrely, it wasn’t really a “Facebook phone” as much as it was a special Android launcher built by Facebook, which was dubbed Facebook Home. The idea was that you could get all of your Facebook messages directly on your home screen, quickly chat with friends using something called Chat Heads, and get near-instant notifications about what was going on around you. Sounds fun and useful right? Advertisement From Wired’s review: It’s nice to see that after so many failed attempts, Facebook has finally cracked the mobile software riddle. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t screw it up. Well, you know how this ends. It turns out, no one wanted a Facebook launcher on their smartphone. Especially when the smartphone itself was fairly boring. Barely a month after its release, AT&T dropped the price of the HTC First to $0.99 (down from $99). Within a year, Facebook Home was also dead (in truth, Facebook stopped caring about it the moment the HTC First flopped), and Facebook moved on from trying to dominate the home screen into all the ways it could copy Snapchat. Microsoft Kin (2010) Despite being one of the first players in the smartphone space with Windows Mobile, Microsoft has never managed to make the inroads on mobile that it did on the desktop. But of all of Microsoft’s mobile missteps, the worst might just be the short-lived Microsoft Kin. Advertisement Born out of Microsoft’s acquisition of Danger, the company behind the popular SideKick, the Kin was supposed to sit somewhere between a smartphone and a dumbphone. Unlike a true smartphone, the Kin didn’t have apps, but it did have access to social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace, as well as Microsoft’s own internal network for storing photos and videos. With a marketing campaign placed squarely at hipsters, the Kin was supposed to be a modern social media phone. But it had one glaring problem: price. Advertisement Early on, a lot of people thought that if Microsoft could release the Kin at a low price without the need for an expensive smartphone data plan (remember the days before data plans?), it could capture the same market segmentation that had made the SideKick so popular in the early aughts. Microsoft and Verizon were alarmingly (in retrospect) coy about the cost of the data plans, but since it was a dumb phone, many of us had hopes that the price would be right. Verizon and Microsoft completely botched the pricing—requiring an expensive $60+ a month smartphone plan for a phone that wasn’t really a full smartphone. Still, I wrote positively about the phone’s potential in an analysis piece in April 2010: Advertisement [The Kin] is really targeted at teenagers — especially younger teenagers. And that’s why Kin might just be brilliant. Of course, I ended up being completely wrong; the teens weren’t interested. Advertisement Just six weeks after launch, Microsoft killed the Kin. According to Business Insider, before the company pulled the plug, the phone sold just 500 units. Brutal. In the wake of the Kin disaster, much was leaked about the infighting and poor strategy that led to the phone’s early demise. Years later, internal videos would show that even before its release, the Kin was just a disaster waiting to happen. Motorola Rokr (2005) In 2005, two of the most powerful consumer electronics brands were Apple and Motorola. Motorola was the leader in dumb phones, thanks to the success of the Motorola Razr. And Apple was well on its way to becoming the world’s most valuable company, thanks to the success of the iPod. So obviously, a fusion between the two companies could only be successful. The resulting phone was called the Motorla Rokr, and it was the first phone with iTunes built in. Motorola’s then chairman and CEO, Ed Zander wanted the world to really love the phone, check out this hype: Advertisement The Motorola ROKR represents the ultimate convergence of mobile communications and music. Fusing iTunes with your always-with-you mobile phone, we’re revolutionizing the way the world experiences mobile self-expression and entertainment. Too bad the phone failed to deliver on those promises. In fact, signs were ominous from the get go. At an iTunes launch event, where Steve Jobs introduced the device to the world, he had problems getting the Rokr to work correctly (you can watch the entire segment in the video above). You can practically see the steam coming out of his ears when the music won’t resume after a phone call. Advertisement In addition to buggy software, users were limited to storing just 100 songs on the device, regardless of how much space was free on the phone. And the process of getting songs onto the phone was a total pain in the ass. Motorola tried to make things better with future iterations of the Rokr line, but the damage was done. The phone was a bomb for Motorola and an embarrassment for Apple. Ultimately, the failure of the Rokr was a good thing. Had it been successful, Apple might not have pushed forward as aggressively with its other phone project, internally known as M68, which became the iPhone. AT&T Picturephone (1964) Before Skype and before FaceTime, AT&T was trying to make video calling a reality. In fact, for more than 30 years, AT&T really tried to make video telephony a thing. It ended up being a great tech demo, but also one of the most expensive tech flops of all time. The first AT&T Picturephone made its debut at the World’s Fair in Flushing Meadow Park in 1964. The demo—which my own mother saw as a teenager—left attendees excited about the future. Stanley Kubrick used ideas from the Picturephone in his epic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Product brochures from the era promised “the bold beginning of tomorrow’s telephoning.” Unfortunately for AT&T, which spent half a billion on R&D for the PicturePhone between 1966 and 1973), “tomorrow” was really about 45 years away. Advertisement At its peak in the 1970s, AT&T never managed to amass more than 500 subscribers to its video telephony service. The costs were just too high, the products too big, and the value was too unclear. AT&T’s subsequent efforts at video telephony into the 1990s failed too. In 2005, Skype finally brought video calling to the masses—and for free. In 2010, Apple launched FaceTime, which finally, for real, made two-way video calling from your actual phone (or in this case, smartphone) a thing. ESPN Phone (2005) Back in the mid-aughts, there was a bizarre trend where non-phone companies decided to try their luck at being mobile carriers. Known as mobile virtual network operators (MVNO), the idea was that brands could lease spectrum from established wireless carriers to sell their own phones and services. Virgin Mobile, TracPhone, and Cricket Wireless all started out as MVNOs. For whatever reason, ESPN thought it would be a good idea to get into the branded phone and carrier space, and it launched Mobile ESPN in early 2006 with a big, glitzy Super Bowl ad (above). ESPN really believed that people would pay $400 for its clamshell dumbphone, a Sanyo MVP (a Sanyo!), along with plans that started at $35 a month for just 100 minutes of service, with no free nights or weekends. Advertisement Why would anyone do this? Well, ESPN was convinced that sportsmen love sporting so much that they would be willing to pay a premium for a shitty phone running on the Sprint network (Sprint!) that would get the sports alerts and updates. The phone also offered subscribers access to mobile video of SportsCenter, score updates, and highlights. As silly as this all sounds now, some tech reviewers actually bought the concept. From PCMag’s review, which gave the phone four stars: Advertisement The Mobile ESPN MVP is a very good voice phone loaded up with massive quantities of sports information. You’ll pay top dollar for top data, but have you seen the price of a Giants ticket recently? The general public didn’t agree with that whole “pay top dollar for top data” argument and the phone ended up being a fairly famous business disaster. Advertisement Just nine months after its splashy launch, ESPN killed Mobile ESPN. At the time, BusinessWeek reported in 2006 that ESPN had managed to gain just 30,000 subscribers, well below the 500,000 figure needed to make the investment break even. In hindsight, ESPN’s then president George Bodenheimer probably should have listened to Steve Jobs, who according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN, told him “your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard of.” Stick to sporting, sportsmen. Samsung Galaxy Beam (2012) Samsung has made a lot of good phones over the years, exploding Note 7s notwithstanding. But Samsung has also made some supposedly innovative but really, really dumb phones. Take for example, the Samsung Galaxy Beam, which the company announced at Mobile World Congress in 2012. It was basically a Galaxy S Advance with a pico projector built-in. Advertisement Samsung actually tried to do the whole phone projector thing in Korea a few years before bringing a version to North America. For whatever reason, the company really thought that people would want to use their smartphone as a way to project content at low resolution on a big screen. The company even made ads showing off the most unrealistic proposal of all time (above). Samsung was positively breathless in its marketing copy for the phone, with its then mobile chief, JK Shin, saying: Advertisement Galaxy Beam provides mobile freedom, enabling a unique shared experience around digital content for everyone-anywhere and instantly-from a smartphone as slim and portable as any on the market. Sadly, that “unique shared experience” came by way of an overpriced, bulky, phone with specs straight out of 2010, running an old version of Android. Even after lackluster response to the original Beam, Samsung still wasn’t willing to give up the ghost. In 2014, the company released a successor—that still had shitty, outdated specs (again, the whole thing was very 2010), aimed at the Chinese market. Advertisement Come on Samsung, know when to let a product die. No one wants a projector on their smartphone and no one will ever propose using said projector. Google’s Project Ara (2013 - 2016) Technically, Project Ara wasn’t a phone—it never had a chance to be. Instead, it was a project Google invested years of time (and lots and lots of hype), only to ultimately cancel the device in 2016. Advertisement But let’s back up. Back in 2013, Motorola (then part of Google), announced that it was working on a modular phone platform, known as “Project Ara.” Project Ara was a basic phone with removable modules that could be switched out or upgraded, kind of like LEGO blocks. The idea was that instead of having to constantly upgrade an entire phone, specific components—the camera system, the storage, the CPU, and the battery—could all be expanded or upgraded with a new module. Additional modules could be available for extra stuff such as a a night vision camera or even a tardigrade aquarium. Advertisement The tech press (including Gizmodo), was all too happy to spread the hype about this concept. Check out what we wrote about the concept, which had already been delayed several times at this point, back in 2015: This is the powerful idea behind Project Ara—the exact smartphone you want, exactly when you need it. Going on a long trip and need battery life? Swipe out for a low-res screen and extra battery modules. Need to take great photos at your kids soccer game? Get that camera module packed with megapixels. It’s an ambitious dream to be sure, and one that won’t jibe with everyone, but it’s an idea worth exploring just to see where it goes. Too bad that “powerful idea” never turned into a real product. Not only did the project’s specifics change direction with alarming regularity (originally it was hyped by Google as a $50-$100 device; by 2016 the company admitted the first phones would cost the same as premium handsets), the people in charge of running the project changed too. According to Venture Beat’s excellent history of Project Ara, the development team never really recovered after Regina Dugan, who ran ATAP at Google (the division Project Ara was under), abruptly left for Facebook. And look, it’s possible that with the right leadership and support, Project Ara could have met the finish line, but that doesn’t change a very large, very fundamental problem with Project Ara (and modular smartphones in general): No one wants a modular smartphone. Project Ara is the most ambitious modular phone failure, but even modular phones from LG and Motorola have totally flopped and failed to take on with audiences. Advertisement Ultimately, Project Ara was a great demo, but it never had a chance at being a real product. And even if it had reached the finish line, something tells me that it would have wound up on this list anyway.   Recommended Stories Why These Great Game Consoles Failed Spectacularly Why These 'Revolutionary' '80s Gadgets Totally Failed Samsung Galaxy S8 Review: The Prettiest Phone Wins Christina Warren christina.warren@gizmodo.com @film_girl Christina is a senior writer at Gizmodo.

Today analytics firm KGI is saying that it expects the same reveal, along with making some predictions about what kind of hardware we’ll see in it. Get ready to potentially spend some money though, because if there’s one theme to KGI’s predictions, it’s “premium.” According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will look to make this smart speaker a fair bit more powerful than Amazon Echo, which could prove to be its main competitor. Kuo, as reported by 9to5Mac, says that this speaker will offer “excellent” sound quality along with a SoC similar to what’s found in the iPhone 6s. If that’s true, then this speaker could far exceed the power offered by Amazon Echo. Sonny Dickson shared similar information last week, at least in regards to sound quality. Apple is expected to tap the Beats brand for this speaker, using it for the audio hardware. It would make sense, then, that Apple is tipped to offer this as a more premium counterpart to Amazon’s Echo and Google Home. Keep in mind that what Kuo predicts here may not be a sure thing. Though he thinks that Apple could reveal the speaker at WWDC 2017 and begin shipping it in the latter half of the year, even he admits that he’s not certain about these predictions. So, as with all rumors and speculation, take this with a grain of salt. Still, Kuo is probably onto something when he says that home AI is a market that Apple can no longer ignore. The building blocks are already in place with tools like Siri, HomeKit, and Apple Home, so a smart speaker that can tie everything together seems like the next logical step. Apple could certainly hit it big by breaking into the smart speaker space, as Kuo says the company could ship as many as 10 million speaker in its first year of availability. We’ll see if Kuo’s predictions hold any water soon enough, as WWDC 2017 is quickly approaching at the beginning of June. There’s been a growing pile of evidence for such a speaker, so even if it doesn’t get a WWDC reveal, it seems like it won’t be too far off. Stay tuned.

Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- When Apple releases its earnings on Tuesday, tech junkies will be looking for clues about the next iPhone and any mention of other new products. Will the new iPhone be called the 8? The 10 or X in honor of its tenth anniversary? Will it come in red? But Wall Street will be watching something else even more closely -- Apple's growing pile of cash. It is likely Apple will report more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash and investments on its balance sheet for the first time ever. Apple had a little more than $240 billion as of the end of December. Apple's stack of Franklins, Grants and Jacksons has steadily grown over the past few years. Five years ago, Apple had "just" $110.2 billion in cash. And Apple has increasingly stashed away its cash overseas for tax purposes. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in February that $230 billion of its cash was held abroad. But there are growing hopes that Apple might soon be able to bring back, or repatriate, this cash to the United States at a one-time lower tax rate if President Trump is able to get his tax plan through Congress. Apple could use the cash to hire more workers, build more plants, make acquisitions, repurchase stock and boost its dividend. Some argue that if Apple and other tech giants were allowed to bring back cash to the U.S., it could stimulate the entire economy. To put into context just how much money $250 billion really is, consider the following. Apple's cash, if it were its own company, would be the 12th largest firm in the S&P 500. Besides Apple, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and General Electric have market valuations higher than $250 billion. And Apple's cash is worth only slightly less than all of GE. It's also worth more than well-known blue chips AT&T, Walmart, Home Depot, Coca-Cola and Disney. (AT&T is in the process of acquiring CNNMoney owner Time Warner. By the way, Apple's cash is worth more than three times Time Warner's market value.) Apple's pot of gold, so to speak, is also worth more than Bank of America, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Visa, Verizon and Comcast. Want more mind-boggling comparisons? $250 billion in cash is about 10 times the market value of Snapchat parent Snap. It is 3.5 times the valuation of Uber, and 20 times that of Twitter. It's also nearly 50 times the market cap of BlackBerry, the former king of mobile phones and a company that has arguably become mostly obsolete in large part due to Apple and the smartphone revolution it helped create.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 01 May 2017 09:40PM (Updated: 02 May 2017 03:10AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Wall Street rose on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index , the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.

Digital Trends Home > Cool Tech > Apple’s stunning ‘spaceship’… Apple’s stunning ‘spaceship’ campus looks ready for workers to move in By Trevor Mogg — May 1, 2017 12:45 AM Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Fans of modern architecture, as well as of the company itself, will be excited to see Steve Jobs' vision for Apple's new HQ finally realized. Back in September 2014, the cleared land once home to Hewlett-Packard was little more than a field of dust. Today, as the first of 12,000 employees prepare to move in, it’s the location of Apple’s gleaming new headquarters. Officially called Apple Park but still better known for its “spaceship” nickname given for its futuristic design, a new drone video posted in recent days by Matthew Roberts shows the sprawling, 176-acre Cupertino campus in the final stages of construction. While at first glance it looks pretty much complete, closer inspection reveals work continuing in a number of areas around the site, including at the Steve Jobs Theater, the company’s subterranean 1,000-seat auditorium featuring a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder, 165 feet in diameter, supporting a metallic carbon-fiber roof. Apple employees are expected any day now to begin transferring to the distinctive, doughnut-shaped main building, which is wrapped in the world’s largest segments of curved glass and topped off with a covering of solar panels that will help power the campus. The process of moving all 12,000 workers to the new site is expected to take up to six months. Besides the main building and theater, the tech giant’s new base includes a 100,000-square-foot fitness center to keep Apple’s team in top shape, a research and development facility where Jony Ive and co. will endeavor to cook up the company’s next big success, and expansive landscaped parklands. Notably, Apple claims its new HQ is the world’s largest naturally ventilated building and is therefore not expected to require heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year. “Steve’s vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us,” Apple boss Tim Cook said in a statement earlier this year. “He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come. The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment. We’ve achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.” Fans of the company, or those with an interest in stunning modern architecture, are invited to drop by Apple Park’s visitors center, which, as you’d expect, includes an Apple Store as well as a cafe. The design of Apple Park is the work of acclaimed architect Norman Foster, though it was the former Apple boss and co-founder Steve Jobs who drove the ambitious project forward in the years and months leading up to his death in 2011.
Digital Trends Home > Wearables > Apple will process some Apple Watch battery… Apple will process some Apple Watch battery repairs for up to 3 years By Lulu Chang — May 1, 2017 6:06 AM Subscribe Share Carlos Vega/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Shortly after celebrating the second birthday of its Apple Watch, Apple is extending the warranty for its first-generation wearable. The latest version of the Apple Watch may soon be making its debut, but the first generation of the wearable is giving some of its wearers some problems. As per an email sent to Apple Authorized Service Providers, first obtained by 9to5Mac, Apple has recognized that some of its earliest Apple Watches have been affected by swollen batteries, and will provide these owners with an additional two years of service that extend beyond the one-year limited warranty. Apparently, the lithium-ion battery packs that power the Apple Watch can sometimes swell and expand when they’re punctured, overcharged, or overheated, or when they sustain other damage. This is, in fact, the same issue that plagued the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7, but thanks to Apple’s careful testing and manufacturing processes, your Apple Watch won’t spontaneously combust — it’ll just become horribly disfigured. As such, Apple is taking responsibility for this problem, and will process repairs as they relate to swollen batteries beyond the one-year warranty period, up to three years. While it’s unclear just how many Apple Watch customers are affected by the issue, there are quite a few reports online across various forums like Reddit and Apple’s own support forums. So how can you tell if your battery is swelling? Affected customers say that display displacement or cracking are generally good indicators of an underlying battery problem. That said, Apple has yet to make any sort of official announcement surrounding the Apple Watch repair extension, which seems to suggest that there aren’t that many people ultimately impacted. But if you are one of the unlucky users whose wearable has been growing larger, feel free to take it over to Apple — you now have up to three years beyond your original purchase date to get that problem taken care of.

Apple has extended its battery-related warranty for the first-generation Apple Watch for an additional year, 9to5Mac reported. The extension comes after various reports on social media and user forums of the watch’s internal battery beginning to swell in size and causing the display to physically pop out or suffer other damage on certain models. In these situations, the Apple Watch will be unusable. Read: Apple Watch 3 With Display-Embedded Touch ID In The Works? 9to5Mac reported an email was sent to authorized support centers: "Apple has extended service coverage for eligible Apple Watch [1st gen] models with an expanded/swollen battery to three years after the original date of purchase,” Apple said. “Eligible devices will be covered for two years beyond the original one-year Limited Warranty." The Apple Watch Series 2 is on display at an Apple media event in San Francisco, Sept. 7, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach While Apple has traditionally offered a base one-year limited warranty for the Apple Watch, the company has provided an additional two-year warranty for damage specifically caused by swollen batteries. With the extension, it essentially provides three years of coverage for the Apple Watch against battery issues without needing Apple’s premium AppleCare warranty coverage. On MacRumors’ forums, user Rosepod5 expressed her dismay in an April 2 post about her Apple Watch experiencing damage from a swollen battery and showed a photo of her deformed Apple Watch. Absolutely gutted to take my Apple Watch series 1 off the charger this morning and find the screen has popped off! No damage, no scratches, never been dropped and I only wear it at weekends/workouts so it is immaculate. AppleSupport informed me that due to being out of warranty I needed to pay a £206 service charge ... considering a new series 1 watch cost £269 it's safe to say I was not willing to proceed with that. Disgusted that the screen on my watch can just pop off. If your Apple Watch has experienced problems with a swollen battery, you can take it to an Apple Store or contact Apple’s support team. Read: How To Install Apple Watch Software Update The first-generation Apple Watch was originally introduced in April 2015 and was Apple’s first significant entry into the wearables market. The Apple Watch can be paired with an iPhone and provide functionality like notifications and fitness tracking. The first-generation Watch was succeeded by the Series 2, which was released in September. The market has also seen competing options from companies ranging from Google to Samsung. While Apple hasn’t revealed anything specific about the Apple Watch 3 like its release date or specifications, some leaks and rumors have hinted about what the successor might feature. Past iterations have relied on Wi-Fi connectivity or pairing with a nearby iPhone to draw content and updates, but the Apple Watch 3 potentially could feature cellular connectivity. Elsewhere, the new smartwatch also potentially could limit notifications from other users while you’re driving. Related Stories What Are Sheeple?

The tech giant is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, May 2. Last quarter, Apple reported that it had $246.09 billion total in cash and cash equivalents, the largest such stockpile among publicly traded companies. Given that Apple has not made any major acquisitions since last quarter, it is likely that Apple's cash pile will cross $250 billion for the first time this quarter.  Most of the stockpile is parked overseas. President Donald Trump has spoken frequently about plans to encourage companies to repatriate their overseas cash with a combination of tax incentives and penalties. Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed his desire to bring some of that cash back to the US earlier this year. According to Bloomberg, analysts expect Apple to report adjusted EPS of $2.023 and revenues of $53.079 billion. Apple has beaten EPS estimates in seven of the last eight quarters. The last miss was the second quarter of 2016. According to Bloomberg, of the 49 analysts who cover the stock, 39 have a "Buy" rating, nine have a "Hold" rating, and one has a "Sell" rating. The average analyst price target is $163.30.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 2 May 2017 | MYT 12:09 AM Global stocks climb in light May Day trading; oil slips, Apple hits record The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.07 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,960.58, the S&P 500 gained 5.84 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,390.04 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.82 points, or 0.51 percent, to 6,078.43. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.25 percent NEW YORK: Apple shares hit a record high on Monday, lifting U.S. stocks and a gauge of key world equity indexes, while data on U.S. drilling and output kept downward pressure on oil prices. Global trading was expected to be light, with some markets in Europe and Latin America closed for the May Day holiday, while Japan was open overnight during a shortened trading week. Data showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Despite the soft data, traders continued to see a 7-in-10 chance that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June. On Wall Street, Apple and other large technology companies led the way, sending the Nasdaq Composite to a record high. Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday. Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence. "We have some renewed optimism that the market strength will continue helped by strong earnings and as a government shutdown was averted," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20.07 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,960.58, the S&P 500 gained 5.84 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,390.04 and the Nasdaq Composite added 30.82 points, or 0.51 percent, to 6,078.43. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.25 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.19 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 0.33 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei <.N225> rose 0.59 percent. U.S. drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to April 28, bringing the count to the most since April 2015, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday. Crude output in the United States has hit its highest since August 2015, government data shows. "The U.S. rig count indicates that there is plenty more to come," analysts at JBC Energy said in a report, referring to the outlook for U.S. production. U.S. crude <CLcv1> fell 1.28 percent to $48.70 per barrel and Brent <LCOcv1> was last at $51.37, down 1.31 percent on the day. Crude prices were also pressured by data showing that growth in Chinese manufacturing slowed faster than expected in April. The weak U.S. data initially weighed on the dollar, but moves among major currencies were relatively small. The dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.1 percent, with the euro <EUR=> up 0.18 percent at $1.0915. The Japanese yen weakened 0.04 percent versus the greenback to 111.61 per dollar, while sterling <GBP=> was last trading at $1.2926, down 0.15 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.3036 percent, from 2.282 percent late on Friday. Spot gold <XAU=> dropped 0.3 percent to $1,264.00 an ounce.

The company’s cash pile continues to grow at a substantial pace. According to a new report, Apple’s cash pile has surged to over $250 billion. That’s a quarter of a trillion dollars. This is an enviable cash pile that’s almost unheard of, it’s greater than the foreign currency reserves of many countries combined. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple is going to confirm the figure in its quarterly earnings release today. It will confirm that it’s sitting on cash reserves of more than $250 billion. That’s more than the market value of both Walmart and FMCG giant Procter & Gamble put together. It’s even greater than the foreign currency reserves held by the United Kingdom and Canada combined. It’s a safe assumption that Apple’s cash pile has crossed $250 billion because the last confirmed figure from Apple put it at $246.09 billion in December last year. It was racking up cash at a rate of $3.6 million an hour in the final three months of 2016. Apple has already been under increasing pressure from shareholders to spend some of the cash it’s hoarding to further increase shareholder value. There are many ways it can do that one of which includes a special dividend. Apple can also use the money that it has to buy companies, no wonder there are rumors of Apple considering an acquisition of Tesla or Netflix. Given the amount of money it has, Apple can buy both companies and still be left with cash in the bank. It may even have to face mounting pressure to bring back some of that cash to the United States, considering that more than 90 percent of that $250 billion is held outside the United States.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Insider says Apple’s first new iOS product line in years will be unveiled at WWDC Chris Smith @chris_writes May 1st, 2017 at 10:42 AM Share Tweet In just a matter of days, a second trustworthy source has mentioned the Apple’s unnamed Amazon Echo competitor.

Kuo, who has an accurate track record when predicting Apple’s plans, says there’s a more than 50% chance of Apple announcing the device at its developers conference next month. The product should then hit stores in the second half of the year, though it’s unclear how much it will cost. Kuo calls the unbranded device “Apple’s first home AI product,” saying that it’ll feature “excellent” sound, packing in seven tweeters and a subwoofer. The device will be sold as a more premium option compared to the Amazon Echo. A few days ago, Apple leaker Sonny Dickson said that Apple’s Siri speaker design is currently being finalized. He later added that the device might feature some form of Beats technology and run a version of iOS.

Apple is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, while Facebook will report on Wednesday.Stocks were supported also as U.S. Congress negotiators agreed on a federal funding deal late on Sunday, removing a hurdle for investor confidence."We have some renewed optimism that the market strength will continue helped by strong earnings and as a government shutdown was averted," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    American companies looking to avoid paying domestic tax rates reportedly are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings. That number has been rising steadily for years, according to new research from Capital Economics. The top companies of overseas holdings are Apple, Pfizer and Microsoft, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. General Electric and IBM round out the top five, CNBC reported. Apple's stockpile of cash reportedly has topped a quarter of a trillion dollars, an unrivaled hoard that is greater than the market value of either Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Procter & Gamble Co. and exceeds the foreign-currency reserves held by the U.K. and Canada combined, The Wall Street Journal reported. Apple's money, more than 90% of which is stockpiled outside of the U.S., has drawn fresh attention as President Donald Trump has proposed slashing business taxes and granting a one-time tax holiday on corporate cash brought home, WSJ.com reported. "Those policies could ratchet up pressure on the tech giant to dole out more money to shareholders or make splashy acquisitions," the WSJ explained. Meanwhile, CNBC reported that at 35 percent, the U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest in the world. That's caused many multinationals to keep their overseas earnings abroad in tax shelter countries like Ireland and Luxembourg. However, approval of the broader plan that entails the tax holiday is unlikely, according to Andrew Hunter, U.S. economist for Capital Economics. "With the deep cuts to individual income and corporate tax rates estimated to increase the federal budget deficit by $7 trillion over a decade," he wrote, CNBC reported, "there is next to no chance of the plan ever being approved by Congress in its current form." The main obstacles for the Trump tax plan are Senate rules. While reconciliation bills need only a majority in the Senate, they cannot increase the deficit beyond a 10-year horizon, which the tax plan is estimated to do. The alternative is to garner 60 votes in the Senate and be signed into permanent law. "The chances of the latter happening are close to zero," Hunter wrote. Meanwhile, many other respected economic voices are predicting robust growth and additional stock-market gains amid Trump's blueprint to truly "Make America Great Again." David Horowitz, author of the best-selling book "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," told Newsmax TV that the market rally since Republican Donald Trump won the election has more room for gains as the president pushes his pro-business agenda. “There's more upside. Starting from when he was president-elect he started this stock market boom,” he told Newsmax TV's “The Income Generation Show.” “There will be corrections. There are going to be setbacks along the way like the healthcare which they hurried too fast. If you're looking over the long term of this administration I think the stock market is going to love Trump,” Horowitz said. Other respected economic gurus agree. Trump has a victory coming, "a home run," with his tax-reform plan announced this week, but expect some "back and forth" debate as with healthcare, economic pundit and Trump campaign adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday, per The Hill. "I can't think of anything better for business, better for wage earners, better for economic growth than Trump's 15 percent tax cut plan," Kudlow told "The Cats Roundtable" on 970 AM-N.Y. "I think it's a home run." Kudlow acknowledges there will be still be considerable debate, perhaps even a "struggle," in getting the game-changing reform passed in a stalemated Congress that has blocked everything President Trump has tried to do to date.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Apple has reportedly amassed a quarter of a… Apple has reportedly amassed a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash reserves By Brad Jones — May 1, 2017 6:59 AM Subscribe Share Zhaojiankangphoto/123RF Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Apple has enough money in the bank to facilitate even the most outlandish research and development projects, but the avenues it will pursue remain to be seen. On Tuesday, Apple will submit its earnings report for the second quarter of 2017, and the company is expected to announce that its cash reserves exceed $250 billion. This enormous amount of money serves as a very reassuring safety net, but it’s thought that the announcement may prompt calls for Apple to invest more of its available resources. As of the time of writing, there’s no firm confirmation that this figure is accurate. However, given that the company reported cash reserves of $246.1 billion in December 2016, it certainly stands to reasons that another $4 billion could have been added to its coffers since then. Apple may delay spending too much of its reserves to see whether or not President Donald Trump will follow through on campaign promises that would allow money being held overseas to be brought back to the United States at a reduced tax rate, according to a report from 9to5Mac. Rumors often circulate about major acquisitions Apple could make by utilizing its considerable war chest. In late 2016, the company apparently considered buying Time Warner before it was eventually sold to Charter Communications, and there are persistent reports that it might make a play to purchase Netflix, in an attempt to bolster its entertainment portfolio. Apple got into the habit of keeping healthy cash reserves under the leadership of Steve Jobs. During the 1990s, the company’s financial situation got into such dire straits that it took a $150 million investment from Microsoft to keep the ship afloat. Today, Apple is obviously in a much more advantageous financial situation. However, its massive reserves will prompt big questions about whether the cash should be pumped into research and development, or returned to shareholders. With more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in the bank, it’s perhaps unsurprising to see the company investing heavily into what’s coming next.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 01 May 2017 09:40PM (Updated: 02 May 2017 03:10AM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail REUTERS: Wall Street rose on Monday, boosted by gains in Apple and other big tech stocks that more than offset weak economic data and pushed the Nasdaq to another record high. Apple shares jumped 2.1 percent and set a record high, boosting all the three major Wall Street indexes. The iPhone maker is due to report its results on Tuesday. The S&P 500 technology index , the best performing major group this year, climbed 0.9 percent, with Microsoft and Facebook also hitting all-time highs. Investors braced for another heavy week of first-quarter corporate results in an earnings season that has exceeded expectations. Overall, profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement Market watchers have been looking for results to help justify stock valuations, as the S&P 500 has been trading about 20 percent above its long-term average, based on forward earnings estimates. "One of the stories that really hit me was the way that earnings growth has improved over the course of the last week or so," said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland. "With that earnings growth picking up, I think there's a sense that that will help not only bring down valuation a little bit, but give us a little bit more fuel for the rally as we continue through the remainder of the year." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,948.17, the S&P 500 gained 8.11 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,392.31. The Nasdaq Composite added 48.24 points, or 0.8 percent, to 6,095.84, and hit an intraday record high. Financials rose 0.8 percent despite volatility caused by President Donald Trump's comments that he was actively considering breaking up big banks. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin said that economic growth of 3 percent is achievable in the next two years as the Trump administration sets out to dramatically cut taxes. Stock gains may have been muted by a series of tepid U.S. economic reports. U.S. factory activity slowed in April while consumer spending was unchanged in March and a key inflation measure recorded its first monthly drop since 2001. Investors were bracing for more data later in the week, including Friday's employment report, as well as for the two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting starting on Tuesday. "The economic data today is causing some investor nervousness ahead of the jobs report this Friday," said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments in Boston. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 135 new highs and 48 new lows.
